      <title>Gradient-Based Inverse Optimization of Atom-Chip Wire Currents for BEC Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modulating wire currents to shift a magnetic trap along an atom chip enables smooth contact-free delivery of Bose-Einstein condensates but can deform the confinement profile causing parametric heating and atom loss. We introduce a fast simulation framework based on inverse optimization that, given an initial trap and a predefined trajectory over time, computes a wire current schedule that transports the atoms and restores the trap geometry upon arrival. We assess trap's minimum energy, lateral displacement, confinement profile and an adiabaticity parameter over a 2.4 mm trajectory for various transport durations between 2s and 5s, demonstrating the trade-off between speed and adiabaticity.</description>

      <title>Optical Interferometric Readout of a Magnetically Levitated Superconducting Microsphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We probe the motion of a 6 $\mu g$ magnetically levitated superconducting microsphere using optical interferometry at 3 K, achieving a resolution better than 1 $nm/ \sqrt{Hz}$, and use the measured signal to feedback-cool its motion. The resolution exceeds the shot-noise limit of 11 $pm/ \sqrt{Hz}$ primarily due to technical noise arising from the roughness of the particle. Combined with established techniques of cavity optomechanics, the high degree of isolation from environmental noise afforded by this platform provides a path to quantum physics experiments with cryogenic isolated masses at the microgram scale.</description>

      <title>One, Two, Three: One empirical evaluation of a two-copy shadow tomography scheme with triple efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shadow tomography protocols have recently emerged as powerful tools for efficient quantum state learning, aiming to reconstruct expectation values of observables with fewer resources than traditional quantum state tomography. For the particular case of estimating Pauli observables, entangling two-copy measurement schemes can offer an exponential improvement in sample complexity over any single-copy strategy conceivable [1, Huang, Kueng, Preskill, PRL(2021)]. A recent refinement of these ideas by King et al. [2, King, Gosset, Kothari, Babbush, SODA (2025)] does not only achieve polynomial sample complexity, but also maintains reasonable computational demands and utilizes joint measurements on only a small constant number of state copies. This `triple efficiency' is achievable for any subset of $n$-qubit Pauli observables, whereas single-copy strategies can only be efficient if the Pauli observables have advantageous structure. In this work, we complement existing theoretical performance guarantees with the empirical evaluation of triply efficient shadow tomography using classical, noise-free simulations. Our findings indicate that the empirical sample complexity aligns closely with theoretical predictions for stabilizer states and, notably, demonstrates slightly improved scaling for random Gibbs states compared to established theoretical bounds. In addition, we improve a central subroutine in the triply-efficient shadow protocol by leveraging insights from a refined quantum and quantum-inspired convex optimization algorithm [3, Henze et al. arXiv:2502.15426 (2025)]. To summarize, our empirical sample complexity studies of triply efficient shadow tomography not only confirm existing theoretical scaling behavior, but also showcase that the actual constants involved are comparatively benign. Hence, this protocol has the potential to also be very sample-efficient in practice.</description>

      <title>Unitary causal decompositions: a combinatorial characterisation via lattice theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If a unitary transformation has a decomposition into a quantum circuit with no directed path from input $a$ to output $b$, then $a$ does not influence $b$ through the overall unitary. Conversely, it is known that if $a$ does not influence $b$, one may always find a circuit decomposition lacking a path between these systems, thus making the no-influence condition directly apparent in the connectivity of the circuit. Causal decompositions are circuit decompositions in which, more generally, multiple such no-influence conditions are made apparent simultaneously. They bridge two fundamental concepts in quantum causality: causal structure, as expressed by influences through unitary transformations (and related to signalling through quantum channels); and compositional structure, expressed in terms of the shape of quantum circuits or networks. The general existence of causal decompositions remains unknown.
  This work focusses on unitary causal decompositions, i.e. decompositions in terms of unitary circuits in the traditional quantum circuit formalism that do not require the generalisation to `extended' or `routed' quantum circuits prompted by earlier research on this topic. We identify a combinatorial condition that characterises precisely those sets of causal no-influence constraints $G$ for which any unitary transformation satisfying $G$ has a unitary causal decomposition compositionally representing those constraints. Our methods are based on finite-dimensional operator algebra as well as the concept lattice construction, which was recently shown to provide a canonical shape $L_G$ for causal decompositions. The combinatorial condition we identify can be formulated in terms of $G$ as the absence of a forbidden substructure $C_3$ and in terms of $L_G$ as the existence of no more than one path between each input and output.</description>

      <title>The Role of Quantum Computing in Advancing Scientific High-Performance Computing: A perspective from the ADAC Institute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing (QC) has gained significant attention over the past two decades due to its potential for speeding up classically demanding tasks. This transition from an academic focus to a thriving commercial sector is reflected in substantial global investments. While advancements in qubit counts and functionalities continues at a rapid pace, current quantum systems still lack the scalability for practical applications, facing challenges such as too high error rates and limited coherence times. This perspective paper examines the relationship between QC and high-performance computing (HPC), highlighting their complementary roles in enhancing computational efficiency. It is widely acknowledged that even fully error-corrected QCs will not be suited for all computational task. Rather, future compute infrastructures are anticipated to employ quantum acceleration within hybrid systems that integrate HPC and QC. While QCs can enhance classical computing, traditional HPC remains essential for maximizing quantum acceleration. This integration is a priority for supercomputing centers and companies, sparking innovation to address the challenges of merging these technologies. The Accelerated Data Analytics and Computing Institute (ADAC) is comprised of globally leading HPC centers. ADAC has established a Quantum Computing Working Group to promote and catalyze collaboration among its members. This paper synthesizes insights from the QC Working Group, supplemented by findings from a member survey detailing ongoing projects and strategic directions. By outlining the current landscape and challenges of QC integration into HPC ecosystems, this work aims to provide HPC specialists with a deeper understanding of QC and its future implications for computationally intensive endeavors.</description>

      <title>Inducing macroscopic cat states of nonequilibrium electrons via cat-state light irradiation and projective measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that projective measurements on quantum light can induce macroscopic cat states in many-electron systems driven by large-amplitude cat-state light. Here we investigate the quantum dynamics of N independent two-level electrons interacting with Schr\"odinger cat or kitten states of light. Without measurement, a macroscopic cat state of electrons appears only in an ultrashort time window. In contrast, we demonstrate that photon-number parity or quadrature projective measurements can restore a macroscopic cat state in nonequilibrium electrons, even in the thermodynamic limit. These dynamics are captured by an external-field approximation, in which the electronic system evolves into a Rabi-oscillation cat state. Our results highlight the need for precise quantum measurement techniques for light to control macroscopic quantum states of matter driven by quantum light.</description>

      <title>Harvesting Contextuality from the Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum contextuality is the notion that certain measurement scenarios do not admit a global description of their statistics and has been implicated as the source of quantum advantage in a number of quantum information protocols. It has been shown that contextuality generalizes the concepts of non-local entanglement and magic, and is an equivalent notion of non-classicality to Wigner negativity. In this paper, the protocol of contextuality harvesting is introduced and it is shown that Unruh-DeWitt models are capable of harvesting quantum contextuality from the vacuum of a massless scalar quantum field. In particular, it is shown that gapless systems can be made to harvest contextuality given a suitable choice of measurements. The harvested contextuality is also seen to behave similarly to harvested magic and can be larger in magnitude for specific parameter regimes. An Unruh-DeWitt qubit-qutrit system is also investigated, where it is shown that certain tradeoffs exist between the harvested contextuality of the qutrit and the harvested entanglement between the systems, and that there are harvesting regimes where the two resources can both be present. Some of the tools of contextuality, namely the contextual fraction, are also imported and used as general harvesting measures for any form of contextuality, including non-local entanglement and magic. Additionally, new criteria for genuine harvesting are put forward that also apply to individual systems, revealing new permissible harvesting parameter regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and theoretically analyze methods for quantum many-body control through geometric reshaping of molecular tweezer arrays. Dynamic rearrangement during entanglement is readily available due to the extended coherence times of molecular rotational qubits. We show how motional dephasing can be suppressed and enhanced spin squeezing can be achieved in an actively rearranged short-range XY model. We also analyze in detail a specific static geometry that significantly suppresses decoherence. These general methods as applied to programmable quantum systems offer robust control modalities that are well suited to molecules.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Atemporality: When Gaussian Quantum Correlations Imply Common Cause</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventionally, covariances do not distinguish between spatial and temporal correlations. The same covariance matrix could equally describe temporal correlations between observations of the same system at two different times or correlations made on two spatially separated systems that arose from some common cause. Here, we demonstrate Gaussian quantum correlations that are atemporal, such that the covariances governing their quadrature measurements are unphysical without postulating some common cause. We introduce Gaussian atemporality robustness as a measure of atemporality, illustrating its efficient computability and operational meaning as the minimal noise needed to remove this uniquely quantum phenomenon. We illustrate that (i) specific spatiotemporal Gaussian correlations possess an intrinsic arrow of time, such that Gaussian atemporality robustness is zero in one temporal direction and not the other and (ii) that it measures quantum correlations beyond entanglement.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Robustness in Distributed Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying adversarial robustness of quantum machine learning (QML) models is essential in order to understand their potential advantages over classical models and build trustworthy systems. Distributing QML models allows leveraging multiple quantum processors to overcome the limitations of individual devices and build scalable systems. However, this distribution can affect their adversarial robustness, potentially making them more vulnerable to new attacks. Key paradigms in distributed QML include federated learning, which, similar to classical models, involves training a shared model on local data and sending only the model updates, as well as circuit distribution methods inherent to quantum computing, such as circuit cutting and teleportation-based techniques. These quantum-specific methods enable the distributed execution of quantum circuits across multiple devices. This work reviews the differences between these distribution methods, summarizes existing approaches on the adversarial robustness of QML models when distributed using each paradigm, and discusses open questions in this area.</description>

      <title>Trotter simulation of vibrational Hamiltonians on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating vibrational dynamics is essential for understanding molecular structure, unlocking useful applications such as vibrational spectroscopy for high-fidelity chemical detection. Quantum algorithms for vibrational dynamics are emerging as a promising alternative to resource-demanding classical approaches, but this domain is largely underdeveloped compared to quantum simulations of electronic structure. In this work, we describe in detail three distinct forms of the vibrational Hamiltonian: canonical bosonic quantization, real space representation, and the Christiansen second-quantized form. Leveraging Lie algebraic properties of each, we develop efficient fragmentation schemes to enable the use of Trotter product formulas for simulating time evolution. We introduce circuits required to implement time evolution in each form, and highlight factors that contribute to the simulation cost, including the choice of vibrational coordinates. Using a perturbative approach for the Trotter error, we obtain tight estimates of T gate cost for the simulation of time evolution in each form, enabling their quantitative comparison. Combining tight Trotter error estimates and efficient fragmentation schemes, we find that for the medium-sized CH$_4$ molecule with 9 vibrational modes, time evolution for approximately 1.8 ps may be simulated using as little as 36 qubits and approximately $3 \times 10^{8}$ T gates -- an order-of-magnitude speedup over prior-art algorithms. Finally, we present calculations of vibrational spectra using each form to demonstrate the fidelity of our algorithms. This work presents a unified and highly optimized framework that makes simulating vibrational dynamics an attractive use case for quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Transfer-Based Strategies for Multi-Target Quantum Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the challenge of multi-target quantum optimization, where the objective is to simultaneously optimize multiple cost functions defined over the same quantum search space. To accelerate optimization and reduce quantum resource usage, we investigate a range of strategies that enable knowledge transfer between related tasks. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage framework consisting of a training phase where solutions are progressively shared across tasks and an inference phase, where unoptimized targets are initialized based on prior optimized ones. We propose and evaluate several methods, including warm-start initialization, parameter estimation via first-order Taylor expansion, hierarchical clustering with D-level trees, and deep learning-based transfer. Our experimental results, using parameterized quantum circuits implemented with PennyLane, demonstrate that transfer techniques significantly reduce the number of required iterations while maintaining an acceptable cost value. These findings highlight the promise of multi-target generalization in quantum optimization pipelines and provide a foundation for scalable multi-target quantum optimization.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Phase Transitions in Open Quantum Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical phase transitions in the relaxation behavior of stochastic quantum walks are investigated, focusing on systems where coherent unitary evolution is periodically interrupted by dephasing. This interplay leads to a classicalization of the dynamics, effectively described by non-equilibrium Markovian processes that can violate detailed balance. As a result, such systems exhibit a richer and more complex spectral structure than their equilibrium counterparts. Extending recent insights from classical Markov dynamics [G. Teza {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 130}, 207103 (2023)], we demonstrate that these quantum-classical hybrid systems can host not only first-order dynamical phase transitions -- characterized by eigenvalue crossings -- but also second-order transitions marked by the coalescence of eigenvalues and eigenvectors at exceptional points. We analyze two paradigmatic models: a quantum walk on a ring under gauge fields and a walk on a finite line with internal degrees of freedom, both exhibiting distinct mechanisms for breaking detailed balance. These findings reveal a novel class of critical behavior in open quantum systems, where decoherence-induced classicalization enables access to non-Hermitian spectral phenomena. Beyond their fundamental interest, our results offer promising implications for quantum technologies, including quantum simulation, error mitigation, and the engineering of controllable non-equilibrium quantum states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum coherence constitutes a fundamental physical mechanism essential to the study of quantum algorithms. We study the coherence and decoherence in generalized Shor's algorithm where the register $A$ is initialized in arbitrary pure state, or the combined register $AB$ is initialized in any pseudo-pure state, which encompasses the standard Shor's algorithm as a special case. We derive both the lower and upper bounds on the performance of the generalized Shor's algorithm, and establish the relation between the probability of calculating $r$ when the register $AB$ is initialized in any pseudo-pure state and the one when the register $A$ initialized in arbitrary pure state. Moreover, we study the coherence and decoherence in noisy Shor's algorithm and give the lower bound of the probability that we can calculate $r$.</description>

      <title>Unified quantification of entanglement and magic in information scrambling and their trade-off relationship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information scrambling is a phenomenon observed in a wide range of quantum systems, in which initially localized information becomes distributed across the entire system. Clarifying the essence of this phenomenon is made possible by quantum resource theory, which provides an axiomatic framework for quantifying various forms of quantumness. Within this framework, information scrambling can be classified into two distinct types: entanglement scrambling and magic scrambling. Although each has been analyzed individually through their respective resource theories, such separate treatments fail to capture the inherent trade-off between them. In this study, we introduce a unified measure of the two types of scrambling, grounded in resource-theoretic principles. This unified approach reveals a rigorous trade-off relationship between entanglement and magic scrambling, as the exact maximum value of the proposed measure can be derived analytically. Furthermore, we quantify the scrambling capability of unitary transformations in terms of their ability to amplify this measure.</description>

      <title>Parallel Data Processing in Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Quantum Machine Learning (QML) framework that leverages quantum parallelism to process entire training datasets in a single quantum operation, addressing the computational bottleneck of sequential data processing in both classical and quantum settings. Building on the structural analogy between feature extraction in foundational quantum algorithms and parameter optimization in QML, we embed a standard parameterized quantum circuit into an integrated architecture that encodes all training samples into a quantum superposition and applies classification in parallel. This approach reduces the theoretical complexity of loss function evaluation from $O(N^2)$ in conventional QML training to $O(N)$, where $N$ is the dataset size. Numerical simulations on multiple binary and multi-class classification datasets demonstrate that our method achieves classification accuracies comparable to conventional circuits while offering substantial training time savings. These results highlight the potential of quantum-parallel data processing as a scalable pathway to efficient QML implementations.</description>

      <title>Preparation of the single-spinon wave function in a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the preparation of single-spinon wave functions, relevant for one-dimensional $S=1/2$ spin models, in a quantum computer. We adopt the recently proposed ansatz \cite{kulk} for the single-spinon wave function, where a state with $S=1/2$ is built in a spin chain with $L+1$ sites, adding a site with $S_z=1/2$ to the configurations of the ground-state wave function for the spin chain with length $L$. We extend the original work to the case of the Haldane-Shastry model. We discuss how to prepare the single-spinon ansatz both for the Heisenberg and Haldane-Shastry models in quantum computers, using a linear combination of unitaries. We consider three different strategies to compute the single-spinon energy in a quantum computer and analyze their cost in terms of the number of qubits, gates, and circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether or not irradiation by squeezed light can provide an enhancement of the two-photon excitation of a system over irradiation by classical light. Our emphasis is not only on whether or not there is such an enhancement, but also on whether or not any enhancement can be reasonably detected in an experiment. We begin by developing a model that includes radiative and nonradiative broadening to calculate the total scattered and absorbed energy. As an example calculation, we consider cesium atoms in a magneto-optical trap, and evaluate the fluorescence emission when driven by non-degenerate classical and squeezed light, in both the continuous-wave and pulsed regimes. We find that squeezed light can provide an enhancement in both regimes under ideal circumstances. These enhancements are in principle detectable. However, we stress that they are moderate at best compared to recently reported values for molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Raising the Bar: An Asymptotic Comparison of Classical and Quantum Shortest Path Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP) problem is a cornerstone of computer science with vast applications, for which Dijkstra's algorithm has long been the classical baseline. While various quantum algorithms have been proposed, their performance has typically been benchmarked against this decades-old approach. This landscape was recently reshaped by the introduction of a new classical algorithm by Duan et al. with a complexity of $O(m \cdot (\log n)^{2/3})$. This development necessitates a re-evaluation of the quantum advantage narrative for SSSP. In this paper, we conduct a systematic theoretical comparison of modern quantum and classical SSSP algorithms in light of this new classical frontier. Through an analysis of their theoretical cost functions, we illustrate how their relative scaling compares across scenarios that vary in graph density and path length. Our analysis suggests a nuanced picture: sophisticated quantum algorithms, such as the one by Wesolowski and Piddock, can exhibit more favorable asymptotic scaling, but only in regimes characterized by short solution paths. Conversely, for problems involving long paths, state-of-the-art classical algorithms appear to maintain a scaling advantage. Our work provides an updated perspective for future quantum algorithm development and underscores that the pursuit of quantum advantage is a dynamic race where the classical goalposts are continually shifting.</description>

      <title>Conditional mutual information: A generalization of causal inference in quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of causality is fundamental to numerous scientific explanations; nonetheless, its extension to the quantum regime has yet to be explored rigorously. This paper introduces the development of a quantum causal index, a novel extension of the classical causal inference framework, tailored to grasp the causal relationships inherent in quantum systems. Our study focuses on the asymmetric quantum conditional mutual information (QCMI), incorporating the von Neumann entropy, as a directional metric of causal influence in quantum many-body systems. We analyze spin chains using the QCMI, implementing a projective measurement on one site as the intervention and monitoring its effect on a distant site conditioned on intermediate spins. Additionally, we study the effective causal propagation velocity, which is the speed at which QCMI becomes significant at distant sites. These findings indicate the presence of finite-speed propagation of causal influence, along with the emergence of coherent oscillations.</description>

      <title>Simulating Quantum Turbulence with Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum turbulence spans length scales from the system size $L$ to the healing length $\xi$, making direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation computationally expensive when $L \gg \xi$. We present a matrix product state (MPS) solver for the GP equation that efficiently compresses the wavefunction by truncating weak interlength-scale correlations. This approach reduces memory use by factors ranging from 10x to over 10,000x compared to DNS. We benchmark our approach on nonlinear excitations, namely dark solitons (1D) and quantized vortices (2D, 3D), capturing key dynamics like Kelvin wave propagation and vortex ring emission in the case of vortex line reconnection. For turbulent states composed of multiple nonlinear excitations, we find that the memory compression of the MPS representation is directly proportional to the soliton or vortex densities. We also accurately reproduce established results from two-point correlation functions and energy spectra, where we recover the incompressible kinetic energy spectrum with little memory overhead. These results demonstrate the representative capabilities of the MPS ansatz for quantum turbulence and pave the way for studying this nonequilibrium state using previously-prohibited system sizes to uncover possible new physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the absence of decoherence the current of fermionic particles across a finite lattice connecting two reservoirs (leads) with different chemical potentials is known to be ballistic. It is also known that decoherence typically suppresses this ballistic current. However, if decoherence is weak, the change in the current may be undetectable. In this work we show that the effect of a weak decoherence can be amplified by orders of magnitude if the lattice has edge states.</description>

      <title>Experimental investigation of uncertainty relations for non-Hermitian operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty relations for Hermitian operators have been confirmed through many experiments. However, previous experiments have only tested the special case of non-Hermitian operators, i.e., uncertainty relations for unitary operators. In this study, we explore uncertainty relations for general non-Hermitian operators, which include Hermitian and unitary operators as special cases. We perform experiments with both real and complex non-Hermitian operators for qubit states, and confirm the validity of the uncertainty relations within the experimental error. Our results provide experimental evidence of uncertainty relations for non-Hermitian operators. Furthermore, our methods for realizing and measuring non-Hermitian operators are valuable in characterizing open-system dynamics and enhancing parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Multiple-Noise-Resilient Nonadiabatic Geometric Quantum Control of Solid-State Spins in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable and robust control lies at the core of implementing quantum information processing with diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers. However, control pulses inevitably introduce multiple errors, leading to decoherence and hindering scalable applications. Here, we experimentally report an experiment-friendly multiple-noise-resilient nonadiabatic geometric quantum gate~(MNR-NGQG) that can significantly improve conventional dynamical gate in both robustness and coherence. Notably, even when the detuning fluctuation range is comparable to the maximum Rabi frequency, the single-qubit gate performance of the MNR-NGQG remains almost unchanged. Besides, the coherence time of the electron spin is significantly extended to 690 $\pm$ 30 $ \mu$s, 3.5 times that of the naive dynamical counterpart. As a result, the fidelity of single-qubit gates reaches 0.9992(1), as characterized by quantum process tomography. With its experimentally feasible design and relaxed hardware requirements, our work offers a solid paradigm for achieving high-fidelity quantum control in NV center system, paving the way for practical applications in quantum information science.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of IBM's Quantum Information Software Kit (Qiskit): A Review of its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is being increasingly adopted for solving classically intractable problems across various domains. However, the availability of accessible and scalable software frameworks remains essential for practical experimentation and adoption. IBM's open-source quantum computing toolkit 'Qiskit' has become a key player in this space by offering tools for circuit design, simulation, hardware execution, and domain-specific applications. This survey provides a systematic review of how Qiskit has evolved and what it has contributed to several critical fields including cryptography and cybersecurity, image and signal processing, climate science and energy applications, and finance. We show how Qiskit facilitates hybrid classical-quantum workflows and enables the deployment of algorithms on physical quantum hardware through error mitigation and modular integration approaches. Our exploration covers several key applications, including quantum key distribution, climate simulation, and quantum-enhanced portfolio optimization, while providing practical insights into their implementation. This work also covers the framework's technical structure and current limitations associated with scalability and reproducibility. By bringing together developments that have been scattered across different areas, this work serves as a reference point for researchers and practitioners who want to understand or contribute to Qiskit-enabled quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Partial transpose as a space-time swap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the partial transpose operation appears in many fundamental results in quantum theory -- such as the Peres-Horodecki criterion for entanglement detection -- a physical interpretation of the partial transpose is lacking. In this work, we show that a partial transpose of a bipartite density operator is a two-time pseudo-density operator, which by definition encodes temporal correlations associated with two-point sequential measurement scenarios. As such, it follows that partial transposition admits a precise physical interpretation as mapping spatial correlations to temporal correlations, thus swapping the roles of space and time for bipartite quantum systems. For maximally entangled qubits, we show that partial transposition maps spatial correlations which violate Bell inequalities to causal correlations which cannot be replicated by spacelike separated systems, thus further solidifying the interpretation of partial transpose as a space-time swap. As it is known that gravitational effects swap the roles of space and time inside a black hole, our results suggest that at a quantum mechanical level, a traversal of a black hole's event horizon by a bipartite quantum system may be described by a partial transpose.</description>

      <title>Resonant dynamics of spin cluster in a periodically driven one-dimensional Rydberg lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg lattice under facilitation conditions can feature kinetic constraints, leading to ballistic and non-ergodic behavior at different detuning intensities. Here, we demonstrate that a resonant driving field can achieve effects similar to those under facilitation conditions. We focus on the relaxation dynamics of spin clusters in a periodically driven Rydberg spin lattice. Through an effective Hamiltonian for the domain walls of the spin cluster, it is shown that when the driving frequency is resonant with the Rydberg interaction, the spin cluster exhibits ballistic expansion with half the spreading rate compared to the case of facilitation conditions. However, near the resonant point, the spin cluster displays confinement behavior of the Bloch-like oscillations. These results demonstrate the rich dynamic behaviors in the driven Rydberg spin lattices and may find applications in quantum state manipulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubbard model is a challenging quantum many-body problem and serves as a benchmark for quantum computing research. Accurate computation of its ground and excited state energies is essential for understanding correlated electron systems. In this study, the ground, first, and second excited state energies of 4$\times$1 and 2$\times$2 Hubbard lattices are obtained using a newly designed ansatz circuit. The ansatz is constructed by combining concepts from the Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz (HVA) and the Number-Preserving Ansatz (NPA). A hybrid optimization strategy is applied, where COBYLA is used for coarse convergence and L-BFGS for fine-tuning. The resulting energies are evaluated, and the corresponding physical properties of the systems are analyzed through phase diagrams of the energy excitation gaps for different charge and spin configurations.</description>

      <title>Generalized Number-Phase Lattice Encoding of a Bosonic Mode for Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bosonic systems offer unique advantages for quantum error correction, as a single bosonic mode provides a large Hilbert space to redundantly encode quantum information. However, previous studies have been limited to exploiting symmetries in the quadrature phase space. Here we introduce a unified framework for encoding a qubit utilizing the symmetries in the phase space of number and phase variables of a bosonic mode. The logical codewords form lattice structures in the number-phase space, resulting in rectangular, oblique, and diamond-shaped lattice codes. Notably, oblique and diamond codes exhibit a number-phase vortex effect, where number-shift errors induce discrete phase rotations as syndromes, enabling efficient correction via phase measurements. These codes show significant performance advantages over conventional quadrature codes against dephasing noise in the potential one-way quantum communication applications. Our generalized number-phase codes open up new possibilities for fault-tolerant quantum computation and extending the quantum communication range with bosonic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical reservoir computing provides a powerful machine learning paradigm that exploits nonlinear physical dynamics for efficient information processing. By incorporating quantum effects, quantum reservoir computing gains superior potential in machine learning applications, for the quantum dynamics are exponentially costly to simulate classically. Here, we present a novel quantum reservoir computing approach based on correlated quantum spin systems, exploiting natural quantum many-body interactions to generate reservoir dynamics, thereby circumventing the practical challenges of deep quantum circuits. Our experimental implementation supports nontrivial quantum entanglement and exhibits sufficient dynamical complexity for high-performance machine learning. We achieve state-of-the-art performance in experiments on standard time-series benchmarks, reducing prediction error by one to two orders of magnitude compared to previous quantum reservoir experiments. In long-term weather forecasting, our 9-spin quantum reservoir delivers greater prediction accuracy than classical reservoirs with thousands of nodes. This represents a first experimental demonstration of quantum machine learning outperforming large-scale classical models on real-world tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow matching has rapidly become a dominant paradigm in classical generative modeling, offering an efficient way to interpolate between two complex distributions. We extend this idea to the quantum realm and introduce Quantum Flow Matching (QFM)-a fully quantum-circuit realization that offers efficient interpolation between two density matrices. QFM offers systematic preparation of density matrices and generation of samples for accurately estimating observables, and can be realized on a quantum computer without the need for costly circuit redesigns. We validate its versatility on a set of applications: (i) generating target states with prescribed magnetization and entanglement entropy, (ii) estimating nonequilibrium free-energy differences to test the quantum Jarzynski equality, and (iii) expediting the study on superdiffusion breakdown. These results position QFM as a unifying and promising framework for generative modeling across quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Spin decoherence dynamics of Er$^{3+}$ in CeO$_2$ film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing telecom-compatible spin-photon interfaces is essential towards scalable quantum networks. Erbium ions (Er$^{3+}$) exhibit a unique combination of a telecom (1.5 $\mu$m) optical transition and an effective spin-$1/2$ ground state, but identifying a host that enables heterogeneous device integration while preserving long optical and spin coherence remains an open challenge. We explore a new platform of Er$^{3+}$:CeO$_2$ films on silicon, offering low nuclear spin density and the potential for on-chip integration. We demonstrate a 38.8 $\mu$s spin coherence, which can be extended to 176.4\nobreakspace $\mu$s with dynamical decoupling. Pairing experiments with cluster correlation expansion calculations, we identify spectral diffusion-induced Er$^{3+}$ spin flips as the dominant decoherence mechanism and provide pathways to millisecond-scale coherence.</description>

      <title>SimQFL: A Quantum Federated Learning Simulator with Real-Time Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) is an emerging field that has the potential to revolutionize computation by taking advantage of quantum physics concepts in a distributed machine learning (ML) environment. However, the majority of available quantum simulators are primarily built for general quantum circuit simulation and do not include integrated support for machine learning tasks such as training, evaluation, and iterative optimization. Furthermore, designing and assessing quantum learning algorithms is still a difficult and resource-intensive task. Real-time updates are essential for observing model convergence, debugging quantum circuits, and making conscious choices during training with the use of limited resources. Furthermore, most current simulators fail to support the integration of user-specific data for training purposes, undermining the main purpose of using a simulator. In this study, we introduce SimQFL, a customized simulator that simplifies and accelerates QFL experiments in quantum network applications. SimQFL supports real-time, epoch-wise output development and visualization, allowing researchers to monitor the process of learning across each training round. Furthermore, SimQFL offers an intuitive and visually appealing interface that facilitates ease of use and seamless execution. Users can customize key variables such as the number of epochs, learning rates, number of clients, and quantum hyperparameters such as qubits and quantum layers, making the simulator suitable for various QFL applications. The system gives immediate feedback following each epoch by showing intermediate outcomes and dynamically illustrating learning curves. SimQFL is a practical and interactive platform enabling academics and developers to prototype, analyze, and tune quantum neural networks with greater transparency and control in distributed quantum networks.</description>

      <title>A Ramsey Ion Gradiometer for Single-Molecule State Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characterization of ligand--receptor interactions is a cornerstone of modern pharmacology; however, current methods are hampered by limitations such as ensemble averaging and invasive labeling. We propose a theoretical quantum sensing solution, the Quantum Ligand-Binding Interrogator (QLI), designed to overcome these challenges. The QLI is a differential sensor, or gradiometer, that uses a pair of co-trapped atomic ions to perform label-free detection of the electric field gradient produced by a single ligand binding to its receptor in vitrified samples. This gradiometric approach provides robust common-mode rejection of background electric field noise. To bridge the gap between the cryogenic, ultra-high-vacuum environment required for the sensor and the biological sample, we propose an architecture based on a vitrified sample mounted on a scanning probe. This enables the detection of the electrostatic signature of a single molecule in a specific conformational state (e.g., bound vs.\ unbound). This paper details the conceptual framework of the QLI, the experimental architecture, the measurement protocol using entangled two-ion spin states, and an analysis of key engineering risks. Anchoring to state-of-the-art single-ion low-frequency sensitivities (sub-mV\,m$^{-1}$/\,$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$), we project SNR\,=\,1 in tens of seconds at a 10\,\textmu m ion--sample separation for $\Delta p \sim 20$\,D, with feasibility dominated by the (as yet unmeasured) electrostatic stability of vitrified samples. If realized, QLI would provide direct single-molecule measurements of binding-induced electric field changes, offering a new path for experimental validation of computational models of drug--receptor interactions.</description>

      <title>Perfect State Transfer of Mixed States and Purification in Central Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how two many-body, generally mixed, quantum states can be swapped via collective, all-to-all interactions. Specifically, we present an experimentally relevant implementation for quantum dots that enables coherent exchange of quantum information between different species of nuclear spins, effectively achieving a perfect swap gate for qudits formed from these different species. This process also serves as a tool for nuclear spin purification. The results are obtained by mapping the problem onto perfect state transfer on a 1D chain. In the partially polarized limit, we demonstrate that the states can be exchanged independently of the initial state. We also assess the robustness of the procedure to decoherence and errors.</description>

      <title>Adaptive-basis sample-based neural diagonalization for quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately estimating ground-state energies of quantum many-body systems is still a challenging computational task because of the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with the system size. Sample-based diagonalization (SBD) methods address this problem by projecting the Hamiltonian onto a subspace spanned by a selected set of basis configurations. In this article, we introduce two neural network-enhanced approaches for SBD: sample-based neural diagonalization (SND) and adaptive-basis SND (AB-SND). Both employ autoregressive neural networks to efficiently sample relevant basis configurations, with AB-SND additionally optimizing a parameterized basis transformation so that the ground-state wave function becomes more concentrated. We consider different classes of basis transformations: single-spin and non-overlapping two-spin rotations, which are tractable on classical computers, and also more expressive global unitaries that can be implemented using quantum circuits. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques on various quantum Ising models, showing that SND achieves high accuracy for concentrated ground states, while AB-SND consistently outperforms both SND and more conventional SBD methods, allowing entering regimes in which the ground state is not concentrated in the original computational basis.</description>

      <title>Addressing Side-Channel Threats in Quantum Key Distribution via Deep Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional countermeasures against security side channels in quantum key distribution (QKD) systems often suffer from poor compatibility with deployed infrastructure, the risk of introducing new vulnerabilities, and limited applicability to specific types of attacks. In this work, we propose an anomaly detection (AD) model based on one-class machine learning algorithms to address these limitations. By constructing a dataset from the QKD system's operational states, the AD model learns the characteristics of normal behavior under secure conditions. When an attack occurs, the system's state deviates from the learned normal patterns and is identified as anomalous by the model. Experimental results show that the AD model achieves an area under the curve (AUC) exceeding 99\%, effectively safeguarding the QKD system's secure operation. Compared to traditional approaches, our model can be deployed with minimal cost in existing QKD networks without requiring additional optical or electrical components, thus avoiding the introduction of new side channels. Furthermore, unlike multi-class machine learning algorithms, our approach does not rely on prior knowledge of specific attack types and is potentially able to detect unknown attacks. These advantages--generality, ease of deployment, low cost, and high accuracy--make our model a practical and effective tool for protecting QKD systems against side-channel threats.</description>

      <title>Detecting $k$-nonstretchability via a class of informationally complete symmetric measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipartite entanglement characterization is a core problem in quantum information theory, with several classification schemes available. Among these, the $k$-stretchability, recently introduced [Szalay, Quantum 3, 204 (2019)], can be used to describe multipartite entanglement structure. Recently, a class of symmetric measurements (informationally complete $(s,t)$-POVMs) has been proposed [Siudzi$\textrm{\'{n}}$ska, Phys. Rev. A \textbf{105}, 042209 (2022)] , which includes GSIC-POVMs and MUMs. In this work, we discuss the detection of $k$-nonstretchability based on informationally complete $(s,t)$-POVMs and obtain some $k$-nonstretchability criteria for multipartite quantum systems. It is shown that these criteria can identify certain $k$-nonstretchable states, and their practical applicability and advantages are illustrated through specific examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient encoding of classical information plays a fundamental role in numerous practical quantum algorithms. However, the preparation of an arbitrary amplitude-encoded state has been proven to be time-consuming, and its deployment on current noisy devices can be challenging. In this work, we propose an improved Matrix Product State(MPS) method preparation protocol with an exponential reduction on the circuit depth, as well as topological adaptability. By refined utilization of the disentangling principle, we also reduce approximately 33% two-qubit gate count. To validate our method, we study various families of functions and distributions with provably bounded MPS rank. Numerical experiments show that our method significantly reduces circuit depth while achieving higher fidelity for states arising in financial and other applications.</description>

      <title>Graybox characterization and calibration with finite-shot estimation on superconducting-qubit experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterization and calibration of quantum devices are necessary steps to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computing. As quantum devices become more sophisticated, it is increasingly essential to rely not only on physics-based models, but also on predictive models with open-loop optimization. Therefore, we choose the Graybox approach, which is composed of an explicit (whitebox) model describing the known dynamics and an implicit (blackbox) model describing the noisy dynamics in the form of a deep neural network, to characterize and calibrate superconducting-qubit devices. By sending a set of selected pulses to the devices and measuring Pauli expectation values, the Graybox approach can train the implicit model and optimize gates based on specified loss functions. We also benchmark our optimized gates on the devices and cross-testing predictive models with two types of loss functions, i.e., the mean squared errors (MSE) of expectation values and the absolute errors (AE) of average gate fidelities (AGF). While the Graybox method allows for flexibility of the implicit noise model, its construction relies on a finite measurement shots dataset. We thus apply the decomposition of expected MSE loss to show that the finite-shot estimation of expectation values is the main contribution to the minimum value achievable of the expected MSE loss. We also show that the expected loss is an upper bound of the expected absolute error of AGF between the exact value and model prediction. Our results provide insights for quantum device characterization and gate optimization in experiments where only finite shots of data are available.</description>

      <title>BELT: Block Encoding of Linear Transformation on Density Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear maps that are not completely positive play a crucial role in the study of quantum information, yet their non-completely positive nature renders them challenging to realize physically. The core difficulty lies in the fact that when acting such a map $\mathcal{N}$ on a state $\rho$, $\mathcal{N}(\rho)$ may not correspond to a valid density matrix, making it difficult to prepare directly in a physical system. We introduce Block Encoding of Linear Transformation (BELT), a systematic protocol that simulates arbitrary linear maps by embedding the output $\mathcal{N}(\rho)$ into a block of a unitary operator. BELT enables the manipulation and extraction of information about $\mathcal{N}(\rho)$ through coherent quantum evolution. Notably, BELT accommodates maps that fall outside the scope of quantum singular value transformation, such as the transpose map. BELT finds applications in entanglement detection, quantum channel inversion, and simulating pseudo-differential operators, and demonstrates improved sample complexity compared to protocols based on Hermitian-preserving map exponentiation.</description>

      <title>Coherence of Microwave and Optical Qubit Levels in Neutral Thulium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperfine-encoded qubits in alkali atoms have established themselves as robust platforms for quantum computing, while alkaline-earth-like elements expand the state manipulation toolbox through their rich spectrum of optical transitions and metastable states. In this work, we demonstrate that thulium is a viable candidate for quantum computing, combining advantages of hyperfine qubit encoding with a rich energy-level structure of alkaline-earth-like atoms. We describe protocols for the initial state preparation and state-selective readout, and show single-qubit operations on the microwave transition at $1 497$ MHz. We demonstrate ground state hyperfine qubit coherence times up to $T_2^* = 22^{+2}_{-2}$ s and $T_2 = 55^{+59}_{-14}$ s, representing record-scale performance for neutral-atom systems. Furthermore, we show operations involving metastable optical states, including shelving for the state-selective readout as well as coherent population transfer of the ground state qubit with coherence time primarily limited by the metastable level natural lifetime of $112$ ms. These results mark the first step toward using thulium for quantum computing applications and highlight its promising characteristics.</description>

      <title>Generalized quantum Chernoff bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a generalized quantum Chernoff bound for the discrimination of multiple sets of quantum states, thereby extending the classical and quantum Chernoff bounds to the general setting of composite and correlated quantum hypotheses. Specifically, we consider the task of distinguishing whether a quantum system is prepared in a state from one of several convex, compact sets of quantum states, each of which may exhibit arbitrary correlations. Assuming their stability under tensor product, we prove that the optimal error exponent for discrimination is precisely given by the regularized quantum Chernoff divergence between the sets. Furthermore, leveraging minimax theorems, we show that discriminating between sets of quantum states is no harder than discriminating between their worst-case elements in terms of error probability. This implies the existence of a universal optimal test that achieves the minimum error probability for all states in the sets, matching the performance of the optimal test for the most challenging states. We provide explicit characterizations of the universal optimal test in the binary composite case. Finally, we show that the maximum overlap between a pure state and a set of free states, a quantity that frequently arises in quantum resource theories, is equal to the quantum Chernoff divergence between the sets, thereby providing an operational interpretation of this quantity in the context of symmetric hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>Error exponents of quantum state discrimination with composite correlated hypotheses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the error exponents in quantum hypothesis testing between two sets of quantum states, extending the analysis beyond the independent and identically distributed case to encompass composite and correlated hypotheses. We introduce and compare two natural extensions of the quantum Hoeffding divergence and anti-divergence to sets of quantum states, establishing their equivalence or quantitative relationships. Our main results generalize the quantum Hoeffding bound to stable sequences of convex, compact sets of quantum states, demonstrating that the optimal type-I error exponent, under an exponential constraint on the type-II error, is precisely characterized by the regularized quantum Hoeffding divergence between the sets. In the strong converse regime, we provide a lower bound on the exponent in terms of the regularized quantum Hoeffding anti-divergence. These findings refine the generalized quantum Stein's lemma and yield a detailed understanding of the trade-off between type-I and type-II errors in discrimination with composite correlated hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Modified security analysis of device-independent quantum key distribution with random key basis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Security analysis is a critical part in any cryptographic protocol, may it be classical or quantum. Without security analysis, one cannot ensure the secrecy of the distributed keys. To perform a conclusive security analysis, it is very often necessary to frame the problem as an optimization problem. However, solving such optimization problems is quite challenging. In this article, we focus on the security analysis of device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) with random key basis protocol. We show that the optimization cost of the existing security analysis can be reduced without compromising the key rate. In particular, we reframe the entire security analysis of this protocol as a strongly convex optimization problem and demonstrate that unlike the original security proof, optimization of Bob's measurement angles for finding a lower bound on Eve's uncertainty about Alice's key generation basis can be done with lesser cost. We derive an explicit form of the pessimistic error that arises while optimizing the measurement angles of both the parties. We also clarify a few parts of the original security proof, making the analysis more rigorous and complete.</description>

      <title>Interference in Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physicist and Nobel Laureate Richard P. Feynman once remarked ``We choose to examine a phenomenon which is impossible, absolutely impossible, to explain in any classical way, and which has in it the heart of quantum mechanics. In reality, it contains the only mystery. We cannot make the mystery go away by ``explaining'' how it works. We will just tell you how it works. In telling you how it works, we will have told you about the basic peculiarities of all quantum mechanics'' [Feynman RP, Leighton RB, Sands M (1963 and 1965)]. The phenomenon of interference is ubiquitous in the quantum world and indeed holds within itself the explanation for many counterintuitive quantum phenomena. In this review, we choose to focus on a few ramifications and manifestations of quantum interference that have deep implications for the foundations of quantum mechanics. These include single-photon or second-order interference, two-photon or fourth-order interference and higher-order interference.</description>

      <title>Symmetric orthogonalization and probabilistic weights in resource quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transforming non-orthogonal bases into orthogonal ones often sacrifices essential properties or physical meaning in quantum systems. Here, we demonstrate that L\"owdin symmetric orthogonalization (LSO) outperforms the widely used Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization (GSO) in characterizing and quantifying quantum resources, with particular emphasis on coherence and superposition. We employ LSO both to construct an orthogonal basis from a non-orthogonal one and to obtain a non-orthogonal basis from an orthogonal set, thereby avoiding any ambiguity related to the basis choice for quantum coherence. Unlike GSO, which depends on the ordering of input states, LSO applies a symmetric transformation that treats all vectors equally and minimizes deviation from the original basis. This approach generates basis sets with enhanced stability and physical relevance, facilitating the analysis of superpositions in non-orthogonal quantum states. Building on LSO, we also introduce L\"owdin weights -- probabilistic weights for non-orthogonal representations that provide a consistent measure of resource content. These weights further enable basis-independent quantification of coherence and state delocalization through information-theoretic measures such as entropy and participation ratios. Our theoretical and numerical analyses confirm LSO's superior preservation of quantum state symmetry and resource characteristics, underscoring the critical role of orthogonalization methods and L\"owdin weights in resource theory frameworks.</description>

Abstract: Quantum technologies play a central role in establishing new ways of quantum-secured communication. We investigate Free-Space Quantum Communication and explore the advantage of implementing Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) with weak coherent states produced by a light source in the Mid-Infrared (&gt;3$\mu$m). We simulate time-bin encoded quantum key distribution and demonstrate that a free-space QKD link operating in the Mid-infrared outperforms configurations based on conventional near-infrared wavelengths under various weather scenarios, with a particular significance in adverse meteorological conditions.</description>

      <title>Trading Quantum Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an example scenario where we require several copies of a pure quantum state $|\psi\rangle$ for some quantum information processing task. Due to practical limitations, we only have access to $N = 10^3$ depolarized copies of $|\psi\rangle$ such that the fidelity $F$ of each copy with $|\psi\rangle$ is $0.75$. We denote this quantum asset with the ensemble $\mathcal{A}: (10^3, 0.75)_{|\psi\rangle}$. A genie appears and offers to trade $\mathcal{A}$ with either $\mathcal{B}: (10^4, 0.65)_{|\psi\rangle}$ or with $\mathcal{C}: (10^2, 0.90)_{|\psi\rangle}$. Should we accept the trade with either of these two ensembles? In this article, we attempt to answer this question with arbitrary $N$ and $F$. More specifically, we derive resource equivalence curves from quantum resource theory of purity, quantum state distinguishability, quantum state purification, and quantum state tomography. These curves enable ranking of these ensembles according to their operational usefulness for these tasks and allow us to answer the question of trading the aforementioned ensembles.</description>

      <title>Dynamic syndrome decoder in volume-law phases of hybrid quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phases of matter with volume-law entanglement are frequently observed in quantum circuits and have numerous applications, ranging from deepening our understanding of quantum mechanics to advancements in quantum computing and cryptography. Their capacity to host entangled, complex quantum information is complemented by their ability to efficiently obscure it from quantum measurements through scrambling, reminiscent of quantum error-correction. However, the issue of initial-state decodability has primarily been studied in measurement-only models with area-law phases, which limit the entanglement of the encoded state. In this work, we introduce a class of Clifford circuits in one and two dimensions that feature a decodable volume law phase, allowing for information retrieval in logarithmic circuit depths. We present the Sign-Color Decoder that tracks stabilizers revealing the initial state, akin to monitoring a dynamically-changing syndrome for error-correcting codes. We demonstrate this approach in scenarios where error locations are either known or unknown to the decoder, and we provide new insights about the relationship between the decodability transition and measurement-induced phase transition. We propose that this decodability transition is universal across various settings, including different circuit geometries. Our findings pave the way for using volume law states as encoders with mid-circuit measurements, opening potential applications in quantum error correction and quantum cryptography.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Estimation Beyond the Gaussian Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum metrology aims to enhance measurement precision beyond the standard quantum limit (SQL), the benchmark set by classical resources, enabling advances in sensing, imaging, and fundamental physics. A critical milestone beyond the SQL is surpassing the Gaussian bound -- the fundamental precision limit achievable with any Gaussian state, such as optimally squeezed states. Certain non-Gaussian states, specifically asymmetric superpositions of coherent states (SCS) and superpositions of a vacuum and a Fock state (ON states), can outperform this Gaussian bound within an intermediate energy range. In particular, asymmetric SCS emerge as a highly practical resource for near-term quantum sensing architectures operating beyond the Gaussian limit due to their efficient preparation and processing via a constant-complexity protocol. Our comprehensive analysis under realistic loss, noise, and detection schemes quantifies the critical trade-off between achievable precision and the operational range of the non-Gaussian advantage. This work sheds light on the fundamental impact of non-Gaussianity and asymmetry on metrological tasks, and offers insights on how to leverage such resources in realistic near-term quantum enhanced sensors beyond the Gaussian limit.</description>

      <title>Quantum Relational Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely adopted technique for compressing large models into smaller, more efficient student models that can be deployed on devices with limited computational resources. Among various KD methods, Relational Knowledge Distillation (RKD) improves student performance by aligning relational structures in the feature space, such as pairwise distances and angles. In this work, we propose Quantum Relational Knowledge Distillation (QRKD), which extends RKD by incorporating quantum relational information. Specifically, we map classical features into a Hilbert space, interpret them as quantum states, and compute quantum kernel values to capture richer inter-sample relationships. These quantum-informed relations are then used to guide the distillation process. We evaluate QRKD on both vision and language tasks, including CNNs on MNIST and CIFAR-10, and GPT-2 on WikiText-2, Penn Treebank, and IMDB. Across all benchmarks, QRKD consistently improves student model performance compared to classical RKD. Importantly, both teacher and student models remain classical and deployable on standard hardware, with quantum computation required only during training. This work presents the first demonstration of quantum-enhanced knowledge distillation in a fully classical deployment setting.</description>

      <title>Sheffer Polynomials and the s-ordering of Exponential Boson Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The s-ordered form of any product of single-mode boson creation and annihilation operators, containing only a single annihilator, is computed explicitly. The s-ordering concept originated in quantum optics, and subsumes normal, symmetric (Weyl), and anti-normal ordering for any two operators satisfying a canonical commutation relation. Because the s-ordering map can be viewed as producing a function of a complex variable, its inverse is a quantization map that takes such "classical" functions to quantum operators. The explicit s-ordered expressions are derived with the aid of a parametric family of Sheffer polynomial sequences (or equivalently an exponential Riordan array of polynomial coefficients), called the Hsu-Shiue family. To yield orderings interpolating between normal and anti-normal, this family is extended in an intricate way.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing of electron beams using solid-state spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering experiments with energetic particles, such as free electrons, have been historically used to reveal the quantum structure of matter. However, realizing coherent interactions between free-electron beams and solid-state quantum systems has remained out of reach, owing to their intrinsically weak coupling. Realizing such coherent control would open up opportunities for hybrid quantum platforms combining free electrons and solid-state qubits for coincident quantum information processing and nanoscale sensing. Here, we present a framework that employs negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers (NV-) in diamond as quantum sensors of a bunched electron beam. We develop a Lindblad master equation description of the magnetic free-electron--qubit interactions and identify spin relaxometry as a sensitive probe of the interaction. Experimentally, we integrate a confocal fluorescence microscopy setup into a microwave-bunched electron beam line. We monitor charge-state dynamics and assess their impact on key sensing performance metrics (such as spin readout contrast), defining safe operating parameters for quantum sensing experiments. By performing $T_1$ relaxometry under controlled electron beam exposure, we establish an upper bound on the free-electron--spin coupling strength. Our results establish NV- centers as quantitative probes of free electrons, providing a metrological benchmark for free-electron--qubit coupling under realistic conditions, and chart a route toward solid-state quantum control with electron beams.</description>

      <title>Driven-Dissipative Interpretation of Measurement-Induced State Transitions Beyond Semiclassical Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dispersive readout plays a central role in superconducting quantum computing, enabling quantum nondemolition (QND) measurements of qubits through a coupled microwave resonator. However, under strong readout drives, multi-photon resonances can cause measurement-induced state transition (MIST), resulting in qubit leakage out of the computational subspace and compromising the QND character. We present a driven-dissipative interpretation of MIST using a reduced quantum model that captures the dynamics and entanglement structure underlying the breakdown of QND measurement, a feature inaccessible to previous semiclassical treatments. A super-MIST regime under strong drive is uncovered, characterized by steady-state qubit inversion and slow relaxation beyond the semiclassical Landau-Zener predictions. We further identify a transient readout condition in which the resonator becomes highly populated while the qubit remains near its original state. These results are broadly applicable to superconducting qubits such as fluxonium and transmon, unveil the nonequilibrium dynamics of MIST, and highlight strongly driven regimes that can be leveraged for measurement optimization.</description>

      <title>$\eta $-pairing states in the Hubbard model with non-uniform Hubbard interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of $\eta $-pairing eigenstates in the fermionic Hubbard model is fundamentally rooted in the $\eta $-pairing symmetry, which may hold for systems with non-uniform Hubbard interaction $U$. In this work, we present a generalized Hubbard model containing a variety of pseudo-spin terms that break the SO$_{4}$ symmetry but retain the $\eta $-pairing symmetry. This allows us to construct a variety of correlated systems possessing $\eta $% -pairing eigenstates.\ We exemplify our findings by considering a modified Hubbard model associated with alternative magnetic fields and on-site repulsion. We find that the same quasi-$\eta $-pairing eigenstate exhibits two distinct dynamic behaviors in the two models. Numerical results of the time evolution driven by several typical Hamiltonians accord with the analytic predictions and provide a way of the control of an $\eta $-pairing wavepacket with the aid of a time-dependent Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Principle of Diminishing Potentialities in Large N Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A connection between the completion of quantum mechanics featuring events and the theory of emergent spacetime in quantum gravity where von Neumann algebra plays a vital role is established. In thermal equilibrium, we show that the Principle of Diminishing Potentialities (PDP) holds for the large $N$ algebra of $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory with gauge group $SU(N)$ when the temperature is higher than Hawking-Page temperature. Below Hawking-Page transition and for the case of zero temperature, PDP does not hold. Since the centralizer of thermofield double state on the large $N$ algebra of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory coincides with the center of the large $N$ algebra which is trivial, we extend the large $N$ algebra by performing crossed product by the maximal abelian subgroup $H $ of the compact symmetry group $G$ of the two-sided eternal black hole. In this case, the centralizer of thermofield double state is non-trivial and it is given by the action of the maximal abelian subgroup $H$ on the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{TFD} \otimes L^{2} (H)$. This centralizer is by itself commutative and it coincides with its own center. This implies that the first actual event that initiate the ``Events-Trees-Histories'' dynamical evolution in this framework is given by the spectral projectors associated to the action of the Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$ of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ associated to the group $G$ on the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{TFD} \otimes L^{2} (H)$.</description>

      <title>Quantized nonlinear kink movement through topological boundary state instabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thouless pumping is a paradigmatic example of topologically protected, directed transport in linear systems. Recent extensions to nonlinear pumps often overlook the need to reassess the conventional framework of linear topology. In this work, we study a nonlinear dimer-chain model that exhibits quantized transport of kinks under a periodic modulation of a pumping parameter. Crucially, linear excitations in the system map to a Rice-Mele model and display topological boundary modes localized at these kinks. Using methods from nonlinear dynamics, we show that instabilities in these boundary modes are the driving mechanism behind the observed kink motion. While the transport resembles that of a linear Thouless pump, it cannot be fully captured by conventional topological indices. Instead, the behavior is more akin to a topological ratchet: robust, directional, and reproducible, yet fundamentally nonlinear. Furthermore, by introducing multiple pumping parameters, we demonstrate fine control over multiple kink trajectories, as well as soliton motion, suggesting applications in information transport. Our results unify concepts from linear topology and nonlinear dynamics to establish a framework for quantized transport in nonlinear media.</description>

      <title>Portable Laser-Pumped Rb Atomic Clock with Digital Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reducing the size and complexity of high-performance timekeeping devices is an ever-growing need for various applications, such as 6G wireless technology, positioning, navigation and timing (PNT), Internet of Things (IoT), and ultrafast spectroscopy. This work presents a distributed feedback (DFB) laser-pumped Rb atomic clock, which features extraordinary frequency stability, small size and low power consumption. The DFB laser head employs a built-in isolator with a linewidth of approximately 1 MHz. For complete optical pumping of the atoms in the absorption cell, the laser beam is expanded to a diameter of 10 mm by using an optical diffuser-based beam expander. The physics package is based on a magnetron microwave cavity and surrounded by two layers of magnetic shielding. The overall volume of the optical system combined with the physics package is 250 cm$^3$. The proposed atomic clock is also designed to operate at a low temperature, whose absorption cell is maintained at 323 K. Benefiting from the lower Rb atom density, the excited atoms present a long population relaxation time of 5.8 ms. The frequency synthesizer and frequency-locked loop are implemented by digital circuits. The short-term stability of the atomic clock is measured to be $1.8\times10^{-12}\tau ^{-1/2}$ (1-100s). Our achievement paves the way for practical application of the laser-pumped Rb atomic clocks.</description>

      <title>Entanglement harvesting and curvature of entanglement: A modular operator approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An operator-algebraic framework based on Tomita-Takesaki modular theory is used to study aspects of quantum entanglement via the application of the modular conjugation operator $J$. The entanglement structure of quantum fields is studied through the protocol of entanglement harvesting whereby by quantum correlations evolve through the time evolution of qubit detectors coupled to a Bosonic field. Modular conjugation operators are constructed for Unruh-Dewitt type qubits interacting with a scalar field such that initially unentangled qubits become entangled. The entanglement harvested in this process is directly quantified by an expectation value involving $J$ offering a physical application of this operator. The modular operator formalism is then extended to the Markovian open system dynamics of coupled qubits by expressing entanglement monotones as functionals of a state $\rho$ and its modular reflection $J\rho J$. The second derivative of such functionals with respect to an external coupling parameter, termed the curvature of entanglement, provides a natural measure of entanglement sensitivity. At points of modular self-duality, the curvature of entanglement coincides with the quantum Fisher information measure. These results demonstrate that the modular conjugation operator $J$ captures both the harvesting of entanglement from quantum fields and the curvature of entanglement in coupled qubit dynamics providing parallel modular structures that connect these systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum spacetime from constraints: wave equations and fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous works, we showed that both time and space can emerge from entanglement within a globally constrained quantum Universe, with no background coordinates. By extending the Page and Wootters quantum time formalism to include both quantum clocks and rods, and imposing global constraints on total energy and momentum, we constructed a fully relational model of quantum spacetime. Here we take a further step: working in 1+1 dimensions, we show that the standard wave equations governing quantum particles (the Schr\"odinger, Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations) emerge naturally from this framework. The solutions of the equations are derived directly from the constraints, without assuming any external spacetime structure. The second quantization formalism is also implemented and discussed. Our results provide further support for the idea that quantum dynamics in spacetime may emerge from entanglement and constraints.</description>

      <title>Extraction of classical ergotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding the time dependent perturbation that extracts the maximal amount of energy (a.k.a. ergotropy) from a thermally isolated quantum system is a central, solved, problem in quantum thermodynamics. Notably, the same problem has been long studied for classical systems as well, e.g., in the field of plasma physics, but a general solution is still missing there. By building on the analogy with the quantum solution, we provide the classical ergotropy extraction driving: it consists of an instantaneous quench followed by an adiabatic return. We illustrate how the solution, which is valid under an ergodic assumption, is instrumental to finding the ergotropy extracting driving in more general cases. We also show that, just like in the quantum case, the classical ergotropy splits into a coherent and an incoherent part. The presented results open new ways for practical energy recovery in the classical regime while suggesting that there is nothing genuinely quantum in the quantum ergotropy problem.</description>

      <title>Controlling quantum scars and engineering subharmonic responses with a two frequency drive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a continuous two frequency drive is a versatile and robust protocol to control the lifetime of quantum many body scars and to engineer non-equilibrium phases of driven quantum matter. By modulating the frequency ratio $c$ (any rational number), we systematically explore prethermal features across a broad frequency range. For small integer values of $c$, we observe ergodicity breaking even at moderately low frequencies, signaling long-lived scarred dynamics. By continuously increasing $c$, one can generate non-monotonic transitions between ergodic and non-ergodic dynamics. These observations are consistent with the predictions of an effective Floquet Hamiltonian based approach. Furthermore, we exploit this tunability to engineer fractional subharmonic responses, highlighting the potential of two-frequency driving as a theoretical platform for controlling scars, prethermalization, and time crystal-like behavior.</description>

      <title>Computing Exchange Coupling constants in Transition metal complexes with Tensor Product Selected Configuration Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition metal complexes present significant challenges for electronic structure theory due to strong electron correlation arising from partially filled $d$-orbitals. We compare our recently developed Tensor Product Selected Configuration Interaction (TPSCI) with Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) for computing exchange coupling constants in six transition metal systems, including dinuclear Cr, Fe, and Mn complexes and a tetranuclear Ni-cubane. TPSCI uses a locally correlated tensor product state basis to capture electronic structure efficiently while maintaining interpretability. From calculations on active spaces ranging from (22e,29o) to (42e,49o), we find that TPSCI consistently yields higher variational energies than DMRG due to truncation of local cluster states, but provides magnetic exchange coupling constants (J) generally within 10-30 cm$^{-1}$ of DMRG results. Key advantages include natural multistate capability enabling direct J extrapolation with smaller statistical errors, and computational efficiency for challenging systems. However, cluster state truncation represents a fundamental limitation requiring careful convergence testing, particularly for large local cluster dimensions. We identify specific failure cases where current truncation schemes break down, highlighting the need for improved cluster state selection methods and distributed memory implementations to realize TPSCI's full potential for strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>A simple analysis of a quantum-inspired algorithm for solving low-rank linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe and analyze a simple algorithm for sampling from the solution $\mathbf{x}^* := \mathbf{A}^+\mathbf{b}$ to a linear system $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$. We assume access to a sampler which allows us to draw indices proportional to the squared row/column-norms of $\mathbf{A}$. Our algorithm produces a compressed representation of some vector $\mathbf{x}$ for which $\|\mathbf{x}^* - \mathbf{x}\| &lt; \varepsilon \|\mathbf{x}^* \|$ in $\widetilde{O}(\kappa_{\mathsf{F}}^4 \kappa^2 / \varepsilon^2)$ time, where $\kappa_{\mathsf{F}} := \|\mathbf{A}\|_{\mathsf{F}}\|\mathbf{A}^{+}\|$ and $\kappa := \|\mathbf{A}\|\|\mathbf{A}^{+}\|$. The representation of $\mathbf{x}$ allows us to query entries of $\mathbf{x}$ in $\widetilde{O}(\kappa_{\mathsf{F}}^2)$ time and sample proportional to the square entries of $\mathbf{x}$ in $\widetilde{O}(\kappa_{\mathsf{F}}^4 \kappa^6)$ time, assuming access to a sampler which allows us to draw indices proportional to the squared entries of any given row of $\mathbf{A}$. Our analysis, which is elementary, non-asymptotic, and fully self-contained, simplifies and clarifies several past analyses from literature including [Gily\'en, Song, and Tang; 2022, 2023] and [Shao and Montanaro; 2022].</description>

      <title>SO(n) Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki states as conformal boundary states of integrable SU(n) spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a class of conformal boundary states in the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) conformal field theory (CFT) using the symmetry embedding $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_2 \subset \mathrm{SU}(n)_1$. These boundary states are beyond the standard Cardy construction and possess $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ symmetry. The $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ Uimin-Lai-Sutherland (ULS) spin chains, which realize the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ WZW model on the lattice, allow us to identify these boundary states as the ground states of the $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki spin chains. Using the integrability of the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ ULS model, we analytically compute the corresponding Affleck-Ludwig boundary entropy using exact overlap formulas. Our results unveil intriguing connections between exotic boundary states in CFT and integrable lattice models, thus providing deep insights into the interplay of symmetry, integrability, and boundary critical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Born's Rule from Quantum Frequentism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12027</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.12027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum theory has evolved from a set of provisional rules to an indispensable framework that underlies much of modern technology and infrastructure. Yet, after a century, Born's probability postulate remains at odds with the theory's unitary character. The problem stems from the linearity of the Schr\"odinger equation, as linear systems are insensitive to the magnitudes of their solutions' coefficients. If measurement is unitary, and thus linear, how can the frequency of an outcome depend on the magnitude of its amplitude? And if not, at what scale does unitarity break down?
  This question remains pressing, as the assumption of unitarity underlies both the design of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum devices, as well as our understanding of fundamental aspects of our universe, for example, the black hole information problem. Proponents of the many-worlds interpretation have argued that Born's rule is observed because events that violate it have vanishing norms, and so must be unphysical. However, this argument has only been made explicit for special cases involving infinitely many identical states.
  In this paper we provide a generalized form of Born's rule applicable to measurements of arbitrarily-prepared factorizable states, and prove that such systems contain no histories that violate Born's rule. Our result therefore demonstrates that purely unitary evolution can co-exist with Born's rule under more relaxed conditions. In addition, we apply our generalized rule to the problem of quantum circuit fidelity, and provide a single-shot alternative to cross-entropy benchmarking based on self-information rate.</description>

Abstract: Quantum state transferring has been demonstrated using drones via entanglement distribution. Here we demonstrate the first drone-based quantum task, for quantum key distribution (QKD). Compact and polarization-maintaining acquisition, pointing, and tracking system and QKD modules are developed and loaded on a home-made octocopter, within takeoff weight of 30 kg. Real-time QKD is performed over 200 m distance with 8.48 kHz average secret key rate, using polarization-coded decoy-state BB84 protocol. With the capability of secret key distribution using a drone, wireless communication can be expected with enhanced security in the quantum approach, between mobile nodes towards a network.</description>

Abstract: We give a construction of public key quantum money, and even a strengthened version called quantum lightning, from abelian group actions, which can in turn be constructed from suitable isogenies over elliptic curves. We prove security in the generic group model for group actions under a plausible computational assumption, and develop a general toolkit for proving quantum security in this model. Along the way, we explore knowledge assumptions and algebraic group actions in the quantum setting, finding significant limitations of these assumptions/models compared to generic group actions.</description>

      <title>Minimal criteria for continuous-variable genuine multipartite entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04376v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a set of genuine multi-mode entanglement criteria for second moments of the quadrature operators. The criteria have a common form of the uncertainty relation between sums of variances of position and momentum quadrature combinations. A unique feature of the criteria is that the sums contain the least possible number of variances of at most two-mode combinations. The number of second moments we need to know to apply the criteria thus scales only linearly with the number of modes, as opposed to the quadratic scaling of the already existing criteria. Each criterion is associated with a tree graph, which allowed us to develop a direct method of construction of the criteria based solely on the structure of the underlying tree. The practicality of the proposed criteria is demonstrated by finding a number of examples of Gaussian states of up to six modes, whose genuine multi-mode entanglement is detected by them. The designed criteria are particularly suitable for verification of genuine multipartite entanglement in large multi-mode states or when only a set of two-mode nearest-neighbour marginal covariance matrices of the investigated state is available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum networks that distribute entanglement among remote nodes will unlock transformational technologies in quantum computing, communication, and sensing. However, state-of-the-art networks utilize only a single optically-addressed qubit per node; this constrains both the quantum communication bandwidth and memory resources, greatly impeding scalability. Solid-state platforms provide a valuable resource for multiplexed quantum networking where multiple spectrally-distinguishable qubits can be hosted in nano-scale volumes. Here we harness this resource by implementing a two-node network consisting of several rare-earth ions coupled to nanophotonic cavities. This is accomplished with a protocol that entangles distinguishable 171Yb ions through frequency-erasing photon detection combined with real-time quantum feedforward. This method is robust to slow optical frequency fluctuations occurring on timescales longer than a single entanglement attempt: a universal challenge amongst solid-state emitters. We demonstrate the enhanced functionality of these multi-emitter nodes in two ways. First, we mitigate bottlenecks to the entanglement distribution rate through multiplexed entanglement of two remote ion pairs. Secondly, we prepare multipartite W-states comprising three distinguishable ions as a resource for advanced quantum networking protocols. These results lay the groundwork for scalable quantum networking based on rare-earth ions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimization drives advances in quantum science and machine learning, yet most generative models aim to mimic data rather than to discover optimal answers to challenging problems. Here we present a variational generative optimization network that learns to map simple random inputs into high quality solutions across a variety of quantum tasks. We demonstrate that the network rapidly identifies entangled states exhibiting an optimal advantage in entanglement detection when allowing classical communication, attains the ground state energy of an eighteen spin model without encountering the barren plateau phenomenon that hampers standard hybrid algorithms, and-after a single training run-outputs multiple orthogonal ground states of degenerate quantum models. Because the method is model agnostic, parallelizable and runs on current classical hardware, it can accelerate future variational optimization problems in quantum information, quantum computing and beyond.</description>

      <title>Contextuality in anomalous heat flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In classical thermodynamics, heat must spontaneously flow from hot to cold systems. In quantum thermodynamics, the same law applies when considering multipartite product thermal states evolving unitarily. If initial correlations are present, anomalous heat flow can happen, temporarily making cold thermal states colder and hot thermal states hotter. Such effect can happen due to entanglement, but also because of classical randomness, hence lacking a direct connection with nonclassicality. In this work, we introduce scenarios where anomalous heat flow \emph{does} have a direct link to nonclassicality, defined to be the failure of noncontextual models to explain experimental data. We start by extending known noncontextuality inequalities to a setup where sequential transformations are considered. We then show a class of quantum prepare-transform-measure protocols, characterized by time intervals $(0,\tau_c)$ for a given critical time $\tau_c$, where anomalous heat flow happens only if a noncontextuality inequality is violated. We also analyze a recent experiment from Micadei et. al. [Nat. Commun. 10, 2456 (2019)] and find the critical time $\tau_c$ based on their experimental parameters. We conclude by investigating heat flow in the evolution of two qutrit systems, showing that our findings are not an artifact of using two-qubit systems.</description>

      <title>Phase Coordinate Uncomputation in Quantum Recursive Fourier Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15938v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recursive Fourier Sampling (RFS) was one of the earliest problems to demonstrate a quantum advantage, and is known to lie outside the Merlin--Arthur complexity class. This work contains a new description of quantum algorithms in phase space terminology, demonstrating its use in RFS, and how and why this gives a better understanding of the quantum advantage in RFS. Most importantly, describing the computational process of quantum computation in phase space terminology gives a much better understanding of why uncomputation is necessary when solving RFS: the advantage is present only when phase coordinate garbage is uncomputed. This is the underlying reason for the limitations of the quantum advantage.</description>

Abstract: The minimal ingredients to describe a quantum system are a Hamiltonian, an initial state, and a preferred tensor product structure that encodes a decomposition into subsystems. We explore a top-down approach in which the subsystems emerge from the spectrum of the whole system. This approach has been referred to as quantum mereology. First we show that decomposing a system into subsystems is equivalent to decomposing a spectrum into other spectra. Then we argue that the number of subsystems (the volume of the system) can be inferred from the spectrum itself. In local models, this information is encoded in finite size corrections to the Gaussian density of states.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Repeater with Single Atoms in Cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient quantum repeaters are needed to combat photon losses in fibers in future quantum networks. Single atom coupled with photonic cavity offers a great platform for photon-atom gate. Here I propose a quantum repeater scheme with efficient entanglement generation and entanglement swapping based on photon-atom gates. It can be implemented with various types of atomic systems and requires much less experimental complexity compared to other repeater protocols. With current available experimental techniques and reasonable improvements, high entanglement distribution rates can be achieved. A multiplexing configuration of 10 single atoms in cavities, secret key rates in order of a few Hz to 100s Hz can be achieved for communication distance of 1000 km. This proposal paves the way for the demonstration of an efficient entanglement distribution with quantum repeaters in the near future.</description>

      <title>Single-shot Distinguishability and Anti-distinguishability of Quantum Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among the surprising features of quantum measurements, the problem of distinguishing and antidistinguishing general quantum measurements is fundamentally appealing. Unlike classical systems, quantum theory offers entangled states and peculiar state update rule of the post-measurement state, which gives rise to four distinct scenarios: (i) probing single systems and without access to the Post-measurement States (PMS), (ii) probing entangled systems and without access to the PMS, (iii) probing single systems with access to the PMS, and (iv) probing entangled systems with access to the PMS. We study the probability of distinguishing (and antidistinguishing) quantum measurements sampled from a given set in the single-shot regime. For some scenarios, we provide the analytical expressions of distinguishability (and antidistinguishability) for qubit projective measurements. We show that the distinguishability of any pair of qubit projective measurements in scenario (iii) is always greater than its value in scenario (ii). Interestingly, certain pairs of non-projective qubit measurements achieve optimal distinguishability in scenario (ii) with a non-maximally entangled state. In general, for any set of measurements, distinguishability (and antidistinguishability) in scenario (i) never exceeds that in any other scenario, while it reaches its highest possible value in scenario (iv). We establish that there is no hierarchical relation between scenarios (ii) and (iii). In particular, we introduce different variants of the well-known `trine' qubit measurement to construct pairs (and triples) of qubit quantum measurements such that they are perfectly distinguishable (and antidistinguishable) in scenario (ii) but not in scenario (iii), and vice versa. Additionally, we present qubit measurements that are perfectly distinguishable (and antidistinguishable) in scenario (iv) but not in any other scenarios.</description>

      <title>Reduced Sampling Overhead for Probabilistic Error Cancellation by Pauli Error Propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01311v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation is regarded as a possible path to near-term quantum utility. The methods under the quantum error mitigation umbrella term, such as probabilistic error cancellation (PEC), zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) or Clifford data regression (CDR) are able to significantly reduce the error for the estimation of expectation values, although at an exponentially scaling cost, i.e., in the sampling overhead. In this work, we present a method to reduce the sampling overhead of PEC through Pauli error propagation combined with classical preprocessing. Our findings indicate that this method significantly reduces sampling overheads for Clifford circuits, leveraging the well-defined interaction between the Clifford group and Pauli noise.
  Additionally, we show that the method is applicable to non-Clifford circuits, though with more limited effectiveness, primarily constrained by the number of non-Clifford gates present in the circuit. We further provide examples of Clifford sub-circuits commonly encountered in relevant calculations, such as resource state generation in measurement-based quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07527v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodically driving a quantum many-body system can drastically change its properties, leading to exotic non-equilibrium states of matter without a static analog. In this scenario, parametric resonances and the complexity of an interacting many-body system are pivotal in establishing non-equilibrium states. We report on a Floquet-engineered transverse field Ising model for the controlled propagation in one dimension of spin waves. The underlying mechanisms behind our proposal rely on high-frequency drivings using characteristic parametric resonances of the spin lattice. Many-body resonances modulating spin-spin exchange or individual spin gaps inhibit interactions between spins thus proving a mechanism for controlling spin-wave propagation and a quantum switch. Our schemes may be implemented in circuit QED with direct applications in coupling-decoupling schemes for system-reservoir interaction and routing in quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Magnon cat states in a cavity-magnon-qubit system via two-magnon driving and dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an efficient method for dissipative generation of magnonic cat states in a cavity-magnon-qubit hybrid system by exploiting a two-magnon driving and dissipation mechanism. When both the magnon and qubit are driven, a coherent nonlinear two-magnon interaction is induced, wherein the qubit and the magnon mode exchange energy through magnon pairs. The dissipation of the qubit is exploited to steer the magnon mode into a quantum superposition of distinct coherent states, where the magnon mode evolves into either an even or odd cat state, depending on the parity of the magnon initial state. For the case where the magnon initial state is a superposition state, e.g., of $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$, the magnon mode can evolve into a weighted mixture of the even and odd cat states. We also find that magnon squeezed states may emerge during the short-time evolution, showcasing the capability of our mechanism in preparing diverse magnon non-classical states. Magnonic cat and squeezed states are macroscopic quantum states and find applications in macroscopic quantum studies and quantum sensing, e.g., in the dark matter search using ferromagnetic axion haloscopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09205v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the key issues in quantum discrimination problems is understanding the extent of the advantages in discrimination performance when using resource states compared to resourceless states. We show that in any resource theory of states, which may not be convex, the extent to which the maximum average success probability can be improved in quantum channel discrimination problems without using auxiliary systems can be precisely quantified by the robustness measure. This result offers an intuitive operational meaning of the robustness measure in any convex resource theory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the robustness measure can also quantify the improvement in channel discrimination problems that use auxiliary systems. Using these findings, resources can be fully characterized to achieve higher success probabilities than any state without the given resource in channel discrimination problems.</description>

Abstract: The M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen (MS) gate is a two-qubit controlled-phase gate in ion traps that is highly valued due to its ability to preserve the motional state of the ions. However, its fidelity is obstructed by errors affecting the motion of the ions as well as the rotation of the qubits. In this work, we propose an amplitude-modulated composite MS gate which features high fidelity robust to gate timing, detuning and coupling errors and is also tolerant of a.c. Stark shifts and drifting detuning errors.</description>

      <title>Scalable Optical Quantum State Synthesizer with Dual-Mode Resonator Memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical quantum computing is a promising approach for achieving large-scale quantum computation. While Gaussian operations have been successfully scaled, the inherently weak nonlinearity in optics makes generating highly non-Gaussian states a critical challenge for universality and fault tolerance. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a scalable method to generate optical non-Gaussian states with a resonator-based quantum memory that supports continuous-time storage and retrieval, in contrast to conventional loop-based memories. We introduce a dual-mode operation of the memory, enabling both storage and entangling functionalities within a single device. By employing a time-domain-multiplexed approach, we successfully demonstrate both cat and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) breeding protocols in a scalable fashion, marking a key step toward quantum error correction.
  Our experiment also marks the first full demonstration of an optical resonator memory performing writing, storage, and readout operations. We validate the memory by storing squeezed single-photon states with up to 93% total efficiency, and measure an energy relaxation time $T_1 =$2.3$\mu$s and dephasing time $T_{\phi} =$0.96$\mu$s.
  These results establish a scalable pathway to generating complex non-Gaussian states required for fault-tolerant optical quantum computing. Beyond computation, our techniques provide new tools for enhancing quantum communication, sensing, and metrology.</description>

      <title>Entanglement generation and scaling from noisy quenches across a quantum critical point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the impact of noise on the dynamics of entanglement in the transverse-field Ising chain, with the field quenched linearly across one or both of the quantum critical points of the model. Taking concurrence as a measure of entanglement, we find that a quench generates entanglement between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor spins, with noise reducing the amount of entanglement. Focusing on the next-nearest-neighbor concurrence, known to exhibit Kibble-Zurek scaling with the square root of the quench rate in the noiseless case, we find a different result when noise is present: The concurrence now scales logarithmically with the quench rate, with a noise-dependent amplitude. This is also different from the ``anti-Kibble-Zurek" scaling of defect density with quench rate when noise is present, suggesting that noisy entanglement generation is largely independent from the rate of defect formation. Intriguingly, the critical time scale beyond which no entanglement is produced by a noisy quench scales as a power law with the strength of noise, with the same exponent as that which governs the optimal quench time for which defect formation is at a minimum in a standard quantum annealing scheme.</description>

      <title>Opening Krylov space to access all-time dynamics via dynamical symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving short and long time dynamics of closed quantum many-body systems is one of the main challenges of both atomic and condensed matter physics. For locally interacting closed systems, the dynamics of local observables can always be expanded into (pseudolocal) eigenmodes of the Liouvillian, so called dynamical symmetries. They come in two classes - transient operators, which decay in time and perpetual operators, which either oscillate forever or stay the same (conservation laws). These operators provide a full characterization of the dynamics of the system. Deriving these operators, apart from a very limited class of models, has not been possible. Here, we present a method to numerically and analytically derive some of these dynamical symmetries in infinite closed systems by introducing a naturally emergent open boundary condition on the Krylov chain. This boundary condition defines a partitioning of the Krylov space into system and environment degrees of freedom, where non-local operators make up an effective bath for the local operators. We demonstrate the practicality of the method on some numerical examples and derive analytical results in two idealized cases. Our approach lets us directly relate the operator growth hypothesis to thermalization and exponential decay of observables in chaotic systems.</description>

Abstract: Quantum systems subjected to a continuous weak measurement process evolve according to stochastic differential equations (SDE). Depending on the outcomes of these stochastic measurements, the quantum state may diffuse in various directions across the state space. This note points out that in many scenarios relevant to quantum engineering, this diffusion is effectively constrained to a low-dimensional space. Specifically, the quantum state remains confined to a low-dimensional, nonlinear manifold -- often time-dependent, yet independent of the specific measurement outcomes. This note derives the corresponding low-dimensional formulations for expressing the stochastically evolving state in several prototypical cases: quantum non-demolition measurements in arbitrary dimensions; quadrature measurements of a harmonic oscillator (linear quantum system); and measurements of subsystems within multipartite quantum systems. Additionally, it introduces an algebraic criterion to determine whether such low-dimensional manifolds exist or persist when additional dynamics are present.</description>

Abstract: Quantifying the entanglement and coherence of quantum systems is a topic of significant theoretical and practical interest. In this paper, we propose a method to evaluate lower bounds for several widely used coherence measures and genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) measures. Our approach, which is resource-efficient and computationally feasible, provides bounds of coherence and GME measures with the help of witnesses by the F-norm. Finally, we present a practical framework for estimating these quantum resources in various physical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Trapped Magnetic Vortex Losses in Niobium Resonators at mK Temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14616v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trapped magnetic vortices in niobium introduce microwave losses that degrade the performance of superconducting resonators. While such losses have been extensively studied above 1~K, we report here their direct quantification in the millikelvin and low-photon regime relevant to quantum devices. Using a high-quality factor 3-D niobium cavity cooled through its superconducting transition in controlled magnetic fields, we isolate vortex-induced losses and find the resistive component of the sensitivity to trapped flux $S$ to be approximately 2~n$\Omega$/mG at 10~mK and 6~GHz. The decay rate is initially dominated by two-level system (TLS) losses from the native niobium pentoxide, with vortex-induced degradation of $T_1$ occurring above $B_{\text{trap}}\sim$~50~mG. In the absence of the oxide, even 10~mG of trapped flux limits performance $Q_0\sim$~10$^{10}$, or $T_1\sim$~350~ms, underscoring the need for stringent magnetic shielding. The resistive sensitivity $S$ decreases with temperature and remains largely field-independent, whereas the reactive component, $S'$, exhibits a maximum near 0.8~K. These behaviors are well modeled within the Coffey-Clem framework in the zero-creep limit, under the assumption that vortex pinning is enhanced by thermally activated processes. Our results suggest that niobium-based transmon qubits can tolerate vortex-induced dissipation at trapped field levels up to several hundred mG, but achieving long coherence times still requires careful magnetic shielding to suppress lower-field losses from other mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: Time-varying quantum channels are essential for modeling realistic quantum systems with evolving noise properties. Here, we consider Gaussian lossy channels varying from one use to another and we employ neural networks to classify, regress, and forecast the behavior of these channels from their Choi-Jamiolkowski states. The networks achieve at least 87% of accuracy in distinguishing between non-Markovian, Markovian, memoryless, compound, and deterministic channels. In regression tasks, the model accurately reconstructs the loss parameter sequences, and in forecasting, it predicts future values, with improved performance as the memory parameter approaches 1 for Markovian channels. These results demonstrate the potential of neural networks in characterizing and predicting the dynamics of quantum channels.</description>

      <title>Detector noise in continuous-variable quantum key distribution</title>

Abstract: Detector noise is a critical factor in determining the performance of a quantum key distribution (QKD) system. In continuous-variable (CV) QKD with optical coherent detection, the widely adopted \textit{trusted detector noise} model improves both the secret key rate and transmission distance. This model assumes that detector noise is inherently random and inaccessible to an adversary. Its validity depends on two key assumptions: (1) the detector can be accurately calibrated by the legitimate user and remains isolated from the adversary, and (2) the detector noise is truly random from the adversary's perspective. While substantial research has focused on strengthening the first assumption, the second is far more difficult to justify. Indeed, in quantum random number generation using optical homodyne detection, detector noise is often treated as ``untrusted'' and unsuitable for generating true randomness. In this paper, we introduce a \textit{calibrated detector noise} model for CV-QKD, which relies solely on the first assumption. Specifically, our model applies even when detector noise is predictable to the adversary. We analyze the electrical noise of a commercial balanced photoreceiver and perform numerical simulations to compare different noise models. Our results show that when the detector noise variance is an order of magnitude below the vacuum noise, the proposed model achieves a secret key rate comparable to that of the trusted detector noise model, while eliminating the questionable assumption of ``truly random'' detector noise.</description>

      <title>Purely quantum memory in closed systems observed via imperfect measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection and quantification of non-Markovianity, a.k.a. memory, in quantum systems is a central problem in the theory of open quantum systems. There memory is as a result of the interaction between the system and its environment. Little is known, however, about memory effects induced by imperfect measurements on closed systems, where an entanglement with the environment is not possible. We investigate the emergence and characteristics of memory in closed systems observed via imperfect stroboscopic quantum measurements yielding coarse-grained outcomes. We consider ideal and two kinds of imperfect measurements: von Neumann measurements--the analogue of classical lumping--which destroy any coherence in the system, and genuinely quantum-lumping L\"uders measurements preserving certain quantum correlations. Whereas the conditions for Markov dynamics under von Neumann lumping are the same as for classical dynamics, quantum-lumping requires stronger conditions, i.e. the absence of any detectable coherence. We introduce the concept of purely quantum memory having no classical counterpart. We illustrate our results with a quantum walk on a lattice and discuss their implications for dissipative dynamics and decoherence effects induced by more realistic measurements.</description>

      <title>Quantum Wasserstein distance and its relation to several types of fidelities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14523v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider several definitions of the quantum Wasserstein distance based on an optimization over general bipartite quantum states with given marginals. Then, we examine the quantities obtained after the optimization is carried out over bipartite separable states instead. We prove that several of these quantities are equal to each other. Thus, we connect several approaches in the literature. We prove the triangle inequality for some of these quantities for the case of one of the three states being pure. As a byproduct, we show that the Uhlmann-Jozsa quantum fidelity can also be written as an optimization over separable states with given marginals. We use this to prove that some of these quantities equal the Uhlmann-Jozsa quantum fidelity for qubits. We also find relations with the superfidelity.</description>

      <title>Generation of hyperentangled photon pairs in the time and frequency domain on a silicon photonic chip</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-dimensional entangled photon states represent an important resource in quantum communication networks. Specifically, hyperentangled states presenting simultaneous entanglement in several degrees of freedom (DoF), stand out for their noise resilience and information capacity. In this work, we demonstrate the generation of hyperentangled photon pairs in the time and frequency-bin domain by spontaneous four-wave mixing from the coherent driving of two integrated Silicon microresonators. We demonstrate entanglement in each DoF by proving the violation of the Clauser Horne Shimony Holt (CHSH) inequality by more than 27 standard deviations (STDs) in each reduced space. Genuine hyperentanglement is then assessed from the negativity of an hyperentanglement witness, which is verified by more than 60 STDs. These results mark, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration of time-frequency bin hyperentanglement in an integrated silicon photonic device.</description>

Abstract: Quantum networks hold promise for key distribution, private and distributed computing, and quantum sensing, among other applications. The scale of such networks for ground users is currently limited by one's ability to distribute entanglement between distant locations. This can in principle be carried out by transmitting entangled photons through optical fibers or satellites. The former is limited by fiber-optic attenuation while the latter is limited by atmospheric extinction and diffraction. Here, we propose a hybrid network and protocol that outperform both ground- and satellite-based designs and lead to high-fidelity entanglement at a continental or even global scale.</description>

      <title>A Lazy Resynthesis Approach for Simultaneous T Gate and Two-Qubit Gate Optimization of Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-of-the-art quantum circuit optimization (QCO) algorithms for T-count reduction often lead to a substantial increase in two-qubit gate count (2Q-count) -- a drawback that existing 2Q-count optimization techniques struggle to address effectively. In this work, we propose a novel lazy resynthesis approach for modern tableau-based QCO flows that significantly mitigates the 2Q-gate surges commonly introduced during T-count optimization in Clifford+T circuits. Experimental results show that our approach reduces 2Q-count overhead by 54.8%, 15.3%, and 68.0% compared to tableau-based, ZX-calculus-based, and path-sum-based QCO algorithms, respectively. In terms of runtime, our method achieves speedups of 1.81$\times$ and 13.1$\times$ over the tableau-based and ZX-calculus-based methods, while performing comparably to the path-sum-based approach. In summary, the proposed lazy resynthesis technique not only enhances the quality and performance of tableau-based QCO algorithms but also demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability compared to alternative QCO approaches such as ZX-calculus and path-sum-based techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work extends quantum optical models of high harmonic generation by considering a quantum stochastic analysis of the field modes coupled to an environment. In particular, we study the open system dynamics by solving the quantum Langevin equation for a non-linear driven cavity coupled to the environment. For an unstructured environment without memory, we show that the emission characteristics of the intense driven cavity is isomorphic to the process of high harmonic generation and a non-linear antenna. This is achieved by using the quantum regression theorem for the Markovian dynamics, and further allows to obtain the upper bound of the radiated power due to the emitter fluctuations. This opens the path to connect current quantum optical approaches of HHG with open system descriptions and towards driven-dissipative systems in the non-linear regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for producing high-fidelity data samples, yet their performance is constrained by the quality of latent representations, typically sampled from classical noise distributions. This study investigates hybrid quantum-classical GANs (HQCGANs) in which a quantum generator, implemented via parameterised quantum circuits, produces latent vectors for a classical discriminator. We evaluate a classical GAN alongside three HQCGAN variants with 3, 5, and 7 qubits, using Qiskit's AerSimulator with realistic noise models to emulate near-term quantum devices. The binary MNIST dataset (digits 0 and 1) is used to align with the low-dimensional latent spaces imposed by current quantum hardware. Models are trained for 150 epochs and assessed with Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Kernel Inception Distance (KID). Results show that while the classical GAN achieved the best scores, the 7-qubit HQCGAN produced competitive performance, narrowing the gap in later epochs, whereas the 3-qubit model exhibited earlier convergence limitations. Efficiency analysis indicates only moderate training time increases despite quantum sampling overhead. These findings validate the feasibility of noisy quantum circuits as latent priors in GAN architectures, highlighting their potential to enhance generative modelling within the constraints of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era.</description>

Abstract: We study a quantum interacting spin system subject to an external drive and coupled to a thermal bath of spatially localized vibrational modes, serving as a model of Dynamic Nuclear Polarization. We show that even when the many-body eigenstates of the system are ergodic, a sufficiently strong coupling to the bath may effectively localize the spins due to many-body quantum Zeno effect, as manifested by the hole-burning shape of the electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum. Our results provide an explanation of the breakdown of the thermal mixing regime experimentally observed above 4 - 5 Kelvin.</description>

      <title>Stability of quasicrystalline ultracold fermions to dipolar interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04830v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic potentials can be used to interpolate between localization and delocalization in one dimension. With the rise of optical platforms engineering dipolar interactions, a key question is the stability of quasicrystalline phases under these long-range interactions. In this work, we study repulsive ultracold dipolar fermions in a quasiperiodic optical lattice to characterize the behavior of interacting quasicrystals. We simulate the full time evolution of the typical experimental protocols used to probe quasicrystalline order and localization properties. We extract experimentally measurable dynamical observables and correlation functions to characterize the three phases observed in the noninteracting setting: localized, intermediate, and extended. We then study the stability of such phases to repulsive dipolar interactions. We find that dipolar interactions can completely alter the shape of the phase diagram by stabilizing the intermediate phase, mostly at the expense of the extended phase. Moreover, in the strongly interacting regime, a resonance-like behavior characterized by density oscillations appears. Remarkably, strong dipolar repulsions can also localize particles even in the absence of quasiperiodicity if the primary lattice is sufficiently deep. Our work shows that dipolar interactions in a quasiperiodic potential can give rise to a complex, tuneable coexistence of localized and extended quantum states.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of many-body localized systems: logarithmic lightcones and $\log \, t$-law of $\alpha$-R\'enyi entropies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of the Many-Body-Localization phenomenology we consider arbitrarily large one-dimensional local spin systems, the XXZ model with random magnetic field is a prototypical example. Without assuming the existence of exponentially localized integrals of motion (LIOM), but assuming instead that the system's dynamics gives rise to a Lieb-Robinson bound (L-R) with a logarithmic lightcone, we rigorously evaluate the dynamical generation, starting from a generic product state, of $ \alpha$-R\'enyi entropies, with $ \alpha $ close to one, obtaining a $\log \, t$-law, that denotes a slow spread of entanglement. This is in sharp contrast with Anderson localized phases that show no dynamically generated entanglement. To prove this result we apply a general theory recently developed by us in arXiv:2408.00743 that quantitatively relates the L-R bounds of a local Hamiltonian with the dynamical generation of entanglement. Assuming instead the existence of LIOM we provide new independent proofs of the known facts that the L-R bound of the system's dynamics has a logarithmic light cone and show that the dynamical generation of the von Neumann entropy has for large times a $ \log \, t$-shape. L-R bounds, that quantify the dynamical spreading of local operators, may be easier to measure in experiments in comparison to global quantities such as entanglement.</description>

Abstract: Monolithic integration, which refers to the incorporation of all device functionalities within a single material, shows significant potential for creating scalable solid-state quantum devices. This study demonstrated the coherent control of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) spins using an electronic circuit monolithically integrated within diamond: a patterned, conductive boron-doped diamond (BDD) microwave waveguide. First, we validated the high-frequency performance of the circuit by characterizing its impedance up to the microwave range, confirming its capability for efficient microwave transmission. Then, using this monolithically integrated BDD--NV hybrid system, we performed optically detected magnetic resonance and observed noticeable Rabi oscillations driven by the metallic BDD circuit. Importantly, we verified that the BDD antenna has a minimal detrimental impact on the NV spins; microwave-induced heating is negligible under both pulsed and continuous driving, and the spin relaxation time ($T_1$) remains unperturbed. This approach paves the way for a new class of compact, robust, and versatile quantum platforms suitable for sensing and information processing in various environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02883v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological Anderson insulators (TAIs) provide a mechanism for topological phase transitions in disordered systems and have implications for quantum material design. In this work, we investigate the emergence of multiple TAIs in a one-dimensional spin-orbit coupled (SOC) chain subject to Fibonacci modulation, which transforms a trivial band structure into a sequence of topologically nontrivial phases. This behavior is characterized by the appearance of zero-energy modes and changes in the $Z_2$ topological quantum number. As the SOC amplitude decreases, the number of TAI phases increases, a feature that is closely related to the fractal structure of the energy spectrum induced by Fibonacci modulation. In contrast to conventional TAI phases with fully localized eigenstates, the wave functions in the Fibonacci-modulated TAI phases display multifractal properties. This model can be experimentally realized using a Bose-Einstein condensate in a momentum-space lattice, where its topological transitions and multifractal features can be explored through quench dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17290v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of color centers in silicon enables scalable quantum technologies by combining telecom-wavelength emission and compatibility with mature silicon fabrication. However, large-scale integration requires precise control of each emitter's optical transition to generate indistinguishable photons for quantum networking. Here, we demonstrate a foundry-fabricated photonic integrated circuit (PIC) combining suspended silicon waveguides with a microelectromechanical (MEMS) cantilever to apply local strain and spectrally tune individual G-centers. Applying up to 35 V between the cantilever and the substrate induces a reversible wavelength shift of the zero-phonon line exceeding 100 pm, with no loss in brightness. Moreover, by modeling the strain-induced shifts with a digital twin physical model, we achieve vertical localization of color centers with sub-3 nm vertical resolution, directly correlating their spatial position, dipole orientation, and spectral behavior. This method enables on-demand, low-power control of emission spectrum and nanoscale localization of color centers, advancing quantum networks on a foundry-compatible platform.</description>

Abstract: Ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices offer pristine realizations of Hubbard models, which are fundamental to modern condensed matter physics. Despite significant advancements, the accessible temperatures in these optical lattice material analogs are still too high to address many open problems. Here, we demonstrate a several-fold reduction in temperature, bringing large-scale quantum simulations of the Hubbard model into an entirely new regime. This is accomplished by transforming a low entropy product state into strongly-correlated states of interest via dynamic control of the model parameters, which is extremely challenging to simulate classically. At half filling, the long-range antiferromagnetic order is close to saturated, leading to a temperature of $T/t=0.05_{-0.05}^{0.06}$ based on comparisons to numerically exact simulations. Doped away from half-filling, it is exceedingly challenging to realize systematically accurate and predictive numerical simulations. Importantly, we are able to use quantum simulation to identify a new pathway for achieving similarly low temperatures with doping. This is confirmed by comparing short-range spin correlations to state-of-the-art, but approximate, constrained-path auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Compared to the cuprates, the reported temperatures correspond to a reduction from far above to below room temperature, where physics such as the pseudogap and stripe phases may be expected. Our work opens the door to quantum simulations that solve open questions in material science, develop synergies with numerical methods and theoretical studies, and lead to discoveries of new physics.</description>

      <title>Velocity correlations of vortices and rarefaction pulses in compressible planar quantum fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a quantitative analytical framework for calculating two-point velocity correlations in compressible quantum fluids, focusing on two key classes of superfluid excitations: vortices and rarefaction pulses. We employ two complementary approaches. First, we introduce a new ansatz for vortex cores in planar quantum fluids that enhances analytic integrability. This ansatz yields closed-form expressions for power spectra and velocity correlations for general vortex distributions. Using it, we identify distinct signatures of short- and long-range velocity correlations corresponding to vortex dipoles and vortex pairs, respectively. Second, we analyze the fast rarefaction pulse regime of the Jones-Roberts soliton. By applying the asymptotic high-velocity wavefunction, we derive analytic expressions for the velocity power spectrum and correlation function, capturing the soliton characteristic length scale. We validate our analytical results for the homogeneous system against numerical treatment of a large trapped system, finding close quantitative agreement. Our findings provide the first analytic treatment of velocity correlations for Jones-Roberts solitons in quantum fluids of light [M. Baker-Rasooli et al., Physical Review Letters, 134, 233401 (2025)], and establish a foundation for characterizing vortices and solitons in compressible quantum fluids.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement of fermionic symmetry-enriched quantum critical points in one dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement can be an effective diagnostic tool for probing topological phases protected by global symmetries. Recently, the notion of nontrivial topology in critical systems has been proposed and is attracting growing attention. In this work, as a concrete example, we explore the quantum entanglement properties of fermionic symmetry-enriched quantum critical points by constructing exactly solvable models based on stacked multiple Kitaev chains. We first analytically establish the global phase diagram using entanglement entropy and reveal three topologically distinct gapped phases with different winding numbers, along with three topologically distinct transition lines separating them. Importantly, we unambiguously demonstrate that two transition lines exhibit fundamentally different topological properties despite sharing the same central charge. Specifically, they display nontrivial topological degeneracy in the entanglement spectrum under periodic boundary conditions, thereby generalizing the Li-Haldane bulk-boundary correspondence to a broader class of fermionic symmetry-enriched criticality. Additionally, we identify a novel Lifshitz multicritical point at the intersection of the three transition lines, which also exhibits nontrivial topological degeneracy. This work provides a valuable reference for investigating gapless topological phases of matter from the perspective of quantum entanglement.</description>

      <title>Synthetic and cosmological axion hybridization: entangled photons, (HBT) and quantum beats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article it is argued that synthetic axions, emergent collective excitations in topological insulators or Weyl semimetals hybridize with the cosmological axion, a compelling dark matter candidate via a common two photon decay channel since they both couple to electromagnetic fields via a Chern-Simons term. We point out an analogy to a V-type three level system with the two upper levels identified with the synthetic and cosmological axions decaying into a two-photon state. The Weisskopf-Wigner theory of spontaneous decay in multi level atoms is complemented and extended to describe the dynamics of hybridization. The final two-photon state features both kinematic and polarization entanglement and displays quantum beats as a consequence of the interference between the decay paths. An initial population of either axion induces a population of the other via hybridization. Consequently, a dark matter axion condensate induces a condensate of the synthetic axion, albeit with small amplitude. We obtain a momentum and polarization resolved Hanbury- Brown Twiss (HBT) second order coherence describing coincident correlated two-photon detection. It exhibits quantum beats with a frequency given by the difference between the energies of the synthetic and cosmological axion and \emph{perhaps may be harnessed} to detect either type of axion excitations. The case of synthetic axions individually is obtained in the limit of vanishing coupling of the cosmological axion and features similar two-photon correlations. Hence second order (HBT) two-photon coherence \emph{may} provide an alternative detection mechanism for emergent condensed matter axionic collective excitations. Similarities and differences with parametrically down converted photons are discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement Generation in the Heterometallic Ni$^\text{2+}_4$Gd$_4^\text{3+}$ Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate various types of quantum entanglement in the octanuclear heterometallic $3d/4f$ complexes denoted as Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ under an external magnetic field, using the exact diagonalization approach. These molecular magnets, which can be effectively described by Heisenberg spin models, consist of two identical $\{\text{Ni}^{2+}_2\text{Gd}^{3+}_2\}$ cubane subunits bridged by acetate and hydroxide ligands. Our analysis reveals that their magnetization exhibits intermediate plateaus at low temperatures, indicating distinct ground states characteristic of Ni-containing compounds. Using negativity as a measure of quantum entanglement, we examine the influence of single-ion anisotropy and magnetic field on tetrapartite, bipartite, 1$-$3 tangle, and 2$-$2 tangle entanglements in two families of Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ complexes: $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ without anisotropy and $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ with anisotropy. Complex $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ exhibits strong bipartite entanglement between Ni ions, which persists up to $T \approx 3.0\,\text{K}$ and $B \approx 4.0\,\text{T}$, but shows significantly weaker tetrapartite entanglement and vanishing bipartite entanglement between Gd$\cdots$Gd and Ni$\cdots$Gd pairs. In contrast, complex $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ displays nonzero and sizable values for all types of entanglement considered. These findings emphasis the crucial role of single-ion anisotropy in generating and shaping the entanglement landscape of heterometallic Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ complexes. Notably, we find that the 1$-$3 tangle entanglement between a Ni ion and the remaining sites in a cubane unit serves as a reliable indicator of ground-state phase transitions, exhibiting distinct changes across phase boundaries irrespective of the presence of single-ion anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Quantum Signatures of Chaos from Free Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20338v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A classical dynamical system can be viewed as a probability space equipped with a measure-preserving time evolution map, admitting a purely algebraic formulation in terms of the algebra of bounded functions on the phase space. Similarly, a quantum dynamical system can be formulated using an algebra of bounded operators in a non-commutative probability space equipped with a time evolution map. Chaos, in either setting, can be characterized by statistical independence between observables at $ t = 0 $ and $ t \to \infty $, leading to the vanishing of cumulants involving these observables. In the quantum case, the notion of independence is replaced by free independence, which only emerges in the thermodynamic limit (asymptotic freeness). In this work, we propose a definition of quantum chaos based on asymptotic freeness and investigate its emergence in quantum many-body systems including the mixed-field Ising model with a random magnetic field, a higher spin version of the same model, and the SYK model. The hallmark of asymptotic freeness is the emergence of the free convolution prediction for the spectrum of operators of the form $ A(0) + B(t) $, implying the vanishing of all free cumulants between $A(0)$ and $B(t)$ in the thermodynamic limit for an infinite-temperature thermal state. We systematically investigate the spectral properties of $ A(0) + B(t) $ in the above-mentioned models, show that fluctuations on top of the free convolution prediction follow universal Wigner-Dyson statistics, and discuss the connection with quantum chaos. Finally, we argue that free probability theory provides a rigorous framework for understanding quantum chaos, offering a unifying perspective that connects many different manifestations of it.</description>

      <title>Topological properties of curved spacetime Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, a prime example of a one-dimensional topologically nontrivial insulator, has been extensively studied in flat space-time. In recent times, many studies have been conducted to understand the properties of the low-dimensional quantum matter in curved spacetime, which can mimic the gravitational event horizon and black hole physics. However, the impact of curved spacetime on the topological properties of such systems remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the curved spacetime (CST) version of the SSH model by introducing a position-dependent hopping parameter. We show, using different topological markers, that the CST-SSH model can undergo a topological phase transition. We find that the topologically non-trivial phase can host zero-energy edge modes, but those edge modes are asymmetric, unlike the usual SSH model. Moreover, we find that at the topological transition point, a critical slowdown takes place for zero-energy wave packets near the boundary, indicating the presence of a horizon, and interestingly, if one moves even a slight distance away from the transition point, wave packets start bouncing back and reverse direction before reaching the horizon. An extended version of the CST-SSH model, which supports distinct topological phases characterized by higher winding numbers, has also been studied. We show that a similar critical slowdown of wave packets near the boundary occurs at all topological transition points between any two distinct phases. A semiclassical description of the wave packet trajectories also supports these results.</description>

      <title>Systematic construction of asymptotic quantum many-body scar states and their relation to supersymmetric quantum mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04853v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic method for constructing asymptotic quantum many-body scar (AQMBS) states. While AQMBS states are closely related to quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states, they exhibit key differences. Unlike QMBS states, AQMBS states are not energy eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, making their construction more challenging. We demonstrate that, under appropriate conditions, AQMBS states can be obtained as low-lying gapless excited states of a parent Hamiltonian, which has a QMBS state as its ground state. Furthermore, our formalism reveals a connection between QMBS and supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics. The QMBS state can be interpreted as a SUSY-unbroken ground state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reinterpret Starobinsky's stochastic inflation as an open quantum system, where short-wavelength modes act as the environment for long-wavelength modes. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we systematically trace out the environment and derive an effective theory for the reduced density matrix, including deviations from exact de Sitter. The resulting master equation is a Lindblad equation, which reduces to a Fokker-Planck equation for the diagonal elements up to higher orders in the slow-roll expansion, while also yielding a more complete equation in phase space. Finally, we extend the formalism to global de Sitter, for which the associated Fokker-Planck equation lacks equilibrium solutions until the late-time regime $aH \gg 1$.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Zeeman Splitting and Tunnel Coupling in Coherent Spin Qubit Shuttling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin shuttling offers a promising approach for developing scalable silicon-based quantum processors by addressing the connectivity limitations of quantum dots (QDs). In this work, we demonstrate high-fidelity bucket-brigade (BB) spin shuttling in a silicon MOS device, utilizing Pauli Spin Blockade (PSB) readout. We achieve an average shuttling fidelity of \SI{99.8}{\percent}. The residual shuttling error is highly sensitive to the ratio between interdot tunnel coupling and Zeeman splitting, with tuning of these parameters enabling up to a twenty-fold variation in error rate. An appropriate four-level Hamiltonian model supports our findings. These results provide valuable insights for optimizing high-performance spin shuttling systems in future quantum architectures.</description>

      <title>Continuous topological phase transition between $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation remain poorly understood. A notable example is the transition between the toric code (TC) and double semion (DS) phases, which has two distinct $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders in (2 + 1)D. Previous studies reveal that the transition between them can be either first order or via an intermediate phase, thus the existence of a directly continuous transition between them remains a long-standing problem. Motivated by the fact that both phases can arise from condensing distinct anyons in the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological order, we introduce a perturbed $\mathbb{Z}_4$ quantum double (QD) model to study the TC-DS transition. We confirm the existence of a continuous (2 + 1)D XY* transition between the TC and DS phases by mapping it to a two-coupled quantum Ising model. Importantly, using the condensation order parameters and the area law coefficients of the Wilson loops, we further reveal that $\mathbb{Z}_4$ anyons, fractionalized from the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders, become deconfined at the transition between $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases. Our results open a path toward developing a theoretical framework for topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation.</description>
