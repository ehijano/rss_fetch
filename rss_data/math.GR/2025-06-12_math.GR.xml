      <title>Groups represented by incidence geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to use the framework of incidence geometry to develop a theory that permits to model both the inner and outer automorphisms of a group G simultaneously. More precisely, to any group G, we attempt to associate an incidence system whose group of type-preserving automorphisms is Inn(G), the group of inner automorphisms of G, and whose full group of automorphisms is the group Out(G) of outer automorphisms of G, getting what we call an incidence geometric representation theory for groups. Hence, in this setting, the group Inn(G) preserves the types of the associated incidence structure while the group Out(G) is acting non-trivially on the typeset of it, realizing the outer automorphisms of G as correlations. We give examples of incidence geometric representations for the dihedral groups, the symmetric groups, the automorphism groups of the five platonic solids, families of classical groups defined over fields such as the projective linear groups, and finally subgroups of free groups whose outer automorphism group is the largest finite subgroup of their automorphism group.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic and cohomological dimension of surface braid groups and poly-surface groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we compute the asymptotic dimension of all surface braid groups, including those associated to non-orientable and infinite-type surfaces, as well as for torsion-free surface groups that are poly-finitely generated. Moreover, we show that in these two classes of groups, the virtual cohomological dimension and the asymptotic dimension coincide. For poly-finitely generated surface groups and braid groups of finite-type surfaces, these results are based on showing that they are virtual duality groups in the sense of Bieri and Eckmann and, for braid groups of infinite-type surfaces the argument relies on the observation that these groups are countable and normally poly-free.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is an expository article on visual metrics on boundaries of hyperbolic metric spaces. We discuss the construction of visual metrics, quasisymmetries and their invariants, Hausdorff and conformal dimension, and constructions and applications of Gromov's round trees. There is a focus on providing examples throughout. These notes are based on the material of a minicourse given by the author at the 2024 Riverside Workshop in Geometric Group Theory.</description>

      <title>Structural Properties and Adjacency Spectrum of Coprime Graph of Integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $TCG_n$ denote the coprime graph having vertex set $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ with any two vertices $i,j$ being adjacent if and only if $\gcd(i,j)=1$. In this article, we first study some structural properties of $TCG_n$. We study the vertex connectivity and crossing number of the coprime graph of integers. We discover a lower constraint on the multiplicity of $-1$, which appears as an eigenvalue in the adjacency matrix of $TCG_n$. We demonstrate our findings with a variety of cases. We also show that the adjacency matrix of $TCG_n$ is singular, i.e. has determinant $0$. Furthermore, we give a lower bound on the multiplicity of $0$, which appears as an eigenvalue in the adjacency matrix of $TCG_n$. Finally, we establish that the greatest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of $TCG_n$ is always above $2.$</description>

      <title>An $O(n$)-Algorithm for the Higher-Order Kinematics and Inverse Dynamics of Serial Manipulators using Spatial Representation of Twists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal control in general, and flatness-based control in particular, of robotic arms necessitate to compute the first and second time derivatives of the joint torques/forces required to achieve a desired motion. In view of the required computational efficiency, recursive $O(n)$-algorithms were proposed to this end. Aiming at compact yet efficient formulations, a Lie group formulation was recently proposed, making use of body-fixed and hybrid representation of twists and wrenches. In this paper a formulation is introduced using the spatial representation. The second-order inverse dynamics algorithm is accompanied by a fourth-order forward and inverse kinematics algorithm. An advantage of all Lie group formulations is that they can be parameterized in terms of vectorial quantities that are readily available. The method is demonstrated for the 7 DOF Franka Emika Panda robot.</description>

      <title>The maximal subgroups of the Monster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14646v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classification of the maximal subgroups of the Monster $\mathbf{M}$ is a long-standing problem in finite group theory. According to the literature, the classification is complete apart from the question of whether $\mathbf{M}$ contains maximal subgroups that are almost simple with socle $\mathrm{PSL}_2(13)$. However, this conclusion relies on reported claims, with unpublished proofs, that $\mathbf{M}$ has no maximal subgroups that are almost simple with socle $\mathrm{PSL}_2(8)$, $\mathrm{PSL}_2(16)$, or $\mathrm{PSU}_3(4)$. The aim of this paper is to settle all of these questions, and thereby complete the solution to the maximal subgroup problem for $\mathbf{M}$, and for the sporadic simple groups as a whole. Specifically, we prove the existence of two new maximal subgroups of $\mathbf{M}$, isomorphic to the automorphism groups of $\mathrm{PSL}_2(13)$ and $\mathrm{PSU}_3(4)$, and we establish that $\mathbf{M}$ has no almost simple maximal subgroup with socle $\mathrm{PSL}_2(8)$ or $\mathrm{PSL}_2(16)$. We also correct the claim that $\mathbf{M}$ has no almost simple maximal subgroup with socle $\mathrm{PSU}_3(4)$, and provide evidence that the maximal subgroup $\mathrm{PSL}_2(59)$ (constructed in 2004) does not exist. Our proofs are supported by reproducible computations carried out using the publicly available Python package mmgroup for computing with $\mathbf{M}$ recently developed by M. Seysen. We provide explicit generators for our newly discovered maximal subgroups of $\mathbf{M}$ in mmgroup format.</description>

      <title>New classes of IYB groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is proven that every finite group of odd order with all Sylow subgroups of nilpotency class at most two is an involutive Yang-Baxter group (IYB group for short), i.e. it admits a structure of left brace. It is also proven that every finite solvable group of even order with all Sylow subgroups of nilpotency class at most two and abelian Sylow 2-subgroups is an IYB group. These results contribute to the open problem asking which finite solvable groups are IYB, in particular they generalize a result of Ben David and Ginosar concerned with finite solvable groups with abelian Sylow subgroups. With the same techniques it is proven that every finite solvable group with all Sylow subgroups nilpotent of class at most two is isomorphic to the multiplicative group of a skew left brace of nilpotent type. It is also proven that every finite group with the Sylow tower property is isomorphic to the multiplicative group of a skew left brace of nilpotent type.</description>

      <title>On products of abelian skew braces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to study factorisations of skew left braces through abelian subbraces. We prove a skew brace theoretical analog of the classical It\^o's theorem about product of two abelian groups: if $B = A_1A_2$ is a skew brace which is the product of two abelian skew subbraces $A_1$ and $A_2$, and $A_1$ is a left and right ideal of $B$, then the commutator ideal $[B, B]^B$ of $B$ is an abelian brace. If $A_1$ is a left (non-necessarily right) ideal of $B$, we show that there exists a strong left ideal of $B$ contained in $A_1$ or $A_2$. We also show factorisations of relevant ideals of factorised braces that are sums and products of abelian subbraces.</description>

      <title>Cocompact Fuchsian groups with a modular embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Fuchsian group $\Gamma$ has a modular embedding if its adjoint trace field is a totally real number field and every unbounded Galois conjugate $\Gamma^\sigma$ comes equipped with a holomorphic (or conjugate holomorphic) map ${\phi^\sigma : \mathbb{B}^1 \to \mathbb{B}^1}$ intertwining the actions of $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma^\sigma$ on the Poincar\'e disk $\mathbb{B}^1$. This paper provides the first cocompact nonarithmetic Fuchsian groups with a modular embedding that are not commensurable with a triangle group. The main result, proved using period domains, is that any immersed totally geodesic complex curve on a complex hyperbolic $2$-orbifold has a modular embedding. Another consequence is that there are infinitely many signatures for which no finite-volume quotient of $\mathbb{B}^1$ with that signature can be an immersed totally geodesic curve on a complex hyperbolic $2$-orbifold.</description>

      <title>Amenability of group actions on compact spaces and the associated Banach algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The amenability of group actions on topological spaces generalizes amenability of groups and has applications in group theory, such as characterizing $C^{*}$--exact groups. We characterized it in terms of Banach algebras. For a topological group $G$ , group amenability can be characterized through the amenability of the convolution Banach algebra $L^1(G)$. Here a Banach algebra $A$ is called amenable if all derivations from $A$ to any dual--type $A$--$A$--Banach bimodules are inner. We extended this result to discrete group actions on compact Hausdorff spaces, using a certain Banach algebra arising from the action and a weakened amenability condition of Banach algebras. We also proved a fixed point characterization of amenable actions, which improves the result by Dong and Wang (2015).</description>
