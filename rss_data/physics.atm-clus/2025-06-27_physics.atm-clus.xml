      <title>Stern-Gerlach deflection of cryogenically cold polyatomic molecules in superfluid nanodroplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beam deflection is capable of providing valuable information about the magnetic moments of molecules and clusters as well as the relaxation dynamics of their spins. However, observations have been hampered by magnetic couplings to excited vibrational and rotational states of polyatomic systems, which are challenging to control, characterize, and systematize. In this work, we carried out deflection measurements on superfluid helium nanodroplets doped with high-spin FeCl2 and CoCl2 molecules and their complexes. This enabled quantitative determination of the magnetic moments of molecules and clusters at extremely low, and fully defined, temperature of all of their degrees of freedom. The spin magnetic moments become thermalized and oriented along the applied field. Dimers and trimers are found to be antiferromagnetically ordered. The issue of rates and mechanisms of molecular spin relaxation within the cryogenic helium matrix is highlighted.</description>

      <title>Near-surface Defects Break Symmetry in Water Adsorption on CeO$_{2-x}$(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water interactions with oxygen-deficient cerium dioxide (CeO$_2$) surfaces are central to hydrogen production and catalytic redox reactions, but the atomic-scale details of how defects influence adsorption and reactivity remain elusive. Here, we unveil how water adsorbs on partially reduced CeO$_{2-x}$(111) using atomic force microscopy (AFM) with chemically sensitive, oxygen-terminated probes, combined with first-principles calculations. Our AFM imaging reveals water molecules as sharp, asymmetric boomerang-like features radically departing from the symmetric triangular motifs previously attributed to molecular water. Strikingly, these features localize near subsurface defects. While the experiments are carried out at cryogenic temperature, water was dosed at room temperature, capturing configurations relevant to initial adsorption events in catalytic processes. Density functional theory identifies Ce$^{3+}$ sites adjacent to subsurface vacancies as the thermodynamically favored adsorption sites, where defect-induced symmetry breaking governs water orientation. Force spectroscopy and simulations further distinguish Ce$^{3+}$ from Ce$^{4+}$ centers through their unique interaction signatures. By resolving how subsurface defects control water adsorption at the atomic scale, this work demonstrates the power of chemically selective AFM for probing site-specific reactivity in oxide catalysts, laying the groundwork for direct investigations of complex systems such as single-atom catalysts, metal-support interfaces, and defect-engineered oxides.</description>

      <title>Probing valence electron and hydrogen dynamics using charge-pair imaging with ultrafast electron diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in ultrafast science has been to directly track the coupled motions of electrons and nuclei in real-space and real-time. This study presents a significant step towards this goal by demonstrating the feasibility of time-resolved real-space tracking of valence electron and hydrogen dynamics during the photodissociation of ammonia (NH3) using MeV ultrafast electron diffraction. It is demonstrated that the enhanced temporal resolution, in conjunction with the analysis of the charge-pair distribution function, enables the disentanglement of the correlated motion of valence electrons and hydrogens in photoexcited ammonia molecule. The methodology employed in this study, which utilizes the charge-pair distribution function from ultrafast electron scattering to retrieve intertwined electron and nucleus dynamics, may open up new opportunities in the study of quantum dynamics for a wide range of molecules.</description>

      <title>On the rank-reduced relativistic coupled cluster method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An efficiency of the Tucker decomposition of amplitude tensors within the single-reference relativistic coupled cluster method with single and double excitations (RCCSD) was studied in a series of benchmark calculations for (AuCl)$_n$ chains, Au$_n$ clusters, and the cluster model of solid YbCl$_2$. The 1 kJ/mol level of accuracy for correlation energy estimates of moderate-size systems and typical reaction energies can be achieved with relatively high compression rates of amplitude tensors via rejecting singular values smaller than $\sim 10^{-4}$. For the most extensive system studied (YbCl$_7$ cluster used for modeling of ytterbium center in ytterbium dichloride crystal), only $\sim 3$% of compressed doubles amplitudes were shown to be significant. Thus, the rank reduction for the relativistic CCSD theory improving its computational scaling is feasible. The advantage (if not necessity) of using the Goldstone diagrammatic technique rather than the "antisymmetrized" Brandow one is underlined. The proposed approach is promising for high-precision modeling of relatively large systems with heavy atoms.</description>

      <title>Correlated reaction coordinate motion produces non-additive rate enhancement for electron and energy transfer in multi-acceptor structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular structures with multiple donor, bridge, or acceptor units can display quantum interference effects that influence electron and energy transfer (ET and EnT) rates. Recent experiments found a 4- to 5-fold increase in ET rates for donor-acceptor structures with two acceptors compared to one. This result is surprising: simple classical or quantum analysis suggests a factor of two rate enhancement. We analyze the coupling interactions in multiple acceptor systems and find that rate enhancements beyond additive effects arise from acceptor-acceptor interactions that: 1) shift the reaction free energy, 2) change the donor-acceptor couplings, and 3) alter the reaction-coordinate motion. Consideration of these effects explains the observed rates in multi-acceptor systems and suggests strategies to tailor energy and electron transfer kinetics.</description>

      <title>Taylor-mode automatic differentiation for constructing molecular rovibrational Hamiltonian operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an automated framework for constructing Taylor series expansions of rovibrational kinetic and potential energy operators for arbitrary molecules, internal coordinate systems, and molecular frame embedding conditions. Expressing operators in a sum-of-products form allows for computationally efficient evaluations of matrix elements in product basis sets. Our approach uses automatic differentiation tools from the Python machine learning ecosystem, particularly the JAX library, to efficiently and accurately generate high-order Taylor expansions of rovibrational operators. The implementation is available at https://github.com/robochimps/vibrojet.</description>
