      <title>Observation of Critical Scaling in Spin Glasses below Tc using the Thermoremanent Magnetization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-dependent Thermoremanent Magnetization (TRM) studies have been instrumental in probing energy dynamics within the spin glass phase. In this paper, we will review the evolution of the TRM experiment over the last half century and discuss some aspects related to how it has been employed in the understanding of spin glasses. We will also report on recent experiments using high resolution DC SQUID magnetometry to probe the TRM at temperatures less than but near to the transition temperature Tc. These experiments have been performed as a function of waiting time, temperature, and five different magnetic fields. We find that as the transition temperature is approached from below, the characteristic time scale of the TRM is suppressed up to several orders of magnitude in time. In the highest temperature region, we find that the waiting time effect goes away, and a waiting time independent crossover line is reached. We also find that increasing the magnetic field, further suppresses the crossover line. Using a first principles energy argument across the crossover line, we derive an equation that is an excellent fit to the crossover lines for all magnetic fields probed. The data show strong evidence for an H = 0 Oe phase transition.</description>

      <title>Biased Degenerate Ground-State Sampling of Small Ising Models with Converged QAOA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz, a generalization of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), is a quantum algorithm used for approximately solving combinatorial optimization problems. QAOA typically uses the Transverse field mixer as the driving Hamiltonian. One of the interesting properties of the Transverse-field driving Hamiltonian is that it results in non-uniform sampling of degenerate ground states of optimization problems. In this study we numerically examine the fair sampling properties transverse field mixer QAOA, and Grover Mixer QAOA (GM-QAOA) which provides theoretical guarantees of fair sampling of degenerate optimal solutions, up to large enough p such that the mean expectation value converges to an optimal approximation ratio of 1. This comparison is performed with high quality heuristically computed, but not necessarily optimal, QAOA angles which give strictly monotonically improving solution quality as p increases. These angles are computed using the Julia based numerical simulation software JuliQAOA. Fair sampling of degenerate ground-states is quantified using Shannon entropy of the ground-state amplitudes distribution. The fair sampling properties are reported on several quantum signature Hamiltonians from previous quantum annealing fair sampling studies. Small random fully connected spin glasses are shown which exhibit exponential suppression of some degenerate ground-states with transverse field mixer QAOA. The transverse field mixer QAOA simulations show that some problem instances clearly saturate the Shannon entropy of 0 with a maximally biased distribution that occurs when the learning converges to an approximation ratio of 1 while other problem instances never deviate from a maximum Shannon entropy (uniform distribution) at any p step.</description>

      <title>Learning the rules of peptide self-assembly through data mining with large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Peptides are ubiquitous and important biologically derived molecules, that have been found to self-assemble to form a wide array of structures. Extensive research has explored the impacts of both internal chemical composition and external environmental stimuli on the self-assembly behaviour of these systems. However, there is yet to be a systematic study that gathers this rich literature data and collectively examines these experimental factors to provide a global picture of the fundamental rules that govern protein self-assembly behavior. In this work, we curate a peptide assembly database through a combination of manual processing by human experts and literature mining facilitated by a large language model. As a result, we collect more than 1,000 experimental data entries with information about peptide sequence, experimental conditions and corresponding self-assembly phases. Utilizing the collected data, ML models are trained and evaluated, demonstrating excellent accuracy (&gt;80\%) and efficiency in peptide assembly phase classification. Moreover, we fine-tune our GPT model for peptide literature mining with the developed dataset, which exhibits markedly superior performance in extracting information from academic publications relative to the pre-trained model. We find that this workflow can substantially improve efficiency when exploring potential self-assembling peptide candidates, through guiding experimental work, while also deepening our understanding of the mechanisms governing peptide self-assembly. In doing so, novel structures can be accessed for a range of applications including sensing, catalysis and biomaterials.</description>

      <title>Bayesian exploration of the composition space of CuZrAl metallic glasses for mechanical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing metallic glasses in silico is a major challenge in materials science given their disordered atomic structure and the vast compositional space to explore. Here, we tackle this challenge by finding optimal compositions for target mechanical properties. We apply Bayesian exploration for the CuZrAl composition, a paradigmatic metallic glass known for its good glass forming ability. We exploit an automated loop with an online database, a Bayesian optimization algorithm, and molecular dynamics simulations. From the ubiquitous 50/50 CuZr starting point, we map the composition landscape changing the ratio of elements and adding aluminium to characterize the yield stress and the shear modulus. This approach demonstrates with relatively modest effort that the system has an optimal composition window for the yield stress around aluminium concentration $c_{\rm Al} = 15$ \% and zirconium concentration $c_{\rm Zr} = 30$ %. We also explore several cooling rates ("process parameters") and find that the best mechanical properties for a composition result from being most affected by the cooling procedure. Our Bayesian approach paves the novel way for the design of metallic glasses with "small data", with an eye toward both future in silico design and experimental applications exploiting this toolbox.</description>

      <title>Phases of decodability in the surface code with unitary errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The maximum likelihood (ML) decoder in the two-dimensional surface code with generic unitary errors is governed by a statistical mechanics model with complex weights, which can be simulated via (1+1)D transfer matrix contraction. Information loss with an increasing error rate manifests as a ferromagnetic-to-paramagnetic transition in the contraction dynamics. In this work, we establish entanglement as a separate obstruction to decoding; it can undergo a transition from area- to volume-law scaling in the transfer matrix contraction with increasing unitary error rate. In particular, the volume-law entanglement can coexist with ferromagnetic order, giving rise to a phase in which the encoded information is retained yet is effectively undecodable. We numerically simulate the ML decoding in the surface code subject to both single- and two-qubit Pauli-X rotations and obtain a phase diagram that contains a ferromagnetic area-law, a paramagnetic volume-law, and a potential ferromagnetic volume-law phase. We further show that, starting from the paramagnetic volume-law phase, tilting the single-qubit rotation away from the X-axis couples the stat-mech models for X and Z errors and can lead to a ferromagnetic volume-law phase in which, although Z errors remain correctable, the encoded classical information is hard to recover. To perform numerical simulations, we develop an algorithm for syndrome sampling based on the isometric tensor network representation of the surface code.</description>

Abstract: Here we outline some new results for the GHWS model which points to a discretization of parameter space into well differentiated collective dynamic states. We argue this can lead to basic processes in parameter space, starting with minimum modelling ingredients: a complex network with a disorder parameter and an excitable dynamics (cellular automata) on it.</description>

      <title>Large time effective kinetics $\beta$-functions for quantum (2+p)-spin glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02602v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the quantum $(2+p)$-spin dynamics of a $N$-vector $\textbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^N$ through the lens of renormalization group (RG) theory. The RG is based on a coarse-graining over the eigenvalues of matrix-like disorder, viewed as an effective kinetic whose eigenvalue distribution undergoes a deterministic law in the large $N$ limit. We focus our investigation on perturbation theory and vertex expansion for effective average action, which proves more amenable than standard nonperturbative approaches due to the distinct non-local temporal and replicative structures that emerge in the effective interactions following disorder integration. Our work entails the formulation of rules to address these non-localities within the framework of perturbation theory, culminating in the derivation of one-loop $\beta$-functions. Our explicit calculations focus on the cases $p=3$, $p=\infty$, and additional analytic material is given in the appendix.</description>

      <title>Symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in symmetric random circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08459v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry, which serves as a diagnostic tool for symmetry breaking and a proxy for thermalization, has recently been proposed and studied in the context of symmetry restoration for quantum many-body systems undergoing a quench. In this Letter, we investigate symmetry restoration in various symmetric random quantum circuits, particularly focusing on the U(1) symmetry case. In contrast to non-symmetric random circuits where the U(1) symmetry of a small subsystem can always be restored at late times, we reveal that symmetry restoration can fail in U(1)-symmetric circuits for certain weak symmetry-broken initial states in finite-size systems. In the early-time dynamics, we observe an intriguing quantum Mpemba effect implying that symmetry is restored faster when the initial state is more asymmetric. Furthermore, we also investigate the entanglement asymmetry dynamics for SU(2) and $Z_{2}$ symmetric circuits and identify the presence and absence of the quantum Mpemba effect for the corresponding symmetries, respectively. A unified understanding of these results is provided through the lens of quantum thermalization with conserved charges.</description>

      <title>Superlattice induced electron percolation within a single Landau level</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum Hall effect in a single Landau level in the presence of a square superlattice of $\delta$-function potentials. The interplay between the superlattice spacing $a_s$ and the magnetic length $\ell_B$ in clean system leads to three interesting characteristic regimes corresponding to $a_s \lt \ell_B$, $a_s \gg \ell_B$ and the intermediate one where $a_s \sim \ell_B$ . In the intermediate regime, the continuous magnetic translation symmetry breaks down to discrete lattice symmetry. In contrast, we show that in the other two regimes, the same is hardly broken in the topological band despite the presence of the superlattice. In the presence of weak disorder (white-noise) one typically expects a tiny fraction of extended states due to topological protection of the Landau level. Interestingly, we obtain a large fraction of extended states throughout the intermediate regime which maximizes at the special point $a_s = \sqrt{2\pi} \ell_B$. We argue the superlattice induced percolation phenomenon requires both the breaking of the time reversal symmetry and the continuous magnetic translational symmetry. It could have a direct implication on the integer plateau transitions in both continuous quantum Hall systems and the lattice based anomalous quantum Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Cascade of phase transitions in the training of Energy-based models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14689v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the feature encoding process in a prototypical energy-based generative model, the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). We start with an analytical investigation using simplified architectures and data structures, and end with numerical analysis of real trainings on real datasets. Our study tracks the evolution of the model's weight matrix through its singular value decomposition, revealing a series of phase transitions associated to a progressive learning of the principal modes of the empirical probability distribution. The model first learns the center of mass of the modes and then progressively resolve all modes through a cascade of phase transitions. We first describe this process analytically in a controlled setup that allows us to study analytically the training dynamics. We then validate our theoretical results by training the Bernoulli-Bernoulli RBM on real data sets. By using data sets of increasing dimension, we show that learning indeed leads to sharp phase transitions in the high-dimensional limit. Moreover, we propose and test a mean-field finite-size scaling hypothesis. This shows that the first phase transition is in the same universality class of the one we studied analytically, and which is reminiscent of the mean-field paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are effective tools for modeling complex systems and deriving insights from data. However, training these models with highly structured data presents significant challenges due to the slow mixing characteristics of Markov Chain Monte Carlo processes. In this study, we build upon recent theoretical advancements in RBM training, to significantly reduce the computational cost of training (in very clustered datasets), evaluating and sampling in RBMs in general. The learning process is analogous to thermodynamic continuous phase transitions observed in ferromagnetic models, where new modes in the probability measure emerge in a continuous manner. Such continuous transitions are associated with the critical slowdown effect, which adversely affects the accuracy of gradient estimates, particularly during the initial stages of training with clustered data. To mitigate this issue, we propose a pre-training phase that encodes the principal components into a low-rank RBM through a convex optimization process. This approach enables efficient static Monte Carlo sampling and accurate computation of the partition function. We exploit the continuous and smooth nature of the parameter annealing trajectory to achieve reliable and computationally efficient log-likelihood estimations, enabling online assessment during the training, and propose a novel sampling strategy named parallel trajectory tempering (PTT) which outperforms previously optimized MCMC methods. Our results show that this training strategy enables RBMs to effectively address highly structured datasets that conventional methods struggle with. We also provide evidence that our log-likelihood estimation is more accurate than traditional, more computationally intensive approaches in controlled scenarios. The PTT algorithm significantly accelerates MCMC processes compared to existing and conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Bayesian RG Flow in Neural Network Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Neural Network Field Theory correspondence (NNFT) is a mapping from neural network (NN) architectures into the space of statistical field theories (SFTs). The Bayesian renormalization group (BRG) is an information-theoretic coarse graining scheme that generalizes the principles of the exact renormalization group (ERG) to arbitrarily parameterized probability distributions, including those of NNs. In BRG, coarse graining is performed in parameter space with respect to an information-theoretic distinguishability scale set by the Fisher information metric. In this paper, we unify NNFT and BRG to form a powerful new framework for exploring the space of NNs and SFTs, which we coin BRG-NNFT. With BRG-NNFT, NN training dynamics can be interpreted as inducing a flow in the space of SFTs from the information-theoretic `IR' $\rightarrow$ `UV'. Conversely, applying an information-shell coarse graining to the trained network's parameters induces a flow in the space of SFTs from the information-theoretic `UV' $\rightarrow$ `IR'. When the information-theoretic cutoff scale coincides with a standard momentum scale, BRG is equivalent to ERG. We demonstrate the BRG-NNFT correspondence on two analytically tractable examples. First, we construct BRG flows for trained, infinite-width NNs, of arbitrary depth, with generic activation functions. As a special case, we then restrict to architectures with a single infinitely-wide layer, scalar outputs, and generalized cos-net activations. In this case, we show that BRG coarse-graining corresponds exactly to the momentum-shell ERG flow of a free scalar SFT. Our analytic results are corroborated by a numerical experiment in which an ensemble of asymptotically wide NNs are trained and subsequently renormalized using an information-shell BRG scheme.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical study of interacting and disordered topological phases of coupled Kitaev wires, which may support further realistic applications of Majorana fermions. We develop a variety of analytical, mathematical and numerical methods for one and two-coupled wires, associated with a topological marker accessible from real-space correlation functions on the wire(s). We verify the stability of the topological superconducting phase and quantify disorder effects close to the quantum phase transitions, e.g. through two-point correlation functions or using a renormalization group (RG) analysis of disorder. We show for the first time that the double critical Ising (DCI) phase -- a fractional Majorana liquid characterized by a pair of half central charges and topological numbers -- is stabilized by strong interactions against disorder which respects the inversion symmetry between the wires (ie. parity conservation on each wire). In the presence of an inter-wire hopping term, the DCI phase turns into a protected topological phase with a bulk gap. We study the localization physics developing along the critical line for weaker interactions.</description>
