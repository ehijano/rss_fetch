      <title>Automatic detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment using high-dimensional acoustic features in spontaneous speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the TAUKADIAL challenge, focusing on the classification of speech from people with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and neurotypical controls. We conducted three experiments comparing five machine-learning methods: Random Forests, Sparse Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Sparse Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree, utilizing 1076 acoustic features automatically extracted using openSMILE. In Experiment 1, the entire dataset was used to train a language-agnostic model. Experiment 2 introduced a language detection step, leading to separate model training for each language. Experiment 3 further enhanced the language-agnostic model from Experiment 1, with a specific focus on evaluating the robustness of the models using out-of-sample test data. Across all three experiments, results consistently favored models capable of handling high-dimensional data, such as Random Forest and Sparse Logistic Regression, in classifying speech from MCI and controls.</description>

      <title>Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation for Enhancing Remote Pilot Training and Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of the drone industry, particularly in the use of small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), requires the development of advanced training protocols for remote pilots. Remote pilots must develop a combination of technical and cognitive skills to manage the complexities of modern drone operations. This paper explores the integration of neurotechnology, specifically auricular vagus nerve stimulation (aVNS), as a method to enhance remote pilot training and performance. The scientific literature shows aVNS can safely improve cognitive functions such as attention, learning, and memory. It has also been shown useful to manage stress responses. For safe and efficient sUAS/UAV operation, it is essential for pilots to maintain high levels of vigilance and decision-making under pressure. By modulating sympathetic stress and cortical arousal, aVNS can prime cognitive faculties before training, help maintain focus during training and improve stress recovery post-training. Furthermore, aVNS has demonstrated the potential to enhance multitasking and cognitive control. This may help remote pilots during complex sUAS operations by potentially reducing the risk of impulsive decision-making or cognitive errors. This paper advocates for the inclusion of aVNS in remote pilot training programs by proposing that it can provide significant benefits in improving cognitive readiness, skill and knowledge acquisition, as well as operational safety and efficiency. Future research should focus on optimizing aVNS protocols for drone pilots while assessing long-term benefits to industrial safety and workforce readiness in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>A cycle with a "short" period in the phenomenological model of a single neuron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the relay version of the generalized Hutchinson's equation as a phenomenological model of an isolated neuron. After an exponential substitution, the equation takes the form of a differential-difference equation with a piecewise-constant right-hand side. In the work of A. Yu. Kolesov and others, this equation was studied with a negative continuous initial function, and the existence and orbital stability of a periodic solution with a period longer than the delay were proven. In the present work, all possible solutions with continuous on the interval of the delay length initial functions, containing no more than two zeros, are constructed. It is proven that the equation has a periodically unstable solution, the period of which is shorter than the delay.</description>

      <title>Desynchronization Index: a New Approach for Exploring Complex Epileptogenic Networks in Stereoelectroencephalography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) is an invasive surgical procedure to record the electrical activities in cortical brain regions, aiming at identifying the Epileptogenic Zone (EZ) in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. To improve the accuracy of the EZ definition, SEEG analysis can be supported by computational tools, among which the Epileptogenic Index (EI) represents the most common solution. However, the scientific community has still not found an agreement on which quantitative biomarkers can characterize the cortical sites within the EZ. In this work, we design a new algorithm, named Desynchronization Index (DI), to assist neurophysiologists in SEEG interpretation. Our algorithm estimates the effective connectivity between cortical sites and hypothesizes that the EZ is identified by those sites getting abnormally desynchronized from the network during the seizure generation. We test the proposed method over a SEEG dataset of 10 seizures, comparing its accuracy in terms of EZ definition against the EI algorithm and clinical ground truth. Our results indicate that the DI algorithm underscores specific connectivity dynamics that can hardly be identified with a pure visual analysis, increasing sensitivity in detecting epileptogenic cortical sites.</description>

      <title>Predictability maximization and the origins of word order harmony</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the linguistic problem of the sequential arrangement of a head and its dependents from an information theoretic perspective. In particular, we consider the optimal placement of a head that maximizes the predictability of the sequence. We assume that dependents are statistically independent given a head, in line with the open-choice principle and the core assumptions of dependency grammar. We demonstrate the optimality of harmonic order, i.e., placing the head last maximizes the predictability of the head whereas placing the head first maximizes the predictability of dependents. We also show that postponing the head is the optimal strategy to maximize its predictability while bringing it forward is the optimal strategy to maximize the predictability of dependents. We unravel the advantages of the strategy of maximizing the predictability of the head over maximizing the predictability of dependents. Our findings shed light on the placements of the head adopted by real languages or emerging in different kinds of experiments.</description>

      <title>FAST functional connectivity implicates P300 connectivity in working memory deficits in Alzheimer's disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring transient functional connectivity is an important challenge in Electroencephalogram (EEG) research. Here, the rich potential for insightful, discriminative information of brain activity offered by high temporal resolution is confounded by the inherent noise of the medium and the spurious nature of correlations computed over short temporal windows. We propose a novel methodology to overcome these problems called Filter Average Short-Term (FAST) functional connectivity. First, long-term, stable, functional connectivity is averaged across an entire study cohort for a given pair of Visual Short Term Memory (VSTM) tasks. The resulting average connectivity matrix, containing information on the strongest general connections for the tasks, is used as a filter to analyse the transient high temporal resolution functional connectivity of individual subjects. In simulations, we show that this method accurately discriminates differences in noisy Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) between two conditions where standard connectivity and other comparable methods fail. We then apply this to analyse activity related to visual short-term memory binding deficits in two cohorts of familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Reproducible significant differences were found in the binding task with no significant difference in the shape task in the P300 ERP range. This allows new sensitive measurements of transient functional connectivity, which can be implemented to obtain results of clinical significance.</description>

      <title>An internal sensory model allows for balance control using muscle spindle exafferent acceleration feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00951v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All motor tasks with an approximately linear mechanical system (e.g., a freely standing person, a rider on a bicycle) allows for optimal control actions that are a simple linear combination of full state sensory feedback. When the sensory feedback is not full state (i.e., does not contain position and velocity information about all joints), optimal control for these systems is based on an internal dynamical system that estimates the states, and that can be implemented as a recurrent neural network (RNN) in the central nervous system (CNS). It uses a sensory model to update the state estimates with the available (non-full state) sensory feedback. The weights of this RNN are fully specified by results from optimal feedback control. This is highly relevant for all sensory systems that do not provide full state feedback, and especially for muscle spindle primary afferents under well-coordinated fusimotor and skeletomotor control because, under this condition, their firing rates scale with the exafferent joint acceleration component. A sensory model exists for this exafferent acceleration component, and this can be used by the CNS to estimate the states. As a proof of the viability of this mechanism, I demonstrate that it balances a standing body and a rider-bicycle combination using realistic parameter values and with forcing torques that are feasible for humans.</description>
