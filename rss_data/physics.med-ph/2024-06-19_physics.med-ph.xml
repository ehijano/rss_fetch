      <title>Radiomics-based artificial intelligence (AI) models in colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis, metastasis detection, prognosis, and treatment response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a high rate of morbidity and mortality, colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks third in mortality among cancers. By analyzing the texture properties of images and quantifying the heterogeneity of tumors, radiomics and radiogenomics are non-invasive methods to determine the biological properties of CRC. Recently, several articles have discussed the application of radiomics in different aspects of CRC. Therefore, given the large amount of data published, this review aims to discuss how radiomics can be used for distinguishing benign and malignant colorectal lesions, diagnosing, staging, predicting prognosis and treatment response, and predicting lymph node and hepatic metastasis of CRC, based on radiomic features extracted from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), esophageal ultrasonography (EUS), and positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT). Challenges in bringing radiomics to clinical application and future solutions have also been discussed. With the progress made in radiomics and the application of deep and machine learning in this area, radiomics can become one of the main tools for the personalized management of CRC patients shortly.</description>

      <title>Eikonal phase retrieval: Unleashing the fourth generation sources potential for enhanced propagation based tomography on biological samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of synchrotrons towards higher brilliance beams has increased the possible sample-to-detector propagation distances for which the source confusion circle does not lead to geometrical blurring. This makes it possible to push near-field propagation driven phase contrast enhancement to the limit, revealing low contrast features which would otherwise remain hidden under an excessive noise. Until today this possibility was hindered, in many objects of scientific interest, by the simultaneous presence of strong phase gradient regions and low contrast features. The strong gradients, when enhanced with the now possible long propagation distances, induce such strong phase effects that the linearisation assumptions of current state-of-the-art single-distance phase retrieval filters are broken, and the resulting image quality is jeopardized. Here, we introduce a new iterative phase-retrieval algorithm and compare it with the Paganin phase-retrieval algorithm, in both the monochromatic and polychromatic cases, obtaining superior image quality. In the polychromatic case the comparison was done with an extrapolated Paganin algorithm obtained by reintroducing, into our phase retrieval algorithm, the linearization approximations underlying the Paganin forward model. Our work provides an innovative algorithm which efficiently performs the phase retrieval task over the entire near-field range, producing images of exceptional quality for mixed attenuation objects.</description>

      <title>Quantum inspired approach for denoising with application to medical imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background noise in many fields such as medical imaging poses significant challenges for accurate diagnosis, prompting the development of denoising algorithms. Traditional methodologies, however, often struggle to address the complexities of noisy environments in high dimensional imaging systems. This paper introduces a novel quantum-inspired approach for image denoising, drawing upon principles of quantum and condensed matter physics. Our approach views medical images as amorphous structures akin to those found in condensed matter physics and we propose an algorithm that incorporates the concept of mode resolved localization directly into the denoising process. Notably, our approach eliminates the need for hyperparameter tuning. The proposed method is a standalone algorithm with minimal manual intervention, demonstrating its potential to use quantum-based techniques in classical signal denoising. Through numerical validation, we showcase the effectiveness of our approach in addressing noise-related challenges in imaging and especially medical imaging, underscoring its relevance for possible quantum computing applications.</description>
