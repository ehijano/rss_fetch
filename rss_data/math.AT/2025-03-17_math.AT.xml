      <title>Revisiting Pontryagin's Proof of Stable Stems 1 and 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce fundamental notions of homotopy theory, including homotopy excision and the Freudenthal suspension theorem. We then explore framed cobordism and its connection to stable homotopy groups of spheres through the Pontryagin-Thom construction. Using this framework, we compute the stable stems in dimensions $0$, $1$, and $2$. This work is primarily expository, revisiting proofs from \cite{Pont1} with slight modifications incorporating modern notation. Furthermore, in the final section, we discuss 2-dimensional framed manifolds with Arf invariant one and examine why the result of \cite{Pont2} regarding $\pi_2^S$ is incorrect.</description>

      <title>Differential topology of the spaces of asymptotically stable vector fields and Lyapunov functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the topology of the space of smooth asymptotically stable vector fields on $\R^n$, as well as the space of all proper smooth Lyapunov functions for such vector fields. We prove that both spaces are path-connected and simply connected when $n\neq 4,5$ and weakly contractible when $n\leq 3$. Moreover, both spaces have the weak homotopy type of a certain subset of the nonlinear Grassmannian of submanifolds of $\R^n$ diffeomorphic to the $n$-disc.
  The proofs rely on Lyapunov theory and differential topology, such as the work of Smale and Perelman on the generalized Poincar\'{e} conjecture and results of Smale, Cerf, and Hatcher on the topology of diffeomorphism groups of discs. Applications include a partial answer to a question of Conley, a parametric Hartman-Grobman theorem for nonyperbolic but asymptotically stable equilibria, and a parametric Morse lemma for degenerate minima. We also study the related topics of hyperbolic equilibria, Morse minima, and relative homotopy groups of the space of asymptotically stable vector fields inside the space of those vanishing at a single point.</description>

      <title>A study of Kock's fat Delta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the study of weak identity structures in higher category theory we explore the fat Delta category, a modification of the simplex category introduced by J. Kock. We provide a comprehensive study of fat Delta via the theory of monads with arities, and use these results to show that fat Delta is a hypermoment category in the sense of C. Berger. Specifically, by proving that the free relative semicategory monad is strongly cartesian and identifying a dense generator, the theory of monads with arities immediately gives rise to the nerve theorem. We characterise the essential image of the nerve via the Segal condition, and show that fat Delta possesses an active-inert factorisation system. Building on these results, we also establish an isomorphism between two presentations of fat Delta and show that it is a strongly unital and extensional hypermoment category.</description>

      <title>Betti number estimates for non-negatively curved graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish Betti number estimates for graphs with non-negative Ollivier curvature, and for graphs with non-negative Bakry-\'Emery curvature, providing a discrete analogue of a classical result by Bochner for manifolds. Specifically, we show that for graphs with non-negative Ollivier curvature, the first Betti number is bounded above by half of the minimum combinatorial vertex degree. In contrast, for graphs with non-negative Bakry-\'Emery curvature, we prove that the first Betti number of the path homology is bounded above by the minimum combinatorial vertex degree minus one. We further present various rigidity results, characterizing graphs that attain the upper bound on the first Betti number under non-negative Ollivier curvature. Remarkably, these graphs are precisely the discrete tori, similar to the Riemannian setting. Furthermore, we show that the results obtained using the Ollivier curvature extend to the setting of potentially non-reversible Markov chains. Additionally, we explore rigidity cases depending on the idleness parameter of the Ollivier curvature, i.e., we characterize rigidity for bone-idle graphs with non-negative Ollivier curvature that attain the upper Betti number bound. We further establish an upper bound on the first Betti number under a more general assumption, where non-negative Ollivier curvature is required only outside a finite subset. Finally, we provide several examples, e.g., we prove that for a potentially non-reversible Markov chain on a cycle of length at least five, there always exists a unique path metric with constant Ollivier curvature. Moreover, this metric has non-negative Ollivier curvature, and the upper Betti number bound is attained if and only if the curvature is zero.</description>

      <title>Every motive is the motive of a stable $\infty$-category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a class of motivic equivalences of small stable $\infty$-categories $W_{\mathrm{mot}}$ and show that the Dwyer--Kan localization functor $\mathrm{Cat}^{\mathrm{perf}}_\infty \to \mathrm{Cat}^{\mathrm{perf}}_\infty[W_{\mathrm{mot}}^{-1}]$ is the universal localizing invariant in the sense of Blumberg--Gepner--Tabuada. In particular, we show that every object in its target $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{loc}}$ can be represented as $\mathcal{U}_{\mathrm{loc}}(\mathcal{C})$ for some small stable $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$. As another consequence, and using work of Efimov, we improve the universal property of $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{loc}}$ and show that any $\aleph_1$-finitary localizing invariant factors uniquely through it.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of codimension of persistence barcodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01610v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a pointwise finite-dimensional persistence module over a totally ordered set $S$, a theorem of Crawley-Boevey guarantees the existence of a barcode. When the set $S$ is finite, the persistence module is an equioriented type-A quiver representation and the barcode identifies a distinguished point in an algebraic variety. We prove a formula for the codimension of this variety inside an ambient space of comparable representations which depends only on the combinatorics of the barcode. We therefore extend the notion of codimension to persistence modules over any set $S$ and prove that this extension is well-defined and can be effectively computed via a stabilization property of approximating quiver representations. Further, we prove realization theorems by constructing explicit examples via persistent homology of data for which the codimension can realize any natural number as its value.</description>

      <title>Towards $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy theory of rigid analytic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To any rigid analytic space (in the sense of Fujiwara-Kato) we assign an $\mathbb{A}^1$-invariant rigid analytic homotopy category with coefficients in any presentable category. We show some functorial properties of this assignment as a functor on the category of rigid analytic spaces. Moreover, we show that there exists a full six functor formalism for the precomposition with the analytification functor by evoking Ayoub's thesis. As an application, we identify connective analytic K-theory in the unstable homotopy category with both $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathrm{BGL}$ and the analytification of connective algebraic K-theory. As a consequence, we get a representability statement for coefficients in light condensed spectra.</description>

      <title>Rectification of dendroidal left fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a discrete colored operad $P$, we construct an adjunction between the category of dendroidal sets over the nerve of $P$ and the category of simplicial $P$-algebras, and prove that when $P$ is $\Sigma$-free it establishes a Quillen equivalence with respect to the covariant model structure on the former category and the projective model structure on the latter. When $P=A$ is a discrete category, this recovers a Quillen equivalence previously established by Heuts-Moerdijk, of which we provide an independent proof.
  To prove the constructed adjunction is a Quillen equivalence, we show that the left adjoint presents a previously established operadic straightening equivalence between $\infty$-categories. This involves proving that, for a discrete symmetric monoidal category $A$, the Heuts-Moerdijk equivalence is a monoidal equivalence of monoidal Quillen model categories.</description>

      <title>Weakly globular double categories and weak units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.11180v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weakly globular double categories are a model of weak $2$-categories based on the notion of weak globularity, and they are known to be suitably equivalent to Tamsamani $2$-categories. Fair $2$-categories, introduced by J. Kock, model weak $2$-categories with strictly associative compositions and weak unit laws. In this paper we establish a direct comparison between weakly globular double categories and fair $2$-categories and prove they are equivalent after localisation with respect to the $2$-equivalences. This comparison sheds new light on weakly globular double categories as encoding a strictly associative, though not strictly unital, composition, as well as the category of weak units via the weak globularity condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.01855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a 3-variable enrichment of the Lawrence-Krammer-Bigelow (LKB) representation of the braid groups, which is the limit of a pro-nilpotent tower of representations having the original LKB representation as its bottom layer. We also construct analogous pro-nilpotent towers of representations of surface braid groups and loop braid groups.</description>
