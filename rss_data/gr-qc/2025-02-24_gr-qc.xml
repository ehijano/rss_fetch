      <title>LQG-modified dispersion relations and the problem of cosmic photons threshold anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our present contribution sets out to investigate how combined effects of Lorentz-symmetry violation (LSV) and Loop-Quantum-Gravity(LQG)-modified photon dispersion relations affect the threshold anomaly of cosmic photons. The point of departure is the post-Maxwellian version of Electromagnetism induced by LQG effects. We then consider the problem of gamma-ray attenuation by the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) and the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB) dominated by the Breit-Wheeler Effect. By following this path, we aim at the establishment of a new bridge between LSV and astrophysical phenomena in the framework of LQG.</description>

      <title>Shadows and Optical Appearances of Black Holes in $R^{2}$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a charged AdS/dS black hole (BH) in $R^{2}$ gravity and study its optical features, including the shadow's geometrical shape and the energy emission rate. Additionally, we look for criteria to restrict the free parameters of the theory by comparing them to observational data of M87$^{\star}$. Then, we employ the Newman-Janis algorithm to build the rotating counterpart of the static solution in $R^{2}$ gravity and calculate the energy emission rate for the rotating case as well as discuss how the rotation factor and other parameters of this theory affect the emission of particles around the BHs. In the following, we consider the obtained rotating BH as a supermassive black hole and evaluate the parameters of the model with shadow size estimates based on the observations of M87$^{\star}$ from EHT.</description>

      <title>Physical validity of anisotropic models derived from isotropic fluid dynamics in $f(R,T)$ theory: An implication of gravitational decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive multiple anisotropic analogs from the established isotropic model by means of the gravitational decoupling approach in a fluid-geometry interaction based theory. To accomplish this, we initially consider a static spherical perfect-fluid configuration and then introduce a new matter source to induce anisotropic behavior in the system. The resulting field equations encapsulate the entire matter distribution and thus become much complicated. We then split these equations into two sets through implementing a particular transformation, each set delineating characteristics attributed to their original fluid sources. We adopt the Heintzmann's ansatz and some constraints on extra gravitating source to deal with the first and second systems of equations, respectively. Furthermore, the two fundamental forms of the matching criteria are used to make the constant in the considered solution known. By utilizing the preliminary information of a star candidate LMC X-4, we assess the physical validity of the developed models. Our analysis indicates that both our models exhibit characteristics which are well-agreed with the acceptability criteria for certain parametric values.</description>

      <title>Entropy correction and quasinormal modes of Kerr-Newman-de Sitter-like black hole in bumblebee gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the tunneling of fermion particle for Kerr-Newman-de Sitter-like (KNdS-like) black hole in bumblebee gravity model by applying the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). The Hawking temperature of KNdS-like black hole has been modified under GUP. The quantum gravity effect reduces the rise of Hawking temperature of KNdS-like black hole. The modified Hawking temperature and the correction of black hole entropy are investigated by using the tunneling of fermion beyond the semiclassical approximation. We study the scalar field perturbation and effective potential of KNdS-like black hole in bumblebee gravity model by using Klein-G\"ordon equation. The quasinormal modes for scalar perturbation is investigated using WKB method and P\"oschl-Teller fitting method. The significant impact on the greybody factor, Hawking spectra and sparsity of Hawking radiation of the black hole are also studied in the presence of Lorentz violating parameter L.</description>

      <title>The correspondence of generalised entropic cosmology theory with $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$ modified gravity and gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This talk is based on the collaboration with Sergei D. Odintsov. We investigate the correspondence between modified gravity theories and general entropic cosmology theory. Such a theory is proposed by an analogy with Jacobson's work, where the Einstein equation was derived from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We compare FLRW equations obtained in entropic gravity with those in modified gravity theories. It is found the correspondence of $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$ gravities and general entropic gravity. We regard the $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$ gravity theories as effective local theories corresponding to the entropic gravity theories and we investigate the gravitational waves. The obtained equation of the gravitational wave is identical to that in Einstein's gravity except that the gravitational coupling is modified by the functional form of the functions $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$. It is interesting that in the case of the Tsallis entropic cosmology, the gravitational coupling becomes small or large, which may suppress or enhance the emission of the gravitational wave.</description>

      <title>TemplateGeNN: Neural Networks used to accelerate Gravitational Wave Template Bank Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce TemplateGeNN, a fast stochastic template bank generation algorithm which uses Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) and a LearningMatch model (Siamese neural network). TemplateGeNN generated a binary black hole template bank (chirp mass varied from $5 M_{\odot} \leq \mathcal{M}_{c} \leq 20M_{\odot}$, symmetric mass ratio varied from $0.1 \leq \eta \leq 0.24999$, and equal aligned spin varied from $-0.99 \leq \chi_{1,2}\leq 0.99$) of 31,640 templates in $\sim 1$ day on a single A100 GPU. To test the sensitivity of this template bank we injected 7746 binary black hole templates into LIGO Gaussian noise. This template bank recovered 98$\%$ of the injections with a fitting factor greater than 0.97. For lower mass regions (black hole mass region between $5 M_{\odot} \leq m_{1, 2} \leq 25 M_{\odot}$), 99$\%$ of 9469 injections were recovered with a fitting factor greater than 0.97. LearningMatch and TemplateGeNN are a machine-learning pipeline that can be used to accelerate template bank generation for future gravitational-wave data analysis.</description>

      <title>Modeling Compact Objects in $f(R)$ Gravity: Application of Buchdahl-I Metric with Chaplygin Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates realistic anisotropic matter configurations for spherical symmetry in the framework of $f(R)$ gravity. The solutions obtained from Buchdahl-I metric are used to determine the behavior of PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0348+0432 and 4U 1608-52 with Starobinsky model. Analysis of physical parameters such as density, pressure, and anisotropy is illustrated through graphs, and the stability of compact objects is investigated by energy and causality conditions. We will also discuss the behavior of gravitational, hydrostatic and anisotropic forces, gravitational redshift and adiabatic index. At the theoretical and astrophysical scales, the graphical representations validate the practical and realistic $f(R)$ gravity models.</description>

      <title>Black hole solutions in the revised Deser-Woodard nonlocal theory of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the revised Deser-Woodard model of nonlocal gravity by reformulating the related field equations within a suitable tetrad frame. This transformation significantly simplifies the treatment of the ensuing differential problem while preserving the characteristics of the original gravitational theory. We then focus on static and spherically symmetric spacetimes in vacuum. Hence, we demonstrate that the gravitational theory under study admits a class of black hole solutions characterized by an inverse power-law correction to the Schwarzschild $g_{tt}$ metric function and a first-order perturbation of the $g_{rr}$ Schwarzschild component. Then, through a stepwise methodology, we analytically solve the full dynamics of the theory, finally leading to the reconstruction of the nonlocal distortion function, within which the new black hole solutions arise. Furthermore, we analyze the geometric properties of the obtained solutions and quantify the deviations from the Schwarzschild prediction. This work provides new insights into compact object configurations and advances our understanding of nonlocal gravity theories in the strong-field regime at astrophysical scales.</description>

      <title>Implications of Photon Mass: Vortextrap Magnetization of Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss certain astrophysical implications of the photon mass. It offers a new mechanism of black hole magnetization, described as ``vortextrap magnetization" (VTM), which can generate a near-saturated magnetic field in astrophysical black holes. The extreme magnetic field is provided by a large number of Nielsen-Olesen type vortex lines piercing a black hole. In massive photon scenario the galactic magnetic field is a densely populated forest of overlapping magnetic flux tubes. These get trapped and collected by a black hole over a cosmological time-scale. The VTM mechanism neatly fits supermassive black holes with sizes matching the phenomenologically-acceptable values of the photon mass, and has implications for magnetic-field based particle acceleration. Even in absence of surrounding plasma, the near-saturated magnetic field is expected to result into an intense electromagnetic radiation as well as gravitational waves in black hole mergers. We provide a numerical simulation of the VTM phenomenon in a prototype system.</description>

      <title>Can synchrotron radiation reveal the presence of {\it dark sector} around black hole?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied synchrotron radiation of a massive charged under visible and hidden sector groups, moving in equatorial plane around spherically symmetric weakly magnetized black hole. As a model of dark matter we choose the one, in which Maxwell field is coupled to the additional $U(1)$-gauge field envisaging the dark sector, the so-called dark photon model. Magnetization of a black hole also stems from Maxwell-dark photon electrodynamics. One found the radiation power and energy loss of the particle and looked for the imprints of dark matter on those phenomena.</description>

      <title>Loop Blow-Up Inflation: a novel way to inflate with the K\"ahler moduli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topic of this talk is a new inflationary model in the context of Type IIB string compactifications called Loop Blow-Up Inflation, presented in arXiv:2403.04831. The original Blow-Up Inflation model, whose potential was purely non-perturbative, suffers from the $\eta$-problem, being sensitive to string-loop corrections. If these corrections are introduced in the nflationary potential, they become dominant over the non-perturbative contributions as soon as the inflaton is displaced from its minimum. Therefore, the inflationary potential takes a new inverse-power law behavior. We show that slow-roll inflation is not ultimately spoiled and focus on the post-inflationary history in different scenarios of microscopic Standard Model (SM) realization. Each of them gives precise predictions for the spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio in agreement with CMB data .The model also predicts an amount of dark radiation potentially observable by next-generation CMB experiments. This article is a contribution to the proceedings of the Second General Meeting of the COST Action CA21106 Cosmic WISPers.</description>

      <title>Boosting the growth of intermediate-mass black holes: collisions with massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform fully relativistic simulations of the head-on collisions between intermediate-mass black holes and very massive stars. Such collisions are expected to occur in dense stellar clusters and may play an important role in growing the mass of the seed black hole. For the cases considered here, for which the masses of the black holes and stars are comparable, the vast majority of the stellar material is accreted onto the black hole within a stellar dynamical timescale, as expected from analytical estimates, and leads to a rapid growth of the black hole. A small amount of mass, which is shock-heated in the wake of the black hole, is ejected from the collision and will contribute to the interstellar material in the cluster.</description>

      <title>Long-term impact of the magnetic-field strength on the evolution and electromagnetic emission by neutron-star merger remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations are essential to understand the complex physics accompanying the merger of binary systems of neutron stars. However, these simulations become computationally challenging when they have to model the merger remnants on timescales over which secular phenomena, such as the launching of magnetically driven outflows, develop. To tackle these challenges, we have recently developed a hybrid approach that combines, via a hand-off transition, a fully general-relativistic code (FIL) with a more efficient code making use of the conformally flat approximation (BHAC+). We here report important additional developments of BHAC+ consisting of the inclusion of gravitational-wave radiation-reaction contributions and of higher-order formulations of the equations of general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. Both improvements have allowed us to explore BNS merger remnants with high accuracy and over timescales that would have been computationally prohibitive otherwise. More specifically, we have investigated the impact of the magnetic-field strength on the long-term (\ie $\sim 200\,{\rm ms}$) and high-resolution (\ie $150\,{\rm m}$) evolutions of the ``magnetar'' resulting from the merger of two neutron stars with a realistic equation of state. In this way, and for sufficiently large magnetic fields, we observe the weakening or suppression of differential rotation and the generation of magnetic flares in the outer layers of the remnant. These flares, driven mostly by the Parker instability, are responsible for intense and collimated Poynting flux outbursts and mass ejections. This novel phenomenology offers the possibility of seeking corresponding signatures from the observations of short gamma-ray bursts and hence revealing the existence of a long-lived strongly magnetized remnant.</description>

      <title>The holographic space-time model of inflation and its predictions for the CMB primordial spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1998 Carlip and Solodukhin independently conjectured the equality between fluctuations in the modular Hamiltonian of black holes and its expectation value. Banks and Zurek's 2021 work generalized this observation to any causal diamonds. We use this observation to calculate the precise normalization of primordial scalar and tensor power spectra in the Holographic Space-time (HST) model of inflation. In previous work Banks and Fischler outlined the general calculation of inflationary power spectra in this model, which we review here. Its conceptual basis is radically different from field theoretic inflation and it has no Transplanckian problems, but its predictions for power spectra will be shown to fit extant data equally well, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio agrees with experimental observations.

      <description>arXiv:2502.15279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this chapter we first describe the early history of primordial black hole (PBH) research. We then discuss their possible formation mechanisms, including critical collapse from inflationary fluctuations and various types of phase transition. We next describe the numerous constraints on the number density of PBHs from various quantum and astrophysical processes. This was the main focus of research until recently but there is currently a shift of emphasis to the search for evidence for PBHs. We end by discussing this evidence, with particular emphasis on their role as dark matter candidates, sources of gravitational waves and seeds for supermassive black holes and early cosmic structures.</description>

      <title>Status of early dark energy after DESI: the role of $\Omega_m$ and $r_s H_0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The EDE model is one of the promising solutions to the long-standing Hubble tension. This paper investigates the status of several EDE models in light of recent BAO observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and their implications for resolving the Hubble tension. The DESI Y1 BAO results deviate from the CMB and Type Ia supernova (SNeIa) observations in their constraints on the matter density $\Omega_m$ and the product of the sound horizon and the Hubble constant $r_s H_0$. Meanwhile, these EDE models happen to tend towards this deviation. Therefore, in this work, it is found that DESI Y1 BAO results strengthen the preference for EDE models and help to obtain a higher $H_0$. Even considering the Pantheon+ observations for SNeIa, which have an opposite tendency, DESI still dominates the preference for EDE. This was unforeseen in past SDSS BAO measurements and therefore emphasizes the role of BAO and SNeIa measurements in Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Spin precession and neutrino helicity flip in various spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically study spin precession of neutral particles freely moving in spacetime. We first derive the formula describing spin precession within a general stationary and axisymmetric spacetime. We then apply our formula to study spin precession of neutral spinning particles moving within various spacetimes that are among the most ubiquitous ones found in the literature. Our results are then used to extract the helicity flip probability for neutrinos propagating in each one of those selected spacetimes. It is found that low-energy neutrinos acquire a spin-flip probability that is as large as unity in all the spacetimes considered here. The remarkable result, however, is that while spin-flip probability for high-energy neutrinos remains insignificant in most of these spacetimes, some of them do allow spin-flip probability to reach unity even for high-energy neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Massive vector field perturbations in the Schwarzschild spacetime from supersymmetric gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The master equation of the Proca field in the Schwarzschild spacetime is studied by using the Seiberg-Witten/quasinormal modes duality. We establish the dictionary between the parameters in gauge and gravity theories, since both sides lead to Heun-type equations. Applying the technique of instanton counting, we analytically find the eigenfrequencies of the quasinormal modes and quasi-bound states for massive vector fields around black holes, with the boundary conditions linked by the connection formula. The results show consistency with known numerical researches in the literature.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Model for Dark Energy - Dark Matter Interaction: Scenario for the Hubble Tension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15977v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze a model for Dark Energy - Dark Matter interaction, based on a decaying process of the former into the latter. The dynamical equations are constructed following a kinetic formulation, which separates the interacting fluctuations from an equilibrium distribution of both species. The emerging dynamical picture consists of coupled equations, which are specialized in the case of a Dark Energy equation of state parameter; we deal with a modified Lambda Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, which is investigated versus a possible interpretation of the Hubble tension. Using an optimized set of the model's free parameters, it can be shown that the obtained Hubble parameter can, in principle, address the tension. We then use the most recent datasets from late Universe sources and compressed information from the Cosmic Microwave Background data to constrain the free parameters and compare the addressed scenario to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. The study outlines how our proposal is preferred by the data in all cases, based on fit quality, while also alleviating the tension.</description>

      <title>Photon Ring Dimming as a Signature of Photon-Axion Conversion in Janis-Newman-Winicour Naked Singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The possible existence of axions in the universe introduces the intriguing possibility of photon-axion conversion in strong magnetic fields, particularly near compact objects like supermassive black holes or even naked singularity. In this study, we investigate the conversion of photons into axions in the vicinity of a Janis-Newman-Winicour (JNW) spacetime, a well-known naked singularity solution. Our analysis reveals that photons can efficiently convert into axions with masses less than $100 \rm \ neV$. We calculate the conversion probability and find that it is significantly influenced by the characteristic parameter of the JNW spacetime. The potential observational signatures of this conversion, would be the dimming of photon ring in the X-ray and gamma-ray spectrum. Our findings suggest that compact objects like M87* could be prime candidates for detecting photon-axion conversion effects, provided future advances in high-resolution observations.</description>

      <title>For a flat Universe, $C_P/C_V=-q$ : another coincidence in Cosmology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with gravitational thermodynamics on the dynamical apparent horizon of an FLRW universe with dissipation. The dissipation is assumed to arise due to adiabatic gravitational particle creation. For the thermodynamic study, we consider the Bekenstein-Hawking formalism and also assume a nonzero curvature $\kappa$ for a general study. In particular, we study the unified first law, the generalized second law, and thermodynamic stability in our model. The specific heat capacities are taken into account for the study of thermodynamic stability. Our study reveals a nice result! The ratio of the specific heat capacity at constant pressure and that at constant volume in a flat FLRW universe with dissipation is nothing but the negative of the deceleration parameter. In classical thermodynamics, this ratio is known as the isentropic expansion factor or (for ideal gases) the adiabatic index. A more interesting fact that has come to light is that this relation is independent of the cosmological model used. So, this is actually a generic result in Big Bang Cosmology. We discuss the implications of this result on the evolution of the Universe. Finally, we determine the constraints on the effective equation of state and the particle creation rate which guarantees thermodynamic stability in our model.</description>

Abstract: Phonons in Bose-Einstein condensates propagate as massless scalar particles on top of an emergent acoustic metric. This hydrodynamics/gravity analogy can be exploited to realize acoustic black holes, featuring an event horizon that traps phonons. We show that by an appropriate external potential, gravitational wave-like perturbations of the acoustic metric can be produced. Such perturbations can be used to excite an acoustic black hole, which should then relax by phonon emission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the (axial) quasinormal modes of black holes embedded in generic matter profiles. Our results reveal that the axial QNMs experience a redshift when the black hole is surrounded by various matter environments, proportional to the compactness of the matter halo. Our calculations demonstrate that for static black holes embedded in galactic matter distributions, there exists a universal relation between the matter environment and the redshifted vacuum quasinormal modes. In particular, for dilute environments the leading order effect is a redshift $1+U$ of frequencies and damping times, with $U \sim -{\cal C}$ the Newtonian potential of the environment at its center, which scales with its compactness ${\cal C}$.</description>

      <title>Fate of Mixmaster Chaos in a Deformed Algebra framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the anisotropic Bianchi models, and in particular the Bianchi Type IX known as the Mixmaster universe, where the Misner anisotropic variables obey Deformed Commutation Relations inspired by Quantum Gravity theories. We consider three different deformations, two of which have been able to remove the initial singularity similarly to Loop Quantum Cosmology when implemented to the single volume variable. Here, the two-dimensional Algebras naturally implement a form of Non-Commutativity between the space variables that affects the dynamics of the anisotropies. In particular, we implement the modifications in their classical limit, where the Deformed Commutators become Deformed Poisson Brackets. We derive the modified Belinskii-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz map in all the three cases, and we study the fate of the chaotic behavior that the model classically presents. Depending on the sign of the deformation, the dynamics will either settle into oscillations between two almost-constant angles, or stop reflecting after a finite number of iterations and reach the singularity as one last simple Kasner solution. In either case, chaos is removed.</description>

      <title>Entropy Bounds and Holographic Dark Energy: Conflicts and Consensus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cohen, Kaplan, and Nelson's influential paper established that the UV-IR cut-offs cannot be arbitrarily chosen but are constrained by the relation $\Lambda^2 L \lesssim M_p$. Here, we revisit the formulation of the CKN entropy bound and compare it with other bounds. The specific characteristics of each bound are shown to depend on the underlying scaling of entropy. Notably, employing a non-extensive scaling with the von Neumann entropy definition leads to a more stringent constraint, $S_{\text{max}} \approx \sqrt{S_{\text{BH}}}$. We also clarify distinctions between the IR cut-offs used in these frameworks. Moving to the causal entropy bound, we demonstrate that it categorises the CKN bound as matter-like, the von Neumann bound as radiation-like, and the Bekenstein bound as black hole-like systems when saturated. Emphasising cosmological implications, we confirm the consistency between the bounds and the first laws of horizon thermodynamics. We then analyse the shortcomings in standard Holographic Dark Energy (HDE) models, highlighting the challenges in constructing HDE using $\Lambda^2 L \lesssim M_p$. Specifically, using the Hubble function in HDE definitions introduces circular logic, causing dark energy to mimic the second dominant component rather than behaving as matter. We further illustrate that the potential for other IR cut-offs, like the future event horizon in an FLRW background or those involving derivatives of the Hubble function, to explain late-time acceleration stems from an integration constant that cannot be trivially set to zero. In brief, the CKN relation doesn't assign an arbitrary cosmological constant; it explains why its value is small.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian orbital evolution and gravitational wave forms of inspiralling compact binaries with mass transfer and spin corrections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we focus on the effects of mass transfer between binary stars and stellar spin on the post-Newtonian (PN) orbital evolution and gravitational waveforms of compact binary systems. We employ the 2.5PN approximation and the mass quadrupole formula to compute the orbital evolution and gravitational waveforms. After an exhaustive discussion of the astrophysical processes relevant to the scenarios of interest, we summarize a one-dimensional mass transfer model that uniformly treats common envelope evolution and tidal disruption, and derive an approximate expression for the dependence of the mass transfer rate of the material flow through the first Lagrange point L1 on the orbital angular velocity. Furthermore, based on the perturbed Keplerian approach, we present a two-dimensional model for the orbital evolution of compact binary systems that simultaneously accounts for mass transfer and stellar spin corrections. Through numerical simulations, we investigate binary systems with significant relativistic effects, namely NS-NS (neutron star-neutron star), NS-BH (neutron star-black hole), and BH-BH (black hole-black hole) systems, and demonstrate the influence of mass transfer and spin corrections on the orbital evolution and polarization waveforms of gravitational waves of these compact binaries systems.</description>

      <title>Localized past stability of the subcritical Kasner-scalar field spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the nonlinear stability, in the contracting direction, of the entire subcritical family of Kasner-scalar field solutions to the Einstein-scalar field equations in four spacetime dimensions. Our proof relies on a zero-shift, orthonormal frame decomposition of a conformal representation of the Einstein-scalar field equations. To synchronise the big bang singularity, we use the time coordinate $\tau = \exp\bigl(\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\phi\bigr)$, where $\phi$ is the scalar field, which coincides with a conformal harmonic time slicing. We show that the perturbed solutions are asymptotically pointwise Kasner, geodesically incomplete to the past and terminate at quiescent, crushing big bang singularities located at $\tau=0$, which are characterised by curvature blow up. Specifically, we establish two stability theorems. The first is a global in-space stability result where the perturbed spacetimes are of the form $M =\bigcup_{t\in (0,t_0]} \tau^{-1}(\{t\}) \cong (0,t_0] \times \mathbb{T}^{3}$. The second is a localised version where the perturbed spacetimes are given by $M=\bigcup_{t\in (0,t_0]}\tau^{-1}(\{t\})\cong \bigcup_{t\in (0,t_0]} \{t\}\times\mathbb{B}_{\rho(t)}$ with time-dependent radius function $\rho(t)=\rho_0+(1-\vartheta)\rho_0\bigl(\bigl(\frac{t}{t_0}\bigr)^{1-\epsilon}-1\bigr)$. Spatial localisation is achieved through our choice of zero-shift, harmonic time slicing that leads to hyperbolic evolution equations with a finite propagation speed.</description>

Abstract: Consistent dynamics which couples classical and quantum degrees of freedom exists. This dynamics is linear in the hybrid state, completely positive and trace preserving. Starting from completely positive classical-quantum master equations, we derive a general path integral representation for such dynamics in terms of a classical-quantum action, which includes the necessary and sufficient conditions for complete positivity and trace preservation. The path integral we study is a generalization of the Feynman path integral for quantum systems, and the stochastic path integral used to study classical stochastic processes, allowing for interaction between the classical and quantum systems. When the classical-quantum Hamiltonian is at most quadratic in the momenta we are able to derive a configuration space path integral, providing a map between master equations and covariant classical-quantum path integrals.</description>

Abstract: We reformulate in Hamiltonian language the recent proposal by Hohm and Zwiebach of an action yielding the most general $O(d,d)$-symmetric string cosmology equations, at tree-level in the string-loop expansion, but to all orders in the $\alpha'$ expansion. This allows us to give a simple characterization of a large class of non-singular, non-perturbative, pre-big bang scenarios smoothly interpolating between a low-energy initial accelerated (string frame) expansion and a phase of final (string and Einstein frame) decelerated expansion. Interestingly, these solutions must necessarily include, just around the bounce, a very short phase of (string-frame) contraction.</description>

      <title>From the string vacuum to FLRW or de Sitter via $\alpha'$ corrections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We first make more precise a recent "Hamiltonian" reformulation of the Hohm-Zwiebach approach to the tree-level, $O(d,d)$-invariant string cosmology equations at all orders in the $\alpha'$ expansion, and recall how it allows to give a simple characterization of a large class of cosmological scenarios connecting, through a non-singular bounce, two duality-related perturbative solutions at early and late times. We then discuss the effects of adding to the action a non-perturbative, $O(d,d)$-breaking, dilaton potential $V(\phi)$. The resulting cosmological solutions, assumed to approach at early times the perturbative string vacuum (with vanishing curvature and string coupling), can stabilize the dilaton at late times and simultaneously approach either a matter-dominated FLRW cosmology or a de-Sitter-like inflationary phase, depending on initial conditions and on the properties of $V(\phi)$ at moderate-coupling. We also identify a general mechanism for generating isotropic late-time attractors from a large basin of anisotropic initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Promising Stabs in the Dark: Theory Virtues and Pursuit-Worthiness in the Dark Energy Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper argues that we ought to conceive of the Dark Energy problem -- the question of how to account for observational data, naturally interpreted as accelerated expansion of the universe -- as a crisis of underdetermined pursuit-worthiness. Not only are the various approaches to the Dark Energy problem evidentially underdetermined; at present, no compelling reasons single out any of them as more likely to be true than the other. More vexingly for working scientists, none of the approaches stands out as uncontroversially preferable over its rivals in terms of its rationally warranted promise, i.e.~the reasons to further work on, explore, and develop it. We demonstrate this claim by applying a Peircean economic model of pursuit-worthiness in terms of a cognitive cost/benefit estimate -- with the instantiation of theory virtues as key indicators of cognitive gains -- to the four main Dark Energy proposals (the cosmological constant approach, modified gravity, quintessence, and inhomogeneous cosmologies). According to our analysis, these approaches do not admit of an unambiguous, or uncontroversial, ranking with respect to which ansatz deserves distinguished attention and research efforts. The overall methodological counsel that our analysis underwrites recommends a pragmatic double research strategy forward: to encourage and foster theory pluralism and the search for tests -- with the goal of enhancing the testability of the $\Lambda$CDM model and ``testing it to destruction".</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Effective Field Theory of Stochastic Single Field Inflation at NNNLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13484v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) generalization of stochastic inflation in a model-independent single-field framework and its impact on primordial black hole (PBH) formation. We show how the Langevin equations for the "soft" modes in quasi de Sitter background is described by the Infra-Red (IR) contributions of scalar perturbations, and the subsequent Fokker-Planck equation driving the probability distribution for the stochastic duration ${\cal N}$, significantly modify in the present EFT picture. An explicit perturbative analysis of the distribution function by implementing the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism is performed up to the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (NNNLO) for both the classical-drift and quantum-diffusion dominated regimes. In the drift-dominated limit, we perturbatively analyse the local non-Gaussianity parameters $(f_{\rm NL}, g_{\rm NL}, \tau_{\rm NL})$ with the EFT-induced modifications. In the diffusion-dominated limit, we numerically compute the probability distribution featuring exponential tails at each order of perturbative treatment.</description>

      <title>Non-local quantum field theory from doubly special relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Doubly special relativity (DSR) is usually regarded as a low-energy limit of a quantum gravity theory with testable predictions. On the other hand, non-local quantum field theories have been presented as a solution to the inconsistencies arising when quantizing gravity. Here, we present a new formulation of quantum field theories in DSR with non-local behavior. Our construction restricts the models to those showing linear Lorentz invariance. We derive the deformed Klein--Gordon, Dirac, and electromagnetic Lagrangians, as well as the deformed Maxwell equations. We also discuss the electric potential of a point charge. Finally, we analyze the connection between the nonlocality of field theories and DSR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the quantum theories of the free massive scalar, the massive fermionic, and the electromagnetic fields, in a doubly special relativity scenario. This construction is based on a geometrical interpretation of the kinematics of this kind of theory. In order to describe the modified actions, we find that a higher (indeed infinite) derivative field theory is needed, from which the deformed kinematics can be read. From our construction we are able to restrict the possible models of doubly special relativity to those that preserve linear Lorentz invariance. We quantize the theories and also obtain a deformed version of the Maxwell equations. We analyze the electromagnetic vector potential for both an electric pointlike source and magnetic dipole. We observe that the electric and magnetic fields do not diverge at the origin for some models described with an anti-de Sitter momentum space but do for the de Sitter one in both problems.</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculation of hyper-neutron matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equation of state (EoS) of neutron matter plays a decisive role in our understanding of the properties of neutron stars as well as the generation of gravitational waves in neutron star mergers. At sufficient densities, it is known that the appearance of hyperons generally softens the EoS, thus leading to a reduction in the maximum mass of neutron stars well below the observed values of about 2 solar masses. Even though repulsive three-body forces are known to solve this so-called "hyperon puzzle", so far performing \textit{ab initio} calculations with a substantial number of hyperons has remained elusive. In this work, we address this challenge by employing simulations based on Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory with up to 232 neutrons (pure neutron matter) and up to 116 $\Lambda$ hyperons (hyper-neutron matter) in a finite volume. We introduce a novel auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm, allowing us to simulate for both pure neutron matter and hyper-neutron matter systems up to 5 times the density of nuclear matter using a single auxiliary field without any sign oscillations. Also, for the first time in {\em ab initio} calculations, we not only include $N\Lambda$ two-body and $NN\Lambda$ three-body forces, but also $\Lambda\Lambda$ and $N \Lambda\Lambda$ interactions. Consequently, we determine essential astrophysical quantities such as the mass-radius relation, the speed of sound and the tidal deformability of neutron stars. Our findings also confirm the existence of the $I$-Love-$Q$ relation, which gives access to the moment of inertia of the neutron star.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on a modified-gravity model with an exponential function of the curvature using the expansion history, the RSD, and the Pantheon+SH0ES data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considering a well-motivated $f(R)$ modified-gravity model, in which an exponential function of the curvature is included, in this paper we implement a statistical data analysis to set constraints on the parameters of the model, taking into account an analytic approximate solution for the expansion rate, $H(z)$. In the analysis based on the Markov chain Markov based on the expansion rate evolution, the standardized SN distance modulus and the redshift space distortion observational data, we find that the preferred value for the perturbative parameter, $b$, quantifying the deviation of the $f(R)$ model from $\Lambda$CDM, lives in a region that excludes $b = 0$ at $\gtrsim 3.5 \sigma$ C.L., and that the predicted current value of the Hubble parameter, $H_0$, locates in between the two observational results currently under scrutiny from Planck and SH0ES collaborations. Under the implemented approximate solution, and with the constraints obtained for the parameters, the proposed $f(R)$ model successfully reproduces the observational data and the predicted evolution of interesting cosmological parameters resemble the results of $\Lambda$CDM, as expected, while an oscillatory behavior of the dark energy equation of state is observed, pointing to deviation from the concordance cosmological model. The results presented here reinforce the conclusion that the $f(R)$ modified-gravity model represents a viable alternative to describe the evolution of the Universe, evading the challenges faced by $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>2D numerical simulation of lunar response to gravitational waves using finite element method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous studies of the response of the Moon to gravitational waves have been carried out using analytical or semi-analytical models assuming ideal lunar structures. Such models are advantageous for their high-speed calculation but fail to account for the extremely heterogeneous subsurface and/or interior structures of the Moon. Numerical calculations are needed, but it is challenging to model the topography and lateral heterogeneity of the Moon. In addition, the computational cost is great especially when performing the GW simulation for a long time. As a first step towards overcoming the above difficulties, we employ a two-dimensional finite element method to numerically simulate the lunar response to gravitational waves. We verify our method by comparing our numerical results with those semi-analytical solutions. Based on such comparison, we also analyze the limitation of the two-dimensional simulation. Our work breaks a new way towards the precise simulation of realistic lunar response to gravitational waves in the future and lays down a solid foundation for three-dimensional numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A recoiling supermassive black hole in a powerful quasar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes (SMBH) are thought to grow through accretion of matter and mergers. Models of SMBH mergers have long suffered the final parsec problem, where SMBH binaries may stall before energy loss from gravitational waves (GW) becomes significant, leaving the pair unmerged. Direct evidence of coalesced SMBH remains elusive. Theory predicts that GW recoiling black holes can occur following a black hole merger. Here we present new and conclusive spectroscopic evidence that both the accretion disk and the broad line region in the spatially offset quasar 3C 186 are blue-shifted by the same velocity relative to the host galaxy, with a line of sight velocity of (-1310 +- 21) km/s. This is best explained by the GW recoil super-kick scenario. This confirmation of the ejection process implies that the final parsec problem is resolved in nature, providing evidence that even the most massive black holes can merge.</description>
