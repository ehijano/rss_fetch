      <title>FIRES: Fluid Integrated Reflecting and Emitting Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter introduces the concept of fluid integrated reflecting and emitting surface (FIRES), which constitutes a new paradigm seamlessly integrating the flexibility of fluid-antenna systems (FASs) with the dual functionality of simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs). The potential of the proposed metasurface structure is studied though an FIRES-enabled multicast system based on the energy splitting protocol. In this model, the FIRES is divided into non-overlapping subareas, each functioning as a 'fluid' element capable of concurrent reflection and transmission and changing its position of radiation within the subarea. In particular, we formulate an optimization problem for the design of the triple tunable features of the surface unit elements, which is solved via a tailored particle swarm optimization approach. Our results showcase that the proposed FIRES architecture significantly outperforms its conventional STAR-RIS counterpart.</description>

      <title>Swarm Intelligence Optimization of Multi-RIS Aided MmWave Beamspace MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the performance of a multiple reconfigurable intelligence surface (RIS)-aided millimeter wave (mmWave) beamspace multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with multiple users (UEs). We focus on a challenging scenario in which the direct links between the base station (BS) and all UEs are blocked, and communication is facilitated only via RISs. The maximum ratio transmission (MRT) is utilized for data precoding, while a low-complexity algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is designed to jointly perform beam selection, power allocation, and RIS profile configuration. The proposed optimization approach demonstrates positive trade-offs between the complexity (in terms of running time) and the achievable sum rate. In addition, our results demonstrate that due to the sparsity of beamspace channels, increasing the number of unit cells (UCs) at RISs can lead to higher achievable rates than activating a larger number of beams at the MIMO BS.</description>

      <title>Timely CPU Scheduling for Computation-intensive Status Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of mobile devices and real-time status updating applications has motivated the optimization of data freshness in the context of age of information (AoI). Meanwhile, increasing computational demands have inspired research on CPU scheduling. Since prior CPU scheduling strategies have ignored data freshness and prior age-minimization strategies have considered only constant CPU speed, we formulate the first CPU scheduling problem as a constrained semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) problem with uncountable space, which aims to minimize the long-term average age of information, subject to an average CPU power constraint. We optimize strategies that specify when the CPU sleeps and adapt the CPU speed (clock frequency) during the execution of update-processing tasks. We consider the age-minimal CPU scheduling problem for both predictable task size (PTS) and unpredictable task size (UTS) cases, where the task size is realized at the start (PTS) or at the completion (UTS) of the task, respectively. To address the non-convex objective, we employ Dinkelbach's fractional programming method to transform our problem into an average cost SMDP. We develop a value-iteration-based algorithm and prove its convergence to obtain optimal policies and structural results for both the PTS and UTS systems. Compared to constant CPU speed, numerical results show that our proposed scheme can reduce the AoI by 50\% or more, with increasing benefits under tighter power constraints. Further, for a given AoI target, the age-minimal CPU scheduling policy can reduce the energy consumption by 50\% or more, with greater AoI reductions when the task size distribution exhibits higher variance.</description>

      <title>Duals of multiplicity codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multivariate multiplicity codes have been recently explored because of their importance for list decoding and local decoding. Given a multivariate multiplicity code, in this paper, we compute its dimension using Gr\"obner basis tools, its dual in terms of indicator functions, and explicitly describe a parity-check matrix. In contrast with Reed--Muller, Reed--Solomon, univariate multiplicity, and other evaluation codes, the dual of a multivariate multiplicity code is not equivalent or isometric to a multiplicity code (i.e., this code family is not closed under duality). We use our explicit description to provide a lower bound on the minimum distance for the dual of a multiplicity code.</description>

      <title>Fisher-Rao distances between finite energy signals in noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes to represent finite-energy signals observed in agiven bandwidth as parameters of a probability distribution, and use the information geometrical framework to compute the Fisher-Rao distance between these signals, seen as distributions. The observations are represented by their discrete Fourier transform, which are modeled as complex Gaussian vectors with fixed diagonal covariance matrix and parametrized means. The parameters define the coordinate system of a statistical manifold. This work investigates the possibility of obtaining closed-form expressions for the Fisher-Rao distance. We study two cases: the general case representing any finite energy signal observed in a given bandwidth and a parametrized example of observing an attenuated signal with a known magnitude spectrum and unknown phase spectrum, and we calculate the Fisher-Rao distances for both cases. The finite energy signal manifold corresponds to the manifold of the Gaussian distribution with a known covariance matrix, and the manifold of known magnitude spectrum signals is a submanifold. We derive the expressions for the Christoffel symbols and the tensorial equations of the geodesics. This leads to geodesic equations expressed as second order differential equations. We show that the tensor differential equations can be transformed into matrix equations. These equations depend on the parametric model but simplify to only two vectorial equations, which combine the magnitude and phase of the signal and their gradients with respect to the parameters. We compute closed-form expressions of the Fisher-Rao distances for both studied cases and show that the submanifold is non-geodesic, indicating that the Fisher-Rao distance measured within the submanifold is greater than in the full manifold.</description>

      <title>Noise-Robust Self-Testing: Detecting Non-Locality in Noisy Non-Local Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-local games test for non-locality and entanglement in quantum systems and are used in self-tests for certifying quantum states in untrusted devices. However, these protocols are tailored to ideal states, so realistic noise prevents maximal violations and leaves many partially non-local states undetected. Selecting self-tests based on their 'robustness' to noise can tailor protocols to specific applications, but current literature lacks a standardized measure of noise-robustness. Creating such a measure is challenging as there is no operational measure for comparing tests of different dimensionalities and input-output settings. We propose and study three comparative measures: noise-tolerance, convincingness, and an analytic approximation of convincingness called the gapped score. Our computational experiments and analytic framework demonstrate that convincingness provides the most nuanced measure for noise-robustness. We then show that the CHSH game has the highest noise-robustness compared to more complex games (2-CHSH variants and the Magic Square Game) when given equal resources, while with unequal resources, some 2-CHSH variants can outperform CHSH at a high resource cost. This work provides the first systematic and operational framework for comparing noise-robustness in self-testing protocols, laying a foundation for theoretical advances in understanding noise-robustness of self-tests and practical improvements in quantum resource utilization.</description>

      <title>Clarifying orthography: Orthographic transparency as compressibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orthographic transparency -- how directly spelling is related to sound -- lacks a unified, script-agnostic metric. Using ideas from algorithmic information theory, we quantify orthographic transparency in terms of the mutual compressibility between orthographic and phonological strings. Our measure provides a principled way to combine two factors that decrease orthographic transparency, capturing both irregular spellings and rule complexity in one quantity. We estimate our transparency measure using prequential code-lengths derived from neural sequence models. Evaluating 22 languages across a broad range of script types (alphabetic, abjad, abugida, syllabic, logographic) confirms common intuitions about relative transparency of scripts. Mutual compressibility offers a simple, principled, and general yardstick for orthographic transparency.</description>

      <title>Waveform for Next Generation Communication Systems: Comparing Zak-OTFS with OFDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Across the world, there is growing interest in new waveforms, Zak-OTFS in particular, and over-the-air implementations are starting to appear. The choice between OFDM and Zak-OTFS is not so much a choice between waveforms as it is an architectural choice between preventing inter-carrier interference (ICI) and embracing ICI. In OFDM, once the Input-Output (I/O) relation is known, equalization is relatively simple, at least when there is no ICI. However, in the presence of ICI the I/O relation is non-predictable and its acquisition is non-trivial. In contrast, equalization is more involved in Zak-OTFS due to inter-symbol-interference (ISI), however the I/O relation is predictable and its acquisition is simple. {Zak-OTFS exhibits superior performance in doubly-spread 6G use cases with high delay/Doppler channel spreads (i.e., high mobility and/or large cells), but architectural choice is governed by the typical use case, today and in the future. What is typical depends to some degree on geography, since large delay spread is a characteristic of large cells which are the rule rather than the exception in many important wireless markets.} This paper provides a comprehensive performance comparison of cyclic prefix OFDM (CP-OFDM) and Zak-OTFS across the full range of 6G propagation environments. The performance results provide insights into the fundamental architectural choice.</description>

      <title>Subshifts on groups and computable analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of subshifts on groups different from $\mathbb{Z}$, such as $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\geq 2$, has been a subject of intense research in recent years. These investigations have unveiled aremarkable connection between dynamics and recursion theory. Different questions about the dynamics of these systems have been answered in recursion-theoretical terms. In this work we further explore this connection. We use the framework of computable analysis to explore the class of effective dynamical systems on metric spaces, and relate these systems to subshifts of finite type (SFTs) on groups. We prove that every effective dynamical system on a general metric space is the topological factor of an effective dynamical system with topological dimension zero. We combine this result with existing simulation results to obtain new examples of systems that are factors of SFTsWe also study a conjugacy invariant for subshifts on groups called Medvedev degree. This invariant is a complexity measure of algorithmic nature. We develop the basic theory of these degrees for subshifts on arbitrary finitely generated groups. Using these tools we are able to classify the values that this invariant attains for SFTs and other classes of subshifts on several groups. Furthermore, we establish a connection between these degrees and the distribution of isolated points in the space of all subshifts. Motivated by the study of Medvedev degrees of subshifts, we also consider translation-like actions of groups on graphs. We prove that every connected, locally finite, and infinite graph admits a translation by $\mathbb{Z}$, and that this action can be chosen transitive exactly when the graph has one or two ends. This generalizes a result of Seward about translation-like actions of $\mathbb{Z}$ on finitely generated groups.</description>

      <title>Lifting a CSS code via its handlebody realization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a topological approach to lifting a quantum CSS code. In previous work, we proposed lifting a CSS code by constructing covering spaces over its 2D simplicial complex representation, known as the Tanner cone-complex. This idea was inspired by the work of Freedman and Hastings, which associates CSS codes with handlebodies. In this paper, we show how the handlebody realization of a code can also be used to perform code lifting, and we provide a more detailed discussion of why this is essentially equivalent to the Tanner cone-complex approach. As an application, we classify lifts of hypergraph-product codes via their handlebody realization.</description>

      <title>Information-optimal measurement: From fixed sampling protocols to adaptive spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All measurements of continuous signals rely on taking discrete snapshots, with the Nyquist-Shannon theorem dictating sampling paradigms. We present a broader framework of information-optimal measurement, showing that traditional sampling is optimal only when we are entirely ignorant about the system under investigation. This insight unlocks methods that efficiently leverage prior information to overcome long-held fundamental sampling limitations. We demonstrate this for optical spectroscopy - vital to research and medicine - and show how adaptively selected measurements yield higher information in medical blood analysis, optical metrology, and hyperspectral imaging. Through our rigorous statistical framework, performance never falls below conventional sampling while providing complete uncertainty quantification in real time. This establishes a new paradigm where measurement devices operate as information-optimal agents, fundamentally changing how scientific instruments collect and process data.</description>

      <title>Cryptocurrencies in the Balance Sheet: Insights from (Micro)Strategy -- Bitcoin Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the evolving link between cryptocurrency and equity markets in the context of the recent wave of corporate Bitcoin (BTC) treasury strategies. We assemble a dataset of 39 publicly listed firms holding BTC, from their first acquisition through April 2025. Using daily logarithmic returns, we first document significant positive co-movements via Pearson correlations and single factor model regressions, discovering an average BTC beta of 0.62, and isolating 12 companies, including Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy, MSTR), exhibiting a beta exceeding 1. We then classify firms into three groups reflecting their exposure to BTC, liquidity, and return co-movements. We use transfer entropy (TE) to capture the direction of information flow over time. Transfer entropy analysis consistently identifies BTC as the dominant information driver, with brief, announcement-driven feedback from stocks to BTC during major financial events. Our results highlight the critical need for dynamic hedging ratios that adapt to shifting information flows. These findings provide important insights for investors and managers regarding risk management and portfolio diversification in a period of growing integration of digital assets into corporate treasuries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework for generic decoding of convolutional codes, which allows us to do cryptanalysis of code-based systems that use convolutional codes. We then apply this framework to information set decoding, study success probabilities and give tools to choose variables. Finally, we use this to attack two cryptosystems based on convolutional codes. In the first, our code recovered about 74% of errors in less than 10 hours each, and in the second case, we give experimental evidence that 80% of the errors can be recovered in times corresponding to about 70 bits of operational security, with some instances being significantly lower.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Geometry and Dynamical System Analysis of Walker Satellite Constellations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In practice, low Earth orbit (LEO) and medium Earth orbit (MEO) satellite networks consist of multiple orbits which are populated with many satellites. A widely used spatial architecture for LEO or MEO satellites is the Walker constellation, where the longitudes of orbits are equally spaced and the satellites are equally spaced along the orbits. In this paper, we develop a stochastic geometry model for the Walker constellations. This proposed model enables an analysis based on dynamical system theory, which allows one to address essential structural properties such as periodicity and ergodicity. It also enables a stochastic geometry analysis under which we derive the performance of downlink communications of a typical user at a given latitude, as a function of the key constellation parameters.</description>

      <title>Optimal Neural Compressors for the Rate-Distortion-Perception Tradeoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17558</link>

Abstract: Recent efforts in neural compression have focused on the rate-distortion-perception (RDP) tradeoff, where the perception constraint ensures the source and reconstruction distributions are close in terms of a statistical divergence. Theoretical work on RDP describes properties of RDP-optimal compressors without providing constructive and low complexity solutions. While classical rate distortion theory shows that optimal compressors should efficiently pack space, RDP theory additionally shows that infinite randomness shared between the encoder and decoder may be necessary for RDP optimality. In this paper, we propose neural compressors that are low complexity and benefit from high packing efficiency through lattice coding and shared randomness through shared dithering over the lattice cells. For two important settings, namely infinite shared and zero shared randomness, we analyze the RDP tradeoff achieved by our proposed neural compressors and show optimality in both cases. Experimentally, we investigate the roles that these two components of our design, lattice coding and randomness, play in the performance of neural compressors on synthetic and real-world data. We observe that performance improves with more shared randomness and better lattice packing.</description>

      <title>Property Inheritance for Subtensors in Tensor Train Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor dimensionality reduction is one of the fundamental tools for modern data science. To address the high computational overhead, fiber-wise sampled subtensors that preserve the original tensor rank are often used in designing efficient and scalable tensor dimensionality reduction. However, the theory of property inheritance for subtensors is still underdevelopment, that is, how the essential properties of the original tensor will be passed to its subtensors. This paper theoretically studies the property inheritance of the two key tensor properties, namely incoherence and condition number, under the tensor train setting. We also show how tensor train rank is preserved through fiber-wise sampling. The key parameters introduced in theorems are numerically evaluated under various settings. The results show that the properties of interest can be well preserved to the subtensors formed via fiber-wise sampling. Overall, this paper provides several handy analytic tools for developing efficient tensor analysis methods.</description>

      <title>Unifying concepts in information-theoretic time-series analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information theory is a powerful framework for quantifying complexity, uncertainty, and dynamical structure in time-series data, with widespread applicability across disciplines such as physics, finance, and neuroscience. However, the literature on these measures remains fragmented, with domain-specific terminologies, inconsistent mathematical notation, and disparate visualization conventions that hinder interdisciplinary integration. This work addresses these challenges by unifying key information-theoretic time-series measures through shared semantic definitions, standardized mathematical notation, and cohesive visual representations. We compare these measures in terms of their theoretical foundations, computational formulations, and practical interpretability -- mapping them onto a common conceptual space through an illustrative case study with functional magnetic resonance imaging time series in the brain. This case study exemplifies the complementary insights these measures offer in characterizing the dynamics of complex neural systems, such as signal complexity and information flow. By providing a structured synthesis, our work aims to enhance interdisciplinary dialogue and methodological adoption, which is particularly critical for reproducibility and interoperability in computational neuroscience. More broadly, our framework serves as a resource for researchers seeking to navigate and apply information-theoretic time-series measures to diverse complex systems.</description>

      <title>An early warning system for emerging markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Financial markets of emerging economies are vulnerable to extreme and cascading information spillovers, surges, sudden stops and reversals. With this in mind, we develop a new online early warning system (EWS) to detect what is referred to as `concept drift' in machine learning, as a `regime shift' in economics and as a `change-point' in statistics. The system explores nonlinearities in financial information flows and remains robust to heavy tails and dependence of extremes. The key component is the use of conditional entropy, which captures shifts in various channels of information transmission, not only in conditional mean or variance. We design a baseline method, and adapt it to a modern high-dimensional setting through the use of random forests and copulas. We show the relevance of each system component to the analysis of emerging markets. The new approach detects significant shifts where conventional methods fail. We explore when this happens using simulations and we provide two illustrations when the methods generate meaningful warnings. The ability to detect changes early helps improve resilience in emerging markets against shocks and provides new economic and financial insights into their operation.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Uncertainty Quantification via Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new and intuitive metric for aleatoric uncertainty quantification (UQ), the prevalence of class collisions defined as the same input being observed in different classes. We use the rate of class collisions to define the collision matrix, a novel and uniquely fine-grained measure of uncertainty. For a classification problem involving $K$ classes, the $K\times K$ collision matrix $S$ measures the inherent difficulty in distinguishing between each pair of classes. We discuss several applications of the collision matrix, establish its fundamental mathematical properties, as well as show its relationship with existing UQ methods, including the Bayes error rate (BER). We also address the new problem of estimating the collision matrix using one-hot labeled data by proposing a series of innovative techniques to estimate $S$. First, we learn a pair-wise contrastive model which accepts two inputs and determines if they belong to the same class. We then show that this contrastive model (which is PAC learnable) can be used to estimate the Gramian matrix of $S$, defined as $G=S^TS$. Finally, we show that under reasonable assumptions, $G$ can be used to uniquely recover $S$, a new result on non-negative matrices which could be of independent interest. With a method to estimate $S$ established, we demonstrate how this estimate of $S$, in conjunction with the contrastive model, can be used to estimate the posterior class portability distribution of any point. Experimental results are also presented to validate our methods of estimating the collision matrix and class posterior distributions on several datasets.</description>

      <title>STAR-RIS-Enabled Multi-Path Beam Routing with Passive Beam Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14234v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can be densely deployed in the environment to create multi-reflection line-of-sight (LoS) links for signal coverage enhancement. However, conventional reflection-only RISs can only achieve half-space reflection, which limits the LoS path diversity. In contrast, simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RISs (STAR-RISs) can achieve full-space reflection and transmission, thereby creating more LoS paths. Hence, in this paper, we study a new multi-STAR-RIS-aided communication system, where a multi-antenna base station (BS) transmits to multiple single-antenna users by exploiting the signal beam routing over a set of cascaded LoS paths each formed by multiple STAR-RISs. To reveal essential insights, we first consider a simplified single-user case, aiming to maximize its received signal power by jointly optimizing the active beamforming at the BS, the BS's power allocation over different paths, the number of selected beam-routing paths, the selected STAR-RISs for each path, as well as their amplitude and phase shifts for transmission/reflection. However, this problem is difficult to be optimally solved as different paths may be intricately coupled at their shared STAR-RISs. To tackle this difficulty, we first derive the optimal solution to this problem in closed-form for a given set of paths. The clique-based approach in graph theory is then applied to solve the remaining multi-path selection problem efficiently. Next, we extend the proposed clique-based method to the multi-user case to maximize the minimum received signal power among all users, subject to additional constraints on the disjointness of the selected paths for different users. Simulation results show that our proposed STAR-RIS-enabled beam routing outperforms the conventional beam routing with reflection-only RISs in both single- and multi-user cases.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneity Matters even More in Distributed Learning: Study from Generalization Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effect of data heterogeneity across clients on the performance of distributed learning systems, i.e., one-round Federated Learning, as measured by the associated generalization error. Specifically, $K$ clients have each $n$ training samples generated independently according to a possibly different data distribution, and their individually chosen models are aggregated by a central server. We study the effect of the discrepancy between the clients' data distributions on the generalization error of the aggregated model. First, we establish in-expectation and tail upper bounds on the generalization error in terms of the distributions. In part, the bounds extend the popular Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) bound, which was developed for the centralized learning setting, i.e., $K=1$, to the distributed learning setting with an arbitrary number of clients $K \geq 1$. Then, we connect with information-theoretic rate-distortion theory to derive possibly tighter \textit{lossy} versions of these bounds. Next, we apply our lossy bounds to study the effect of data heterogeneity across clients on the generalization error for the distributed classification problem in which each client uses Support Vector Machines (DSVM). In this case, we establish explicit generalization error bounds that depend explicitly on the data heterogeneity degree. It is shown that the bound gets smaller as the degree of data heterogeneity across clients increases, thereby suggesting that DSVM generalizes better when the dissimilarity between the clients' training samples is bigger. This finding, which goes beyond DSVM, is validated experimentally through several experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Hybrid Reinforcement Learning Framework for Dynamic Path Planning in Autonomous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel quantum classical hybrid framework is proposed that synergizes quantum with Classical Reinforcement Learning. By leveraging the inherent parallelism of quantum computing, the proposed approach generates robust Q tables and specialized turn cost estimations, which are then integrated with a classical Reinforcement Learning pipeline. The Classical Quantum fusion results in rapid convergence of training, reducing the training time significantly and improved adaptability in scenarios featuring static, dynamic, and moving obstacles. Simulator based evaluations demonstrate significant enhancements in path efficiency, trajectory smoothness, and mission success rates, underscoring the potential of framework for real time, autonomous navigation in complex and unpredictable environments. Furthermore, the proposed framework was tested beyond simulations on practical scenarios, including real world map data such as the IIT Delhi campus, reinforcing its potential for real time, autonomous navigation in complex and unpredictable environments.</description>
