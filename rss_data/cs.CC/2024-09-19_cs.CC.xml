      <title>The Sample Complexity of Smooth Boosting and the Tightness of the Hardcore Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smooth boosters generate distributions that do not place too much weight on any given example. Originally introduced for their noise-tolerant properties, such boosters have also found applications in differential privacy, reproducibility, and quantum learning theory. We study and settle the sample complexity of smooth boosting: we exhibit a class that can be weak learned to $\gamma$-advantage over smooth distributions with $m$ samples, for which strong learning over the uniform distribution requires $\tilde{\Omega}(1/\gamma^2)\cdot m$ samples. This matches the overhead of existing smooth boosters and provides the first separation from the setting of distribution-independent boosting, for which the corresponding overhead is $O(1/\gamma)$.
  Our work also sheds new light on Impagliazzo's hardcore theorem from complexity theory, all known proofs of which can be cast in the framework of smooth boosting. For a function $f$ that is mildly hard against size-$s$ circuits, the hardcore theorem provides a set of inputs on which $f$ is extremely hard against size-$s'$ circuits. A downside of this important result is the loss in circuit size, i.e. that $s' \ll s$. Answering a question of Trevisan, we show that this size loss is necessary and in fact, the parameters achieved by known proofs are the best possible.</description>

      <title>Computational Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the computational complexity theory of smooth, finite-dimensional dynamical systems. Building off of previous work, we give definitions for what it means for a smooth dynamical system to simulate a Turing machine. We then show that 'chaotic' dynamical systems (more precisely, Axiom A systems) and 'integrable' dynamical systems (more generally, measure-preserving systems) cannot robustly simulate universal Turing machines, although such machines can be robustly simulated by other kinds of dynamical systems. Subsequently, we show that any Turing machine that can be encoded into a structurally stable one-dimensional dynamical system must have a decidable halting problem, and moreover an explicit time complexity bound in instances where it does halt. More broadly, our work elucidates what it means for one 'machine' to simulate another, and emphasizes the necessity of defining low-complexity 'encoders' and 'decoders' to translate between the dynamics of the simulation and the system being simulated. We highlight how the notion of a computational dynamical system leads to questions at the intersection of computational complexity theory, dynamical systems theory, and real algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>NP-completeness of Tiling Finite Simply Connected Regions with a Fixed Set of Wang Tiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computational complexity of tiling finite simply connected regions with a fixed set of tiles is studied in this paper. We show that the problem of tiling simply connected regions with a fixed set of $23$ Wang tiles is NP-complete. As a consequence, the problem of tiling simply connected regions with a fixed set of $111$ rectangles is NP-complete. Our results improve that of Igor Pak and Jed Yang by using fewer numbers of tiles. Notably in the case of Wang tiles, the number has decreased by more than one third from $35$ to $23$.</description>

      <title>Character Complexity: A Novel Measure for Quantum Circuit Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09641v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of quantum computing, quantifying circuit complexity remains a critical challenge. This paper introduces Character Complexity, a novel measure that bridges Group-theoretic concepts with practical quantum computing concerns. By leveraging tools from representation theory, I prove several key properties of character complexity and establish a surprising connection to the classical simulability of quantum circuits. This new measure offers a fresh perspective on the complexity landscape of quantum algorithms, potentially reshaping our understanding of quantum-classical computational boundaries. I present innovative visualization methods for character complexity, providing intuitive insights into the structure of quantum circuits. The empirical results reveal intriguing scaling behaviors with respect to qubit and gate counts, opening new avenues for quantum algorithm design and optimization. This work not only contributes to the theoretical foundations of quantum complexity but also offers practical tools for the quantum computing community. As quantum hardware continues to advance, character complexity could play a crucial role in developing more efficient quantum algorithms and in exploring the fundamental limits of quantum computation.</description>
