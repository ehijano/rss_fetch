      <title>U-Net-based surrogate modeling for attosecond X-ray free-electron lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attosecond X-ray pulse generation in modern X-ray free-electron lasers relies on strongly compressed, precisely tailored electron bunches, making accurate diagnostics and control of the longitudinal phase space (LPS) essential. In the self-chirping scheme, collective effects in the linac generate a strong energy chirp that is converted into high peak current through pre-undulator compression, enabling isolated attosecond pulse generation. Reliable operation of this scheme depends on precise LPS control and fast diagnostics. In this work, we present a U-Net-based neural network surrogate that predicts two-dimensional LPS distributions directly from accelerator settings. The model exhibits excellent agreement with start-to-end simulation results. These results demonstrate the potential of neural network surrogates to facilitate real-time tuning and control in attosecond X-ray pulse generation.</description>

      <title>Introduction to the Mechanical Design of Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle accelerators represent some of the most sophisticated engineering achievements of our time. Their construction requires a unique combination of physics insight and mechanical engineering expertise. The aim of this paper is to provide young mechanical engineers with an introduction to the principles, methods, and challenges associated with the mechanical design of accelerators. The lecture upon which this proceeding is based emphasized the translation of functional requirements into engineering specifications, the critical importance of robust and reliable design, and the need for precisely defined drawings supported by international standards such as ISO GPS and GD&amp;T. Through illustrative examples and a practical case inspired by CERN's existing components, the paper underlines the necessity of anticipating lifecycle demands, ensuring manufacturability, and safeguarding operational reliability. Particular emphasis is placed on the contractual value of 2D drawings, the practical application of functional dimensioning, and tolerance chain analysis. By reviewing common pitfalls and exploring best practices, the paper seeks to orient engineers towards design choices that balance cost, reliability, and performance.</description>

      <title>Vacuum in Accelerators for Mechanical &amp; Materials Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vacuum systems are an intrinsic part of any accelerator around the world: all particles circulate under vacuum. This lecture gives rudiments on the fundamentals of vacuum science such as units, ideal gas law, partial pressure, mean free path, flow of molecules, conductance, pumping speed, and outgassing. An overview of standard vacuum instruments for pressure measurement and pumping is presented. Finally, the specificities of accelerator vacuum systems are introduced, discussing some design, construction, installation, and commissioning aspects, as well as fundamentals of beam-vacuum interactions with synchrotron radiation and electron cloud.</description>

      <title>Limitations of emittance and source size measurement of laser-accelerated electron beams using the pepper-pot mask method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pepper-pot method is a widely used technique, originally proposed for measuring the emittance of space-charge-dominated electron beams from radio-frequency photoinjectors. With recent advances in producing high-brightness electron beams via laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA), the method has also been applied to evaluate emittance in this new regime. Here, the limitations of this method for measuring the emittance of LWFA electron beams are investigated, particularly in parameter regimes where the true beam emittance is overestimated. Conducting an experiment at the JETi200 laser system, we measured an upper bound for the geometric beam emittance of $(26.2 \pm 7.3)$ $\mu$m mrad using the pepper-pot method. This result is consistent with GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulation of the pepper-pot diagnostic, with an input beam-emittance parameter that matches both PIC simulations of the laser-plasma accelerator and an independent measurement using the transient optical grating method.</description>
