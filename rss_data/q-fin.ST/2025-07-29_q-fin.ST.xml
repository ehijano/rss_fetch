      <title>Determinants of Saving Behavior Among Employees in Dhaka, Bangladesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose With an emphasis on elements like financial knowledge, financial attitude, social influence, financial self-efficacy, and financial management practices, this study explores the factors that influence employees' saving behavior in Dhaka, Bangladesh. We also welcome others to work on saving behavior, which is the main reason for publishing. The purpose is to make others aware of the methods for quantitative financial behavior analysis in Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach The study uses a quantitative approach with a cross-sectional survey design. Data was collected from 40 participants through a structured questionnaire adapted from reliable sources. The questionnaire captured demographic information and used established items to measure the key variables. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, reliability analysis using Cronbachs alpha, and regression analysis to test the hypothesized relationships. Findings The results indicate that among the factors examined, only financial management practices had a significant positive relationship with saving behavior. Rest of the factors did not show significant relationships with saving behavior in this study sample. Limitation or Disclaimer It is still a work in progress, this paper is meant for pre-print with mostly incomplete and limited data. No data cleaning was performed, so it is very likely to include outliers and faulty data. Originality or value This study contributes to the limited research on saving behavior determinants in the Bangladeshi context, specifically among employees in the capital city of Dhaka. It explores the influence of multiple factors, including the rarely studied aspect of social influence.</description>

      <title>Slomads Rising: Stay Length Shifts in Digital Nomad Travel, United States 2019-2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using every U.S. Airbnb reservation created from 1 January 2019 through 31 December 2024, weighted by nights booked, we document a lasting shift toward longer stays after the COVID 19 shock. Mean nights per booking rose from 3.7 before the pandemic to a stable 4.1 to 4.4 after 2021; the median increased from two to three nights and the weighted standard deviation nearly doubled to seven nights, indicating a heavier tail. Negative binomial regression shows that, relative to the restriction period, post vaccine bookings are 6.5 percent shorter and pre pandemic bookings 16 percent shorter, with only mild seasonality. A hurdle model finds that the probability of a stay of at least 28 nights nearly doubled during restrictions (1.5 percent to 2.9 percent) and has settled at 2.2 percent since, while the conditional mean of long stays remains 43 to 46 nights. Hence the higher average arises chiefly from a greater frequency, not length of month plus stays. These results indicate that remote work "slomads" have durably thickened the long stay tail of the U.S. short term rental market, with implications for pricing, inventory management, and taxation.</description>

      <title>Markowitz Variance May Vastly Undervalue or Overestimate Portfolio Variance and Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the investor who doesn't trade shares of his portfolio. The investor only observes the current trades made in the market with his securities to estimate the current return, variance, and risks of his unchanged portfolio. We show how the time series of consecutive trades made in the market with the securities of the portfolio can determine the time series that model the trades with the portfolio as with a single security. That establishes the equal description of the market-based variance of the securities and of the portfolio composed of these securities that account for the fluctuations of the volumes of the consecutive trades. We show that Markowitz's (1952) variance describes only the approximation when all volumes of the consecutive trades with securities are assumed constant. The market-based variance depends on the coefficient of variation of fluctuations of volumes of trades. To emphasize this dependence and to estimate possible deviation from Markowitz variance, we derive the Taylor series of the market-based variance up to the 2nd term by the coefficient of variation, taking Markowitz variance as a zero approximation. We consider three limiting cases with low and high fluctuations of the portfolio returns, and with a zero covariance of trade values and volumes and show that the impact of the coefficient of variation of trade volume fluctuations can cause Markowitz's assessment to highly undervalue or overestimate the market-based variance of the portfolio. Incorrect assessments of the variances of securities and of the portfolio cause wrong risk estimates, disturb optimal portfolio selection, and result in unexpected losses. The major investors, portfolio managers, and developers of macroeconomic models like BlackRock, JP Morgan, and the U.S. Fed should use market-based variance to adjust their predictions to the randomness of market trades.</description>
