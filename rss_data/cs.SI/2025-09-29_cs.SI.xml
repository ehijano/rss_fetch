      <title>Message passing for epidemiological interventions on networks with loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spreading models capture key dynamics on networks, such as cascading failures in economic systems, (mis)information diffusion, and pathogen transmission. Here, we focus on design intervention problems -- for example, designing optimal vaccination rollouts or wastewater surveillance systems -- which can be solved by comparing outcomes under various counterfactuals. A leading approach to computing these outcomes is message passing, which allows for the rapid and direct computation of the marginal probabilities for each node. However, despite its efficiency, classical message passing tends to overestimate outbreak sizes on real-world networks, leading to incorrect predictions and, thus, interventions. Here, we improve these estimates by using the neighborhood message passing (NMP) framework for the epidemiological calculations. We evaluate the quality of the improved algorithm and demonstrate how it can be used to test possible solutions to three intervention design problems: influence maximization, optimal vaccination, and sentinel surveillance.</description>

      <title>Attributed Hypergraph Generation with Realistic Interplay Between Structure and Attributes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, interactions happen in a group-wise manner with multiple entities, and therefore, hypergraphs are a suitable tool to accurately represent such interactions. Hyperedges in real-world hypergraphs are not composed of randomly selected nodes but are instead formed through structured processes. Consequently, various hypergraph generative models have been proposed to explore fundamental mechanisms underlying hyperedge formation. However, most existing hypergraph generative models do not account for node attributes, which can play a significant role in hyperedge formation. As a result, these models fail to reflect the interactions between structure and node attributes. To address the issue above, we propose NoAH, a stochastic hypergraph generative model for attributed hypergraphs. NoAH utilizes the core-fringe node hierarchy to model hyperedge formation as a series of node attachments and determines attachment probabilities based on node attributes. We further introduce NoAHFit, a parameter learning procedure that allows NoAH to replicate a given real-world hypergraph. Through experiments on nine datasets across four different domains, we show that NoAH with NoAHFit more accurately reproduces the structure-attribute interplay observed in the real-world hypergraphs than eight baseline hypergraph generative models, in terms of six metrics.</description>

      <title>Reimagining Agent-based Modeling with Large Language Model Agents via Shachi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of emergent behaviors in large language model (LLM)-driven multi-agent systems is a critical research challenge, yet progress is limited by a lack of principled methodologies for controlled experimentation. To address this, we introduce Shachi, a formal methodology and modular framework that decomposes an agent's policy into core cognitive components: Configuration for intrinsic traits, Memory for contextual persistence, and Tools for expanded capabilities, all orchestrated by an LLM reasoning engine. This principled architecture moves beyond brittle, ad-hoc agent designs and enables the systematic analysis of how specific architectural choices influence collective behavior. We validate our methodology on a comprehensive 10-task benchmark and demonstrate its power through novel scientific inquiries. Critically, we establish the external validity of our approach by modeling a real-world U.S. tariff shock, showing that agent behaviors align with observed market reactions only when their cognitive architecture is appropriately configured with memory and tools. Our work provides a rigorous, open-source foundation for building and evaluating LLM agents, aimed at fostering more cumulative and scientifically grounded research.</description>

      <title>Modularity and random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work will appear as a chapter in a forthcoming volume titled `Topics in Probabilistic Graph Theory'.
  For a given graph $G$, each partition of the vertices has a modularity score, with higher values indicating that the partition better captures community structure in $G$. The modularity $q^*(G)$ of $G$ is the maximum over all vertex-partitions of the modularity score, and satisfies $0\leq q^*(G)&lt; 1$. Modularity lies at the heart of the most popular algorithms for community detection. In this chapter we discuss the behaviour of the modularity of various kinds of random graphs, starting with the binomial random graph $G_{n,p}$ with $n$ vertices and edge-probability $p$.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of A National Digitally-Enabled Health Promotion Campaign for Mental Health Awareness using Social Media Platforms Tik Tok, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mental health disorders rank among the 10 leading contributors to the global burden of diseases, yet persistent stigma and care barriers delay early intervention. This has inspired efforts to leverage digital platforms for scalable health promotion to engage at-risk populations. To evaluate the effectiveness of a digitally-enabled mental health promotion (DEHP) campaign, we conducted an observational cross-sectional study of a 3-month (February-April 2025) nation-wide campaign in Singapore. Campaign materials were developed using a marketing funnel framework and disseminated across YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. This included narrative videos and infographics to promote symptom awareness, coping strategies, and/or patient navigation to Singapore's Mindline website, as the intended endpoint for user engagement and support. Primary outcomes include anonymised performance analytics (impressions, unique reach, video content view, engagements) stratified by demographics, device types, and sector. Secondary outcomes measured cost-efficiency metrics and traffic to the Mindline website respectively. This campaign generated 3.49 million total impressions and reached 1.39 million unique residents, with a Cost Per Click at 29.33 SGD, Cost Per Mille at 26.90 SGD and Cost Per Action at 6.06 SGD. Narrative videos accumulated over 630,000 views and 18,768 engagements. Overall, we demonstrate that DEHP campaigns can achieve national engagement for mental health awareness through multi-channel distribution and creative, narrative-driven designs.</description>

      <title>The Internet of Us</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social Media and the Internet have catalyzed an unprecedented potential for exposure to human diversity in terms of demographics, language, culture, knowledge, opinions, talents and the like. Access to people's diversity gives us the possibility of exploiting skills and competences that we do not have, that we may not even know they exist, the so called unknown unknowns, but which, however, could be exactly what we need when looking for help in the solution of the our current problem. However, this potential has not come with new, much needed, instruments and skills to harness the complications which rise when trying to exploit the diversity of people. This paper presents our vision of the Internet of Us (IoU), a new type of online diversity-aware social interactions capable of promoting richer and deeper social relations. We discuss the multiple facets of diversity in social settings and the multidisciplinary work that is required to reap the benefits of the IoU, towards a IoU-enabled diversity-aware hybrid human-AI society.</description>

      <title>Using Generative AI to Uncover What Drives Player Enjoyment in PC and VR Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16596v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As video games continue to evolve, understanding what drives player enjoyment remains a key challenge. Player reviews provide valuable insights, but their unstructured nature makes large-scale analysis difficult. This study applies generative AI and machine learning, leveraging Microsoft Phi-4 small language model (SLM) and Google Cloud, to quantify and analyze game reviews from Steam and Meta Quest stores. The approach converts qualitative feedback into structured data, enabling comprehensive evaluation of key game design elements, monetization models, and platform-specific trends. The findings reveal distinct patterns in player preferences across PC and VR games, highlighting factors that contribute to higher player enjoyment. By using Google Cloud for large scale data storage and processing, this study establishes a scalable framework for game review analysis. The study's insights offer actionable guidance for game developers, helping optimize game mechanics, pricing strategies, and player engagement.</description>
