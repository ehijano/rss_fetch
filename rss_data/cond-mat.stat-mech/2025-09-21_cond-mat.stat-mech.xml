      <title>Surface diffusion: The intermediate scattering function seen as a characteristic function of probability theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In surface diffusion, one of the key observables is the so-called intermediate scattering function which is measured directly from the surface technique called Helium spin echo. In this work, we show that this function can be seen as a characteristic function of probability theory. From the characteristic function, the moments and cumulants of the probability distribution function of the position of the adsorbate are straightforward obtained in an analytical way; in particular, the second order which is related to the diffusion coefficient. In order to illustrate this simple theory, we have focused on the incoherent tunneling of H and D on a Pt(111) surface where only jumps between nearest neighbor sites have been reported experimentally. Finally, an extension to jumps to more than nearest neighbors has also been considered.</description>

      <title>Entropic balance with feedback control: information equalities and tight inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider overdamped physical systems evolving under a feedback-controlled fluctuating potential and in contact with a thermal bath at temperature $T$. A Markovian description of the dynamics, which keeps only the last value of the control action, is advantageous -- both from the theoretical and the practical side -- for the entropy balance. Novel second-law equalities and bounds for the extractable work are obtained, the latter being both tighter and easier to evaluate than those in the literature based on the whole chain of controller actions. The Markovian framework also allows us to prove that the bound for the extractable work that incorporates the unavailable information is saturated in a wide class of physical systems, for error-free measurements. These results are illustrated in a model system. For imperfect measurements, there appears an interval of measurement uncertainty, including the point at which work ceases to be extracted, where the new Markovian bound is tighter than the unavailable information bound.</description>

      <title>Training thermodynamic computers by gradient descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to adjust the parameters of a thermodynamic computer by gradient descent in order to perform a desired computation at a specified observation time. Within a digital simulation of a thermodynamic computer, training proceeds by maximizing the probability with which the computer would generate an idealized dynamical trajectory. The idealized trajectory is designed to reproduce the activations of a neural network trained to perform the desired computation. This teacher-student scheme results in a thermodynamic computer whose finite-time dynamics enacts a computation analogous to that of the neural network. The parameters identified in this way can be implemented in the hardware realization of the thermodynamic computer, which will perform the desired computation automatically, driven by thermal noise. We demonstrate the method on a standard image-classification task, and estimate the thermodynamic advantage -- the ratio of energy costs of the digital and thermodynamic implementations -- to exceed seven orders of magnitude. Our results establish gradient descent as a viable training method for thermodynamic computing, enabling application of the core methodology of machine learning to this emerging field.</description>

      <title>Spectral Characterization of Wave Scattering at a Granular-Elastic Solid Interface: From Hyperbolic Wave Propagation to Near-Parabolic Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method based on acoustic wavenumber imaging algorithms to quantify the spectral content of strongly nonlinear energy scattering of a propagating wavefront across the discrete-continuum interface of a 2D hybrid system composed of an ordered granular layer in contact with a thin elastic plate. We consider snapshots of the transmitted wavefront at given time instants, which are filtered across the wavenumber domain by applying the spatial Fourier Transform (FT), and then the filtered wavefields are transformed back to the spatial domain by inverse spatial FT. This yields a spectral decomposition of the given snapshots at varying center wavenumbers. Based on this postprocessing method, the scattering of the kinetic energy in the receiving medium (plate) can be studied in the wavenumber-time domain, proving a quantitative measure of the nonlinear scattering of the transmitted wavefront by the strongly nonlinear 2D granular layer. This postprocessing method enables the detailed quantitative study of the scattering and spectral energy redistribution of propagating wavepackets in elastic media with embedded linear or nonlinear layers or inclusions. In addition, we show that the spectral evolution of receiving plate with a granular interface exhibits diffusion-like behavior in the wavenumber domain, drawing an analogy between parabolic heat diffusion and classical hyperbolic elsatodynamic energy transport.</description>

      <title>A stochastic heat engine driven using a nonlinear protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A colloidal particle confined in a time-dependent optical trap can function as a microscopic heat engine, with optimization strategies playing a crucial role in enhancing its performance. In this study, we numerically investigate a Stirling heat engine operating in both passive and active environments using a protocol inspired by the Engineered Swift Equilibration (ESE) method. This approach differs from the standard process and focuses on enhancing engine efficiency, particularly at short time scales. We analyze various fluctuating parameters throughout the cycle to validate the robustness of the engine, and demonstrate a significant enhancement in performance compared to conventional Stirling engines. Most crucially, we observe that the nonlinear protocol can even transform a heat-pump-like operation into a genuine heat engine under strong activity, thereby surpassing bounds imposed on efficiency by high-temperature and quasi-static conditions. Finally, the proposed protocol is designed with experimental feasibility in mind, making it a promising framework for the practical realization of efficient microscopic heat engines.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Driven Transitions between Area Law Phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, quantum circuits consisting of unitary gates and projective measurements have become valuable tools for stimulating or preparing quantum many-body states with non-trivial properties. Here, we introduce and examine a measurement-only circuit (the projective quantum Ising model with three-spin interactions) that involves three non-commuting projective measurements. This model features three distinct phases, separated by two critical lines. We utilize two entanglement measures (topological entanglement entropy and mutual information) to identify the phase boundaries and derive various critical exponents through scaling analysis. We establish a relationship between our model and a two-dimensional statistical model (bond percolation) within certain limits. We hope that our results will shed light on further studies using other measurement-only models.</description>

      <title>Phase Behavior and Ion Transport in Lithium-Niobium-Tantalum Oxide Alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium niobate-tantalate mixtures have garnered considerable interest for their ability to merge the desirable properties of both end members, enabling diverse high-value applications, such as high-performance faradaic capacitors, non-linear optics, and protective coatings in rechargeable batteries. While numerous studies on the application of $\mathrm{LiNb_xTa_{1-x}O_3}$ exist, the phase behavior and properties of $\mathrm{Li_3Nb_xTa_{1-x}O_4}$ remain largely unexplored. In this work, we employ a multiscale approach that encompasses first-principles phonon calculations, cluster expansion, and Monte Carlo simulations to derive the temperature-composition phase diagram for $\mathrm{Li_3Nb_xTa_{1-x}O_4}$. Our findings reveal the critical role of vibrational entropy in accurately predicting phase stability, which promotes the solubility of Nb in $\mathrm{Li_3TaO_4}$ while suppressing the miscibility of Ta in $\mathrm{Li_3NbO_4}$. Additionally, we demonstrate that Nb/Ta mixing offers a promising avenue for tailoring the Li-ion conductivities of $\mathrm{Li_3Nb_xTa_{1-x}O_4}$. On the technical side, we demonstrated the importance of including vibrational entropy effects explicitly in Monte Carlo simulations dealing with multicomponent systems, beyond simple binary mixtures. On the application side, this study provides fundamental insights into the phase behavior and Li-ion transport properties of $\mathrm{Li_3Nb_xTa_{1-x}O_4}$, paving the way for its potential applications in energy storage and other fields.</description>

      <title>Monitored Fluctuating Hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a hydrodynamic framework for describing monitored classical stochastic processes. We study the conditional ensembles for these monitored processes -- i.e., we compute spacetime correlation functions conditioned on a fixed, typical measurement record. In the presence of global symmetries we show that these conditional ensembles can undergo measurement-induced "sharpening" phase transitions as a function of the monitoring rate; moreover, even weak monitoring can give rise to novel critical phases, derived entirely from a classical perspective. We give a simple hydrodynamic derivation of the known "charge-fuzzy phase" for weakly monitored diffusive many-body quantum systems. We show that although the unmonitored symmetric and asymmetric exclusion processes are in different universality classes of transport, the fluctuations in their conditional ensembles flow to the same fixed point with emergent relativistic invariance under monitoring. On the other hand, weakly monitored systems with non-Abelian symmetries enter a novel strongly coupled fixed point with non-trivial dynamical exponent, which we characterize. Our formalism naturally accounts for monitoring general observables, such as currents or density gradients, and allows for a direct calculation of information-theoretic diagnostics of sharpening transitions, including the Shannon entropy of the measurement record.</description>

Abstract: Stochastic storage models based on essentially non-Gaussian noise are considered. The stochastic description of physical systems based on stochastic storage models is associated with generalized Poisson (or shot) noise, in which the jump values can be quite large. Stochastic storage models have a direct physical meaning: some elements enter the system and leave it. Storage processes fit into the general scheme of dynamic systems subject to the additive influence of a random process. The main relationships of storage models are described, and the possibilities of applying the mathematical provisions of stochastic storage processes to various physical problems are indicated. A number of examples of applying the stochastic storage model are considered.</description>

      <title>Manipulating phases in many-body interacting systems with subsystem resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stabilizing thermodynamically unstable phases in many-body systems, such as suppressing pathological neuronal synchronization in Parkinson's disease or maintaining magnetic order across broad temperature ranges, remains a persistent challenge. In traditional approaches, such phases are stabilized through intervening in the dynamics of all system constituents or introducing additional interactions. Here, we offer a hitherto-unexplored alternative, namely, subsystem resetting, whereby intervention in the dynamics of only a part of the system, and that too only occasionally in time, is implemented through resetting its state to a reset configuration. Just playing with a few parameters, e.g., the nature of the reset configuration and the size of the reset subsystem, one achieves a remarkable and robust control over the phase diagram of the bare dynamics. We demonstrate that these universal effects span a wide variety of scenarios, including equilibrium and non-equilibrium, mean-field and non-mean-field dynamics, with and without quenched disorder. Despite the challenges posed by memory effects, we obtain explicit analytical predictions, validated by simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantum quenches with long range interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the theory of quantum quenches to the case of $d$-dimensional homogeneous systems with long range interactions. This is achieved treating the long range interactions as switched on by the quench and performing the derivation within the basis of asymptotic states of the short range interacting pre-quench theory. In this way we analytically determine the post-quench state and the one-point functions of local observables such as the order parameter. One implication is that, as in the short range case, some oscillations induced by the quench remain undamped at large times under conditions specified by the theory. This explains, in particular, why such undamped oscillations have been numerically observed also in presence of long range interactions.</description>

      <title>Phase transition properties via partition function zeros: The Blume-Capel ferromagnet revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the landmark work of Lee and Yang, locating the zeros of the partition function in the complex magnetic-field plane has become a powerful method for studying phase transitions. Fisher later extended this approach to complex temperatures, and subsequent generalizations introduced other control parameters, such as the crystal field. In previous works [Moueddene et al, J. Stat. Mech. (2024) 023206; Phys. Rev. E 110, 064144 (2024)] we applied this framework to the two- and three-dimensional Blume-Capel model -- a system with a rich phase structure where a second-order critical line meets a first-order line at a tricritical point. We showed that the scaling of Lee-Yang, Fisher, and crystal-field zeros yields accurate critical exponents even for modest lattice sizes. In the present study, we extend this analysis and demonstrate that simulations need not be performed exactly at the nominal transition point to obtain reliable exponent estimates. Strikingly, small system sizes are sufficient, which not only improves methodological efficiency but also advances the broader goal of reducing the carbon footprint of large-scale computational studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05957v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Out of equilibrium, the action-reaction symmetry of the interactions is often broken, leading to the emergence of various collective phenomena with no equilibrium counterparts. Although ubiquitous in classical active systems, implementing such non-reciprocal interactions in solid-state systems has remained challenging, as the known quantum schemes require precise control over the system on a single-site level. Here, we propose a novel dissipation-engineering protocol to induce non-reciprocal interactions in solid-state platforms with light, which we expect to be achievable with state-of-the-art experimental techniques. Focusing on magnetic metals for concreteness, we show microscopically that a light injection that introduces the decay channel to a virtually excited state gives rise to non-reciprocal interactions between localized spins. One can even realize a situation where spin A tries to align with spin B but the B tries the opposite, resulting in a chase-and-runaway dynamics. Applying our scheme to layered ferromagnets, we show that a non-reciprocal phase transition from a static to a many-body time-dependent chiral phase emerges. Our work paves the way to bring solid-state systems to the realm of non-reciprocal science, providing yet another possibility to control quantum matter with light.</description>

      <title>D-commuting SYK model: building quantum chaos from integrable blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new family of quantum chaotic models by combining multiple copies of integrable commuting SYK models. As each copy of the commuting SYK model does not commute with others, this construction breaks the integrability of each commuting SYK and the family of models demonstrates the emergence of quantum chaos. We study the spectrum of this model analytically in the double-scaled limit. As the number of copies tends to infinity, the spectrum becomes compact and equivalent to the regular SYK model. For finite $d$ copies, the spectrum is close to the regular SYK model in UV but has an exponential tail $e^{E/T_c}$ in the IR. We identify the reciprocal of the exponent in the tail as a critical temperature $T_c$, above which the model should be quantum chaotic. $T_c$ monotonically decreases as $d$ increases, which expands the chaotic regime over the non-chaotic regime. We propose the existence of a new phase around $T_c$, and the dynamics should be very different in two phases. We further carry out numeric analysis at finite $d$, which supports our proposal.
  Given any finite dimensional local Hamiltonian, by decomposing it into $d$ groups, in which all terms in one group commute with each other but terms from different groups may not, our analysis can give an estimate of the critical temperature for quantum chaos based on the decomposition. We also comment on the implication of the critical temperature to future quantum simulations of quantum chaos and quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Anticoncentration and nonstabilizerness spreading under ergodic quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum state complexity metrics, such as anticoncentration and nonstabilizerness, or ``magic'', offer key insights into many-body physics, information scrambling, and quantum computing. Anticoncentration and equilibration of magic resources under dynamics of random quantum circuits occur at times scaling logarithmically with system size, a prediction that is believed to extend to more general ergodic dynamics. This work challenges this idea by examining the anticoncentration and magic spreading in one-dimensional ergodic Floquet models and Hamiltonian systems. Using participation and stabilizer entropies to probe these resources, we reveal significant differences between the two settings. Floquet systems align with random circuit predictions, exhibiting anticoncentration and magic saturation at time scales logarithmic in system size. In contrast, Hamiltonian dynamics deviate from the random circuit predictions and require times scaling approximately linearly with system size to achieve saturation of participation and stabilizer entropies, which remain smaller than that of the typical quantum states even in the long-time limit. Our findings establish the phenomenology of participation and stabilizer entropy growth in ergodic many-body systems and emphasize the role of conservation laws in constraining anticoncentration and magic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Clustering of Conditional Mutual Information via Quantum Belief-Propagation Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conditional mutual information (CMI) has recently attracted significant attention as a key quantity for characterizing quantum correlations in many-body systems. While it is conjectured that CMI decays rapidly in finite-temperature Gibbs states, a complete and general proof remains elusive. In this work, we introduce a new formulation of the problem based on the \emph{belief propagation (BP) channel}, namely a completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) map that realizes local perturbations of the Hamiltonian. Within this framework, we prove that establishing the quasi-locality of BP channels implies the decay of CMI, thereby reducing the original conjecture to a more tractable problem. We show that such quasi-local BP channels can be constructed under natural physical conditions, such as uniform rapid mixing or uniform clustering. Under these assumptions, we obtain conditional proofs of CMI decay valid at all temperatures. Moreover, because these assumptions are automatically satisfied at high temperatures, our results in that regime yield unconditional proofs of CMI decay. At the same time, in order to better understand the high-temperature behavior of Gibbs states, we revisit the cluster expansion method. Contrary to common intuition, we demonstrate that when multipartite correlations such as CMI are considered, the cluster expansion suffers from intrinsic divergence problems rooted in the Baker--Campbell--Hausdorff formula, revealing fundamental limitations of this traditional approach.</description>

      <title>Lindblad evolution as gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a simple argument that, for a large class of jump operators, the Lindblad evolution can be written as a gradient flow in the space of density operators acting on a Hilbert space of dimension $D$. We give explicit expressions for the (matrix-valued) eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Lindblad evolution using this formalism. We argue that in many cases the interpretation of the evolution is simplified by passing from the complex $D^2$-dimensional space of density operators to the real $D^2-1$-dimensional space of Bloch vectors. When jump operators are non-Hermitian the evolution is not in general gradient flow, but we show that it nevertheless resembles gradient flow in two particular ways. Importantly, the steady states of Lindbladian evolution are still determined by the potential in all cases.</description>

      <title>Stripe order in quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the emergence of magnetic order in geometrically frustrated quasiperiodic systems, focusing on the interplay between local tile symmetry and frustration-induced constraints. In particular, we study the $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model on the two-dimensional Ammann--Beenker quasicrystal. Through large-scale Monte Carlo simulations and general arguments, we map the phase diagram of the model. For small $J_2$, a N\'eel phase appears, whereas a stripe phase is stable for dominant antiferromagnetic $J_2$, despite the system's lack of periodicity. Although long-range stripe order emerges below a critical temperature, unlike in random systems, it is softened by the nucleation of competing stripe domains pinned at specific quasiperiodic sites. This behavior reveals a unique mechanism of symmetry breaking in quasiperiodic lattices, where geometric frustration and local environment effects compete to determine the magnetic ground state. Our results show how long-range order adapts to non-periodic structures, with implications for understanding nematic phases and other broken-symmetry states in quasicrystals.</description>

      <title>Emergent deterministic entanglement dynamics in monitored infinite-range bosonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study monitored quantum dynamics of infinite-range interacting bosonic systems in the thermodynamic limit. We show that under semiclassical assumptions, the quantum fluctuations along single monitored trajectories adopt a deterministic limit for both quantum-jump and state-diffusion unravelings, and they can be exactly solved. In particular, the hierarchical structure of the equations of motion explains the coincidence of entanglement criticalities and dissipative phase transitions found in previous finite-size numerical studies. We illustrate the findings on a Bose-Hubbard dimer and a collective spin system.</description>

      <title>Fermion Parity Resolution of Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is analyzed in the Majorana fermion conformal field theory (CFT) in the vacuum, in the fermion state, and in states built from conformal interfaces. In the boundary-state approach, the Hilbert space admits two factorizations for a single interval, producing distinct entanglement spectra determined by spin structures. Although R\'enyi and relative entropies are shown to be insensitive to these structures, symmetry-resolved entanglement naturally reveals their differences. The Majorana fermion's $\mathbb{Z}_2^F$ symmetry, generated by the fermion-parity operator $(-1)^F$, distinguishes bosonic from fermionic sectors, motivating the notion of fermion-parity resolution. While $\mathbb{Z}_2^F$ is naturally a symmetry of the vacuum and fermion reduced density matrices, the Hilbert space factorization is shown to stabilize this symmetry in conformal interface states. When an unpaired Majorana zero mode is present, fermion-parity-resolved entropies display equipartition at all orders in the UV cutoff; in its absence, the breaking of equipartition is quantified by Ramond-sector data. This behavior persists across all states considered. Connections with symmetry-protected topological phases of matter are outlined. All results are compared with twist field computations.</description>

      <title>Free Majorana Fermion Meets Gauged Ising Conformal Field Theory on the Fuzzy Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fuzzy sphere regularisation is a powerful tool to study conformal field theories (CFT) in three spacetime dimensions. In this paper, we extend its scope to CFTs with local fermionic operators. We realise the free Majorana fermion CFT on a setup with one flavour of bosons and one flavour of fermions on the lowest Landau level with a $1/2$ angular momentum mismatch. We allow conversion between two bosons and two fermions, and use a relative chemical potential as the tuning parameter. On the phase diagram, we find three gapped phases, viz. a fermionic integer quantum Hall phase, an $f$-wave chiral topological superconductor, and a bosonic Pfaffian phase. They are separated by two continuous transitions described respectively by a free Majorana fermion and a gauged Ising CFT. We numerically confirm their emergent conformal symmetry through the operator spectrum. We also study the two-point correlation function of the Majorana fermion, and the topological Wilson line defect of the gauged Ising CFT. Our work lays the foundation for studying interacting fermionic CFTs and regularising quantum field theories on the fuzzy sphere.</description>
