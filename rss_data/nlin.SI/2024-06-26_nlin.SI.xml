      <title>A representation-theoretical approach to higher-dimensional Lie--Hamilton systems: The symplectic Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sp}(4, \mathbb{R})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new procedure for the construction of higher-dimensional Lie-Hamilton systems is proposed. This method is based on techniques belonging to the representation theory of Lie algebras and their realization by vector fields. The notion of intrinsic Lie-Hamilton system is defined, and a sufficiency criterion for this property given. Novel four-dimensional Lie-Hamilton systems arising from the fundamental representation of the symplectic Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sp}(4, \mathbb{R})$ are obtained and proved to be intrinsic. Two distinguished subalgebras, the two-photon Lie algebra $\mathfrak{h}_{6}$ and the Lorentz Lie algebra $\mathfrak{so}(1,3)$, are also considered in detail. As applications, coupled time-dependent systems which generalize the Bateman oscillator and the one-dimensional Caldirola-Kanai models are constructed, as well as systems depending on a time-dependent electromagnetic field and generalized coupled oscillators. A superposition rule for these systems, exhibiting interesting symmetry properties, is obtained using the coalgebra method.</description>

      <title>Quantum groups, discrete Magnus expansion, pre-Lie &amp; tridendriform algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the discrete evolution problem and the corresponding solution as a discrete Dyson series in order to rigorously derive a generalized discrete version of the Magnus expansion. We also systematically derive the discrete analogue of the pre-Lie Magnus expansion and express the elements of the discrete Dyson series in terms of a tridendriform algebra action. In the generic discrete case extra significant terms that are absent in the continuous or the linear discrete case appear in both Dyson and Magnus expansions. Based on the rigorous discrete derivation key links between quantum algebras, tridendriform and pre-Lie algebras are then established. This is achieved by examining tensor realizations of quantum groups, such as the Yangian. We show that these realizations can be expressed in terms of tridendriform and pre-Lie algebras actions. The continuous limit as expected provides the corresponding non-local charges of the Yangian as members of the pre-Lie Magnus expansion.</description>

      <title>A $(q,t)$-deformation of the 2d Toda integrable hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A $(q,t)$-deformation of the 2d Toda integrable hierarchy is introduced by enhancing the underlying symmetry algebra $\mathfrak{gl}(\infty)\simeq \text{q-W}_{1+\infty}$ to the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$ algebra. The difference-differential equations of the hierarchy are obtained from the expansion of $(q,t)$-bilinear identities, and two equations refining the 2d Toda equation are found in this way. The derivation of the bilinear identities follows from the isomorphism between the Fock representation of level $(2,0)$ of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$ algebra and the tensor product of the q-deformed Virasoro algebra with a $u(1)$ Heisenberg algebra. It leads to identify the $(q,t)$-deformed Casimir with the screening charges of the deformed Virasoro algebra. Due to the non-trivial coproduct, equations of the hierarchy no longer involve a single tau-function, but instead relate a set of different tau functions. We then define the universal refined tau function using the $L$-matrix of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$ algebra and interpret it as the generating function of the deformed tau functions. The equations of the hierarchy, written in terms of the universal refined tau function, combine into two-term quadratic equations similar to the $RLL$ equations.</description>

      <title>A solvable non-unitary fermionic long-range model with extended symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and study a long-range version of the XX model, arising as the free-fermion point of the XXZ-type Haldane--Shastry (HS) chain. It has a description via non-unitary fermions, based on the free-fermion Temperley--Lieb algebra, and may also be viewed as an alternating $\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$ spin chain. Even and odd length behave very differently; we focus on odd length. The model is integrable, and we explicitly identify two commuting hamiltonians. While non-unitary, their spectrum is real by PT-symmetry. One hamiltonian is chiral and quadratic in fermions, while the other is parity-invariant and quartic. Their one-particle spectra have two linear branches, realising a massless relativistic dispersion on the lattice. The appropriate fermionic modes arise from 'quasi-translation' symmetry, which replaces ordinary translation symmetry. The model exhibits exclusion statistics, like the isotropic HS chain, with even more 'extended symmetry' and larger degeneracies.</description>
