      <title>Design of Programmable Temperature Platform and its Pyroelectrocatalytic applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Si based TiO2 thin films were prepared via the combination both of Sol-Gel and Spin-Coating method. The films were sintered at 850 degrees Celsius for half an hour, and the resulting films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for their phase composition and microstructure. It was found that the films contained silicon, anatase phase, and unknown impurities. There were holes and micro-cracks on the surface of TiO2 films. A program-controllable hot-cold test chamber was successfully developed and used to study the catalytic performance of the thin film for the first time. The results showed that TiO2 thin films had the ability to degrade Rhodamine B dyes. The highest degradation rate of Rhodamine B achieved 37% after 48 cold-hot cycles. Our design and the experimental results presented in this paper strongly highlight the bright prospects of the thermoelectric properties of TiO2 and water environmental disinfection applications.</description>

      <title>Weak antilocalization in the transition metal telluride Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report transport studies on the layered van der Waals topological crystalline insulator Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$. The temperature-dependent resistance at high temperature is dominated by a bulk insulating gap and tend to saturate at low temperatures. Low temperature magnetotransport shows that Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$ exhibits weak antilocatization (WAL) effect in both perpendicular orientation and parallel orientation, suggesting an contribution of the WAL effect from both topological edge states and bulk states. By measuring the anisotropic magnetoconductance and then subtracting the contribution of bulk states, the WAL effect associated with topological edge states can be revealed and analyzed quantitatively based on the two-dimensional Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka model. Our results have important implications in understanding the WAL phenomena in Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$.</description>

      <title>New mechanism to enhance electron transverse transport by composite formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalous transverse transport of electrons such as the anomalous Hall effect and the anomalous Nernst effect provide opportunities to realize advanced spintronic and thermoelectric devices. To materialize these opportunities, it is crucial to strengthen the transverse transport. There have been considerable efforts to find new materials that fulfill this goal. Topological materials received a surge of recent attention in this regard. Here we report a different approach to enhance the transverse transport. Instead of searching for new materials, we propose mixing known materials to form composites. We show theoretically that randomly mixed arrays of two materials can exhibit significantly stronger transverse transport than the constituent materials. This enhancement is experimentally demonstrated for mixtures of crystallized and amorphous ferromagnetic metals. We identify the requirement of this enhancement, which can be satisfied by a wide class of materials. Thus, this scheme provides a universal method to strengthen transverse transport, together with rooms to accommodate various engineering requirements for device applications.</description>

      <title>Hilbert-Polya conjecture via critical pseudo-magnetic degrees of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a recent pseudo-spin model for monolayer-bilayer phase transitions in silver-based honeycomb layered materials, we propose that the critical pseudo-magnetic fields in such systems correspond to both the infinite-channel Feshbach resonance widths of a (Fermi-Dirac/Bose-Einstein/$\textit{etc}.$) condensate in $2$ dimensions, and equivalently to the Lee-Yang zeros of the Ising model of two pseudo-spins with a partition function corresponding to a class of functions that must include the Xi function, $\Xi(z/2) = \xi(s = 1/2 + iz/2)$. Identifying the quantum-mechanical operator that yields the \textit{discontinuous/random/topological} spectrum of the critical pseudo-magnetic fields in such systems offers a tenable realisation of the Hilbert-P\'{o}lya conjecture.</description>

      <title>High-throughput Screening of Ferrimagnetic Semiconductors With Ultrahigh N$\acute{e}$el Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferrimagnetic semiconductors, integrated with net magnetization, antiferromagnetic coupling and semi-conductivity, have constructed an ideal platform for spintronics. For practical applications, achieving high N$\acute{e}$el temperatures ($T_{\mathrm{N}}$) is very desirable, but remains a significant challenge. Here, via high-throughput density-functional-theory calculations, we identify 19 intrinsic ferrimagnetic semiconductor candidates from nearly 44,000 structures in the Materials Project database, including 10 ferrimagnetic bipolar magnetic semiconductors (BMS) and 9 ferrimagnetic half semiconductors (HSC). Notably, the BMS \ce{NaFe5O8} possesses a high $T_{\mathrm{N}}$ of 768 K. By element substitutions, we obtain an HSC \ce{NaFe5S8} with a $T_{\mathrm{N}}$ of 957 K and a BMS \ce{LiFe5O8} with a $T_{\mathrm{N}}$ reaching 1059 K. Our results pave a promising avenue toward the development of ferrimagnetic spintronics at ambient temperature.</description>

      <title>Exploration of stable atomic configurations in graphene-like BCN systems by Bayesian optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: h-BCN is an intriguing material system where the bandgap varies considerably depending on the atomic configuration, even at a fixed composition. Exploring stable atomic configurations in this system is crucial for discussing the energetic formability and controllability of desirable configurations. In this study, this challenge is tackled by combining first-principles calculations with Bayesian optimization. An encoding method that represents the configurations as vectors, while incorporating information about the local atomic environments, is proposed for the search. Although the optimization did not function with the conventional one-hot encoding that had been effective in other material systems, the proposed encoding proved efficient in the search. As a result, two interesting semiconductor configurations were discovered. These configurations exhibit qualitatively similar patterns to conventional models, and one of the two is more stable than the conventional ones with the same periodicity. Furthermore, the optimization behavior is discussed through principal component analysis, confirming that the ordered BN network and the C configuration features are well embedded in the search space. The proposed encoding method, which is easy to implement, is expected to expand the applicability of atomic configuration search using Bayesian optimization to a broader range of material systems.</description>

      <title>Insight into the effect of force error on the thermal conductivity from machine-learned potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learned potentials (MLPs) have been extensively used to obtain the lattice thermal conductivity via atomistic simulations. However, the impact of force errors in various MLPs on thermal transport has not been widely recognized and remains to be fully understood. Here, we employ MLP-driven molecular dynamics (MD) and anharmonic lattice dynamics (LD) to systematically investigate how the calculated thermal conductivity varies with the force errors, using boron arsenide as a prototypical material. We consistently observe an underestimation of thermal conductivity in MD simulations with three different MLPs including the neuroevolution potential, deep potential, and moment tensor potential. We provide a robust extrapolation scheme based on controlled force noises via the Langevin thermostat to correct this underestimation. The corrected results achieve a good agreement with previous experimental measurement from 200 K to 600 K. In contrast, the thermal conductivity values from LD calculations with MLPs readily align with the experimental data, which is attributed to the much smaller effects of the force errors on the force-constant calculations.</description>

      <title>Impact of hole-doping on the thermoelectric properties of pyrite FeS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles analysis of the thermoelectric transport properties of hole-doped pyrite FeS$_2$ that includes electron-phonon interactions. This work was motivated by the observed variations in the magnitude of thermopower reported in previous experimental and theoretical studies of hole-doped FeS$_2$ systems. Our calculations reveal that hole-doped FeS$_2$ exhibits large positive room-temperature thermopower across all doping levels, with a room-temperature thermopower of 608 $\mu$V/K at a low hole-doping concentration of 10$^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$. This promising thermopower finding prompted a comprehensive investigation of other key thermoelectric parameters governing the thermoelectric figure of merit $ZT$. The calculated electrical conductivity is modest and remains below 10$^5$ S/m at room-temperature for all doping levels, limiting the achievable power factor. Furthermore, the thermal conductivity is found to be phonon driven, with a high room-temperature lattice thermal conductivity of 40.5 W/mK. Consequently, the calculated $ZT$ remains below 0.1, suggesting that hole-doped FeS$_2$ may not a viable candidate for effective thermoelectric applications despite its promising thermopower.</description>

      <title>Si/SiO$_\text{2}$ MOSFET Reliability Physics: From Four-State Model to All-State Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As implemented in the commercialized device modeling software, the four-state nonradiative multi-phonon model has attracted intensive attention in the past decade for describing the physics in negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) and other reliability issues of Si/SiO$_\text{2}$ MOSFET devices. It was proposed initially based on the assumption that the oxygen vacancy defects (V$_\text{O}$) in SiO$_\text{2}$ dielectric layer are bistable in the Si-dimer and back-projected structures during carrier capture and emission. Through high-throughput first-principles structural search, we found V$_\text{O}$ on non-equivalent O sites in amorphous SiO$_\text{2}$ can take 4 types of structural configurations in neutral state and 7 types of configurations in +1 charged state after capturing holes, which produce a wide range of charge-state transition levels for trapping holes. The finding contrasts the structural-bistability assumption and makes the four-state model invalid for most of O sites. To describe the reliability physics accurately, we propose an all-state model to consider all these structural configurations as well as all the carrier capture/emission transitions and thermal transitions between them. With the all-state model, we show that the V$_\text{O}$ defects play important roles in causing NBTI, which challenges the recent studies that discarded V$_\text{O}$ as a possible hole trap in NBTI. Our systematical calculations on the diversified V$_\text{O}$ properties and the all-state model provide the microscopic foundation for describing the reliability physics of MOSFETs and other transistors accurately.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric behavior of breathing kagom\'{e} monolayers of $\mathrm{Nb}_3\mathrm{(Cl, Br, I)}_8$ from first-principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply density functional theory to explore the magnetoelectric (ME) properties of two-dimensional $\mathrm{Nb}_3\mathrm{(Cl,Br,I)}_8$. These compounds have recently been proposed to exhibit coupled ferroelectric and ferromagnetic order leading to a switchable anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE). Using both spin-spiral and self-consistent spin-orbit coupled calculations, we predict an in-plane $120^\circ$ cycloid of trimerized spins as the ground state for $\mathrm{Nb}_3\mathrm{Cl}_8$. For $\mathrm{Nb}_3\mathrm{Br}_8$ and $\mathrm{Nb}_3\mathrm{I}_8$ we find long period incommensurate helical order. We calculate a number of magnetic properties such as the exchange constants, orbital magnetization, and Curie-Weiss transition temperatures, which are in good agreement with experimental values for the bulk compounds. It is then shown that, despite having both broken inversion and time-reversal symmetry, the proposed AVHE and linear ME response are forbidden by the presence of helical order in the ground state. In addition, the computed switching trajectory demonstrates that it is unlikely that the polar state of the monolayers can be switched with a homogeneous electric field due to an unusual equation of state of the out-of-plane dipole moment. Nevertheless, we highlight that in the presence of a strong electric field, the trimerized spins in $\mathrm{Nb}_3\mathrm{Cl}_8$ will exhibit a magnetic phase transition from the $120^\circ$ cycloid to out-of-plane ferromagnetic order, which restores the symmetry required for both AVHE and linear ME effects.</description>

      <title>Temperature-dependent Electronic Spectral Functions from Band-Structure Unfolding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic band structure, describing the periodic dependence of electronic quantum states on lattice momentum in reciprocal space, is a fundamental concept in solid-state physics. However, it's only well-defined for static nuclei. To account for thermodynamic effects, this concept must be generalized by introducing the temperature-dependent spectral function, which characterizes the finite-width distributions of electronic quantum states at each reciprocal vector. Many-body perturbation theory can compute spectral functions and associated observables, but it approximates the dynamics of nuclei and its coupling to the electrons using the harmonic approximation and linear-order electron-phonon coupling elements, respectively. These approximations may fail at elevated temperatures or for mobile atoms. To avoid inaccuracies, the electronic spectral function can be obtained non-perturbatively, capturing higher-order couplings between electrons and vibrational degrees of freedom. This process involves recovering the representation of supercell bands in the first Brillouin zone of the primitive cell, a process known as unfolding. In this contribution, we describe the implementation of the band-structure unfolding technique in the electronic-structure theory package FHI-aims and the updates made since its original development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum materials governed by emergent topological fermions have become a cornerstone of physics. Dirac fermions in graphene form the basis for moir\'e quantum matter, and Dirac fermions in magnetic topological insulators enabled the discovery of the quantum anomalous Hall effect. In contrast, there are few materials whose electromagnetic response is dominated by emergent Weyl fermions. Nearly all known Weyl materials are overwhelmingly metallic, and are largely governed by irrelevant, conventional electrons. Here we theoretically predict and experimentally observe a semimetallic Weyl ferromagnet in van der Waals (Cr,Bi)$_2$Te$_3$. In transport, we find a record bulk anomalous Hall angle $&gt; 0.5$ along with non-metallic conductivity, a regime sharply distinct from conventional ferromagnets. Together with symmetry analysis, our data suggest a semimetallic Fermi surface composed of two Weyl points, with a giant separation $&gt; 75\%$ of the linear dimension of the bulk Brillouin zone, and no other electronic states. Using state-of-the-art crystal synthesis techniques, we widely tune the electronic structure, allowing us to annihilate the Weyl state and visualize a unique topological phase diagram exhibiting broad Chern insulating, Weyl semimetallic and magnetic semiconducting regions. Our observation of a semimetallic Weyl ferromagnet offers an avenue toward novel correlated states and non-linear phenomena, as well as zero-magnetic-field Weyl spintronic and optical devices.</description>

      <title>Efficient Symmetry-Aware Materials Generation via Hierarchical Generative Flow Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering new solid-state materials requires rapidly exploring the vast space of crystal structures and locating stable regions. Generating stable materials with desired properties and compositions is extremely difficult as we search for very small isolated pockets in the exponentially many possibilities, considering elements from the periodic table and their 3D arrangements in crystal lattices. Materials discovery necessitates both optimized solution structures and diversity in the generated material structures. Existing methods struggle to explore large material spaces and generate diverse samples with desired properties and requirements. We propose the Symmetry-aware Hierarchical Architecture for Flow-based Traversal (SHAFT), a novel generative model employing a hierarchical exploration strategy to efficiently exploit the symmetry of the materials space to generate crystal structures given desired properties. In particular, our model decomposes the exponentially large materials space into a hierarchy of subspaces consisting of symmetric space groups, lattice parameters, and atoms. We demonstrate that SHAFT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art iterative generative methods, such as Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) and Crystal Diffusion Variational AutoEncoders (CDVAE), in crystal structure generation tasks, achieving higher validity, diversity, and stability of generated structures optimized for target properties and requirements.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the performance of state-of-the-art spintronic THz emitters (W or Ta)/CoFeB/Pt with non-magnetic underlayer deposited using oblique angle deposition. The THz emission amplitude in the presence or absence of an external magnetic field remains the same and remarkably stable over time. This stability is attributed to the enhanced uniaxial magnetic anisotropy in the ferromagnetic layer, achieved by oblique angle deposition of the underlying non-magnetic layer. Our findings could be used for the development of practical field-free emitters of linearly polarized THz radiation, potentially enabling novel applications in future THz technologies.</description>

      <title>Frictional Dissipation and Scaling Laws at van der Waals Interface: The Key Role of Elastic Pinning of Moir\'e at Edges and Corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals heterogeneous interfaces are promising candidates for the scaling up of structural superlubricity to meet practical applications. Several factors, however, have been identified that may eliminate superlubricity. Elasticity is one such intrinsic factor, where shear induced lattice reconstruction leads to local interfacial pinning, even at clean pristine contacts. Here, through detailed atomistic simulations, we reveal that incomplete moir\'e tile pinning at the corners and edges of finite sliders dominates friction from the nano- to the microscales. We further demonstrate that slider shape tailoring and twisting allow to control energy dissipation and its scaling with contact size, thus opening the way to achieve large-scale superlubricity.</description>

      <title>Adibatic demagnetization refrigeration with antiferromagnetically ordered NaGdP$_2$O$_7$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the structural, magnetic, and thermodynamic properties, as well as the adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration (ADR) performance of NaGdP$_2$O$_7$. Although NaGdP$_2$O$_7$ exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering at a N\'eel temperature of $T_{\rm N} = 570$ mK in zero field, ADR experiments achieved a minimum temperature of 220 mK starting from $T = 2$ K under an applied magnetic field of $\mu_0H = 5$ T. The warm-up time back to $T = 2$ K exceeds 60 hours, which is roughly 50 times longer than that of its Yb-based analogue, underscoring the potential of NaGdP$_2$O$_7$ as an efficient precooling stage in double-stage ADR systems. We show that NaGdP$_2$O$_7$ can be seen as a network of ferromagnetic spin chains with antiferromagnetic interchain couplings and also investigate the influence of antiferromagnetic ordering on the magnetic entropy. We find that the temperature dependence of the entropy plays a more dominant role than its magnetic field dependence in the magnetically ordered state.</description>

      <title>Diabatic states of charge transfer with constrained charge equilibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge transfer (CT) processes that are electronically non-adiabatic are ubiquitous in chemistry, biology, and materials science, but their theoretical description requires diabatic states or adiabatic excited states. For complex systems, these latter states are more difficult to calculate than the adiabatic ground state. Here, we propose a simple method to obtain diabatic states, including energies and charges, by constraining the atomic charges within the charge equilibration framework. For two-state systems, the exact diabatic coupling can be determined, from which the adiabatic excited-state energy can also be calculated. The method can be viewed as an affordable alternative to constrained density functional theory (CDFT), and so we call it constrained charge equilibration (CQEq). We test the CQEq method on the anthracene-tetracyanoethylene CT complex and the reductive decomposition of ethylene carbonate on a lithium metal surface. We find that CQEq predicts diabatic energies, charges, and adiabatic excitation energies in good agreement with CDFT, and we propose that CQEq is promising for combination with machine learning force fields to study non-adiabatic CT in the condensed phase.</description>

      <title>Linear non-saturating magnetoresistance and superconductivity in epitaxial thin films of YbSb$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare-earth diantimonides display intriguing ground states often associated with structural order, which can be manipulated in thin film geometries. In this study, we report epitaxial synthesis of one such compound, YbSb$_{2}$, on III-V substrates using molecular-beam epitaxy. The synthesized thin films exhibit large, non-saturating, linear magnetoresistance across a wide magnetic field range. Additionally, they demonstrate superconducting properties, with a critical temperature of $\approx$ 1.025 K and a critical field of $\approx$ 83.85 Oe, consistent with the reports in bulk single crystals. While YbSb$_{2}$ has been classified as a Type-I superconductor in its bulk form, our findings provide evidence of a mixed state in the epitaxial thin films. This work paves the way for controlling the electronic ground state in this class of materials through thin film engineering.</description>

      <title>Achieving superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelate thin films by aluminum sputtering deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer (IL, ABO$_2$) nickelates has opened a new avenue to deepen the understanding of high-temperature superconductivity. However, progress in this field is slowed by significant challenges in material synthesis and the scarcity of research groups capable of producing high quality superconducting samples. IL nickelates are obtained from a reduction of the perovskite ABO$_3$ phase, typically achieved by annealing using CaH$_2$ as a reducing agent. Here, we present a new method to synthesize superconducting infinite-layer nickelate Pr$_{0.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$NiO$_2$ thin films using an aluminum overlayer deposited by sputtering as a reducing agent. We systematically optimized the aluminum deposition parameters and obtained superconducting samples reduced either in situ or ex situ (after air exposure of the precursor ABO$_3$ films). A comparison of their crystalline quality and transport properties shows that in situ Al reduction enhances the quality of the superconducting Pr$_{0.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$NiO$_2$ thin films, achieving a maximum superconducting transition temperature $T_{c}^{onset}$ of 17 K, in agreement with the optimum value reported for this compound. This simple synthesis route, much more accessible than existing methods, offers better control and reproducibility over the topotactic transformation, opening new opportunities to gain insights into the physics of superconductivity in nickelates.</description>

      <title>On Nanowire Morphological Instability and Pinch-Off by Surface Electromigration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface diffusion and surface electromigration may lead to a morphological instability of thin solid films and nanowires. In this paper two nonlinear analyses of a morphological instability are developed for a single-crystal cylindrical nanowire that is subjected to an axial current. These treatments extend the conventional linear stability analyses without surface electromigration, that manifest a Rayleigh-Plateau instability. A weakly nonlinear analysis is done slightly above the Rayleigh-Plateau (longwave) instability threshold. It results in a one-dimensional Sivashinsky amplitude equation that describes a blow-up of a surface perturbation amplitude in a finite time. This is a signature of a pinching singularity of a cylinder radius, which leads to a wire separation into a disjoint segments. The time- and electric field-dependent dimensions of the focusing self-similar amplitude profile approaching a blow-up are characterized via the scaling analysis. Also, a weakly nonlinear multi-scale analysis is done at the arbitrary distance above a longwave or a shortwave instability threshold. The time- and electric field-dependent Fourier amplitudes of the major instability modes are derived and characterized.</description>

      <title>Reconsidering the nonlinear emergent inductance: time-varying Joule heating and its impact on the AC electrical response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A nonlinearly enhanced electrical reactance, $\Im Z$, under a large AC current has been measured to explore emergent inductors, which constitute a new class of inductors based on the spin-transfer torque effect. A nonlinear $\Im Z$ has been observed in conducting magnets that contain noncollinear spin textures and interpreted as the realization of an inductance due to current-induced spin dynamics. However, curious behavior has concomitantly been observed. For instance, the nonlinear $\Im Z$ always has a cutoff frequency of $10^0$--$10^4$ Hz, which is much lower than the resonance frequency of a ferromagnetic domain wall, $\sim$10$^7$ Hz; furthermore, the temperature and magnetic field variations in $\Im Z$ appear to be considerably correlated with those in the temperature derivative of resistance. This behavior appears to be difficult to understand in terms of the current-induced spin dynamics, and therefore, the earlier interpretation of the nonlinear $\Im Z$ should be further verified. Here, we theoretically and experimentally show that time-varying Joule heating and its impact on the AC electrical response can naturally explain these observations. In the experimental approach, we study the nonlinear AC electrical response of two conducting materials that exhibit no magnetic order, CuIr$_2$S$_4$ and 1$T$'-MoTe$_2$. Under time-varying Joule heating, a nonlinearly enhanced $\Im Z$ with the curious behavior mentioned above is observed in both systems. Our study implies that the nonlinear $\Im Z$ previously observed in noncollinear magnets includes a considerable contribution of the Joule-heating-induced apparent AC impedance.</description>

      <title>Adaptive energy reference for machine-learning models of the electronic density of states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electronic density of states (DOS) provides information regarding the distribution of electronic energy levels in a material, and can be used to approximate its optical and electronic properties and therefore guide computational material design. Given its usefulness and relative simplicity, it has been one of the first electronic properties used as target for machine-learning approaches going beyond interatomic potentials. A subtle but important point, well-appreciated in the condensed matter community but usually overlooked in the construction of data-driven models, is that for bulk configurations the absolute energy reference of single-particle energy levels is ill-defined. Only energy differences matter, and quantities derived from the DOS are typically independent on the absolute alignment. We introduce an adaptive scheme that optimizes the energy reference of each structure as part of the training process, and show that it consistently improves the quality of ML models compared to traditional choices of energy reference, for different classes of materials and different model architectures. On a practical level, we trace the improved performance to the ability of this self-aligning scheme to match the most prominent features in the DOS. More broadly, we believe that this work highlights the importance of incorporating insights into the nature of the physical target into the definition of the architecture and of the appropriate figures of merit for machine-learning models, that translate in better transferability and overall performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By working out the Bethe sum rule, a boundary condition that takes the form of a linear equality is derived for the fine structure observed in ionization edges present in electron energy-loss spectra. This condition is subsequently used as a constraint in the estimation process of the elemental abundances, demonstrating starkly improved precision and accuracy and reduced sensitivity to the number of model parameters. Furthermore, the fine structure is reliably extracted from the spectra in an automated way, thus providing critical information on the sample's electronic properties that is hard or impossible to obtain otherwise. Since this approach allows dispensing with the need for user-provided input, a potential source of bias is prevented.</description>

      <title>Surface Conduction and Reduced Electrical Resistivity in Ultrathin Non-Crystalline NbP Semimetal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17337v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electrical resistivity of conventional metals, such as copper, is known to increase in thinner films due to electron-surface scattering, limiting the performance of metals in nanoscale electronics. Here, we uncover a reduction of resistivity with decreasing film thickness in NbP semimetal, deposited at relatively low temperatures of 400 \deg C. In sub-5 nm thin films, we find a significantly lower room temperature resistivity (~34 microOhm*cm for 1.5 nm thin NbP) than in the bulk form, and lower than conventional metals at similar thickness. Remarkably, the NbP films are not crystalline, but display local nanocrystalline, short-range order within an amorphous matrix. Our analysis suggests that the lower resistivity is due to conduction via surface channels, together with high surface carrier density and sufficiently good mobility as the film thickness is reduced. These results and the fundamental insights obtained here could enable ultrathin, low-resistivity wires for nanoelectronics, beyond the limitations of conventional metals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of frequently observed ultrahigh electric-induced longitudinal strain, ranging from 1% to 26%, remains an open question. Recent evidence suggests that this phenomenon is linked to the bending deformation of samples, but the mechanisms driving this bending and the strong dependence of nominal strain on sample thickness have yet to be fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that the bending in piezoceramics can be induced by non-zero gradient of d31 acrcoss thickness direction. Our calculations show that in standard perovskite piezoceramics, such as KNbO3, a 0.69% concentration of oxygen vacancies results in a 6.3 pC/N change in d31 by inhibiting polarization rotation, which is sufficient to produce ultrahigh nominal strain in thin samples. The gradients of defect concentration, composition, and stress can all cause sufficient inhomogeneity in the distribution of d31, leading to the bending effect. We propose several approaches to distinguish true electric-induced strain from bending-induced effects. Our work provides clarity on the origin of nominal ultrahigh electricinduced strain and offers valuable insights for advancing piezoelectric materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09539v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integrated Berry curvature is a geometric property that has dramatic implications for material properties. This study investigates the integrated Berry curvature and other contributions to the anomalous Hall effect in CrGeTe$_3$ as a function of pressure. The anomalous Hall effect is absent in the insulating phase of CrGeTe$_3$ and evolves with pressure in a dome-like fashion as pressure is applied. The dome's edges are characterized by Fermi surface deformations, manifested as mixed electron and hole transport. We corroborate the presence of bipolar transport by ab-initio calculations which also predict a nonmonotonic behavior of the Berry curvature as a function of pressure. Quantitative discrepancies between our calculations and experimental results indicate that additional scattering mechanisms, which are also strongly tuned by pressure, contribute to the anomalous Hall effect in CrGeTe$_3$.</description>

      <title>Understanding long-range opposite charge repulsion in multivalent salt solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electrostatic correlations between ions profoundly influence the structure and forces within electrical double layers. Here, we apply the modified Gaussian Renormalized Fluctuation theory to investigate the counter-intuitive phenomenon of repulsion between two oppositely charged surfaces and discuss its relationship with overcharging. By accurately accounting for the effect of spatially varying ion-ion correlations, we capture these repulsive forces for divalent, trivalent as well as tetravalent ions, in quantitative agreement with reported simulation results. We show that the opposite-charge repulsion is long-ranged with an effective length scale of a few nanometers. The strength of opposite-charge repulsion increases monotonically with the multivalent salt concentration, in stark contrast with the non-monotonic salt concentration dependence of other ion correlation-driven phenomena, such as overcharging and like-charge attraction. We also elucidate that the origin of the opposite-charge repulsion is the large amount of ions attracted to the double layer as a result of ion-ion correlations, leading to higher osmotic pressure and stronger screening of the electrostatic attraction, which results in an overall repulsive force between two oppositely charged surfaces. Furthermore, we demonstrate that there is no causal relationship between opposite-charge repulsion and the overcharging of the surface. Opposite-charge repulsion is accompanied by overcharging at large separation distances, but can also occur in normal double layers without overcharging at intermediate separation distances.</description>

Herein, we report a family of RE-based spin ladder compounds Ba2RE2Ge4O13 (RE = Pr, Nd, Gd-Ho) crystallized into the monoclinic structure with the space group C2/c. The RE ions are arranged on a two-leg spin ladder motif along the b-axis, where the rung and leg exchange interactions are bridged via the RE-O-RE pathways and RE-O-Ge-O-RE routes, respectively. Moreover, the much shorter rung distance in the RE2O12 dimer units than the leg distance suggests Ba2RE2Ge4O13 to be a strong-rung spin ladder system. All the synthesized Ba2RE2Ge4O13 (RE = Pr, Nd, Gd-Ho) compounds exhibit the dominant antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions and absence of magnetic order down to 1.8 K. Among the family members, Ba2Dy2Ge4O13 can be described by Jeff = 1/2 Kramers doublet states, the low temperature specific heat indicates the coexistence of spin dimerized state with broad maximum at ~ 2.4 K and long-range AFM order with TN = 0.81 K. This family of Ba2RE2Ge4O13 compounds thereby provides a rare platform to investigate the novel spin ladder physics constructed by 4f electrons.</description>

      <title>On the Robustness of Machine Learning Models in Predicting Thermodynamic Properties: a Case of Searching for New Quasicrystal Approximants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite an artificial intelligence-assisted modeling of disordered crystals is a widely used and well-tried method of new materials design, the issues of its robustness, reliability, and stability are still not resolved and even not discussed enough. To highlight it, in this work we composed a series of nested intermetallic approximants of quasicrystals datasets and trained various machine learning models on them correspondingly. Our qualitative and, what is more important, quantitative assessment of the difference in the predictions clearly shows that different reasonable changes in the training sample can lead to the completely different set of the predicted potentially new materials. We also showed the advantage of pre-training and proposed a simple yet effective trick of sequential training to increase stability.</description>

      <title>Piezoelectric polymer generators: the large bending regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is an important difference between piezoelectric polymer films and solid crystals for the application to piezoelectric generators. In the case of polymers, the optimal piezoelectric response imposes {\it a large bending regime}. Starting from the linear Curie's constitutive equations, we develop an analytical model under the assumption of the large bending regime resulting from bulge testing configuration. This model shows a specific non-linear piezoelectric response, that follows a power $2/3$ of the mechanical excitation. The piezoelectric voltage and the corresponding power are then studied experimentally as a function of the angular frequency $\omega$ of the mechanical excitation, the load resistance $R$, and the thickness of the film $\ell$. The experimental results carried out on piezoelectric PVDF films validate the model.</description>

      <title>Tensegrity-Inspired Polymer Films: Progressive Bending Stiffness through Multipolymeric Patterning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Materials with J-shaped stress-strain behavior under uniaxial stretching, where strength increases as deformation progresses, have been developed through various materials designs. On the other hand, polymer materials that progressively stiffen under bending remain unrealized. To address this gap, this study drew inspiration from membrane tensegrity structures, which achieve structural stability by balancing compressive forces in rods and tensile forces in membrane. Notably, some of these structures exhibit increased stiffness under bending. Using a multipolymer patterning technique, we developed a polymer film exhibiting membrane tensegrity-like properties that stiffens under bending. This effect results from membrane tension generated by rod protrusions and an increase in second moment of area at regions with maximum curvature.</description>
