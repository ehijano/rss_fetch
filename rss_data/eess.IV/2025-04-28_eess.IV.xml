      <title>A Deep Bayesian Convolutional Spiking Neural Network-based CAD system with Uncertainty Quantification for Medical Images Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Computer_Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems facilitate accurate diagnosis of diseases. The development of CADs by leveraging third generation neural network, namely, Spiking Neural Network (SNN), is essential to utilize of the benefits of SNNs, such as their event_driven processing, parallelism, low power consumption, and the ability to process sparse temporal_spatial information. However, Deep SNN as a deep learning model faces challenges with unreliability. To deal with unreliability challenges due to inability to quantify the uncertainty of the predictions, we proposed a deep Bayesian Convolutional Spiking Neural Network based_CADs with uncertainty_aware module. In this study, the Monte Carlo Dropout method as Bayesian approximation is used as an uncertainty quantification method. This method was applied to several medical image classification tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model is accurate and reliable and will be a proper alternative to conventional deep learning for medical image classification.</description>

      <title>Predicting Dairy Calf Body Weight from Depth Images Using Deep Learning (YOLOv8) and Threshold Segmentation with Cross-Validation and Longitudinal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring calf body weight (BW) before weaning is essential for assessing growth, feed efficiency, health, and weaning readiness. However, labor, time, and facility constraints limit BW collection. Additionally, Holstein calf coat patterns complicate image-based BW estimation, and few studies have explored non-contact measurements taken at early time points for predicting later BW. The objectives of this study were to (1) develop deep learning-based segmentation models for extracting calf body metrics, (2) compare deep learning segmentation with threshold-based methods, and (3) evaluate BW prediction using single-time-point cross-validation with linear regression (LR) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and multiple-time-point cross-validation with LR, XGBoost, and a linear mixed model (LMM). Depth images from Holstein (n = 63) and Jersey (n = 5) pre-weaning calves were collected, with 20 Holstein calves being weighed manually. Results showed that You Only Look Once version 8 (YOLOv8) deep learning segmentation (intersection over union = 0.98) outperformed threshold-based methods (0.89). In single-time-point cross-validation, XGBoost achieved the best BW prediction (R^2 = 0.91, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) = 4.37%), while LMM provided the most accurate longitudinal BW prediction (R^2 = 0.99, MAPE = 2.39%). These findings highlight the potential of deep learning for automated BW prediction, enhancing farm management.</description>

      <title>Spectral Bias Correction in PINNs for Myocardial Image Registration of Pathological Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate myocardial image registration is essential for cardiac strain analysis and disease diagnosis. However, spectral bias in neural networks impedes modeling high-frequency deformations, producing inaccurate, biomechanically implausible results, particularly in pathological data. This paper addresses spectral bias in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) by integrating Fourier Feature mappings and introducing modulation strategies into a PINN framework. Experiments on two distinct datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods enhance the PINN's ability to capture complex, high-frequency deformations in cardiomyopathies, achieving superior registration accuracy while maintaining biomechanical plausibility - thus providing a foundation for scalable cardiac image registration and generalization across multiple patients and pathologies.</description>

      <title>Physics-Driven Neural Compensation For Electrical Impedance Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18067v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) provides a non-invasive, portable imaging modality with significant potential in medical and industrial applications. Despite its advantages, EIT encounters two primary challenges: the ill-posed nature of its inverse problem and the spatially variable, location-dependent sensitivity distribution. Traditional model-based methods mitigate ill-posedness through regularization but overlook sensitivity variability, while supervised deep learning approaches require extensive training data and lack generalization. Recent developments in neural fields have introduced implicit regularization techniques for image reconstruction, but these methods typically neglect the physical principles underlying EIT, thus limiting their effectiveness. In this study, we propose PhyNC (Physics-driven Neural Compensation), an unsupervised deep learning framework that incorporates the physical principles of EIT. PhyNC addresses both the ill-posed inverse problem and the sensitivity distribution by dynamically allocating neural representational capacity to regions with lower sensitivity, ensuring accurate and balanced conductivity reconstructions. Extensive evaluations on both simulated and experimental data demonstrate that PhyNC outperforms existing methods in terms of detail preservation and artifact resistance, particularly in low-sensitivity regions. Our approach enhances the robustness of EIT reconstructions and provides a flexible framework that can be adapted to other imaging modalities with similar challenges.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Weight Modified Riesz Mean Filter For High-Density Salt and Pepper Noise Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel filter, the Adaptive Weight Modified Riesz Mean Filter (AWMRmF), designed for the effective removal of high-density salt and pepper noise (SPN). AWMRmF integrates a pixel weight function and adaptivity condition inspired by the Different Adaptive Modified Riesz Mean Filter (DAMRmF). In my simulations, I evaluated the performance of AWMRmF against established filters such as Adaptive Frequency Median Filter (AFMF), Adaptive Weighted Mean Filter (AWMF), Adaptive Cesaro Mean Filter (ACmF), Adaptive Riesz Mean Filter (ARmF), and Improved Adaptive Weighted Mean Filter (IAWMF). The assessment was conducted on 26 typical test images, varying noise levels from 60% to 95%. The findings indicate that, in terms of both Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity (SSIM) metrics, AWMRmF outperformed other state-of-the-art filters. Furthermore, AWMRmF demonstrated superior performance in mean PSNR and SSIM results as well.</description>

      <title>Towards a deep learning approach for classifying treatment response in glioblastomas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glioblastomas are the most aggressive type of glioma, having a 5-year survival rate of 6.9%. Treatment typically involves surgery, followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and frequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to monitor disease progression. To assess treatment response, radiologists use the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria to categorize the tumor into one of four labels based on imaging and clinical features: complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease. This assessment is very complex and time-consuming. Since deep learning (DL) has been widely used to tackle classification problems, this work aimed to implement the first DL pipeline for the classification of RANO criteria based on two consecutive MRI acquisitions. The models were trained and tested on the open dataset LUMIERE. Five approaches were tested: 1) subtraction of input images, 2) different combinations of modalities, 3) different model architectures, 4) different pretraining tasks, and 5) adding clinical data. The pipeline that achieved the best performance used a Densenet264 considering only T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) images as input without any pretraining. A median Balanced Accuracy of 50.96% was achieved. Additionally, explainability methods were applied. Using Saliency Maps, the tumor region was often successfully highlighted. In contrast, Grad-CAM typically failed to highlight the tumor region, with some exceptions observed in the Complete Response and Progressive Disease classes, where it effectively identified the tumor region. These results set a benchmark for future studies on glioblastoma treatment response assessment based on the RANO criteria while emphasizing the heterogeneity of factors that might play a role when assessing the tumor's response to treatment.</description>

      <title>NUDF: Neural Unsigned Distance Fields for high resolution 3D medical image segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is often considered as the task of labelling each pixel or voxel as being inside or outside a given anatomy. Processing the images at their original size and resolution often result in insuperable memory requirements, but downsampling the images leads to a loss of important details. Instead of aiming to represent a smooth and continuous surface in a binary voxel-grid, we propose to learn a Neural Unsigned Distance Field (NUDF) directly from the image. The small memory requirements of NUDF allow for high resolution processing, while the continuous nature of the distance field allows us to create high resolution 3D mesh models of shapes of any topology (i.e. open surfaces). We evaluate our method on the task of left atrial appendage (LAA) segmentation from Computed Tomography (CT) images. The LAA is a complex and highly variable shape, being thus difficult to represent with traditional segmentation methods using discrete labelmaps. With our proposed method, we are able to predict 3D mesh models that capture the details of the LAA and achieve accuracy in the order of the voxel spacing in the CT images.</description>

      <title>Partition Map-Based Fast Block Partitioning for VVC Inter Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the new techniques of Versatile Video Coding (VVC), the quadtree with nested multi-type tree (QT+MTT) block structure yields significant coding gains by providing more flexible block partitioning patterns. However, the recursive partition search in the VVC encoder increases the encoder complexity substantially. To address this issue, we propose a partition map-based algorithm to pursue fast block partitioning in inter coding. Based on our previous work on partition map-based methods for intra coding, we analyze the characteristics of VVC inter coding, and thus improve the partition map by incorporating an MTT mask for early termination. Next, we develop a neural network that uses both spatial and temporal features to predict the partition map. It consists of several special designs including stacked top-down and bottom-up processing, quantization parameter modulation layers, and partitioning-adaptive warping. Furthermore, we present a dual-threshold decision scheme to achieve a fine-grained trade-off between complexity reduction and rate-distortion (RD) performance loss. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average 51.30% encoding time saving with a 2.12% Bjontegaard Delta Bit Rate (BDBR) under the random access configuration.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Deep Learning Approach for White Matter Shape Prediction in Diffusion MRI Tractography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shape measures have emerged as promising descriptors of white matter tractography, offering complementary insights into anatomical variability and associations with cognitive and clinical phenotypes. However, conventional methods for computing shape measures are computationally expensive and time-consuming for large-scale datasets due to reliance on voxel-based representations. We propose Tract2Shape, a novel multimodal deep learning framework that leverages geometric (point cloud) and scalar (tabular) features to predict ten white matter tractography shape measures. To enhance model efficiency, we utilize a dimensionality reduction algorithm for the model to predict five primary shape components. The model is trained and evaluated on two independently acquired datasets, the HCP-YA dataset, and the PPMI dataset. We evaluate the performance of Tract2Shape by training and testing it on the HCP-YA dataset and comparing the results with state-of-the-art models. To further assess its robustness and generalization ability, we also test Tract2Shape on the unseen PPMI dataset. Tract2Shape outperforms SOTA deep learning models across all ten shape measures, achieving the highest average Pearson's r and the lowest nMSE on the HCP-YA dataset. The ablation study shows that both multimodal input and PCA contribute to performance gains. On the unseen testing PPMI dataset, Tract2Shape maintains a high Pearson's r and low nMSE, demonstrating strong generalizability in cross-dataset evaluation. Tract2Shape enables fast, accurate, and generalizable prediction of white matter shape measures from tractography data, supporting scalable analysis across datasets. This framework lays a promising foundation for future large-scale white matter shape analysis.</description>

      <title>HepatoGEN: Generating Hepatobiliary Phase MRI with Perceptual and Adversarial Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) plays a crucial role in the detection and characterization of focal liver lesions, with the hepatobiliary phase (HBP) providing essential diagnostic information. However, acquiring HBP images requires prolonged scan times, which may compromise patient comfort and scanner throughput. In this study, we propose a deep learning based approach for synthesizing HBP images from earlier contrast phases (precontrast and transitional) and compare three generative models: a perceptual U-Net, a perceptual GAN (pGAN), and a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). We curated a multi-site DCE-MRI dataset from diverse clinical settings and introduced a contrast evolution score (CES) to assess training data quality, enhancing model performance. Quantitative evaluation using pixel-wise and perceptual metrics, combined with qualitative assessment through blinded radiologist reviews, showed that pGAN achieved the best quantitative performance but introduced heterogeneous contrast in out-of-distribution cases. In contrast, the U-Net produced consistent liver enhancement with fewer artifacts, while DDPM underperformed due to limited preservation of fine structural details. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of synthetic HBP image generation as a means to reduce scan time without compromising diagnostic utility, highlighting the clinical potential of deep learning for dynamic contrast enhancement in liver MRI.

      <title>Nearly isotropic segmentation for medial temporal lobe subregions in multi-modality MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Morphometry of medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions in brain MRI is sensitive biomarker to Alzheimers Disease and other related conditions. While T2-weighted (T2w) MRI with high in-plane resolution is widely used to segment hippocampal subfields due to its higher contrast in hippocampus, its lower out-of-plane resolution reduces the accuracy of subregion thickness measurements. To address this issue, we developed a nearly isotropic segmentation pipeline that incorporates image and label upsampling and high-resolution segmentation in T2w MRI. First, a high-resolution atlas was created based on an existing anisotropic atlas derived from 29 individuals. Both T1-weighted and T2w images in the atlas were upsampled from their original resolution to a nearly isotropic resolution 0.4x0.4x0.52mm3 using a non-local means approach. Manual segmentations within the atlas were also upsampled to match this resolution using a UNet-based neural network, which was trained on a cohort consisting of both high-resolution ex vivo and low-resolution anisotropic in vivo MRI with manual segmentations. Second, a multi-modality deep learning-based segmentation model was trained within this nearly isotropic atlas. Finally, experiments showed the nearly isotropic subregion segmentation improved the accuracy of cortical thickness as an imaging biomarker for neurodegeneration in T2w MRI.</description>

      <title>RSFR: A Coarse-to-Fine Reconstruction Framework for Diffusion Tensor Cardiac MRI with Semantic-Aware Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiac diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) offers unique insights into cardiomyocyte arrangements, bridging the gap between microscopic and macroscopic cardiac function. However, its clinical utility is limited by technical challenges, including a low signal-to-noise ratio, aliasing artefacts, and the need for accurate quantitative fidelity. To address these limitations, we introduce RSFR (Reconstruction, Segmentation, Fusion &amp; Refinement), a novel framework for cardiac diffusion-weighted image reconstruction. RSFR employs a coarse-to-fine strategy, leveraging zero-shot semantic priors via the Segment Anything Model and a robust Vision Mamba-based reconstruction backbone. Our framework integrates semantic features effectively to mitigate artefacts and enhance fidelity, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and accurate DT parameter estimation under high undersampling rates. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the superior performance of RSFR compared to existing methods, highlighting its robustness, scalability, and potential for clinical translation in quantitative cardiac DTI.</description>

      <title>SmallGS: Gaussian Splatting-based Camera Pose Estimation for Small-Baseline Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic videos with small baseline motions are ubiquitous in daily life, especially on social media. However, these videos present a challenge to existing pose estimation frameworks due to ambiguous features, drift accumulation, and insufficient triangulation constraints. Gaussian splatting, which maintains an explicit representation for scenes, provides a reliable novel view rasterization when the viewpoint change is small. Inspired by this, we propose SmallGS, a camera pose estimation framework that is specifically designed for small-baseline videos. SmallGS optimizes sequential camera poses using Gaussian splatting, which reconstructs the scene from the first frame in each video segment to provide a stable reference for the rest. The temporal consistency of Gaussian splatting within limited viewpoint differences reduced the requirement of sufficient depth variations in traditional camera pose estimation. We further incorporate pretrained robust visual features, e.g. DINOv2, into Gaussian splatting, where high-dimensional feature map rendering enhances the robustness of camera pose estimation. By freezing the Gaussian splatting and optimizing camera viewpoints based on rasterized features, SmallGS effectively learns camera poses without requiring explicit feature correspondences or strong parallax motion. We verify the effectiveness of SmallGS in small-baseline videos in TUM-Dynamics sequences, which achieves impressive accuracy in camera pose estimation compared to MonST3R and DORID-SLAM for small-baseline videos in dynamic scenes.

      <title>Object Learning and Robust 3D Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: In this thesis we discuss architectural designs and training methods for a neural network to have the ability of dissecting an image into objects of interest without supervision. The main challenge in 2D unsupervised object segmentation is distinguishing between foreground objects of interest and background. FlowCapsules uses motion as a cue for the objects of interest in 2D scenarios. The last part of this thesis focuses on 3D applications where the goal is detecting and removal of the object of interest from the input images. In these tasks, we leverage the geometric consistency of scenes in 3D to detect the inconsistent dynamic objects. Our transient object masks are then used for designing robust optimization kernels to improve 3D modelling in a casual capture setup. One of our goals in this thesis is to show the merits of unsupervised object based approaches in computer vision. Furthermore, we suggest possible directions for defining objects of interest or foreground objects without requiring supervision. Our hope is to motivate and excite the community into further exploring explicit object representations in image understanding tasks.</description>

      <title>Subject-driven Video Generation via Disentangled Identity and Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose to train a subject-driven customized video generation model through decoupling the subject-specific learning from temporal dynamics in zero-shot without additional tuning. A traditional method for video customization that is tuning-free often relies on large, annotated video datasets, which are computationally expensive and require extensive annotation. In contrast to the previous approach, we introduce the use of an image customization dataset directly on training video customization models, factorizing the video customization into two folds: (1) identity injection through image customization dataset and (2) temporal modeling preservation with a small set of unannotated videos through the image-to-video training method. Additionally, we employ random image token dropping with randomized image initialization during image-to-video fine-tuning to mitigate the copy-and-paste issue. To further enhance learning, we introduce stochastic switching during joint optimization of subject-specific and temporal features, mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our method achieves strong subject consistency and scalability, outperforming existing video customization models in zero-shot settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.</description>

      <title>Masked strategies for images with small objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hematology analytics used for detection and classification of small blood components is a significant challenge. In particular, when objects exists as small pixel-sized entities in a large context of similar objects. Deep learning approaches using supervised models with pre-trained weights, such as residual networks and vision transformers have demonstrated success for many applications. Unfortunately, when applied to images outside the domain of learned representations, these methods often result with less than acceptable performance. A strategy to overcome this can be achieved by using self-supervised models, where representations are learned and weights are then applied for downstream applications. Recently, masked autoencoders have proven to be effective to obtain representations that captures global context information. By masking regions of an image and having the model learn to reconstruct both the masked and non-masked regions, weights can be used for various applications. However, if the sizes of the objects in images are less than the size of the mask, the global context information is lost, making it almost impossible to reconstruct the image. In this study, we investigated the effect of mask ratios and patch sizes for blood components using a MAE to obtain learned ViT encoder representations. We then applied the encoder weights to train a U-Net Transformer for semantic segmentation to obtain both local and global contextual information. Our experimental results demonstrates that both smaller mask ratios and patch sizes improve the reconstruction of images using a MAE. We also show the results of semantic segmentation with and without pre-trained weights, where smaller-sized blood components benefited with pre-training. Overall, our proposed method offers an efficient and effective strategy for the segmentation and classification of small objects.</description>

      <title>MROP: Modulated Rank-One Projections for compressive radio interferometric imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emerging generation of radio-interferometric (RI) arrays are set to form images of the sky with a new regime of sensitivity and resolution. This implies a significant increase in visibility data volumes, scaling as $\mathcal{O}(Q^{2}B)$ for $Q$ antennas and $B$ short-time integration intervals (or batches), calling for efficient data dimensionality reduction techniques. This paper proposes a new approach to data compression during acquisition, coined modulated rank-one projection (MROP). MROP compresses the $Q\times Q$ batchwise covariance matrix into a smaller number $P$ of random rank-one projections and compresses across time by trading $B$ for a smaller number $M$ of random modulations of the ROP measurement vectors. Firstly, we introduce a dual perspective on the MROP acquisition, which can either be understood as random beamforming, or as a post-correlation compression. Secondly, we analyse the noise statistics of MROPs and demonstrate that the random projections induce a uniform noise level across measurements independently of the visibility-weighting scheme used. Thirdly, we propose a detailed analysis of the memory and computational cost requirements across the data acquisition and image reconstruction stages, with comparison to state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction approaches. Finally, the MROP model is validated in simulation for monochromatic intensity imaging, with comparison to the classical and baseline-dependent averaging (BDA) models, and using the uSARA optimisation algorithm for image formation. An extensive experimental setup is considered, with ground-truth images containing diffuse and faint emission and spanning a wide variety of dynamic ranges, and for a range of $uv$-coverages corresponding to VLA and MeerKAT observation.</description>

      <title>Iterative Event-based Motion Segmentation by Variational Contrast Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event cameras provide rich signals that are suitable for motion estimation since they respond to changes in the scene. As any visual changes in the scene produce event data, it is paramount to classify the data into different motions (i.e., motion segmentation), which is useful for various tasks such as object detection and visual servoing. We propose an iterative motion segmentation method, by classifying events into background (e.g., dominant motion hypothesis) and foreground (independent motion residuals), thus extending the Contrast Maximization framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully classifies event clusters both for public and self-recorded datasets, producing sharp, motion-compensated edge-like images. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on moving object detection benchmarks with an improvement of over 30%, and demonstrates its possibility of applying to more complex and noisy real-world scenes. We hope this work broadens the sensitivity of Contrast Maximization with respect to both motion parameters and input events, thus contributing to theoretical advancements in event-based motion segmentation estimation. https://github.com/aoki-media-lab/event_based_segmentation_vcmax</description>

      <title>Scanning Electron Microscopy-based Automatic Defect Inspection for Semiconductor Manufacturing: A Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this review, automatic defect inspection algorithms that analyze Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images for Semiconductor Manufacturing (SM) are identified, categorized, and discussed. This is a topic of critical importance for the SM industry as the continuous shrinking of device patterns has led to increasing defectivity and a greater prevalence of higher-resolution imaging tools such as SEM. Among others, these aspects threaten to increase costs due to increased inspection time-to-solution and decreased yield. Relevant research papers were systematically identified in four popular publication databases in January 2024. A total of 103 papers were selected after screening for novel contributions relating to automatic SEM image analysis algorithms for semiconductor defect inspection. These papers were then categorized based on the inspection tasks they addressed, their evaluation metrics, and the type of algorithms used. A notable finding from this categorization is that reference-based defect detection algorithms were the most popular algorithm type until 2020 when Deep Learning (DL)-based inspection algorithms became more popular, especially for defect classification. Furthermore, four broader research questions were discussed to come to the following conclusions: (i) the key components of inspection algorithms are set up, pre-processing, feature extraction, and final prediction; (ii) the maturity of the manufacturing process affects the data availability and required sensitivity of inspection algorithms; (iii) key challenges for these algorithms relate to the desiderata of minimizing time-to-solution which pushes for high imaging throughput, reducing manual input during algorithm setup, and higher processing throughput; and (iv) three promising directions for future work are suggested based on gaps in the reviewed literature that address key remaining limitations.</description>

      <title>A Spatially-Aware Multiple Instance Learning Framework for Digital Pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a promising approach for weakly supervised classification in pathology using whole slide images (WSIs). However, conventional MIL methods such as Attention-Based Deep Multiple Instance Learning (ABMIL) typically disregard spatial interactions among patches that are crucial to pathological diagnosis. Recent advancements, such as Transformer based MIL (TransMIL), have incorporated spatial context and inter-patch relationships. However, it remains unclear whether explicitly modeling patch relationships yields similar performance gains in ABMIL, which relies solely on Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). In contrast, TransMIL employs Transformer-based layers, introducing a fundamental architectural shift at the cost of substantially increased computational complexity. In this work, we enhance the ABMIL framework by integrating interaction-aware representations to address this question. Our proposed model, Global ABMIL (GABMIL), explicitly captures inter-instance dependencies while preserving computational efficiency. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets for tumor subtyping in breast and lung cancers demonstrate that GABMIL achieves up to a 7 percentage point improvement in AUPRC and a 5 percentage point increase in the Kappa score over ABMIL, with minimal or no additional computational overhead. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating patch interactions within MIL frameworks. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/tueimage/GABMIL}{\texttt{GABMIL}}.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Learning and Adversarial Disentanglement for Task-Oriented Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Task-oriented semantic communication systems have emerged as a promising approach to achieving efficient and intelligent data transmission, where only information relevant to a specific task is communicated. However, existing methods struggle to fully disentangle task-relevant and task-irrelevant information, leading to privacy concerns and subpar performance. To address this, we propose an information-bottleneck method, named CLAD (contrastive learning and adversarial disentanglement). CLAD utilizes contrastive learning to effectively capture task-relevant features while employing adversarial disentanglement to discard task-irrelevant information. Additionally, due to the lack of reliable and reproducible methods to gain insight into the informativeness and minimality of the encoded feature vectors, we introduce a new technique to compute the information retention index (IRI), a comparative metric used as a proxy for the mutual information between the encoded features and the input, reflecting the minimality of the encoded features. The IRI quantifies the minimality and informativeness of the encoded feature vectors across different task-oriented communication techniques. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CLAD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of semantic extraction, task performance, privacy preservation, and IRI. CLAD achieves a predictive performance improvement of around 2.5-3%, along with a 77-90% reduction in IRI and a 57-76% decrease in adversarial attribute inference attack accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Temporal Convolutional Network-Based Approach and a Benchmark Dataset for Colonoscopy Video Temporal Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following recent advancements in computer-aided detection and diagnosis systems for colonoscopy, the automated reporting of colonoscopy procedures is set to further revolutionize clinical practice. A crucial yet underexplored aspect in the development of these systems is the creation of computer vision models capable of autonomously segmenting full-procedure colonoscopy videos into anatomical sections and procedural phases. In this work, we aim to create the first open-access dataset for this task and propose a state-of-the-art approach, benchmarked against competitive models. We annotated the publicly available REAL-Colon dataset, consisting of 2.7 million frames from 60 complete colonoscopy videos, with frame-level labels for anatomical locations and colonoscopy phases across nine categories. We then present ColonTCN, a learning-based architecture that employs custom temporal convolutional blocks designed to efficiently capture long temporal dependencies for the temporal segmentation of colonoscopy videos. We also propose a dual k-fold cross-validation evaluation protocol for this benchmark, which includes model assessment on unseen, multi-center data.ColonTCN achieves state-of-the-art performance in classification accuracy while maintaining a low parameter count when evaluated using the two proposed k-fold cross-validation settings, outperforming competitive models. We report ablation studies to provide insights into the challenges of this task and highlight the benefits of the custom temporal convolutional blocks, which enhance learning and improve model efficiency. We believe that the proposed open-access benchmark and the ColonTCN approach represent a significant advancement in the temporal segmentation of colonoscopy procedures, fostering further open-access research to address this clinical need.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Few-Shot Image Fusion: Granular Ball Priors Enable General-Purpose Deep Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08937v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In image fusion tasks, the absence of real fused images as priors presents a fundamental challenge. Most deep learning-based fusion methods rely on large-scale paired datasets to extract global weighting features from raw images, thereby generating fused outputs that approximate real fused images. In contrast to previous studies, this paper explores few-shot training of neural networks under the condition of having prior knowledge. We propose a novel fusion framework named GBFF, and a Granular Ball Significant Extraction algorithm specifically designed for the few-shot prior setting. All pixel pairs involved in the fusion process are initially modeled as a Coarse-Grained Granular Ball. At the local level, Fine-Grained Granular Balls are used to slide through the brightness space to extract Non-Salient Pixel Pairs, and perform splitting operations to obtain Salient Pixel Pairs. Pixel-wise weights are then computed to generate a pseudo-supervised image. At the global level, pixel pairs with significant contributions to the fusion process are categorized into the Positive Region, while those whose contributions cannot be accurately determined are assigned to the Boundary Region. The Granular Ball performs modality-aware adaptation based on the proportion of the positive region, thereby adjusting the neural network's loss function and enabling it to complement the information of the boundary region. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed algorithm and the underlying theory. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, our approach shows strong competitiveness in terms of both fusion time and image expressiveness. Our code is publicly available at:</description>
