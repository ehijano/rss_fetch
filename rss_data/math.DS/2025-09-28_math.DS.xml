      <title>Angular Linearization and Quantitative Convergence of Statistical Ensembles for Weighted Integrable Hamiltonian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of weighted integrable Hamiltonian systems, we study the long-time behavior of the associated statistical ensembles. We construct an action-dependent angular conjugacy that rectifies the nonuniform angular flow into a constant-speed linear flow, thereby reducing the ensemble dynamics to oscillatory integrals over the action domain. Using integration by parts along a tailored vector field and \(W^{1,1}\) approximations with controlled boundary terms, we derive inverse-in-time decay for each Fourier mode and complete the summation under nonresonance and uniform nondegeneracy assumptions. Consequently, under suitable regularity and admissible initial data, we prove that the ensemble converges to the weighted equilibrium measure at rate \(O(1/t)\), with an explicit parameter-dependent bound. The methodology provides a transferable analytic scheme for establishing limit theorems in near-integrable regimes.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg Translation Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study ergodic theoretical properties of flows on circle bundles over translation surfaces that arise via prequantization, generalizing the theory of Heisenberg nilflows to base surfaces more general than tori; these flows are among the most fundamental examples of parabolic dynamical systems with non-trivial central directions. In particular, we show that such flows are relatively mixing, i.e., they exhibit decay of correlations in the orthogonal complement of functions constant along fibers. We discuss applications of this result to the dynamics of such flows, to the ergodic theory on the corresponding space of wave functions, and, via surface of section constructions, to the study of affine skew products over interval exchange transformations, in the spirit of Furstenberg's classification program for measurable dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Some stability results for the fractional differential equations with two delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the stability properties of a nonlinear fractional differential equation with two discrete delays and a delay-dependent coefficient. Such equations arise in various biological and control systems where temporal delays influence feedback mechanisms. Two cases are analyzed: one where the first delay is zero, and the second acts through an exponential coefficient, and another where the first delay is fixed. We derive delay-independent stability conditions using linearization, characteristic equations, and bifurcation theory, along with complete theoretical proofs. The results are validated through numerical simulations and stability diagrams.</description>

      <title>Robust Transitivity of Partially Hyperbolic Diffeomorphisms with Interval Central Leaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a boundary-preserving partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism with interval central leaves, we completely characterize the $C^k$-robust transitivity $(k\geq 2)$ by boundary interconnection. As an application, if the boundary SRB measures admit negative central Lyapunov exponents, then boundary interconnection also completely characterizes the phenomenon of robustly intermingled basins for boundary SRB measures.</description>

      <title>Distinct dimensions for attractors of bi-Lipschitz iterated function systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct an iterated function system on the line consisting of two bi-Lipschitz contractions whose attractor has distinct lower, Hausdorff, lower box, upper box, and Assouad dimensions, thereby providing negative answers to certain folklore questions.
  Furthermore, as a by-product of our study of bi-Lipschitz IFSs, we construct IFSs within this family that exhibit interesting fractal behaviour. In particular, we prove the following two statements: (i) There exists a bi-Lipschitz IFS for which the pushforward of any ergodic measure with positive entropy is not exact dimensional; (ii) There exists a bi-Lipschitz IFS whose attractor has empty interior yet positive Lebesgue measure.</description>

      <title>Generalized Thue-Morse measures: spectral and fractal analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a family of Riesz products and show that they can be regarded as diffraction measures of generalized Thue-Morse sequences, possibly over an infinite alphabet. These measures are closely related to the dynamical system arising from the doubling map together with an observable exhibiting a logarithmic singularity. For this system, we develop a generalized thermodynamic formalism beyond the standard setting, which yields explicit formulas for Birkhoff and dimension spectra. A further novel aspect is the identification of a precise connection between these spectra and the $L^q$-spectrum of the underlying Riesz product. This new link allows us to determine, explicitly, the Fourier and quantization dimension, and to describe the spectral asymptotics of the associated Kre\u{i}n-Feller operator, providing new insights into the interplay between diffraction, fractal geometry, and spectral theory in the Thue-Morse context.</description>

      <title>Synchrony in firing rate neural networks with multiple delays: A harmonic balance approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks of neural mass nodes with delayed interactions are increasingly being used as models for large-scale brain activity. To complement the growing number of computational studies of such networks, it is timely to develop new mathematical studies of their solution structure and bifurcations. The analysis of steady states and their stability is relatively well developed, though that of time-periodic solutions is far less so. Here, we show how the method of harmonic balance is ideally suited to describing delay-induced and delay-modulated periodic oscillations at both the node and network level. This approach reduces the formally infinite dimensional setting of the delayed differential equation network to a finite dimensional one, opening the way for a practical combined analytical and numerical treatment. At the node level, we show how to construct periodic orbits and develop an associated linear stability analysis to determine the Floquet exponents and, thus, stability. At the network level, we further show that explicit progress for analysing the stability of the synchronous state can be made for networks with a circulant structure. This is achieved with the use of an adjacency lag operator that decouples the linearised network equations into a set of equations that can each be analysed using the techniques previously developed for analysing a single node. When combined with numerical continuation techniques this allows us to build the skeleton of a network bifurcation diagram, and highlight the role of distance-dependent delays in contributing to novel spatio-temporal patterns arising from the instability of a synchronous state, including travelling periodic waves, alternating anti-phase solutions (in which only next nearest neighbours are synchronised), cluster states, and more exotic behaviours.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a linear upper bound for the number of singular points on the boundary of a quadrature domain, improving a previously known quadratic bound due to Gustafsson \cite{Gus88}. This linear upper bound on the number of boundary double points also strengthens the bound on the connectivity (i.e., the number of complementary components) of a quadrature domain given by Lee and Makarov \cite{LM16}. Our proofs use conformal dynamics and hyperbolic geometry arguments. Finally, we introduce a new dynamical method to construct multiply connected quadrature domains.</description>

      <title>Uniform Hyperbolicity, Bandgaps and Edge Modes in Aperiodic Systems of Subwavelength Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to characterise the spectral distributions of bi-infinite, semi-infinite, and finite aperiodic one-dimensional arrays of subwavelength resonators, constructed by sampling from a finite library of building blocks. By adopting the modern formalism of uniform hyperbolicity, we are able to strengthen and rigorously prove a Saxon-Hutner-type result, fully characterising the spectral gaps of the composite bi-infinite aperiodic system in terms of its constituent blocks. Crucial to this approach is a change of basis from transfer matrices to propagation matrices, allowing for a block-level characterisation. This approach also enables an explicit characterisation of edge-induced eigenmodes in the semi-infinite setting. Finally, we leverage finite section methods for Jacobi operators to extend our results to finite systems - providing strict bounds for their spectra in terms of their constituent blocks.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Transfer Operators in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Koopman operator, as a linear representation of a nonlinear dynamical system, has been attracting attention in many fields of science. Recently, Koopman operator theory has been combined with another concept that is popular in data science: reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We follow this thread into Gaussian process methods, and illustrate how these methods can alleviate two pervasive problems with kernel-based Koopman algorithms. The first being sparsity: most kernel methods do not scale well and require an approximation to become practical. We show that not only can the computational demands be reduced, but also demonstrate improved resilience against sensor noise. The second problem involves hyperparameter optimization and dictionary learning to adapt the model to the dynamical system. In summary, the main contribution of this work is the unification of Gaussian process regression and dynamic mode decomposition.</description>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to study stability of Lyapunov exponents and simplicity of Lyapunov spectrum for bounded random compact operators on a separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert space from a generic point of view generated by the essential supremum norm. Firstly, we show the density of both the set of bounded random compact operators having finite number Lyapunov exponents and the set of bounded random compact operators having countably infinite number Lyapunov exponents. Meanwhile, the set of bounded random compact operators having no Lyapunov exponent is nowhere dense. Finally, for any $k\in\N$ we show that the set of bounded random compact operators satisfying that the Lyapunov spectral corresponding to their first $k$ Lyapunov exponents are simple and continuous contains an open and dense set.</description>

      <title>Ledrappier-Young entropy formula for $C^1$ diffeomorphisms with dominated splitting Part 1: Unstable entropy formula and invariance principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the unstable entropy of $C^1$ diffeomorphisms with dominated splittings. Our main result shows that when the zero Lyapunov exponent has multiplicity one, the center direction contributes no entropy, and the unstable entropy coincides with the metric entropy. This extends the celebrated work of Ledrappier-Young [18] for $C^2$ diffeomorphisms to the $C^1$ setting under these assumptions. In particular, our results apply to $C^1$ diffeomorphisms away from homoclinic tangencies due to [20].
  As consequences, we obtain several applications at $C^1$ regularity. The Avila-Viana invariance principle [7, 33] holds when the center is one-dimensional. Results on measures of maximal entropy due to Hertz-Hertz-Tahzibi-Ures [25], Tahzibi-Yang [33]}, and Ures-Viana-Yang-Yang [34, 35] also remain valid for $C^1$ diffeomorphisms.</description>

Abstract: We study systematically cross sections of probability preserving actions of unimodular groups and their associated transverse measures, and introduce the invariant \emph{intersection covolume} to quantify their periodicity. Our main theorem, derived from a higher order version of Kac's lemma, shows that the intersection covolume is bounded below by the intensity, with equality precisely when the action is induced by a lattice (in the sense of Mackey). We further prove that the natural cross sections of cut--and--project actions have finite intersection covolume.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the intersection covolume of cross sections for probability preserving actions of a class of abelian groups without lattices, including $p$-adic groups and the group of finite adeles. We show that for cross sections with a uniformly discrete return time set, the intersection covolume is bounded below by twice the intensity, revealing a strict gap compared to the lattice case. Our main theorem asserts that cut-and-project systems uniquely attain the minimal intersection covolume. As an application, we characterize the generalized Farey fractions in the finite adeles via their Banach density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.10238v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish several classification results for compact extensions of tracial $W^*$-dynamical systems and for relatively independent joinings thereof for actions of arbitrary discrete groups. We use these results to answer a question of Austin, Eisner, and Tao and some questions raised by Duvenhage and King. Moreover, combining our results with an earlier classification of weakly mixing extensions by Popa, we can derive non-commutative Furstenberg-Zimmer type dichotomies on the $L^2$-level. Although in general an adequate generalization of the Furstenberg-Zimmer tower of intermediate compact extensions doesn't seem possible in the von Neumann algebraic framework, we show that there always exists a non-commutative analogue of the finer Host-Kra-Ziegler tower for any ergodic action of a countable abelian group.</description>

They conjectured that delta factors are irreducible for the family $z\mapsto z^2+c$. One can easily show the irreducibility for periods $1$ and $2$ by reducing it to the irreducibility of cyclotomic polynomials. However, for periods $3$ and beyond, this becomes a challenging problem. This paper proves the irreducibility of delta factors for the period $3$ and demonstrates the existence of infinitely many irreducible delta factors for periods greater than $3$.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the controllability of a broad class of recurrent neural networks widely used in theoretical neuroscience, including models of large-scale human brain dynamics. Motivated by emerging applications in non-invasive neurostimulation such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), we study the control synthesis of these networks using constant and piecewise constant inputs. The neural model considered is a continuous-time Hopfield-type system with nonlinear activation functions and arbitrary input matrices representing inter-regional brain interactions. Our main contribution is the formulation and solution of a control synthesis problem for such nonlinear systems using specific solution representations. These representations yield explicit algebraic conditions for synthesizing constant and piecewise constant controls that solve a two-point boundary value problem in state space up to higher-order corrections with respect to the time horizon. In particular, the input is constructed to satisfy a tractable small-time algebraic relation involving the Jacobian of the nonlinear drift, ensuring that the synthesis reduces to verifying conditions on the system matrices. For canonical input matrices that directly actuate $k$ nodes, this implies that the reachable set (with constant inputs) of a given initial state is an affine subspace whose dimension equals the input rank and whose basis can be computed efficiently using a thin QR factorization. Numerical simulations illustrate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed synthesis in guiding the design of brain stimulation protocols for therapeutic and cognitive applications.</description>

      <title>Next Generation Equation-Free Multiscale Modelling of Crowd Dynamics via Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: Bridging the microscopic and the macroscopic modelling scales in crowd dynamics constitutes an important open challenge for systematic numerical analysis, optimization and control. We propose a combined manifold and machine learning approach to learn the discrete evolution operator for the emergent crowd dynamics in latent spaces from high-fidelity agent-based simulations. The proposed framework builds upon our previous works on next-generation Equation-free algorithms for learning surrogate models of high-dim. multiscale systems. Our approach is a four-stage one, explicitly conserving the mass of the reconstructed dynamics in the high-dim. space. In the first step, we derive continuous macroscopic fields (densities) from discrete microscopic data (pedestrians' positions) using KDE. In the second step, based on manifold learning, we construct a map from the macroscopic ambient space into the latent space parametrized by a few coordinates based on POD of the corresponding density distribution. The third step involves learning reduced-order surrogate ROMs in the latent space using machine learning techniques, particularly LSTMs networks and MVARs. Finally, we reconstruct the crowd dynamics in the high-dim. space in terms of macroscopic density profiles. With this "embed-&gt;learn in latent space-&gt;lift back to ambient space" pipeline, we create an effective solution operator of the unavailable macroscopic PDE for the density evolution. For our illustrations, we use SFM to generate data in a corridor with an obstacle, imposing periodic boundary conditions. The numerical results demonstrate high accuracy, robustness, and generalizability, thus allowing for fast and accurate modelling of crowd dynamics from agent-based simulations. Notably, linear MVAR models surpass nonlinear LSTMs in predictive accuracy, while also offering significantly lower complexity and greater interpretability.</description>
