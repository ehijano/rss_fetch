      <title>Harmonic extension technique: probabilistic and analytic perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a path of the reflected Brownian motion in the half-plane $\{y \ge 0\}$, and erase its part contained in the interior $\{y &gt; 0\}$. What is left is, in an appropriate sense, a path of a jump-type stochastic process on the line $\{y = 0\}$ -- the boundary trace of the reflected Brownian motion. It is well known that this process is in fact the 1-stable L\'evy process, also known as the Cauchy process.
  The PDE interpretation of the above fact is the following. Consider a bounded harmonic function $u$ in the half-plane $\{y &gt; 0\}$, with sufficiently smooth boundary values $f$. Let $g$ denote the normal derivative of $u$ at the boundary. The mapping $f \mapsto g$ is known as the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator, and it is again well known that this operator coincides with the square root of the 1-D Laplace operator $-\Delta$. Thus, the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator coincides with the generator of the boundary trace process.
  Molchanov and Ostrovskii proved that isotropic stable L\'evy processes are boundary traces of appropriate diffusions in half-spaces. Caffarelli and Silvestre gave a PDE counterpart of this result: the fractional Laplace operator is the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator for an appropriate second-order elliptic equation in the half-space. Again, the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator turns out to be the generator of the boundary trace process.
  During my talk I will discuss boundary trace processes and Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators in a more general context. My main goal will be to explain the connections between probabilistic and analytical results. Along the way, I will introduce the necessary machinery: Brownian local times and additive functionals, Krein's spectral theory of strings, and Fourier transform methods.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic limits of transient patterns in a continuous-space interacting particle system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a discrete-time interacting particle system with continuous state space which is motivated by a mathematical model for turnover through branching in actin filament networks. It gives rise to transient clusters reminiscent of actin filament assemblies in the cortex of living cells. We reformulate the process in terms of the inter-particle distances and characterise their marginal and joint distributions. We construct a recurrence relation for the associated characteristic functions and pass to the large population limit, reminiscent of the Fleming-Viot super-processes. The precise characterisation of all marginal distributions established in this work opens the way to a detailed analysis of cluster dynamics. We also obtain a recurrence relation which enables us to compute the moments of the asymptotic single particle distribution characterising the transient aggregates. Our results indicate that aggregates have a fat-tailed distribution.</description>

      <title>Quasi-stationary distributions of non-absorbing Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider reversible ergodic Markov chains with finite state space, and we introduce a new notion of quasi-stationary distribution that does not require the presence of any absorbing state. In our setting, the hitting time of the absorbing set is replaced by an optimal strong stationary time, representing the ``hitting time of the stationary distribution''. On the one hand, we show that our notion of quasi-stationary distribution corresponds to the natural generalization of the \emph{Yaglom limit}. On the other hand, similarly to the classical quasi-stationary distribution, we show that it can be written in terms of the eigenvectors of the underlying Markov kernel, and it is therefore amenable of a geometric interpretation. Moreover, we recover the usual exponential behavior that characterizes quasi-stationary distributions and metastable systems. We also provide some toy examples, which show that the phenomenology is richer compared to the absorbing case. Finally, we present some counterexamples, showing that the assumption on the reversibility cannot be weakened in general.</description>

      <title>Brownian Last Passage Percolation with functional initial condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brownian last passage percolation is a classical model of integrable probability and the KPZ universality class. We consider the Brownian last passage model with a functional initial condition: $$BLPP(X;(t,m)) = \max_{0 \leq t_0 \leq t_1 \leq \cdots \leq t_m = t} X(t_0) + \sum_{k=1}^m B_k(t_k) - B_k(t_{k-1}).$$ Here $X: [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ and $B_k$ are independent, standard Brownian motions. We derive a formula for finite dimensional laws of $t \mapsto BLPP(X;(t,m))$ in terms of a Fredholm determinant.</description>

      <title>Functional Inequalities for doubly weighted Brownian Motion with Sticky-Reflecting Boundary Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give upper bounds for the Poincar\'e and Logarithmic Sobolev constants for doubly weighted Brownian motion on manifolds with sticky reflecting boundary diffusion under curvature assumptions on the manifold and its boundary. We therefor use an interpolation approach based on energy interactions between the boundary and the interior of the manifold and the weighted Reilly formula. Along the way we also obtain a lower bound on the first nontrivial doubly weighted Steklov eigenvalue and an upper bound on the norm of the doubly weighted boundary trace operator on Sobolev functions. We also consider the case of weighted Brownian motion with pure sticky reflection.</description>

Abstract: In the present paper, we consider the plug-in estimator of Shannon's entropy defined on a finite alphabet which is assumed to dynamically vary as the sample size increases. The asymptotic behaviors for the plug-in estimator, such as, asymptotic normality, Berry-Esseen bound and moderate deviation principle, are established.</description>

      <title>Disordered Gibbs measures and Gaussian conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the law of a random field $f_N(\boldsymbol{\sigma})$ evaluated at a random sample from the Gibbs measure associated to a Gaussian field $H_N(\boldsymbol{\sigma})$. In the high-temperature regime, we show that bounds on the probability that $f_N(\boldsymbol{\sigma})\in A$ for $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ randomly sampled from the Gibbs measure can be deduced from similar bounds for deterministic $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ under the conditional Gaussian law given that $H_N(\boldsymbol{\sigma})/N=E$ for $E$ close to the derivative $F'(\beta)$ of the free energy (which is the typical value of $H_N(\boldsymbol{\sigma})/N$ under the Gibbs measure). In the more challenging low-temperature regime we restrict to $k$-RSB spherical spin glasses, proving a similar result, now with a more elaborate conditioning. Namely, with $q_i$ denoting the locations of the non-zero atoms of the Parisi measure, in addition to specifying that $H_N(\boldsymbol{\sigma})/N=E$, here one needs to also condition on the energy and its gradient at points $\mathbf{x}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{x}_k$ such that $\langle \mathbf{x}_i,\mathbf{x}_j\rangle/N=q_{i\wedge j}$ and $\langle \mathbf{x}_i,\boldsymbol{\sigma}\rangle/N\approx q_{i}$. Like in the high-temperature phase, the energy and gradient values on which one conditions are also specified by the model's Parisi measure. As an application, we compute the Franz-Parisi potential at any temperature. Our results are also relevant to the study of Langevin dynamics with initial conditions distributed according to the Gibbs measure, which is one of the main motivations of this work.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Convergence Rates for Stochastically Monotone Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For Markov chains and Markov processes exhibiting a form of stochastic monotonicity (larger states shift up transition probabilities in terms of stochastic dominance), stability and ergodicity results can be obtained using order-theoretic mixing conditions. We complement these results by providing quantitative bounds on deviations between distributions. We also show that well-known total variation bounds can be recovered as a special case.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, a range of measures of partial stochastic dominance have been introduced. These measures attempt to determine the extent to which one distribution is dominated by another. We assess these measures from intuitive, axiomatic, computational and statistical perspectives. Our investigation leads us to recommend a measure related to optimal transport as a natural default.</description>

      <title>On the separation cut-off phenomenon for Brownian motions on high dimensional rotationally symmetric compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a family of rotationally symmetric compact manifolds indexed by the dimension and a weight function, the goal of this paper is to investigate the cut-off phenomenon for the Brownian motions on this family. We provide a class of compact manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvatures for which the cut-off in separation with windows occurs, in high dimension, with different explicit mixing times. We also produce counter-examples, still with non-negative Ricci curvatures, where there are no cut-off in separation. In fact we show a phase transition for the cut-off phenomenon concerning the Brownian motions on a rotationally symmetric compact manifolds. Our proof is based on a previous construction of a sharp strong stationary times by the authors, and some quantitative estimates on the two first moments of the covering time of the dual process. The concentration of measure phenomenon for the above family of manifolds appears to be relevant for the study of the corresponding cut-off.</description>

      <title>Pure perimeter laws for Wilson lines observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several recent papers have studied the decay rate of the expectation of Wilson loop and Wilson line observables in lattice gauge theory and the lattice Higgs model. These results have all been perturbative in the sense that the parameters need to scale with the length of the loop or line for the error term to be smaller than the estimate. In this paper, we further develop ideas from~\cite{fv2023} and~\cite{f2024} to give more detailed asymptotics for the expectation of Wilson loop and Wilson line observables, which do not require the parameters to be very large or very small for the error term to be small, thus improving the results of~\cite{flv2022, flv2023, flv2020, f2022b}. In particular, we show that Wilson line and loop observables have a pure parameter law in the Higgs and confinement phases of the lattice Higgs model.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give here a semi-analytic formula for the density of critical values for chi random fields on a general manifold. The result uses Kac-Rice argument and a convenient representation for the Hessian matrix of chi fields, which makes the computation of their expected determinant much more feasible. In the high-threshold limit, the expression for the expected value of critical points becomes very transparent: up to explicit constants, it amounts to Hermite polynomials times a Gaussian density. Our results are also motivated by the analysis of polarization random fields in Cosmology, but they might lead to applications in many different environments.</description>

      <title>A simple proof for the almost sure convergence of the largest singular value of a product of Gaussian matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $m \geq 1$ and consider the product of $m$ independent $n \times n$ Gaussian matrices $\mathbf{W} = \mathbf{W}_1 \dots \mathbf{W}_m$, each $\mathbf{W}_{i}$ with i.i.d. normalised $\mathcal{N}(0, n^{-1/2})$ entries. It is shown in Penson et al. (2011) that the empirical distribution of the squared singular values of $\mathbf{W}$ converges to a deterministic distribution compactly supported on $[0, u_m]$, where $u_m = \frac{{(m+1)}^{m+1}}{m^m}$. This generalises the well-known case of $m=1$, corresponding to the Marchenko-Pastur distribution for square matrices. Moreover, for $m=1$, it was first shown by \cite{Geman} that the largest squared singular value almost surely converges to the right endpoint (aka ``soft edge'') of the support, i.e. $s_1^2(\mathbf{W}) \xrightarrow{a.s.} u_1$. Herein, we present a proof for the general case $s_1^2(\mathbf{W}) \xrightarrow{a.s.} u_m$ when $m\geq 1$. Although we do not claim novelty for our result, the proof is simple and does not require familiarity with modern techniques of free probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper we study markets with concave transaction costs which depend in a concave way on the volume of transaction. This is typical situation in the case of small investors, which commonly appears in currency and real estate markets. Sufficient conditions for absence of arbitrage are formulated. New notion of asymptotic arbitrage is introduced and used to study the above mentioned markets.</description>

      <title>Alternative representation of the large deviation rate function and hyperparameter tuning schemes for Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are one of the most common classes of algorithms to sample from a target probability distribution $\pi$. A rising trend in recent years consists in analyzing the convergence of MCMC algorithms using tools from the theory of large deviations. One such result is a large deviation principle for algorithms of Metropolis-Hastings (MH) type (Milinanni &amp; Nyquist, 2024), which are a broad and popular sub-class of MCMC methods.
  A central object in large deviation theory is the rate function, through which we can characterize the speed of convergence of MCMC algorithms. In this paper we consider the large deviation rate function from (Milinanni &amp; Nyquist, 2024), of which we prove an alternative representation. We also determine upper and lower bounds for the rate function, based on which we design schemes to tune algorithms of MH type.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic limit for a class of degenerate convex $\nabla \varphi$-interface models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Langevin dynamics corresponding to the $\nabla \varphi$-interface model with a degenerate convex interaction potential satisfying a polynomial growth assumption. Following the work of the author and Armstrong, we interpret these Langevin dynamics as a nonlinear parabolic equation forced by white noise and apply homogenization methods to derive a quantitative hydrodynamic limit. This result quantifies and extends to a class of degenerate convex potentials the seminal result of Funaki and Spohn. In order to handle the degeneracy of the potential, we make use of the notion of moderated environment originally introduced by Mourrat and Otto and further developed by Biskup and Rodriguez to study the properties of solutions of parabolic equations with degenerate coefficients (and of the corresponding random walks).</description>

      <title>The supercooled Stefan problem with transport noise: weak solutions and blow-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive two weak formulations for the one-dimensional supercooled Stefan problem with transport noise on the quarter plane. The first captures a continuously evolving system, while the second resolves blow-ups by allowing for suitable jump discontinuities in the evolution of the temperature profile and the freezing front. For the first formulation, we establish a probabilistic representation in terms of a conditional McKean--Vlasov problem, and we show that there is finite time blow-up with positive probability as soon as part of the initial temperature profile exceeds a critical value. On the other hand, the system evolves continuously according to a unique solution when the initial profile is everywhere below this value. In the presence of blow-ups, we exploit the conditional McKean--Vlasov problem to find probabilistic solutions of the second weak formulation and we show that, among these, there is a particular solution of minimal temperature increase over time. Finally, we characterize the jump discontinuities of this solution as the minimal resolution of instabilities with respect to an infinitesimal external heat transfer. A general uniqueness result remains an open problem.</description>

Abstract: We consider the stochastic damped nonlinear wave equation $\partial_t^{2}u+\partial_t u+u-\Delta u +u^{3} = \sqrt{2} {\langle{\nabla}\rangle^{-s}} \xi$ on the two-dimensional torus $\mathbb T^2$, where $\xi$ denotes a space-time white noise and $s&gt;0$.

      <title>Bilateral Gamma Approximation in Weiner Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with bilateral-gamma (BG) approximation to functionals of an isonormal Gaussian process. We use Malliavin-Stein method to obtain the error bounds for the smooth Wasserstein distance. As by-products, the error bounds for variance-gamma (V G), Laplace, gamma and normal approximations are presented. Our approach is new in the sense that the Stein equation is based on integral operators rather than diferential operators commonly used in the literature. Some of our bounds are sharper than the existing ones. For the approximation of a random element from the second Wiener chaos to a BG distribution, the bounds are obtained in terms of their cumulants. Using this result, we show that a sequence of random variables (rvs) in the second Wiener chaos converges in distribution to a BG rv if their cumulants of order two to six converge. As an application of our results, we consider an approximation of homogeneous sums of independent rvs to a BG distribution, and mention some related limit theorems also. Finally, an approximation of a U-statistic to the BG distribution is discussed.</description>

      <title>Word length, bias and bijections in Penney's ante</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fix two words over the binary alphabet $\{0,1\}$, and generate iid Bernoulli$(p)$ bits until one of the words occurs in sequence. This setup, commonly known as Penney's ante, was popularized by Conway, who found (in unpublished work) a simple formula for the probability that a given word occurs first. We study win probabilities in Penney's ante from an analytic and combinatorial perspective, building on previous results for the case $p = \frac{1}{2}$ and words of the same length. For words of arbitrary lengths, our results bound how large the win probability can be for the longer word. When $p = \frac{1}{2}$ we characterize when a longer word can be statistically favorable, and for $p \neq \frac{1}{2}$ we present a conjecture describing the optimal pairs, which is supported by computer computations. Additionally, we find that Penney's ante often exhibits symmetry under the transformation $p \to 1-p$. We construct new explicit bijections that account for these symmetries, under conditions that can be easily verified by examining auto- and cross-correlations of the words.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For an invariant probability measure for the Gauss map, almost all numbers are Diophantine if the log of the partial quotent function is integrable. We show that with respect to a ``Renyi measure'' for the Gauss map with the log of the partial quotent function non-integrable, almost all numbers are Liouville. We also exhibit Gauss-invariant, ergodic measures with arbitrary irrationality exponent. The proofs are via the ``extravagance'' of positive, stationary, stochastic processes. In addition, we prove a Khinchin-type theorem for Diophantine approximation with respect to ``weak Renyi measures''.</description>

Abstract: For quasicrystals of cut-and-project type in $\mathbb{R}^d$, it was proved by Marklof and Str\"ombergsson that the limit local statistical properties of the directions to the points in the set are described by certain $\operatorname{SL}_d(\mathbb{R})$-invariant point processes. In the present paper we make a detailed study of the tail asymptotics of the limiting gap statistics of the directions, for certain specific classes of planar quasicrystals.</description>

      <title>Sign changes of the partial sums of a random multiplicative function III: Average</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $V(x)$ be the number of sign changes of the partial sums up to $x$, say $M_f(x)$, of a Rademacher random multiplicative function $f$. We prove that the averaged value of $V(x)$ is at least $\gg_\delta (\log x)^{1-\delta}$, for each positive constant $\delta&gt;0$. Our new method applies for the counting of sign changes of the partial sums of a system of orthogonal random variables having variance $1$ under additional hypothesis on the moments of these partial sums. The main input in our method is the "linearity" phase in $1\leq q\leq 1.9$ of the quantity $\log \mathbb{E} |M_f(x)|^q$, provided by the Harper's \better than squareroot cancellation phenomenon for small moments of $M_f(x)$.</description>

      <title>Explicit dynamical properties of the Pelikan random map in the chaotic region and at the intermittent critical point towards the non-chaotic region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pelikan random trajectories $x_t \in [0,1[$ are generated by choosing the chaotic doubling map $x_{t+1}=2 x_t [mod 1]$ with probability $p$ and the non-chaotic half-contracting map $x_{t+1}=\frac{x_t}{2}$ with probability $(1-p)$. We compute various dynamical observables as a function of the parameter $p$ via two perspectives. In the first perspective, we focus on the closed dynamics within the subspace of probability densities that remain constant on the binary-intervals $x \in [ 2^{-n-1}, 2^{-n}[$ partitioning the interval $x \in [0,1[$ : the dynamics for the weights $\pi_t(n)$ of these intervals corresponds to a biased random walk on the half-infinite lattice $n \in \{0,1,2,..+\infty\}$ with resetting occurring with probability $p$ from the origin $n=0$ towards any site $n$ drawn with the distribution $2^{-n-1}$. In the second perspective, we study the Pelikan dynamics for any initial condition $x_0$ via the binary decomposition $x_t = \sum_{l=1}^{+\infty} \frac{\sigma_l (t)}{2^l} $, where the dynamics for the half-infinite lattice $l=1,2,..$ of the binary variables $\sigma_l(t) \in \{0,1\}$ can be reformulated in terms of two global variables : $z_t$ corresponds to a biased random walk on the half-infinite lattice $z \in \{0,1,2,..+\infty\}$ that may remain at the origin $z=0$ with probability $p$, while $F_t \in \{0,1,2,..t\}$ counts the number of time-steps $\tau \in [0,t-1]$ where $z_{\tau+1}=0=z_{\tau}$ and represents the number of the binary coefficients of the initial condition that have been erased. We discuss typical and large deviations properties in the chaotic region $\frac{1}{2}&lt;p&lt;1 $ as well as at the intermittent critical point $p_c=\frac{1}{2}$ towards the non-chaotic region $0&lt;p&lt;\frac{1}{2}$.</description>

Moreover, we show that a waiting-time is required for the nonlocal parabolic Harnack inequality when local solutions are considered.</description>

      <title>Irreducibility of nonsmooth state-space models with an application to CMA-ES</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a stochastic process resulting from the normalization of states in the zeroth-order optimization method CMA-ES. On a specific class of minimization problems where the objective function is scaling-invariant, this process defines a time-homogeneous Markov chain whose convergence at a geometric rate can imply the linear convergence of CMA-ES. However, the analysis of the intricate updates for this process constitute a great mathematical challenge. We establish that this Markov chain is an irreducible and aperiodic T-chain. These contributions represent a first major step for the convergence analysis towards a stationary distribution. We rely for this analysis on conditions for the irreducibility of nonsmooth state-space models on manifolds. To obtain our results, we extend these conditions to address the irreducibility in different hyperparameter settings that define different Markov chains, and to include nonsmooth state spaces.</description>

      <title>New matrix perturbation bounds via contour expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix perturbation bounds (such as Weyl and Davis-Kahan) are frequently used in many branches of mathematics. Most of the classical results in this area are optimal, in the worst-case analysis. However, in modern applications, both the ground and the nose matrices frequently have extra structural properties. For instance, it is often assumed that the ground matrix is essentially low rank, and the nose matrix is random or pseudo-random. We aim to rebuild a part of perturbation theory, adapting to these modern assumptions. We will do this using a contour expansion argument, which enables us to exploit the skewness among the leading eigenvectors of the ground and the noise matrix (which is significant when the two are uncorrelated) to our advantage. In the current paper, we focus on the perturbation of eigenspaces. This helps us to introduce the arguments in the cleanest way, avoiding the more technical consideration of the general case. In applications, this case is also one of the most useful. More general results appear in a subsequent paper. Our method has led to several improvements, which have direct applications in central problems. Among others, we derive a sharp result for the perturbation of a low rank matrix with random perturbation, answering an open question in this area. Next, we derive new results concerning the spike model, an important model in statistics, bridging two different directions of current research. Finally, we use our results on the perturbation of eigenspaces to derive new results concerning eigenvalues of deterministic and random matrices. In particular, we obtain new results concerning the outliers in the deformed Wigner model and the least singular value of random matrices with non-zero mean.</description>

      <title>A mean field Jacobi process for modeling sustainable tourism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A mean field Jacobi process governing the dynamics of the travel demand of agents is formulated and its application to sustainable tourism is investigated both mathematically and computationally. The bounded nature of the Jacobi diffusion process enables the categorization of tourism state with sustainable tourism state corresponding to an internal solution and overtourism state to a boundary solution. A stochastic control framework is introduced to design sustainable tourism under uncertainty, incorporating model distortion conditions owing to misspecification. The control problem is reduced to solving the optimality system of a stationary mean field game whose closed-form solution is derived under certain conditions. The optimality system can be computed numerically using the finite difference method under more general conditions. We present demonstrative examples of the mean field Jacobi process for different parameter values, illustrating both sustainable tourism and overtourism cases. Our findings suggest that the sustainable tourism state cannot be realized if the fluctuation or model misspecification is large.</description>

      <title>$L^{p}$ Mild Solution to Stochastic Incompressible inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the global $L^{p}$ mild solution of inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the torus $\mathbb{T}^{N}$ with $N&lt;p&lt;6$, $ 1 \leqslant N \leqslant 3$, driven by the Wiener Process. We introduce a new iteration scheme coupled the density $\rho$ and the velocity $\mathbf{u}$ to linearize the system, which defines a semigroup. Notably, unlike semigroups dependent solely on $x$, the generators of this semigroup depend on both time $t$ and space $x$. After demonstrating the properties of this time- and space-dependent semigroup, we prove the local existence and uniqueness of mild solution, employing the semigroup theory and Banach's fixed point theorem. Finally, we show the global existence of mild solutions by Zorn's lemma. Moreover, for the stochastic case, we need to use the operator splitting method to do some estimates separately.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1607.05471v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we determine a process-level Large Deviation Principle (LDP) for a model of interacting particles indexed by a lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$. The connections are random, sparse and unscaled, so that the system converges in the large size limit due to the probability of a connection between any two particles decreasing as the system size increases. The particles are also subject to noise (such as independent Brownian Motions). The method of proof is to assume a process-level (or Level 3) LDP for the double-layer empirical measure for the noise and connections, and then apply a series of transformations to this to obtain an LDP for the process-level empirical measure of our system. Although it is not explicitly necessary, we expect that most applications of this work should involve an assumption of stationarity of the probability law for the noise and connections under translations of the lattice, so that the system converged to an ergodic probability law in the large size limit. This work synthesizes the theory of large-size limits of interacting particles with that of random graphs and matrices. It should therefore be relevant to neuroscience and social networks theory in particular.</description>

      <title>The TASEP on Galton-Watson trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.10443v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) on trees where particles are generated at the root. Particles can only jump away from the root, and they jump from $x$ to $y$ at rate $r_{x,y}$ provided $y$ is empty. Starting from the all empty initial condition, we show that the distribution of the configuration at time $t$ converges to an equilibrium. We study the current and give conditions on the transition rates such that the current is of linear order or such that there is zero current, i.e. the particles block each other. A key step, which is of independent interest, is to bound the first generation at which the particle trajectories of the first $n$ particles decouple.</description>

      <title>Exponential Convergence in Entropy and Wasserstein Distance for McKean-Vlasov SDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.08950v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The following type exponential convergence is proved for (non-degenerate or degenerate) McKean-Vlasov SDEs: $$W_2(\mu_t,\mu_\infty)^2 +{\rm Ent}(\mu_t|\mu_\infty)\le c {\rm e}^{-\lambda t} \min\big\{W_2(\mu_0, \mu_\infty)^2,{\rm Ent}(\mu_0|\mu_\infty)\big\},\ \ t\ge 1,$$ where $c,\lambda&gt;0$ are constants, $\mu_t$ is the distribution of the solution at time $t$, $\mu_\infty$ is the unique invariant probability measure, ${\rm Ent}$ is the relative entropy and $W_2$ is the $L^2$-Wasserstein distance. In particular, this type exponential convergence holds for some (non-degenerate or degenerate) granular media type equations generalizing those studied in [CMV, GLW] on the exponential convergence in a mean field entropy.</description>

      <title>Mean field analysis of stochastic networks with reservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.08298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of reservation in a large distributed system is analyzed via a new mathematical model. A typical application is a station-based car-sharing system which can be described as a closed stochastic network where the nodes are the stations and the customers are the cars. The user can reserve the car and the parking space.
  In the paper, we study the evolution of the system when the reservation of parking spaces and cars is effective for all users.
  The asymptotic behavior of the underlying stochastic network is given when the number $N$ of stations and the fleet size increase at the same rate. The analysis involves a Markov process on a state space with dimension of order $N^2$. It is quite remarkable that the state process describing the evolution of the stations, whose dimension is of order $N$, converges in distribution, although not Markov, to an non-homogeneous Markov process. We prove this mean-field convergence. We also prove, using combinatorial arguments, that the mean-field limit has a unique equilibrium measure when the time between reserving and picking up the car is sufficiently small. This result extends the case where only the parking space can be reserved.</description>

      <title>Mixing times for the TASEP on the circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.11896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study mixing times for the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) on a circle of length $N$ with $k$ particles. We show that the mixing time is of order $N^2 \min(k,N-k)^{-1/2}$, and that the cutoff phenomenon does not occur. This confirms behavior which was separately predicted by Jara, Lacoin and Peres, and it is more broadly believed to hold for integrable models in the KPZ-universalty class. Our arguments rely on a connection to periodic last passage percolation with a detailed analysis of flat geodesics, as well as a novel random extension and time shift argument for last passage percolation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.04395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In causal inference on directed acyclic graphs, the orientation of edges is in general only recovered up to Markov equivalence classes. We study Markov equivalence classes of uniformly random directed acyclic graphs. Using a tower decomposition, we show that the ratio between the number of Markov equivalence classes and directed acyclic graphs approaches a positive constant when the number of sites goes to infinity. For a typical directed acyclic graph, the expected number of elements in its Markov equivalence class remains bounded. More precisely, we prove that for a uniformly chosen directed acyclic graph, the size of its Markov equivalence class has super-polynomial tails.</description>

Abstract: We study some fundamental properties, such as the transience, the recurrence, the first passage times and the zero-set of a certain type of sawtooth Markov processes, called extremal shot noise processes. The sets of zeros of the latter are Mandelbrot's random cutout sets, i.e. the sets of points left uncovered after placing Poisson random covering intervals on the positive half-line. Based on this connection, we provide a new proof of Fitzsimmons-Fristedt-Shepp Theorem which characterizes the random cutout sets.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for Generalized Excited Random Walks in time-inhomogeneous Bernoulli environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a variant of the Generalized Excited Random Walk (GERW) on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ introduced by Menshikov, Popov, Ram\'irez and Vachkovskaia in [Ann. Probab. 40 (5), 2012]. It consists in a particular version of the model studied in [arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.05715, 2022] where excitation may or may not occur according to a time-dependent probability. Specifically, given $\{p_n\}_{n \ge 1}$, $p_n \in (0, 1]$ for all $n \ge 1$, whenever the process visits a site at time $n$ for the first time, with probability $p_n$ it gains a drift in a determined direction. Otherwise, it behaves as a $d$-martingale with zero-mean vector. We refer to the model as a GERW in time-inhomogeneous Bernoulli environment, in short, $p_n$-GERW.
  Under bounded jumps hypothesis and with $p_n \approx n^{-\beta}$, $\beta \geq 1/2$, we show a series of results for the $p_n$-GERW depending on the value of $\beta$ and on the dimension. Specifically, for $\beta &gt; 1/2$, $d\geq 2$ and $\beta=1/2$ and $d=2$ we obtain a Functional Central Limit Theorem. Finally, for $\beta=1/2$ and $d \ge 22$ we obtain that the diffusively rescaled $p_n$-GERW is tight, and every limit point $\mathcal{Y}$ satisfies $W_t \cdot \ell + c_1 \sqrt{t} \preceq \mathcal{Y}_t \cdot \ell \preceq W_t \cdot \ell + c_2 \sqrt{t}$, where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are known positive constants, $W_{\cdot}$ is a Brownian motion and $\ell$ is the direction of the drift.</description>

      <title>Growing integer partitions with uniform marginals and the equivalence of partition ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an explicit construction of a Markovian random growth process on integer partitions such that given it visits some level $n$, it passes through any partition $\lambda$ of $n$ with equal probabilities. The construction has continuous time, but we also investigate its discrete time jump chain. The jump probabilities are given by explicit but complicated expressions, so we find their asymptotic behavior as the partition becomes large. This allows us to explain how the limit shape is formed.
  Using the known connection of the considered probabilistic objects to Poisson point processes, we give an alternative description of the partition growth process in these terms. Then we apply the constructed growth process to find sufficient conditions for a phenomenon known as equivalence of two ensembles of random partitions for a finite number of partition characteristics. This result allows to show that counts of odd and even parts in a random partition of $n$ are asymptotically independent as $n\to\infty$ and to find their limiting distributions, which are, somewhat surprisingly, different.</description>

      <title>Graphical constructions of simple exclusion processes with applications to random environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07703v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the symmetric simple exclusion process (SSEP) on a countable set is well defined by the stirring graphical construction as soon as the dynamics of a single particle is. The resulting process is Feller, its Markov generator is derived on local functions, duality at the level of the empirical density field holds. We also provide a general criterion assuring that local functions form a core for the generator. We then move to the simple exclusion process (SEP) and show that the graphical construction leads to a well defined Feller process under a percolation-type assumption corresponding to subcriticality in a percolation with random inhomogeneous parameters. We derive its Markov generator on local functions which, under an additional general assumption, form a core for the generator. We discuss applications of the above results to SSEPs and SEPs in random environments, where the standard assumptions to construct the process and investigate its basic properties (by the analytic approach or by graphical constructions) are typically violated. As detailed in [14], our results for SSEP also allow to extend the quenched hydrodynamic limit in path space obtained in [11] by removing Assumption (SEP) used in there.</description>

      <title>Some Notes on Quantitative Generalized CLTs with Self-Decomposable Limiting Laws by Spectral Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In these notes, we obtain new stability estimates for centered non-degenerate selfdecomposable probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with finite second moment and for non-degenerate symmetric $\alpha$-stable probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $\alpha \in [1,2)$. These new results are refinements of the corresponding ones available in the literature. The proofs are based on Stein's method for self-decomposable laws, recently developed in a series of papers, and on closed forms techniques together with a new ingredient: weighted Poincar\'e-type inequalities. As applications, rates of convergence in Wasserstein-type distances are computed for several instances of the generalized central limit theorems (CLTs). In particular, a $n^{1-2/\alpha}$-rate is obtained in $1$-Wasserstein distance when the target law is a non-degenerate symmetric $\alpha$-stable one with $\alpha \in (1,2)$. Finally, the non-degenerate symmetric Cauchy case is studied at length from a spectral point of view. At last, in this Cauchy situation, a $n^{-1}$-rate of convergence is obtained when the initial law is a certain instance of layered stable distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are based on the construction of a Markov chain with transition probabilities leaving invariant a probability distribution of interest. In this work, we look at these transition probabilities as functions of their invariant distributions, and we develop a notion of derivative in the invariant distribution of a MCMC kernel. We build around this concept a set of tools that we refer to as Markov chain Monte Carlo Calculus. This allows us to compare Markov chains with different invariant distributions within a suitable class via what we refer to as mean value inequalities. We explain how MCMC Calculus provides a natural framework to study algorithms using an approximation of an invariant distribution, and we illustrate this by using the tools developed to prove convergence of interacting and sequential MCMC algorithms. Finally, we discuss how similar ideas can be used in other frameworks.</description>

The key step is to extend the flow approach so that it can accommodate semi-linear equations involving smooth, non-polynomial, functions of the solution - this is accomplished by introducing coordinates for the flow built out of elementary differentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04752v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show homogenization for a family of $\mathbb{R}^d$-valued stable-like processes $(X_t^{\epsilon;\theta})_{t\ge 0}$, $\epsilon\in(0,1]$, whose (random) Fourier symbols equal $q_\epsilon(x,\xi;\theta)=\frac{1}{\epsilon^{\alpha}}q(x/\epsilon,\epsilon\xi; \theta)$, where$$q(x,\xi; \theta)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\big(1-e^{i y\cdot\xi}+iy\cdot\xi\mathds{1}_{\{|y|\le1\}}\big)\,\frac{\langle a(x;\theta)y,y\rangle}{|y|^{d+2+\alpha}}\,dy,$$for $(x,\xi,\theta)\in\mathbb{R}^{2d}\times\Theta$. Here, $\alpha\in(0,2)$ and the family $(a(x; \theta))_{x\in\mathbb{R}^d}$ of $d\times d$ symmetric, non-negative definite matrices is a stationary ergodic random field over some probability space $(\Theta,{\cal H},m)$. We assume that the random field is deterministically bounded and non-degenerate, i.e.\ $|a(x;\theta)|\le\Lambda$ and $\text{Tr}(a(x;\theta))\ge\lambda$ for some $\Lambda,\lambda&gt;0$ and all $\theta\in\Theta$. In addition, we suppose that the field is regular enough so that for any $\theta\in\Theta$, the operator $-q(\cdot,D;\theta)$, defined on the space of compactly supported $C^2$ functions, is closable in the space of continuous functions vanishing at infinity and its closure generates a Feller semigroup. We prove the weak convergence of the laws of $(X_t^{\epsilon;\theta})_{t\ge 0}$, as $\epsilon\to0^+$, in the Skorokhod space, $m$-a.s.\ in $\theta$, to an $\alpha$-stable process whose Fourier symbol $\bar{q}(\xi)$ is given by $\bar{q}(\xi)=\int_{\Omega}q(0,\xi;\theta)\Phi_*(\theta)\,m(d\theta)$, where $\Phi_*$ is a strictly positive density w.r.t.\ measure $m$. Our result has an analytic interpretation in terms of the convergence, as $\epsilon\to0^+$, of the solutions to random integro-differential equations $ \partial_tu_\epsilon(t,x;\theta)=-q_\epsilon(x,D;\theta)u_\epsilon(t,x;\theta)$, with the initial condition $u_\epsilon(0,x;\theta)=f(x)$, where $f$ is a bounded and continuous function.</description>

Abstract: For branching processes, the generating functions for limit distributions of so-called ratios of probabilities of rare events satisfy the Schr\"oder-type integral-functional equations. Excepting limited special cases, the corresponding equations can not be solved analytically. I found a large class of Poisson-type offspring distributions, for which the Schr\"oder-type functional equations can be solved analytically. Moreover, for the asymptotics of limit distributions, the power and constant factor can be written explicitly. As a bonus, Bernoulli branching processes in random environments are treated. The beauty of this example is that the explicit formula for the generating function is unknown. Still, the closed-form expression for the power and constant factor in the asymptotic can be written with the help of some outstanding tricks. Also, the asymptotic expansion contains oscillatory terms absent in the Poisson case. It is shown that at the power $3$ in the Bernoulli binomial kernels short-phase discrete oscillations turn into long-phase continuous ones.</description>

      <title>Long run convergence of discrete-time interacting particle systems of the McKean-Vlasov type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17472v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a discrete-time system of n coupled random vectors, a.k.a. interacting particles.  The dynamics involve a vanishing step size, some random centered perturbations,  and a mean vector field which induces the coupling between the particles.  We study the doubly asymptotic regime where both the number of iterations and the number n of particles tend to infinity,  without any constraint on the relative rates of convergence of these two parameters.  We establish that the empirical measure of the interpolated trajectories of the particles converges in probability,  in an ergodic sense, to the set of recurrent Mc-Kean-Vlasov distributions.  A first application example is the granular media equation, where the particles are shown  to converge to a critical point of the Helmholtz energy.  A second  example  is the convergence of stochastic gradient descent   to the global minimizer of the risk, in a wide two-layer neural networks using random features.</description>

      <title>Imprecise Markov Semigroups and their Ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of an imprecise Markov semigroup $\mathbf{Q}$. It is a tool that allows to represent ambiguity around both the initial and the transition probabilities of a Markov process via a compact collection of plausible Markov semigroups, each associated with a (different, plausible) Markov process. We use techniques from geometry, functional analysis, and (high dimensional) probability to study the ergodic behavior of $\mathbf{Q}$. We show that, if the initial distribution of the Markov processes associated with the elements of $\mathbf{Q}$ is known and invariant, under some conditions that also involve the geometry of the state space, eventually the ambiguity around their transition probability fades. We call this property ergodicity of the imprecise Markov semigroup, and we relate it to the classical notion of ergodicity. We prove ergodicity both when the state space is Euclidean or a Riemannian manifold, and when it is an arbitrary measurable space. The importance of our findings for the fields of machine learning and computer vision is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Some FKG inequalities for stochastic processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is interested in proving correlation inequalities of the FKG-type for various stochastic processes in continuous time. The pivotal tool which yields these correlation inequalities is an approximation with (possibly conditioned) Markov chains and random walks. In particular, we prove FKG inequalities for L\'evy processes, Bessel processes and several conditioned Brownian processes. As a side result, we also provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a random walk distribution in $\mathbb{Z}$ to satisfy the well-known ``FKG lattice condition''.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider large uniform random trees where we fix for each vertex its degree and height. We prove, under natural conditions of convergence for the profile, that those trees properly renormalized converge. To this end, we study the paths from random vertices to the root using coalescent processes. As an application, we obtain scaling limits of Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson trees in varying environment.</description>

      <title>A lower bound on the spectrum of unimodular networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02209</link>
      <description>arXiv:1609.02209v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unimodular networks are a generalization of finite graphs in a stochastic sense. We prove a lower bound to the spectral radius of the adjacency operator and of the Markov operator of an unimodular network in terms of its average degree. This allows to prove an Alon-Boppana type bound for the largest eigenvalues in absolute value of large, connected, bounded degree graphs, which generalizes the Alon-Boppana theorem for regular graphs.
  A key step is establishing a lower bound to the spectral radius of a unimodular tree in terms of its average degree. Similarly, we provide a lower bound on the volume growth rate of an unimodular tree in terms of its average degree.</description>

      <title>Numerical method for feasible and approximately optimal solutions of multi-marginal optimal transport beyond discrete measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.01633v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a numerical algorithm for the computation of multi-marginal optimal transport (MMOT) problems involving general probability measures that are not necessarily discrete. By developing a relaxation scheme in which marginal constraints are replaced by finitely many linear constraints and by proving a specifically tailored duality result for this setting, we approximate the MMOT problem by a linear semi-infinite optimization problem. Moreover, we are able to recover a feasible and approximately optimal solution of the MMOT problem, and its sub-optimality can be controlled to be arbitrarily close to 0 under mild conditions. The developed relaxation scheme leads to a numerical algorithm which can compute a feasible approximate optimizer of the MMOT problem whose theoretical sub-optimality can be chosen to be arbitrarily small. Besides the approximate optimizer, the algorithm is also able to compute both an upper bound and a lower bound for the optimal value of the MMOT problem. The difference between the computed bounds provides an explicit sub-optimality bound for the computed approximate optimizer. We demonstrate the proposed algorithm in three numerical experiments involving an MMOT problem that stems from fluid dynamics, the Wasserstein barycenter problem, and a large-scale MMOT problem with 100 marginals. We observe that our algorithm is capable of computing high-quality solutions of these MMOT problems and the computed sub-optimality bounds are much less conservative than their theoretical upper bounds in all the experiments.</description>

      <title>Error Distribution for One-Dimensional Stochastic Differential Equation Driven By Fractional Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13897v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with asymptotic errors, limit theorems for errors between numerical and exact solutions of stochastic differential equation (SDE) driven by one-dimensional fractional Brownian motion (fBm). The Euler-Maruyama, higher-order Milstein, and Crank-Nicolson schemes are among the most studied numerical schemes for SDE (fSDE) driven by fBm. Most previous studies of asymptotic errors have derived specific asymptotic errors for these schemes as main theorems or their corollary. Even in the one-dimensional case, the asymptotic error was not determined for the Milstein or the Crank-Nicolson method when the Hurst exponent is less than or equal to $1/3$ with a drift term. We obtained a new evaluation method for convergence and asymptotic errors. This evaluation method improves the conditions under which we can prove convergence of the numerical scheme and obtain the asymptotic error under the same conditions. We have completely determined the asymptotic error of the Milstein method for arbitrary orders. In addition, we have newly determined the asymptotic error of the Crank-Nicolson method for $1/4&lt;H\leq 1/3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, our main aim is to investigate the strong convergence for a neutral McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation with super-linear delay driven by fractional Brownian motion with Hurst exponent $H\in(1/2, 1)$. After giving uniqueness and existence for the exact solution, we analyze the properties including boundedness of moment and propagation of chaos. Besides, we give the Euler-Maruyama (EM) scheme and show that the numerical solution converges strongly to the exact solution. Furthermore, a corresponding numerical example is given to illustrate the theory.</description>

      <title>Relative Entropy Method for Particle Approximation of the Landau Equation for Maxwellian Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the spatially homogeneous Landau equation for Maxwellian molecules from a natural stochastic interacting particle system. More precisely, we control the relative entropy between the joint law of the particle system and the tensorized law of the Landau equation. To obtain this, we establish as key tools the pointwise logarithmic gradient and Hessian estimates of the density function and also a new Law of Large Numbers result for the particle system. The logarithmic estimates are derived via the Bernstein method and the parabolic maximum principle, while the Law of Large Numbers result comes from crucial observations on the control of moments at the particle level.</description>

      <title>Improved Finite-Particle Convergence Rates for Stein Variational Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide finite-particle convergence rates for the Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) algorithm in the Kernelized Stein Discrepancy ($\mathsf{KSD}$) and Wasserstein-2 metrics. Our key insight is that the time derivative of the relative entropy between the joint density of $N$ particle locations and the $N$-fold product target measure, starting from a regular initial distribution, splits into a dominant `negative part' proportional to $N$ times the expected $\mathsf{KSD}^2$ and a smaller `positive part'. This observation leads to $\mathsf{KSD}$ rates of order $1/\sqrt{N}$, in both continuous and discrete time, providing a near optimal (in the sense of matching the corresponding i.i.d. rates) double exponential improvement over the recent result by Shi and Mackey (2024). Under mild assumptions on the kernel and potential, these bounds also grow polynomially in the dimension $d$. By adding a bilinear component to the kernel, the above approach is used to further obtain Wasserstein-2 convergence in continuous time. For the case of `bilinear + Mat\'ern' kernels, we derive Wasserstein-2 rates that exhibit a curse-of-dimensionality similar to the i.i.d. setting. We also obtain marginal convergence and long-time propagation of chaos results for the time-averaged particle laws.</description>
