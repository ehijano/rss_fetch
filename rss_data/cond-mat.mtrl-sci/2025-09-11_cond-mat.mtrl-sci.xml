      <title>PyPAS -- Python package for Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy Doppler Broadening Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doppler Broadening (DB) of annihilation radiation is a well-established technique within Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy (PAS), used for probing the electronic structure of materials. The analysis of DB experimental data relies on gamma spectroscopy analysis tools, while depth profiling using variable-energy slow positron beams depends on solving the positron diffusion equation. Traditional Variable Energy Doppler Broadening (VEDB) analysis tools, such as VEPFIT and ROYPROF, often present limitations due to outdated interfaces and lack of integration with comprehensive spectroscopy analysis platforms. Addressing these challenges, an open-source Python package for PAS analysis, PyPAS, is introduced. PyPAS offers functionalities including Coincidence Doppler Broadening (CDB) filtering, two-dimensional CDB analysis with DB and resolution extraction, and computation of lineshape parameters (S and W). Furthermore, it integrates modules for generating thermal positron implantation profiles based on established models, solving positron diffusion equations using finite-difference methods and optimizing diffusion length. This work presents the architecture of the PyPAS package and the validation results and demonstrates the application of the package through case studies.</description>

      <title>Laser-engineered $\Gamma$-point Topology in Trigonal Bismuthene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\Gamma$-point topology represents a significant segment in the family of topological insulators. Here we provide a comprehensive prediction of light-induced $\Gamma$-point-based topological manipulation in trigonal bismuthene and its derivatives. Our findings unveil a two-stage process of topological phase transitions (TPT) as the laser intensity increases. Initially, a quantum-spin-Hall or metallic state transitions to a quantum-anomalous-Hall (QAH) state ($C$ = $\pm$3), followed by another TPT that yields a compensated Chern-insulating state ($C$ = 0). The trigonal warping model accounts for these states, describing the $C_{3z}$-rotational band-inversion process, which is determined by $\pm$1 orders of replica bands. Notably, this high Chern-number QAH state persists over a broad range of laser parameters, maintaining functionality beyond room temperature as evidenced by the large global gaps ($\geq$ 60 meV). Our work provides a comprehensive roadmap towards the designer $\Gamma$-point topology under laser excitation, facilitating applications of artificial topological materials.</description>

      <title>Highly tunable Gilbert damping in two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2: From bilayer to the twisted bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 possesses both a high Curie temperature and robust perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, holding promise for practical spintronic applications. In particular, understanding and engineering its Gilbert damping which determines magnetization dynamics are crucial for its applications. Here, we investigate the Gilbert damping of bilayer and the twisted bilayer Fe3GaTe2 through first-principles calculations. For the bilayer Fe3GaTe2, we obtain a quite low Gilbert damping when its magnetization is along the z axis at room temperature. In addition, the bilayer Fe3GaTe2 exhibits a large orientational anisotropy of Gilbert damping when its magnetization is rotated from the magnetic easy axis to the hard one. Such anisotropy is attributed to the distinct band structures caused by the anisotropic spin-orbit coupling. Surprisingly, we find that twisting the bilayer Fe3GaTe2 can effectively reduce the Gilbert damping for the perpendicular magnetization, and enhance the orientational anisotropy of Gilbert damping up to 635% when rotating the magnetization from the magnetic easy axis to the hard one. These findings open up an entirely new avenue for the manipulation of Gilbert damping and its anisotropy in two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e excitons in generalized Wigner crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices of transition-metal dichalcogenide bilayers host strong Coulomb interactions residing in narrow electron bands, leading to correlated insulating states at fractional carrier doping densities, known as generalized Wigner crystals. In excited states, the formation of moir\'e excitons is expected to be fundamentally shaped by the Wigner-crystal ground states, manifesting an intricate interplay between electronic and excitonic correlations. However, the microscopic description of these Wigner crystalline excitons (WCEs) remains elusive, largely subject to speculations, and is further needed for the understanding of exotic excitonic phases (e.g., exciton insulators and exciton density waves) and their unique properties (e.g., anomalous exciton diffusion). Here, using first-principles many-body GW-Bethe-Salpeter-equation calculations, we directly reveal the internal structures of WCEs in angle-aligned MoSe2/MoS2 moir\'e heterostructure at hole fillings of 1/3 and 2/3. Our results unveil the propagation of correlation effects from the ground state to excited states, shaping the real-space characteristics of WCEs. The strong two-particle excitonic correlations dominate over the kinetic energy of free electron-hole pairs, in analog to the strong single-particle correlations of flat bands. We propose that such unusual excited-state correlation effects of WCEs can be experimentally probed by photocurrent tunneling microscopy. Our work provides a microscopic understanding of strongly correlated WCEs, suggesting them as a highly tunable mixed boson-fermion platform to study many-body interactions and phenomena.</description>

      <title>Percolation Diagrams Derived from First-Principles Investigation of Chemical Short-Range Order in Binary Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in the percolation theory of passivation have shown that chemical short-range order (SRO) affects the aqueous passivation behavior of alloys. However, there has been no systematic exploration to quantify these SRO effects on percolation in practical alloys and the related passivation behavior. In this study, we quantify the effects of SRO on percolation in a binary size-mismatched Cu-Rh alloy and study the related passivation behavior. We develop a mixed-space cluster expansion model trained on the mixing energy calculated using density functional theory. We use the cluster expansion model to sample the configuration space via variance-constrained semi-grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations and develop SRO diagrams over a range of compositions and temperatures. Building on this with the percolation crossover model, specifically the variation of percolation threshold with SRO in the FCC lattice, we construct the first nearest-neighbor chemical percolation diagram. These diagrams can inform the design of the next generation of corrosion-resistant metallic alloys.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear opto-magnetic signuature of d-wave altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a recently discovered collinear magnetic order with net zero magnetization but exhibits spin-splitting band structure, has attracted much research interest due to the rich fundamental physics and possible applications. In this work, we investigate the opto-magnetic response of $d$-wave altermagnets, focusing on the inverse Cotton-Mouton effect--the induction of static magnetization via linearly polarized light. We find that the direction of the induced magnetization is determined by the N\'eel vector. Moreover, its magnitude exhibits a periodic dependence on the polarization angle of the incident light, a hallmark of the system's symmetry. Our findings demonstrate that the inverse Cotton-Mouton effect provides both a method of manipulating altermagnetic magnetization in altemagnets and a probe of their intrinsic properties.</description>

      <title>Controlling GaN nucleation via O$_2$-plasma-perforated graphene masks on c-plane sapphire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomically thin, perforated graphene on $c$-plane sapphire functions as a nanoscale mask that enables GaN growth through thru-holes. We tune the perforated-area fraction $f_p$ by controlled O$_2$-plasma exposure and quantify its impact on early-stage nucleation: the nucleation-site density scales with $f_p$, while the nucleation-delay time decreases approximately as $1/f_p$. Time-resolved areal coverage and domain counts exhibit systematic $f_p$-dependent trends. A kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) model that coarse-grains atomistic events -- adatom arrival, surface diffusion, attachment at exposed sapphire within perforations, and coalescence (the first front-front contact between laterally growing domains) -- reproduces these trends using a constant per-site nucleation rate. Fitting the kMC simulation data yields onset times t$_0$ for the nucleation delay that closely match independently observed no-growth thresholds (Set 1: 28.5s vs $\sim$30s; Set 2: 38s vs $\sim$35s), validating the kMC-experiment mapping and highlighting plasma dose as an activation threshold for plasma-induced through-hole formation in 2D materials. Together, experiment and kMC identify $f_p$ as a single, surface-engineerable parameter governing GaN nucleation statistics on perforated graphene masks, providing a quantitative basis and process window for epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELOG)/thru-hole epitaxy (THE) workflows that employ two-dimensional masks.</description>

      <title>Crossover between kite growth and vibrational bridging in pillar-assisted controlled formation of carbon nanotube networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pillar-assisted growth is a technique in which short carbon nanotubes (CNTs) form suspended networks by growing across closely spaced microfabricated pillars. During growth, the CNT tips exhibit vibrations that allow them to bridge the neighboring pillars. To improve the complexity and controllability of the CNT networks, we introduce a kite-growth mechanism in which CNTs are elongated and aligned by gas flow during growth, enabling a longer bridging distance compared to vibrational bridging. By integrating theoretical modeling, simulations, and experimental synthesis, we found that CNT tip vibrations dominate bridging at short lengths, whereas gas flow increasingly influences alignment as CNTs grow longer. This results in a crossover behavior governed by gas flow and pillar arrangement. We also developed a bridging model based on geometric constraints to quantify the bridging behavior based on pillar spacing and angular accessibility. The statistical analysis of the resulting network structures demonstrates that the pillar arrangement significantly influences the connection types, with kite growth enabling more diverse network topologies. These findings provide design principles for tuning the density and structural complexity of suspended CNT networks, offering promising applications in nanoscale electrical interconnect wiring and three-dimensional circuit architectures.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of terbium tellurides Tb2Te5 and TbTe3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two terbium tellurides, TbTe3 and Tb2Te5, were studied by means of thermodynamics, ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy and torque magnetometry. While crystal structure and some physical properties of TbTe3 were established previously, the crystal structure of Tb2Te5 was solved only in this work in the orthorhombic space group Cmcm with the parameters of unit cell a = 4.3120(5), b = 41.0305(76) and c = 4.2979(8) {\AA}. In contrast to TbTe3, which experiences three successive magnetic phase transitions, Tb2Te5 orders antiferromagnetically in two steps at TN1 = 9.0 K and TN2 = 6.8 K, both readily suppressed by an external magnetic field. The third transition in TbTe3 is due to the interaction of the magnetic subsystem with the charge density waves. The interaction of magnetic and electronic subsystems in Tb2Te5 has been revealed by the pump probe. Torque measurements of TbTe3 show that the magnetic moments of Tb are oriented predominantly in the ac plane at high temperatures and switch to the b axis at low temperatures. In Tb2Te5, the magnetic moments of Tb are oriented predominantly in the ac plane at low temperatures.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions with topologically protected properties are anticipated to shape the future of electronics. Understanding how skyrmions may evolve in ambient conditions presents a key challenge in the pursuit of technologically significant materials. In this perspective, we focus on electronic instabilities and the density of energy of established skyrmion hosts, where a pathway to a skyrmion phase transition is readily available, to identify signposts for the emergence of skyrmions. We value the impressive research efforts in the field that have built the foundation for many more enticing breakthroughs to come. We share a framework that connects the electronic origins of skyrmion formation to the temperature and field requirements, allowing predictions of candidate materials that may host skyrmions at ambient conditions (the treasure).</description>

      <title>Trans-scale spin Seebeck effect in nanostructured bulk composites based on magnetic insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin Seebeck effect (SSE) enables thermoelectric conversion through thermally generated spin currents in magnetic materials, offering a promising transverse geometry for scalable devices. However, conventional SSE devices are confined to nanoscale thin-film architectures, with significantly restricted output power due to the intrinsic constraints of spin and magnon diffusion lengths. Here, we demonstrate a trans-scale SSE using nano-structured bulk composite materials composed of Pt-coated yttrium iron garnet (YIG) powders fabricated via dynamic powder sputtering and low-temperature sintering. The resulting three-dimensional composites exhibit continuous Pt channels and robust mechanical integrity. The effective electrical conductivity of the composites is 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than conventional thin-film-based YIG/Pt devices. Transverse thermoelectric measurements confirm isotropic SSE signals at the bulk scale. This work establishes a scalable platform for bulk SSE-based thermoelectrics, bridging nanoscale spin caloritronics with macroscopic device integration.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Spin Injection in Graphene via Dynamical Carrier Filtering at Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a real-time first-principles study of ultrafast spin injection in a WSe$_2$-graphene heterobilayer under circularly polarized laser irradiation, using time-dependent density functional theory. Contrary to conventional expectations, spin transfer into graphene is not a passive process but is actively driven by spin-selective carrier filtering at the interface. Spin-polarized carriers generated in the WSe$_2$ layer induce a preferential migration of opposite-spin carriers from graphene, which results in net spin magnetization in graphene. This process is governed by interlayer band offsets, density-of-state asymmetry, and Pauli blocking. These findings indicate a microscopic mechanism of spin injection in non-magnetic systems and identify a guiding principle for the design of ultrafast opto-spintronic functionalities in van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Layer-dependent Charge Transfer and inter-layer coupling in WSe2/Graphene Heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding interfacial interactions in two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures is essential for advancing optoelectronic and quantum technologies. We investigate metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD)-grown WSe$_2$ films (one to five layers) on graphene/SiC, directly compared to exfoliated WSe$_2$ on SiO$_2$, using Raman and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy complemented by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Raman measurements reveal compressive strain and interfacial charge transfer in WSe$_2$/graphene heterostructures, evidenced by blue-shifted phonon modes and the emergence of higher-order interlayer breathing modes absent on SiO$_2$. Concomitant shifts and attenuation of graphene's G and 2D modes with increasing WSe$_2$ thickness indicate progressive p-type doping of graphene, while WSe$_2$ phonon shifts point to n-type doping of the semiconductor, consistent with interfacial electron transfer. PL shows strong quenching for monolayer WSe$_2$ on graphene due to ultrafast charge transfer and F"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET), with partial emission recovery in multilayers relative to SiO$_2$-supported flakes. Exciton behavior differs strongly between substrates: on SiO$_2$, A- and B-exciton energies vary markedly with thickness, whereas on graphene they remain nearly pinned. This stability reflects the combined effects of graphene's strong dielectric screening and charge-transfer-induced free-carrier screening, with strain playing a secondary role. These results establish graphene, unlike SiO$_2$, as an active interfacial partner that stabilizes excitonic states and enables engineering of the optical response of 2D heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Structure Exploration and Thermodynamics of Heteroatom Doped Graphene Superstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene has been studied in detail due to its mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. It is well documented that the introduction of dopants or defects in the lattice can be used to tune material properties for a specific application, such as in electronics, sensors, or catalysis. To design graphene with specific properties, one must achieve control over the composition and concentration of defects. This requires a fundamental understanding of the stability of defects and their interaction in a superstructure. We present a comprehensive defect structure determination approach that enables close to exhaustive enumeration of all relevant defect structures. The approach uses a combination of Density Functional Theory and machine learning to build a transferable energy model for defect formation. Henceforth, we show the capabilities of our approach for a proof-of-principle application on free-standing graphene with heteroatom defects. This allows us to provide physical insights into defect interactions and to establish a thermodynamic model to investigate how temperature affects the configuration space of doped graphene.</description>

      <title>Diameter-Controlled High-Order Vortex States and Magnon Hybridization in VSe2 Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curved magnets offer a rich phase diagram and hold great promise for next-generation spintronic technologies. This study establishes the paramount significance of high-order vortex states (e.g., 3$\varphi$ with winding number $n$ &gt; 1) in VSe2 nanotubes, which uniquely enable magnonic functionalities fundamentally inaccessible to conventional magnetic systems. These states arise from diameter-dependent competition between the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic ($J_1$) and longer-range antiferromagnetic ($J_2$/$J_3$) couplings, as rigorously validated through density-functional theory calculations and Heisenberg modeling of phase diagrams. Critically, by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we find that high-order vortex configurations unlock an intrinsic hybridization mechanism governed by strict orbital angular momentum (OAM) selection rules ($\Delta l = \pm 2(n-1)$) -- a process strictly forbidden in fundamental vortices ($n$ = 1) -- generating complex high-OAM magnons with measurable topological charge. This is vividly demonstrated in the 3$\varphi$ state, where hybridization between $l$ = -4, 0 and 4 modes produces eight-petal magnon density patterns. Such states provide an essential platform-free solution for generating high-OAM magnons, wchich is crucial for spin-wave-based information transport. These findings establish a predictive theoretical framework for controlling high-order vortex states in curved magnets and highlight VSe2 nanotubes as a promising platform for exploring complex magnetism and developing future magnonic and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Facet: highly efficient E(3)-equivariant networks for interatomic potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational materials discovery is limited by the high cost of first-principles calculations. Machine learning (ML) potentials that predict energies from crystal structures are promising, but existing methods face computational bottlenecks. Steerable graph neural networks (GNNs) encode geometry with spherical harmonics, respecting atomic symmetries -- permutation, rotation, and translation -- for physically realistic predictions. Yet maintaining equivariance is difficult: activation functions must be modified, and each layer must handle multiple data types for different harmonic orders. We present Facet, a GNN architecture for efficient ML potentials, developed through systematic analysis of steerable GNNs. Our innovations include replacing expensive multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for interatomic distances with splines, which match performance while cutting computational and memory demands. We also introduce a general-purpose equivariant layer that mixes node information via spherical grid projection followed by standard MLPs -- faster than tensor products and more expressive than linear or gate layers. On the MPTrj dataset, Facet matches leading models with far fewer parameters and under 10% of their training compute. On a crystal relaxation task, it runs twice as fast as MACE models. We further show SevenNet-0's parameters can be reduced by over 25% with no accuracy loss. These techniques enable more than 10x faster training of large-scale foundation models for ML potentials, potentially reshaping computational materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Visualizing phonon edge states on molybdenum disulphide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to study atom vibrational amplitudes in carbon-supported Molybdenum Disulphide (MoS2) nanoparticles. Enhanced and correlated atom vibrational amplitudes are observed as the nanoparticle edges are approached from the bulk, consistent with recent experimental High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) observations by Chen et al (Nature Communications 12, 5007 (2021). Analysis of phonon modes in finite systems explains the experimental observation by low-energy phonon modes confined at the nanoparticle edge, underscoring the need of full MD modeling for accurate HR-TEM image interpretation. Noticeably, we introduce a workflow for training Equivariant Neural Network-based machine learning potentials using limited Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. This approach effectively captures both covalent and van der Waals interactions, enabling accurate extrapolations of DFT calculations to larger systems with built-in error estimation.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking CHGNet Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potential Against DFT and EXAFS: Case of Layered WS2 and MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) deliver near ab initio accuracy in energy and force calculations at low computational cost, making them invaluable for materials modeling. Although uMLIPs are pre-trained on vast ab initio datasets, rigorous validation remains essential for their ongoing adoption. In this study, we use the CHGNet uMLIP to model thermal disorder in isostructural layered 2Hc-WS2 and 2Hc-MoS2, benchmarking it against ab initio data and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra, which capture thermal variations in bond lengths and angles. Fine-tuning CHGNet with compound-specific ab initio (DFT) data mitigates the systematic softening (i.e., force underestimation) typical of uMLIPs and simultaneously improves alignment between molecular dynamics-derived and experimental EXAFS spectra. While fine-tuning with a single DFT structure is viable, using ~100 structures is recommended to accurately reproduce EXAFS spectra and achieve DFT-level accuracy. Benchmarking the CHGNet uMLIP against both DFT and experimental EXAFS data reinforces confidence in its performance and provides guidance for determining optimal fine-tuning dataset sizes.</description>

      <title>Accelerating first-principles molecular-dynamics thermal conductivity calculations for complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomistic simulations of heat transport in complex materials are costly and hard to converge. This has led to the development of several noise reduction techniques applicable to equilibrium molecular-dynamics simulations. We analyze the performance of those strategies, taking InAs nanowires as our benchmark due to the diverse structures and complex phonon spectra of these quasi-1D systems. We demonstrate how, for low-thermal-conductivity systems, cepstral analysis can reduce computational demands while still delivering accurate results that do not require discarding arbitrary parts of the dataset. However, issues with this approach are revealed when treating high-thermal-conductivity systems, where the thermal conductivity is significantly underestimated. We discuss alternative methods to be used in that situation, relying on uncertainty propagation from independent simulations. We show that the contributions of the covariance matrix have to be included for a quantitative assessment of the error. The combination of these strategies with machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) provides an accelerated, robust workflow applicable to a diverse set of systems, as our examples using a highly transferable MACE potential illustrate.</description>

      <title>Microstructural Control and Heat Transport Enhancement in Lanthanum Sulfate for Thermochemical Heat Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing heat transport within thermochemical heat storage (TCHS) materials is essential for improving the heat output. A common strategy is combining salts with highly conductive additives such as carbon or metals. However, such composites often suffer from drawbacks including interfacial instability and a reduction of gas permeability. In this work, we propose an alternative approach based on microstructural orientation control, aiming to create efficient heat transport pathways without relying on conductive additives. As a model material, La$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$ was selected, which undergoes reversible hydration and dehydration below 250 {\deg}C. Centimeter-scale hexagonal prismatic La$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3\cdot$9H$_2$O grains were grown from solution and then formed into plate-shaped specimens either parallel to the longitudinal direction or transverse to it, and then dehydrated to $\beta$-La$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$. Laser flash analysis revealed clear orientation-dependent thermal diffusivity of pre-dehydrated $\beta$-La$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$, with values of about 0.24 mm$^2$/s for the longitudinal plate and about 0.15 mm$^2$/s for the transverse plate at room temperature. Microstructural observations indicated the formation of aligned rod-like domains, suggesting that orientation provides an efficient heat transport pathway. These findings demonstrate that controlling orientation provides a viable route to enhance heat transport in TCHS materials, offering a new design approach.</description>

      <title>Intertwined polar, chiral, and ferro-rotational orders in a rotation-only insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intertwined orders refer to strongly coupled and mutually dependent orders that coexist in correlated electron systems, often underpinning key physical properties of the host materials. Among them, polar, chiral, and ferro-rotational orders have been theoretically known to form a closed set of intertwined orders. However, experimental investigation into their mutual coupling and physical consequences has remained elusive. In this work, we employ the polar-chiral insulator Ni$_3$TeO$_6$ as a platform and utilize a multimodal optical approach to directly probe and reveal the intertwining among polarity, chirality, and ferro-rotational order. We demonstrate how their coupling governs the formation of domains and dictates the nature of domain walls. Within the domains, we identify spatial inversion symmetry as the operation connecting two domain states of opposite polarity and chirality, with a common ferro-rotational state serving as the prerequisite for these interlocked configurations. At the domain walls, we observe a pronounced enhancement of in-plane polarization accompanied by a suppression of chirality. By combining with Ginzburg-Landau theory within the framework of a pre-existing ferro-rotational background, we uncover the emergence of mixed N\'eel- and Bloch-type domain walls. Our findings highlight the critical role of intertwined orders in defining domain and domain wall characteristics and open pathways for domain switching and domain wall control via intertwined order parameters.</description>

      <title>A Local-Phase Framework for the BaTi_{1-x}Zr_xO_3$ Phase Diagram: From Ferroelectricity to Dipolar Glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply a first-principles-based atomistic model to investigate the BaTi(1-x)Zr(x)O3 phase diagram, focusing on both macroscopic and local structural changes. Our approach, which combines molecular dynamics with machine learning techniques, accurately captures the influence of Ti and Zr cations on their local environment and its evolution with composition and temperature. The computed phase diagram shows excellent agreement with existing experimental and theoretical data. Beyond reproducing known results, our analysis reveals that the behavior of the solid solution across different compositions and temperatures can be understood in terms of coexisting Ti cells with different symmetries, whose stability depends on the local B-site configuration. This local-phase-based approach provides a unified description of the distinct regions of the solid solution, including ferroelectric, relaxor, and dipolar glass phases, and captures the continuous evolution from one regime to another. Our findings demonstrate how atomic-level distortions drive the complex macroscopic behavior of the material.</description>

      <title>Persistent spin texture preserved by local symmetry in graphene/WTe$_2$ heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal symmetries in solids give rise to spin-momentum locking, which determines how an electron's spin orientation depends on its momentum. This relationship, often referred to as spin texture, influences both charge-to-spin conversion and spin relaxation, making it one of the essential characteristics for spin-orbit-driven phenomena. Materials with strong spin-orbit coupling and broken inversion symmetry can host persistent spin textures (PSTs) - unidirectional spin configurations in momentum space, supporting efficient charge-to-spin conversion and extended spin lifetimes. Monolayer WTe$_2$, a topological material crystallizing in a rectangular lattice, is a notable example; its symmetry enforces a canted PST enabling quantum spin Hall effect with the nontrivial spin orientation. Here, we use first-principles calculations to explore how these properties are modified when WTe$_2$ is interfaced with graphene. We find that the PST is preserved by the local symmetry present in different regions of the heterostructure, while the system develops extended electron and hole pockets, resulting in semimetallic behavior. Although the band gap closes and eliminates the quantum spin Hall phase, spin Hall effects remain robust in both conventional and unconventional geometries. The computed spin Hall conductivities are comparable to those of other two-dimensional materials, and the survival of the PST suggests the possibility of long-range spin transport even in the absence of topological edge states. In addition, the graphene layer serves as an oxidation barrier, helping protect the intrinsic properties of WTe$_2$ and supporting the potential of this heterostructure for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Efficient Reconstruction of Anisotropic Hyperuniform Continuous Random Fields in 2D and 3D via Generalized Spectral Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperuniform continuous random fields suppress large-scale fluctuations while preserving rich local disorder, making them highly attractive for next-generation photonic, thermal and mechanical materials. However, traditional reconstruction techniques often suffer from limited spectral control or excessive computational cost, especially in high-resolution 2D and 3D settings. In this work, we present an ultra-efficient generative algorithm based on generalized superellipse spectral filtering, which allows independent tuning of isotropic and anisotropic spectral envelopes without resorting to costly iterative schemes. We demonstrate our method on a comprehensive set of 2D and 3D examples, showing precise manipulation of spectral band shape and orders-of-magnitude speedup compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, we explore the effect of simple thresholding on the generated fields, analyzing the morphological features and power-spectrum characteristics of the resulting two-phase maps. Our results confirm that the proposed framework not only accelerates hyperuniform field synthesis but also provides a versatile platform for systematic study of binary microstructures derived from continuous designs. This work opens new avenues for large-scale simulation and optimized design of advanced hyperuniform materials.</description>

      <title>Molecular-Size Control of Properties of Therapeutic Nano-Paper Allows for Selective Drug Storage in Small Doses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel concept of nano-scaled interwoven templates for drug delivery with alternating hydro- and lipophilicity properties is introduced. They are built from cellulose and peptide hydrogel in tandem, and characterized by a nano-stacked interwoven design, thus enabling for tuning the lipophilicity in the mesh nano-domains in which drug candidates of complementary lipophilicities can be embedded. This allows for low-dose-controlled consumption and therapeutic applications. Time-resolved and in-situ grazing incidence X-ray scattering studies confirm the design of the therapeutic nano-paper and create conditions suitable for the drug storage of complementary properties. The molecular design has the potential of a locally controlled, site-specific drug release on a beyond-nanomolar scale. Generalized, the design may contribute to facile developments of personalized medicine.</description>

      <title>Hidden frustration in the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet NdCd3P3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a study of the magnetic ground state and crystal electric field (CEF) scheme in the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet NdCd$_3$P$_3$. Combined neutron scattering, magnetization, and heat capacity measurements demonstrate that the Nd$^{3+}$ moments occupying the triangular lattice in this material harbor hidden signs of frustration not detected in typical Curie-Weiss-based parameterization of the frustration index ($f=\Theta_{CW} / T_N$). This is evidenced by a zero-field splitting of the Kramers' ground state and first excited state doublets at temperatures far in excess of $T_N$ as well as signatures of low-energy fluctuations for $T&gt;&gt;T_N$. A suppression of the zero-field ordered moment relative to its field saturation value is observed, and the impacts of this magnetic frustration as well as the coexisting bond frustration in the CdP honeycomb network on the physical properties of NdCd$_3$P$_3$ are discussed.</description>

      <title>Electronic Fluctuations and Ionic Dynamics in Molten Silver Iodide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molten salts are high-temperature ionic liquids whose unique combination of strong Coulombic interactions, large polarizabilities, and high ionic conductivities makes them central to energy storage, metallurgy, and nuclear technology. Understanding their delicate balance of Coulomb forces, short-range repulsion, and electronic polarization, particularly regarding the role that electronic fluctuations play in their structure and dynamics, is critical to predictively designing molten salts for applications of interest. We investigate the importance of electronic fluctuations in molten AgI using density functional theory, a universal machine learning model (Orb), and a classical, empirical pairwise model of interionic interactions. We find that directional polarization fluctuations of iodide ions enhance Ag+ diffusion, manifesting as enhanced force fluctuations and structure in the time-dependent friction experienced by the cations. The coupling between iodide polarization fluctuations and silver diffusion creates a dynamic asymmetry; Ag+ motion is tightly linked to the instantaneous polarization of neighboring I-, whereas I- dynamics are relatively unperturbed by electronic fluctuations. For all structural and dynamic quantities investigated, the Orb model is in excellent agreement with density functional theory-based simulations, highlighting the ability of this universal neural network potential to capture many-body polarization effects. In contrast, the empirical force field fails to reproduce key structural and dynamic quantities involving cations, ultimately because it neglects dynamic electronic fluctuations. Our findings connect liquid=state ionic dynamics with the "electronic paddle-wheel" mechanism of ionic diffusion in superionic solids and motivate further exploration of polarization fluctuation effects in complex electrolytes and ionic liquids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anisotropic metal nanostructures exhibit polarization-dependent light scattering. This property has been widely exploited to determine geometries of subwavelength structures using far-field microscopy. Here, we explore the use of variational autoencoders (VAEs) to determine the geometries of gold nanorods (NRs) such as in-plane orientation and aspect ratio under linearly polarized dark-field illumination in an optical microscope. We input polarized dark-field scattering spectra and electron microscopy images into a dual-branch multimodal VAE with a single shared latent space trained on paired spectra-image data, using a learnable linear adapter. We achieve prediction of Au NRs using only polarized dark-field scattering spectra input. We determine geometrical parameters of orientational angle and aspect ratio quantitatively via both dual-VAE and physics-based analysis. We show that orientational angle prediction by dual-VAE performs well with only a small (300 particle) training set, yielding a mean absolute error (MAE) of 14.4 and a concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.95. This performance is only marginally worse than the physics-based cos(2theta) fitting approach between the scattering intensity and the polarizing angle, which achieves MAE of 8.78 and CCC of 0.99. Aspect ratio determination is also similar for the dual-VAE and physics-based fitting comparison (MAE of 0.21 vs. 0.23 and CCC of 0.53 vs. 0.68). By learning a shared latent manifold linking spectra and morphology, the model can generate NR images with accurate orientation and aspect ratio with spectra-only input in the small-data regime (300 particles), suggesting a general recipe for inverse nano-optical problems requiring both structure and orientation information.</description>

      <title>Cepstral Strain Mapping for Small Pixel-Count Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the decreasing sizes of integrated-circuit components, the semiconductor industry is in growing need of high-throughput strain mapping techniques that offer high precision and spatial resolution, with desired industry goals of 0.01-0.1% and 1 nm respectively. As the fundamental limitation on the measurement precision is set by the Poisson noise, pixel array detectors with high saturation current, high dynamic range and fast readout are ideally suited for this purpose. However, due to the limited pixel count on these detectors, they do not work well with traditional strain mapping algorithms that were optimized to work on datasets with a large pixel count. Here, we evaluate the cepstral transform that was designed to address this problem, with the precision determined by the convergence, collection angles and dose while remaining insensitive to the pixel count. We test the performance of our method on silicon wedges and Si-SiGe multilayers, and using datasets collected at different conditions, we show how the measured strain precision scales as a function of dose, aperture size and sample thickness. Using precession gives a further improvement in precision by about 1.5-2x, whereas energy filtering does not have a significant impact on the cepstral method for device-relevant sample thickness ranges.</description>

      <title>How Does Incubation Affect Laser Material Processing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last decades, the subject of laser-induced damage (LID) moved from a topic of scientific interest toward laser material processing for technical applications. When using pulsed lasers, the cumulative effect known as incubation is one of the most fundamental features of the processing event. Incubation manifests by the fact that the critical fluence for LID (known as laser-induced damage threshold, LIDT) depends on the number of pulses N exciting one spot on the sample. In most cases, the threshold fluence decreases with N starting from the single-shot ablation threshold and remains constant for large N. No ablation or damage occurs for any N, if the fluence is kept below the multiple-pulse threshold. In contrast, examples where the LIDT increases with N have been reported. The latter effect is known as laser conditioning and is advantageously used when ramping up the power of high-power laser systems. Incubation has been described for many types of solids; the motivation for these comprehensive efforts is twofold. Firstly, one tries to prevent the damage of optical materials in the beam path of high-energy or high-peak-power lasers. Secondly, one deliberately uses this damage for the sculpting of components. In this chapter, we introduce the reader to the mechanisms of incubation. We are going to look at the parameters controlling LID and highlight the peculiarity of the parameter "number of pulses". We will give an overview of the experimental work done in a variety of materials. There are several physical and chemical mechanisms proposed that govern incubation, and there are several mathematical models to describe the behavior of threshold fluence and ablation rate in dependence on the number of pulses. In a few cases, the two classes of mechanisms are even related to each other. Eventually, we will show the implications that incubation has on real-world laser machining.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Phase-Transition Framework for Gate-Tunable Superconductivity in Monolayer WTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently reported gate-tunable superconductivity in monolayer WTe$_2$ exhibits several striking anomalies beyond the standard paradigm, including a contrasting carrier-density dependence of the transition temperature $T_c$ in weakly and strongly disordered regimes and more surprisingly, the sudden disappearance of superconducting fluctuations below a critical carrier density. To understand these features, we go beyond the mean-field theory to treat the superconducting gap and superfluid density by explicitly incorporating both Nambu-Goldstone (NG) phase fluctuations and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) fluctuations. We show that these fluctuations are minimal in the weak-disorder regime but become crucial under strong disorder, where the zero-temperature gap renormalized by NG quantum fluctuations becomes density-dependent while the BKT fluctuations drive the superconducting $T_c$ below the gap-closing temperature. Simulations within this unified framework combining with the density-functional-theory input to account for the excitonic instability quantitatively reproduced nearly all key experimental observations in monolayer WTe$_2$, providing a consistent understanding of reported anomalies.</description>

      <title>Observation of tunable chiral spin textures with nonlinear optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral spin textures, such as spin spirals and skyrmions, are key to advancing spintronics by enabling ultrathin, energy-efficient memory, and high-density data storage and processing. However, their realization remains hindered by the scarcity of suitable host materials and the formidable experimental challenges associated with the characterization of these intricate chiral magnetic states. Here, we report the observation of tunable chiral magnetic textures in van der Waals magnet CrPS$_4$ with nonlinear optics. These tunable textures exhibit strong chiral third-order nonlinear optical responses, driven by interlayer and intralayer spin couplings under varying magnetic fields and temperatures. These pronounced chiral nonlinear optical responses highlight the potency and high sensitivity of the nonlinear optical readout for probing non-collinear magnetic orders. Moreover, our findings position van der Waals magnets and their heterostructures as an exceptional platform for reconfigurable spin-photonics and spintronics, unifying optical, electrical, and magnetic properties through unique intralayer and interlayer spin coupling properties and effective spin interaction between photons and electrons.</description>

      <title>A Unified Symmetry-Constrained Framework for Band Inversions in Photonic Crystals with $C_n$ Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lack of a unified theoretical framework for characterizing band inversions across different crystal symmetries hinders the rapid development of topological photonic band engineering. To address this issue, we have constructed a framework constrained by symmetry $k \cdot p$ that universally models bands near high-symmetry points for symmetric photonic crystals $C_6$, $C_4$, $C_3$, and $C_2$. This framework enables a coefficient-free quantitative diagnosis of band topology. We have demonstrated the power of this framework by systematically engineering band inversions. In $C_6$ crystals, we induce a reopening of the linear gap at $\Gamma$. In $C_4$ systems, mirror symmetry enforces a characteristic quadratic coupling leading to distinct spectral features. Our analysis further reveals that a lone $E$ doublet prevents inversion at the $\Gamma$ point in $C_3$ symmetry, while $C_2$ symmetry facilitates a unique inversion of $Y$ pointsints with anisotropic gap. This symmetry-first, fit-free approach establishes a direct link between experimental band maps and the extraction of fundamental topological parameters. It offers a universal tool for inversion and coupling-order identification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The structural and electronic properties of the CaMnGe$_2$O$_6$ and SrMnGe$_2$O$_6$ clinopyroxene systems have been investigated by means of perturbed angular correlation (PAC) measurements, performed at ISOLDE, combined with $ab-initio$ electronic structure calculations within the density functional theory (DFT) framework. The partial density of states (PDOS) of the CaMnGe$_2$O$_6$ and SrMnGe$_2$O$_6$ stable compounds has been determined, and it has been observed that the requirement of including an on-site Hubbard-$U$ potential was necessary in order to describe the highly correlated Mn $3d$-states. By considering $U_{eff}$=4 eV, we obtained a band gap width of 1.82 eV and 1.70 eV, for the CaMnGe$_2$O$_6$ and SrMnGe$_2$O$_6$, respectively. Combining electric field gradient (EFG) first principles calculations, using a supercell scheme, with experimental PAC results, we were able to infer that the Cd probe can replace either the $A$ (Ca, Sr) or the Mn sites in the crystalline structures. We also showed that Cd substitution is expected to lead to a reduction in the width of the band gap in these systems, evidencing opportunities for potential band-gap engineering.</description>

Abstract: This study introduces the calculation of spatially-resolved chord length distribution (SR-CLD) as an efficient approach for quantifying and visualizing non-uniform microstructures in heterogeneous materials. SR-CLD enables detailed analysis of spatial variation of microstructures in different directions that can be overlooked with traditional descriptions. We present the calculation of SR-CLD using efficient scan-line algorithm that counts pixels in constituents along pixel rows or columns of microstructure images for detailed, high-resolution SR-CLD maps. We demonstrate the application of SR-CLD in three case studies: on synthetic polycrystalline microstructures with known and intentionally created uniform and gradient spatial distributions of grain size; on non-uniform microstructures from welding simulations; and on experimental images of two-phase microstructures of additively manufactured Ti alloys with significant spatially non-uniform distributions of laths of one of the phases.</description>

      <title>Anomalous-Hall Neel textures in altermagnetic materials</title>

Abstract: Recently, the altermagnets, a new kind of collinear antiferromagnet with nearly zero net magnetization and momentum-dependent spin-splitting of bands, have sparked great interest. Despite simple magnetic structures, these altermagnets exhibit intriguing and intricate dependence of anomalous Hall effect (AHE) on the N\'eel vector, in contrast to the conventional perpendicular configuration of Hall current with magnetization in ferromagnets. However, the fundamental relationship between the AHE and the N\'eel vector remains largely elusive. Here, we reveal all the unconventional anomalous Hall textures in the N\'eel vector space, dubbed anomalous-Hall N\'eel textures (AHNTs) for altermagnets. Specifically, we identify 10 types across four categories of AHNTs for all altermagnets. Notably, we find that AHNTs resemble the known spin textures in momentum space, and further reveal their symmetry origin. Meanwhile, we examine our key discoveries in prototypical altermagnets. Our work offers a thorough understanding of AHE in altermagnets and a complete and pictorial classification of altermagnets based on the geometry of response functions.</description>

      <title>Rational Control of Magnonic and Electronic Band Splittings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a theoretical demonstration of controllable non-relativistic spin splitting in both electronic and magnonic bands via targeted structural distortions tied to specific phonon modes. Using MnF$_2$ as a model system, we identify a $d$-wave magnon band splitting between magnon modes of specific handedness, directly correlated with the non-relativistic spin splitting observed in the electronic structure. Crucially, we show that structural distortions associated with the A$_{2u}$ and A$_{1g}$ phonon modes (8.52 and 9.74 THz) modulate these splittings without altering the antiferromagnetic order. The effect originates from changes in the nonmagnetic ligand environment, highlighting the key role of lattice degrees of freedom in governing spin dynamics. Our findings establish a novel route for structure-mediated control of spin splitting, opening possibilities for tunable magnonic and spintronic functionalities in antiferromagnetic materials.</description>

The method works for very large elementary cells and supercells, and we benchmark it on covalently bonded solids and molecular crystals with nonbonded interactions, for supercells of up to 33,000 atoms. Memory and CPU requirements scale with supercell size quasi-linearly.</description>

      <title>Role of the Direct-to-Indirect Bandgap Crossover in the 'Reverse' Energy Transfer Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy transfer (ET) is a dipole-dipole interaction, mediated by the virtual photon. Traditionally, ET happens from the higher (donor) to lower bandgap (acceptor) material. However, in some rare instances, a 'reverse' ET can happen from the lower-to-higher bandgap material, depending on the strong overlap between the acceptor photoluminescence (PL) and the donor absorption spectra. In this work, we report a reverse ET process from the lower bandgap MoS2 to the higher bandgap WS2, due to a near 'resonant' overlap between the MoS2 B and WS2 A excitonic levels. Changing the MoS2 bandgap from direct to indirect by increasing the layer number results in a reduced ET rate, evidenced by the quenching of the WS2 PL emission. Our work shows at 300 K, the ET timescale of ~33 fs is faster than the reported thermalization of the MoS2 excitonic intervalley scattering (K to K') time and competing with the ultrafast charge transfer timescale. Thus, allowing to open a new direction in understanding the competing inter/intralayer processes.</description>

      <title>Two lock-in amplifiers based $3\omega$ technique: a practical guide for thermal conductivity experiments in bulk samples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate determination of thermal conductivity $\kappa(T)$ in bulk materials at room temperature and above is crucial for evaluating their compatibility for specific applications. The 3$\omega$ technique is an established methodology for studying the thermal conductivity of thin films, becoming particularly suitable in the case of bulk specimens for $T\gtrsim$300K, where standard stationary techniques require significant corrections for radiative losses. Although this method has been employed in several works, it remains not widely adopted because its implementation demands considerable sophistication, including experiment design, thin film deposition techniques, and choices of the geometry of the current/heat transducer, electronics, and analytical treatment of the signals. Based on a critical review of the technique's key technical aspects, this work provides practical support for a rapid and user-friendly implementation, from the design phase through to execution and analysis. We release a Python-based graphical user interface that supports a quantitative estimation of the investigated temperature profiles based on the geometrical parameters (width/length) of the deposited transducer (heater/thermometer metal line) before an experiment, guaranteeing an optimal design of the experimental conditions for each given material under scrutiny.</description>

      <title>Exact Expansion Formalism for Transport Properties of Heterogeneous Materials Characterized by Arbitrary Continuous Random Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an exact contrast-expansion formalism for the effective conductivity of heterogeneous materials (media) with local properties described by arbitrary continuous random fields, significantly generalizing the widely used binary-field models. The theory produces a rapidly convergent Neumann-series that, upon Gaussian closure via a Hermite expansion, yields closed-form first-, second- and third-order approximations, which achieve percent-level accuracy at first order for isotropic media. For anisotropic media, second-order approximations achieve sub-2% accuracy across a wide range of local property contrasts and correlations. Our formalism provides mathematically rigorous structure-property closures, with significant implications for the discovery and design of novel graded and architected materials with tailored transport properties.</description>

Abstract: Band alignment, namely the prediction of band-edge positions of semiconductors and insulators in aqueous solutions, is an important problem in physics and chemistry. Such a prediction is especially challenging for complex materials. Here we present an approach to align band structure of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) on an absolute energy scale which can be used for direct comparison with experiments. Hydrogen defects are used as probes into the chemical bonding of the covalently bonded hybrid materials. An effective defect energy level, defined as the average of the charge-state transition levels of the defects at the linker and at the secondary building unit, is identified as a charge neutrality level to align band structures. This level captures subtle chemical details at both the organic and inorganic building blocks and provides results that are in agreement with experiments in a wide range of different MOFs. We also compare with results obtained from using other approaches involving surface calculations and average pore-center electrostatic potentials.</description>

      <title>Decoding the Stability of Transition-Metal Alloys with Theory-infused Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an interpretable deep learning framework that predicts the cohesive energy of transition-metal alloys (TMAs) by embedding cohesion theory within graph neural networks (GNNs). Beyond accurate prediction of cohesive energy, a key indicator of thermodynamic stability, the model offers mechanistic insights by disentangling energy contributions into physically meaningful components. These data-driven interpretations reveal periodic trends and stability principles governing transition metals. We apply the model to single-atom alloys (SAAs) to assess their thermodynamic resilience against two destabilizing processes: agglomeration (adatom clustering) and segregation (migration into the subsurface). Our analysis shows that these phenomena are governed by distinct physical factors-agglomeration is primarily influenced by localized d-orbital coupling, while segregation is dictated by delocalized effects such as wavefunction renormalization. This model thus serves as an explainable AI tool for understanding and guiding the design of stable TMAs, with implications for catalysis and materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of general grain boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a central part of microstructure evolution, grain boundary (GB) migration is believed to be both monolithic and unidirectional. But here, we introduce the concept of GB decomposition: one GB separates into two new GBs by exerting differential Peach-Koehler forces on its disconnections. Molecular dynamics simulation is used to reveal the disconnection mechanisms and direction-dependent motion behaviors associated with the reversible decomposition of a nickel {\Sigma}7 general GB. We also observed a decomposition-like process in a high-energy diffraction microscopy (HEDM) dataset of high purity nickel polycrystal (Science 2021, 374, 189-193), and performed HEDM-data-based simulations to confirm it. The decomposition should be considered as a new GB kinetic behavior, based on its particularity and potential universality.</description>

      <title>How transparent is graphene? A surface science perspective on remote epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Remote epitaxy is the synthesis of a single crystalline film on a graphene-covered substrate, where the film adopts epitaxial registry to the substrate as if the graphene is transparent. Despite many exciting applications for flexible electronics, strain engineering, and heterogeneous integration, an understanding of the fundamental synthesis mechanisms remains elusive. Here we offer a perspective on the synthesis mechanisms, focusing on the foundational assumption of graphene transparency. We identify challenges for quantifying the strength of the remote substrate potential that permeates through graphene, and propose Fourier and beating analysis as a bias-free method for decomposing the lattice potential contributions from the substrate, from graphene, and from surface reconstructions, each at different frequencies. We highlight the importance of graphene-induced reconstructions on epitaxial templating, drawing comparison to moir\'e epitaxy. We highlight the role of the remote potential in tuning surface diffusion and adatom kinetics on graphene, which are crucial for navigating the competition between remote epitaxy and defect-seeded mechanisms like pinhole epitaxy. In light of this weak remote potential, we re-evaluate the current state-of-the-art experimental evidence, highlighting why it remains challenging to experimentally validate a ``remote'' epitaxy mechanism that cannot be explained by alternatives, such as pinhole-seeded epitaxy or serial van der Waals epitaxy. We end with one experimental example that, to out knowledge, cannot be explained by competing mechanisms: a different long-range epitaxial relationship for GdPtSb films grown on graphene/sapphire, compared to direct epitaxy on sapphire. We suggest for future experiments that directly measure the remote potential and impact of tunable growth kinetics.</description>

      <title>Memory in strain-tuned insulator-metal-insulator sequence of transitions after photoexcitation in the Mott material V2O3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Memory effects during metal-insulator transitions in quantum materials reveal complex physics and potential for novel electronics mimicking biological neural systems. Nonetheless, understanding of memory and nonlinearity in sequential non-equilibrium transitions remains elusive as the full chain of transitions can involve features lasting anywhere from femtoseconds to microseconds. Here, we extend time-resolved x-ray Bragg diffraction to the dynamic range of timescales spanning 9 orders of magnitude to fully trace the pathways of photoexcited insulator-metal transition and the following relaxation through non-equilibrium metal-insulator transitions in epitaxial films of V2O3, a promising Mott material. We find 5 orders of magnitude variation in metal-insulator transition time, from nanoseconds to hundreds of microseconds, depending on pre-excitation phase state. We provide a theoretical explanation and simulations based on strain feedback to domain nucleation. The lingering transition is stretched in time by memory of spatial and energy heterogeneity and, contrary to known memory effects in vanadium oxides commonly described by power laws, follows an extremely (factor below 0.2) stretched exponential. The induced dramatic slowdown in the light-driven highly correlated system signifies unusually high heterogeneity of transition barriers similar to biological systems, and demonstrates importance of non-local correlations of structure in evolution of transitional phases in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Extracting Phonon Quasiparticles from Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phonon anharmonicity is ubiquitous in real materials and is crucial for understanding thermal properties and phase stability. In this work, we show that phonon quasiparticles are optimally described by modes with maximum lifetimes, and prove that information about these quasiparticles is contained in two small matrices $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$, which can be constructed directly from molecular dynamics simulations. Based on these knowledge, we proposed an optimization scheme, which allows us to efficiently determine temperature-dependent phonon modes along with their frequencies and lifetimes. We verified this method by applying it to silicon and cubic CaSiO$_3$, where it successfully captured their temperature-dependent phonon behaviors and the well-known phonon softening in cubic CaSiO$_3$. This theory provides a convenient tool for investigating phonon quasiparticles and can be extended to study other quasiparticles, such as electrons, holes, and magnons.</description>

      <title>Possible Sliding Regimes in Twisted Bilayer WTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the observation of increasingly one-dimensional (1D) behavior with decreasing temperature in small-angle twisted bilayers of WTe$_2$ (tWTe$_2$), we theoretically explore the exotic sliding regimes that could be realized in tWTe$_2$. At zero displacement field, while hole-doped tWTe$_2$ can be thought of as an array of weakly coupled conventional two-flavor 1D electron gases (1DEGs), the electron-doped regime is equivalent to coupled four-flavor 1DEGs , due to the presence of an additional "valley'' degree of freedom. In the decoupled limit, the electron-doped system can thus realize phases with a range of interesting ordering tendencies, including $4k_F$ charge-density-wave and charge-$4e$ superconductivity. Dimensional crossovers and cross-wire transport due to inter-wire couplings of various kinds are also discussed. We find that a sliding Luther-Emery liquid with small inter-wire couplings is probably most consistent with current experiments on hole-doped tWTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Single-band square lattice Hubbard model from twisted bilayer C568</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose twisted homobilayer of a carbon allotrope, C$_{568}$, to be a promising platform to realize controllable square lattice single-band extended Hubbard model. This setup has the advantage of a widely tunable $t'/t$ ratio without adding external fields, and the intermediate temperature $t\ll T\ll U$ regime can be easily achieved. We first analyze the continuum model obtained from symmetry analysis and first-principle calculations, and calculate the band structures. Subsequently, we derive the corresponding tight-binding models and fit the hopping parameters as well as the Coulomb interactions. When displacement field is applied, anisotropic nearest neighbor hoppings can further be achieved. If successfully fabricated, the device could be an important stepping stone towards understanding high-temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Pressure and strain effects on the $\textit{ab initio}$ $GW$ electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at a critical temperature above 80~K points to a non-conventional pairing mechanism in nickelates as in cuprates, possibly due to electronic correlations. We have calculated from first principles the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under the effect of pressure and epitaxial strain including correlations by the $GW$ approximation to the many-body self-energy. We find that the Fermi surface is composed of a characteristic cuprate-shape sheet $\beta$ plus a nickelate-specific cylinder $\alpha$, both from Ni $e_g$ orbitals, with a non-negligible drop in the quasiparticle weight and an effective 1D character. This topology results from a delicate balance between the Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ hole pocket $\gamma$, which is suppressed by correlations, and an emerging La-5$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electron pocket induced by both correlation and pressure/strain effects and whose role at low energy has been neglected so far. Unlike cuprates, the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is already correctly described from ab initio and in agreement with the experiment without the need to introduce Hubbard $U$ adjustable parameters or to invoke a strongly correlated physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals superconductors are attracting much attention owing to their rich phase diagrams including possible unconventional superconductivity. However, they suffer from a lack of reliable methods for identifying their nontrivial pairing symmetries and quantum geometry. In this study, we propose nonlinear responses driven by surface acoustic waves as a novel probe to access exotic Bogoliubov quasiparticles in such superconductors. Our approach is particularly suitable for addressing the superconducting gap structure as the gap energies in these systems typically lie within the frequency range of surface acoustic waves, and thus paves the way toward the experimental identification of exotic superconducting states especially in low-$T_c$ superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop and implement numerically a phase field model for the growth and detachment of a gas bubble resting on an electrode and being filled with hydrogen produced by water electrolysis. The bubble is surrounded by a viscous liquid, has a prescribed static contact angle and is also subject to gravitational forces. We compute, as a function of the static contact angle, the time at which the bubble detaches from the substrate and what volume it has at that time. We also investigate de dependence of the detachment time on other parameters such as the applied voltage and the hydrogen ion concentration at the fluid bulk.</description>
