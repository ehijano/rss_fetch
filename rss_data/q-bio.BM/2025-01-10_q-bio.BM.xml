      <title>EquiBoost: An Equivariant Boosting Approach to Molecular Conformation Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular conformation generation plays key roles in computational drug design. Recently developed deep learning methods, particularly diffusion models have reached competitive performance over traditional cheminformatical approaches. However, these methods are often time-consuming or require extra support from traditional methods. We propose EquiBoost, a boosting model that stacks several equivariant graph transformers as weak learners, to iteratively refine 3D conformations of molecules. Without relying on diffusion techniques, EquiBoost balances accuracy and efficiency more effectively than diffusion-based methods. Notably, compared to the previous state-of-the-art diffusion method, EquiBoost improves generation quality and preserves diversity, achieving considerably better precision of Average Minimum RMSD (AMR) on the GEOM datasets. This work rejuvenates boosting and sheds light on its potential to be a robust alternative to diffusion models in certain scenarios.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of uncertainty estimations for Gaussian process regression based machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty estimations for machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are crucial for quantifying model error and identifying informative training samples in active learning strategies. In this study, we evaluate uncertainty estimations of Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based MLIPs, including the predictive GPR standard deviation and ensemble-based uncertainties. We do this in terms of calibration and in terms of impact on model performance in an active learning scheme. We consider GPR models with Coulomb and Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) representations as inputs to predict potential energy surfaces and excitation energies of molecules. Regarding calibration, we find that ensemble-based uncertainty estimations show already poor global calibration (e.g., averaged over the whole test set). In contrast, the GPR standard deviation shows good global calibration, but when grouping predictions by their uncertainty, we observe a systematical bias for predictions with high uncertainty. Although an increasing uncertainty correlates with an increasing bias, the bias is not captured quantitatively by the uncertainty. Therefore, the GPR standard deviation can be useful to identify predictions with a high bias and error but, without further knowledge, should not be interpreted as a quantitative measure for a potential error range. Selecting the samples with the highest GPR standard deviation from a fixed configuration space leads to a model that overemphasizes the borders of the configuration space represented in the fixed dataset. This may result in worse performance in more densely sampled areas but better generalization for extrapolation tasks.</description>
