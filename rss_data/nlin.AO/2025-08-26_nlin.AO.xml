      <title>Data-driven phase control for limit-cycle oscillators under partial observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling rhythmic systems, typically modeled as limit-cycle oscillators, is an important subject in real-world problems. Phase reduction theory, which simplifies the multidimensional oscillator state under weak input to a single phase variable, is useful for analyzing the oscillator dynamics. In the control of limit-cycle oscillators with unknown dynamics, the oscillator phase should be estimated from time series under partial observation in real time. In this study, we present an autoencoder-based method for estimating the oscillator phase using delay embedding of observed state variables. We evaluate the order of the phase estimation error under weak inputs and apply the method to phase-reduction-based feedback control of mutual synchronization of two oscillators under partial observation. The effectiveness of our method is illustrated by numerical examples using two types of limit-cycle oscillators, the Stuart-Landau and Hodgkin-Huxley models.</description>

      <title>Scaling laws and relaxation rate at desynchronization in coupled oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex interactions leading to phase transitions continue to hold a due interest in the scientific community. We charactersize a phase transition in a coupled oscillators model where interactions are not local in nature. At a first order transition i.e an abrupt jump in order parameter, we obtain the order parameter scaling exponent $1/2$ and show that the relaxation time diverges near the transition point, both numerically and analytically. We also verify a finite time finite size scaling by considering a correlation measure in the discrete set of all interacting units. Due to divergence in correlation measure at the transition point, the order parameter becomes a homogeneous function of all the relevent parameters. The homogeneity assumption is numerically verified using data collapse method. Various finite size scaling relations and exponents are also obtained. This study suggests that presence of non local interactions may allow for critical behaviour at a first order transition.</description>

      <title>Species coexistence in the reinforcement learning paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central goal in ecology is to understand how biodiversity is maintained. Previous theoretical works have employed the rock-paper-scissors (RPS) game as a toy model, demonstrating that population mobility is crucial in determining the species' coexistence. One key prediction is that biodiversity is jeopardized and eventually lost when mobility exceeds a certain value--a conclusion at odds with empirical observations of highly mobile species coexisting in nature. To address this discrepancy, we introduce a reinforcement learning framework and study a spatial RPS model, where individual mobility is adaptively regulated via a Q-learning algorithm rather than held fixed. Our results show that all three species can coexist stably, with extinction probabilities remaining low across a broad range of baseline migration rates. Mechanistic analysis reveals that individuals develop two behavioral tendencies: survival priority (escaping from predators) and predation priority (remaining near prey). While species coexistence emerges from the balance of the two tendencies, their imbalance jeopardizes biodiversity. Notably, there is a symmetry-breaking of action preference in a particular state that is responsible for the divergent species densities. Furthermore, when Q-learning species interact with fixed-mobility counterparts, those with adaptive mobility exhibit a significant evolutionary advantage. Our study suggests that reinforcement learning may offer a promising new perspective for uncovering the mechanisms of biodiversity and informing conservation strategies.</description>

      <title>An integrated vertex model of the mesoderm invagination during the embryonic development of Drosophila</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mesoderm invagination of the Drosophila embryo is known as an archetypal morphogenic process. To explore the roles of the active cellular forces and the regulation of these forces, we developed an integrated vertex model that combines the regulation of morphogen expression with cell movements and tissue mechanics. Our results suggest that a successful furrow formation requires an apical tension gradient, decreased basal tension, and increased lateral tension, which corresponds to apical constriction, basal expansion, and apicobasal shortening respectively. Our model also considers the mechanical feedback which leads to an ectopic twist expression with external compression as observed in experiments. Our model predicts that ectopic invagination could happen if an external compressive gradient is applied.</description>

      <title>How Network Topology Affects the Strength of Dangerous Power Grid Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00552v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reasonably large perturbations may push a power grid from its stable synchronous state into an undesirable state. Identifying vulnerabilities in power grids by studying power grid stability against such perturbations can aid in preventing future blackouts. Probabilistic stability quantifiers such as basin stability, which measures the asymptotic stability of a system, and survivability, which measures the transient stability of a system, have been commonly used to quantify the stability of nodes in a power grid. However, these quantifiers do not provide information about the strength of perturbations that destabilize the system. To measure the strength of perturbations beyond which the stability of the system gets compromised, we employ two probabilistic distance-based stability measures -- basin stability bound, which deals with a system's asymptotic behaviour, and survivability bound, a newly defined stability measure that deals with a system's transient behaviour. Using these stability quantifiers, we conduct a detailed study on the impact of network topology on the strength of dangerous power grid perturbations. In this, we uncover a new class of highly vulnerable nodes that were previously unknown. Additionally, we establish connections with tree-like network structures and node connectivity to lowly stable nodes.</description>

      <title>Gaussian process regression with additive periodic kernels for two-body interaction analysis in coupled phase oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since many physical laws -- from classical mechanics to electromagnetism -- are formulated as two-body interactions, the same perspective naturally extends to biological and social dynamics. Here we focus on rhythmic phenomena, where phase reduction theory shows that synchronization dynamics can be universally described by coupled phase oscillators. Estimating the interaction functions of such systems from data offers a direct path to understanding and predicting such dynamics. Existing Fourier-series-based methods encounter difficulties with limited or biased data. To overcome this, we employ Gaussian process regression with additive periodic kernels. In our approach, we incorporate information about the estimation target into the statistical model in advance by designing kernel functions that capture the characteristics -- additivity and $2\pi$-periodicity -- of the coupling functions. Furthermore, owing to the Bayesian framework, our method enables the evaluation of uncertainty in the estimation results. We validate our approach on Van der Pol, FitzHugh-Nagumo, and spiking neural models. Our approach outperforms Fourier-series baselines in both error and stability under biased phase sampling. This enables data-driven studies of rhythm dynamics across a broader range of datasets. Furthermore, it makes a first step toward a statistically grounded, data-driven approach to general many-body systems with two-body interactions.</description>
