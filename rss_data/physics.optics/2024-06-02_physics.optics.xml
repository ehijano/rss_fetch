      <title>Universal evaluation and design of imaging systems using information estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information theory, which describes the transmission of signals in the presence of noise, has enabled the development of reliable communication systems that underlie the modern world. Imaging systems can also be viewed as a form of communication, in which information about the object is "transmitted" through images. However, the application of information theory to imaging systems has been limited by the challenges of accounting for their physical constraints. Here, we introduce a framework that addresses these limitations by modeling the probabilistic relationship between objects and their measurements. Using this framework, we develop a method to estimate information using only a dataset of noisy measurements, without making any assumptions about the image formation process. We demonstrate that these estimates comprehensively quantify measurement quality across a diverse range of imaging systems and applications. Furthermore, we introduce Information-Driven Encoder Analysis Learning (IDEAL), a technique to optimize the design of imaging hardware for maximum information capture. This work provides new insights into the fundamental performance limits of imaging systems and offers powerful new tools for their analysis and design.</description>

      <title>Beaconless Auto-Alignment for Single-Wavelength 5 Tbit/s Mode-Division Multiplexing Free-Space Optical Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mode-division multiplexing has shown its ability to significantly increase the capacity of free-space optical communications. An accurate alignment is crucial to enable such links due to possible performance degradation induced by mode crosstalk and narrow beam divergence. Conventionally, a beacon beam is necessary for system alignment due to multiple local maximums in the mode-division multiplexed beam profile. However, the beacon beam introduces excess system complexity, power consumption, and alignment errors. Here we demonstrate a beaconless system with significantly higher alignment accuracy and faster acquisition. This system also excludes excess complexity, power consumption, and alignment errors, facilitating simplified system calibration and supporting a record-high 5.14 Tbit/s line rate in a single-wavelength free-space optical link. We anticipate our paper to be a starting point for more sophisticated alignment scenarios in future multi-Terabit mode-division multiplexing free-space optical communications for long-distance applications with a generalised mode basis.</description>

      <title>Charge Transport in Interband Cascade Lasers: An Ab-Initio Self-Consistent Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interband cascade lasers (ICLs) stand out due to their low threshold current and minimal power consumption, rendering them viable sources for compact and mobile devices in the mid-infrared. Since their first demonstration, they experienced major performance improvements. Many of them originate, on one hand, from technological enhancements and, on the other hand, also from restricted numerical analysis. Encouraged by the impact of restricted models, an ICL-specific simulation tool can lead to performance breakthroughs and a better comprehension of governing mechanisms. Drawing from an evaluation of existing tools designed for quantum cascade structures, we implemented a self-consistent density matrix rate equation model generalized to simulate the transport in both conduction and valence band heterostructures. Albeit the extensive inclusion of the quantum effects, special care was taken to maintain a high numerical efficiency. Our charge transport model additionally considers optical field calculations, allowing for predictive calculations of light-current-voltage (LIV) curves. We benchmark the model against well-established ICL designs and demonstrate reliable performance predictability. Additionally, we give detailed insights into device characteristics extracted from our model. This ultimately allows us to deepen our understanding of ICLs and define existing and generate novel designs.</description>

      <title>Edible microlasers for monitoring authenticity and quality of food and pharmaceuticals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traceability, security and freshness monitoring are crucial to the food and pharmaceutical industries. Currently, barcodes and sensors are almost exclusively located on product packaging. Making them edible and introducing them into edible products could significantly enhance their functions. Here, several types of microlasers made entirely out of edible substances were developed. It is striking that olive oil already contains enough chlorophyll to be used as a laser when dispersed in water as droplets. The edible lasers can be embedded directly into edible products and serve as barcodes and sensors. Due to their much narrower spectral lines compared to fluorescent or color-changing sensors, they are significantly more sensitive to various environmental factors. The edible lasers were employed to sense sugar concentration, pH, the presence of bacteria, and exposure to too-high temperatures. They can also encode tens of data bits, such as manufacturer's information and expiration date. The microlasers are entirely safe for consumption, do not change the appearance and taste of food considerably, and are environmentally friendly. The developed barcodes and sensors could also be applied to non-edible items, such as cosmetic and agricultural products, for environmental monitoring and biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Tsang's resolution enhancement method for imaging with focused illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A widely tested approach to overcoming the diffraction limit in microscopy without disturbing the sample relies on substituting widefield sample illumination with a structured light beam. This gives rise to confocal, image-scanning and structured-illumination microscopy methods. On the other hand, as shown recently by Tsang and others, subdiffractional resolution at the detection end of the microscope can be achieved by replacing the intensity measurement in the image plane with spatial mode demultiplexing. In this work we study the combined action of Tsang's method with image scanning. We experimentally demonstrate superior lateral resolution and enhanced image quality compared to either method alone. This result paves the way for integrating spatial demultiplexing into existing microscopes, contributing to further pushing the boundaries of optical resolution.</description>

      <title>Axial HoloTile: Extended Depth-of-Focus of Dynamic Holographic Light Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This publication extends the HoloTile framework to three dimensions, introducing the ability to generate arbitrary dynamic patterns composed of extended depth-of-field non-diffractive beamlets with theoretically 100% diffraction efficiency. In particular, we demonstrate experimentally the generation of speckle-reduced reconstruction patterns, consisting of spatially multiplexed extended Bessel-like beamlets, implemented on a phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM). Due to the inherent separation of the tiled subhologram and the point spread function shaping hologram in HoloTile, we show that the reconstruction amplitude can be expressed as a simple convolution of the contributions from the two holograms. This results in a discretely sampled reconstruction, with each spatial frequency component exhibiting long DoF with characteristic Bessel beam properties. This separation facilitates spatial and temporal multiplexing of both contributions, and allows for real-time dynamic patterning with extended DoF. Additionally, a geometric analysis is included, allowing for the direct calculation of the propagation characteristics of the beamlets.</description>

      <title>Encryption in ghost imaging with Kronecker products of random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By forming measurement matrices with the Kronecker product of two random matrices, image encryption in computational ghost imaging is investigated. The two-dimensional images are conveniently reconstructed with the pseudo-inverse matrices of the two random matrices. To suppress the noise, the method of truncated singular value decomposition can be applied to either or both of the two pseudo-inverse matrices. Further, our proposal facilitates for image encryption since more matrices can be involved in forming the measurement matrix. Two permutation matrices are inserted into the matrix sequence. The image information can only be reconstructed with the correct permutation matrices and the matrix sequence in image decryption. The experimental results show the facilitations our proposal. The technique paves the way for the practicality and flexibility of computational ghost imaging.</description>

      <title>A transportable hyperspectral imaging setup based on fast, high-density spectral scanning for in situ quantitative biochemical mapping of fresh tissue biopsies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Histopathological examination of surgical biopsies, such as in glioma and glioblastoma resection, is hindered in current clinical practice by the long times required for the laboratory analysis and pathological screening, typically taking several days or even weeks to be completed. We propose here a transportable, high-density, spectral-scanning based hyperspectral imaging setup, named HyperProbe1, that can provide in situ, fast biochemical analysis and mapping of fresh surgical tissue samples, right after excision, and without the need of fixing or staining. HyperProbe1 is based on spectral scanning via supercontinuum laser illumination filtered with acousto-optic tuneable filters. Such methodology allows the user to select any number and type of wavelength bands in the visible and near-infrared range between 510 and 900 nm (up to 79), and to reconstruct 3D hypercubes composed of high-resolution, widefield images of the surgical samples, where each pixel is associated with a complete spectrum. The system is applied on 11 fresh surgical biopsies of glioma from routine patients, including different grades of tumour classification. Quantitative analysis of the composition of the tissue is performed via fast spectral unmixing to reconstruct mapping of major biomarkers. We also provided a preliminary attempt to infer tumour classification based on differences of composition in the samples, suggesting the possibility to use lipid content and differential cytochrome-c-oxidase concentrations to distinguish between lower and higher grade gliomas. A proof-of-concept of the performances of HyperProbe1 for quantitative, biochemical mapping of surgical biopsies is demonstrated, paving the way for improving current post-surgical, histopathological practice via non-destructive, in situ streamlined screening of fresh tissue samples in a matter of minutes after excision.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional solitons in second-harmonic-generating media with fractional diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a system of propagation equations for the fundamental-frequency (FF) and second-harmonic (SH) waves in the bulk waveguide with the effective fractional diffraction and quadratic (chi ^(2)) nonlinearity. The numerical solution produces families of ground-state (zero-vorticity) two-dimensional solitons in the free space, which are stable in exact agreement with the Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion, while vortex solitons are completely unstable in that case. Mobility of the stable solitons and inelastic collisions between them are briefly considered too. In the presence of a harmonic-oscillator (HO) trapping potential, families of partially stable single- and two-color solitons (SH-only or FF-SH ones, respectively) are obtained, with zero and nonzero vorticities. The single-and two-color solitons are linked by a bifurcation which takes place withthe increase of the soliton's power.</description>

      <title>snompy: a package for modelling scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) is a powerful technique for extreme subwavelength imaging and spectroscopy, with around 20 nm spatial resolution. But quantitative relationships between experiment and material properties requires modelling, which can be computationally and conceptually challenging. In this work, we present snompy an open-source Python library which contains implementations of two of the most common s-SNOM models, the finite dipole model (FDM) and the point dipole model (PDM). We show a series of typical uses for this package with demonstrations including simulating nano-Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra and recovering permittivity from experimental s-SNOM data. We also discuss the challenges faced with this sort of modelling, such as competing descriptions of the models in literature, and finite size effects. We hope that snompy will make quantitative s-SNOM modelling more accessible to the wider research community, which will further empower the use of s-SNOM for investigating nanoscale material properties.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-enhanced chiral absorption through electric dipole-electric quadrupole interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enantioselective interactions of chiral molecules include distinct absorptions to opposite-handed circularly polarized light, known as chiral absorption. Traditionally, chiral absorption has been primarily attributed to electric dipole and magnetic dipole interaction with molecular chirality. However, this approach falls short for large molecules that support high-order multipolar components, such as electric quadrupole moment. Here, we introduce a theoretical model to study the chiral absorption of large molecules in the presence of plasmonic nanostructures. This model considers both electric dipole-magnetic dipole interaction and electric dipole-electric quadrupole interaction enhanced by a resonant structure. We numerically study such interactions of the chiral molecular solution in the vicinity of a nonchiral plasmonic nano-resonator. Our results show the distinct spectral information of the chiral media on- and off-resonance of the resonator.</description>

      <title>Coherence in resonance fluorescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13743v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resonance fluorescence (RF) of a two-level emitter displays persistently anti-bunching irrespective of the excitation intensity, but inherits the driving laser's linewidth under weak excitation. These properties are commonly explained disjoinedly as the emitter's single photon saturation or passively scattering light, until a recent theory attributes anti-bunching to the laser-like spectrum's interference with the incoherently scattered light. However, the theory implies higher-order scattering processes, and led to an experiment purporting to validate an atom's simultaneous scattering of two photons. If true, it could complicate RF's prospects in quantum information applications. Here, we propose a unified model that treats all RF photons as spontaneous emission, one at a time, and can explain simultaneously both the RF's spectral and correlation properties. We theoretically derive the excitation power dependencies, with the strongest effects measurable at the single-photon incidence level, of the first-order coherence of the whole RF and super-bunching of the spectrally filtered, followed by experimental confirmation on a semiconductor quantum dot micro-pillar device. Furthermore, our model explains peculiar coincidence bunching observed in phase-dependent two-photon interference experiments. Our work provides novel understandings of coherent light-matter interaction and may stimulate new applications.</description>
