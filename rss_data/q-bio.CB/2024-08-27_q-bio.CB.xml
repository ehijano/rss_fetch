      <title>Intracellular order formation through stepwise phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Living cells inherently exhibit the ability to spontaneously reorganize their structures in response to changes in both their internal and external environments. Among these responses, the organization of stress fibers composed of actin molecules changes in direct accordance with the mechanical stiffness of their environments. On soft substrates, SFs are rarely formed, but as stiffness increases, they emerge with random orientation, progressively align, and eventually form thicker bundles as stiffness surpasses successive thresholds. These transformations share similarities with phase transitions studied in condensed matter physics, yet despite extensive research on cellular dynamics, the introduction of the statistical mechanics perspective to the environmental dependence of intracellular structures remains underexplored. With this physical framework, we identify key relationships governing these intracellular transitions, highlighting the delicate balance between energy and entropy. Our analysis provides a unified understanding of the stepwise phase transitions of actin structures, offering new insights into related biological mechanisms. Notably, our study suggests the existence of mechanical checkpoints in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, which sequentially regulate the formation of intracellular structures to ensure proper cell cycle progression.</description>

      <title>Qualitatively Distinct Signaling in Cells: The Informational Landscape of Amplitude and Frequency Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04089v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cells continuously sense their surroundings to detect modifications and generate responses. Very often changes in extracellular concentrations initiate signaling cascades that eventually result in changes in gene expression. Increasing stimulus strengths can be encoded in increasing concentration amplitudes or increasing activation frequencies of intermediaries of the pathway. In this paper we show that the different way in which amplitude and frequency encoding map environmental changes endow cells with qualitatively different information transmission capabilities. While amplitude encoding is optimal for a limited range of stimuli strengths, frequency encoding can transmit information with equal reliability over much broader ranges. The qualitative difference between the two strategies stems from the scale invariant discriminating power of the first transducing step in frequency codification. The apparently redundant combination of both strategies in some cell types may then serve the purpose of expanding the span over which stimulus strengths can be reliably discriminated. In this paper we discuss a possible example of this mechanism in yeast.</description>
