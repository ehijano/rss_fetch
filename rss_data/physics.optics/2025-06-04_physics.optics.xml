      <title>A refinement of the Lorentz local field expression with impact on the Clausius-Mossotti and Lorentz-Lorenz models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 19th century Mossotti and Clausius formulated an expression that relates electrical permittivity of a dielectric to the product of molecular polarizability and number density. Lorenz and Lorentz extended the use of that expression to also cover the dielectric s refractive index. These expressions successfully predict the change of the dielectric s permittivity and refractive index as a function of a wide range of its number density, using the consideration that molecular polarizability should not change significantly. However, the derivation of these equations is based on an approximation of the electric field inside the spherical void that models the environment of a single molecule with its own field removed. A switch to the exact field solution extends the validity of the Clausius-Mossotti and Lorentz-Lorenz equations to the higher values of number density which occur in densified dielectrics. It also provides a significant change in the estimates of molecular polarizability.</description>

      <title>Inverse design for robust inference in integrated computational spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For computational spectrometers, we propose an inverse-design approach in which the scattering media are topology-optimized to achieve better performance in inference, without the need of a training set of spectra and a distribution of detector noise. Our approach also allows the selection of the inference algorithm to be decoupled from that of the scatterer. For smooth spectra, we additionally devise a regularized reconstruction algorithm based on Chebyshev interpolation, which yields higher accuracy compared with conventional methods in which the spectra are sampled at equally spaced frequencies/wavelengths with equal weights. Our approaches are numerically demonstrated via inverse design of integrated computational spectrometers and reconstruction of example spectra. The inverse-designed spectrometers exhibit significantly better performance in the presence of noise than their counterparts with random scatterers.</description>

      <title>Selective Excitation of Coupled Resonators via Complex Frequency Driving: Enhanced Efficiency and Crosstalk Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling individual elements of coupled resonator systems poses a significant challenge, as conventional real-frequency pulses suffer from inefficiency and crosstalk, limiting fidelity and scalability. To address this challenge, we propose and explore the use of complex frequency excitations, tailoring the driving signal waveform to match the target complex reflection zeros. We demonstrate that complex frequency driving can achieve near-unity selected energy storage efficiency (100%) in a single resonator, substantially exceeding the performance of optimized Gaussian pulses (~80%). In a coupled three-resonator system, our method yields significantly higher efficiency (92-95%) along with vastly improved selectivity and crosstalk suppression compared to conventional Gaussian pulse excitations of the same duration. Our technique achieves dynamic critical coupling, providing a powerful paradigm for high-fidelity, selective control, crucial for advancing scalable complex systems for sensing and computing.</description>

      <title>Synthetic crystal rotation with spacetime metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of light with rotating bodies has been historically limited to rotation frequencies much smaller than optical frequencies. Here, we investigate synthetic crystal rotations, i.e., spatiotemporal modulations mimicking the rotation of an anisotropic crystal, which grant access to large rotation frequencies. Spatiotemporal modulations change the fundamental symmetries of the electromagnetic field, breaking temporal and rotation symmetries, but preserving a spatiotemporal rotation symmetry that enforces the conservation of a combination of energy and spin angular momentum (SAM). The scattering of optical pulses by synthetically rotating crystals results in spatiotemporal light with intra-pulse SAM changes. The frequency-domain response reveals sidebands with frequency/SAM locking, and negative frequency sideband transitions for large enough rotation frequencies. Our results highlight the qualitatively different light-matter interaction regimes accessed by synthetic rotations.</description>

      <title>High Light-Efficiency Holographic Tomographic Volumetric Additive Manufacturing using a MEMS-based Phase-only Light Modulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-based 3D printing, which relies on photocurable resins, has shown the capability to produce complex geometries with high resolution and fidelity. Tomographic Volumetric Additive Manufacturing (TVAM) employs a digital micromirror device (DMD) to project high-speed sequences of amplitude light patterns into a rotating resin volume, enabling rapid fabrication of 3D structures through photopolymerization. Typically, the light projection efficiency in such binary amplitude modulator-based systems is below a few percent. Recent advancements introduced phase encoding in TVAM using binary amplitude modulators, improving depth control and boosting light projection efficiency to approximately 10%. This was achieved by implementing the Lee hologram technique to encode phase into binary amplitude patterns. In this work, we present the first 3D printing platform utilizing a phase-only light modulator (PLM), based on an array of micro-electro-mechanical pistons. Compared to amplitude encoding, phase encoding with the PLM yields a 70-fold increase in laser power efficiency. By coupling this efficient light engine with a speckle reduction method in holographic volumetric additive manufacturing (HoloVAM), we experimentally demonstrate printing across different scales from hundreds of micrometers to centimeters using only digital control. The PLM opens up new avenues in volumetric AM for holographic techniques using low-cost single-mode UV laser diodes.</description>

      <title>Advanced microwave photonic waveform editing: enabling the evolution of radar systems into joint radar and spectrum sensing systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In response to the urgent demand for the development of future radar application platforms from single radar functionality towards integrated multi-functional systems, we show an advanced microwave photonic waveform editing method that enables the editing of arbitrary radar waveforms, equipping them with the capability to perform spectrum sensing. This, in turn, expands single-function radar systems into joint radar and spectrum sensing systems. We theoretically define and calculate the accumulation function of an arbitrary waveform after passing through a specific dispersive medium, and utilize this accumulation function to further design a corresponding binary sequence for editing the waveform. After editing, the accumulation function of the edited waveform approximates that of a linearly frequency-modulated signal matching the specific dispersive medium. Thus, the edited waveform can be compressed into a narrow pulse after passing through the dispersive medium, realizing the frequency-to-time mapping for achieving frequency measurement or time-frequency analysis. The concept is verified by a simulation and an experiment. Using a dispersion compensating fiber with a total dispersion of -6817 ps/nm, arbitrary waveforms, including a 7-bit Barker phase-coded waveform, a linearly frequency-modulated waveform, a nonlinearly frequency-modulated waveform, and a waveform with an "E" time-frequency diagram, are edited and further used for microwave frequency measurement and time-frequency analysis in an ultra-wide bandwidth of 36.8 GHz. The temporal resolution and frequency resolution are 2 ns and 0.86 GHz, respectively.</description>

      <title>Phase Topology Stability of an Optical Vortex via an Electrically Controlled Twist-Planar Oriented Liquid Crystal Fresnel Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical vortices (OVs) have emerged as a revolutionary concept in modern photonics, offering a unique method of manipulating light beyond conventional Gaussian beams. Despite their vast potential, phase topology stability remains unaddressed, limiting their widespread adoption and performance in real-world environments. Here, we reveal the missing link to assessing the stability of optical vortices using an electrically tunable twist-planar liquid crystal (LC) Fresnel lens. The proposed LC-based lens leverages the birefringence and voltage-controlled reconfigurability of liquid crystals to dynamically probe the phase topology of singular beams. By modulating the LC orientation with an applied voltage, we restructure the optical phase in real-time without requiring modifications to the optical setup. The 3V and 35V voltage supply allows for the switch between the "topological charge detection" and "optical singular beam propagation" modes. This eliminates the need for additional optical elements, significantly simplifying the detection and characterization of vortex beams. Experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate that the vortex topology can be unambiguously identified from the intensity profile observed in the Fourier plane of a lens. Furthermore, the designed device features low power consumption, compact form factor, and seamless integration potential, making it a promising candidate for scalable vortex-based photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Agile laser wavelength tuning using dynamic targeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunable lasers are essential and versatile tools in photonics, with applications spanning telecommunications, spectroscopy, and sensing. Advancements have aimed to expand tuning ranges, suppress mode hopping, and enable photonic integration. In this work, we explore the adaptation of dynamic targeting, a technique originally developed to stabilize lasers under optical feedback, as a method for achieving agile, fast, and continuous wavelength tuning. By adjusting the feedback rate and phase, we enable a stable and controlled frequency shift. We experimentally demonstrate reliable and reproducible tuning over 2.1 GHz using a free-space optical setup. Simulations further suggest that this approach could extend the tuning range to tens of GHz, with a potential scan speed exceeding $10^{17}$ Hz/s. These results highlight dynamic targeting as a promising route toward agile frequency control in semiconductor lasers.</description>

      <title>Transverse Distance Estimation with Higher-Order Hermite-Gauss modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the use of higher-order Hermite-Gauss modes for sensing optically induced transverse displacements. In the small-displacement regime, we show that projective measurements onto the two neighboring spatial modes yield optimal Fisher information, linearly scaling with the mode order $m$. We further extend the analysis to arbitrary displacement values and derive general expressions for the Fisher information, demonstrating that higher-order modes continue to outperform the fundamental Gaussian mode even at larger separations. This approach enables enhanced displacement sensitivity with only a minimal number of measurements, offering a simple and scalable alternative to conventional Spatial Mode Demultiplexing schemes. We provide a proof-of-principle experimental demonstration using spatial light modulators, showing an order-of-magnitude reduction in estimation variance when employing Hermite-Gauss modes of order $m = 8$ and $m = 17$. These results highlight the potential of structured light for ultrasensitive displacement sensing and may enable new applications in birefringence measurements with broadband or low-coherence light sources.</description>

      <title>Quantum Vacuum in Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An intriguing consequence of quantum field theory is that vacuum is not empty space; it is full of quantum fluctuating electromagnetic fields, or virtual photons, corresponding to their zero-point energy, even though the average number of photons is zero. These short-lived vacuum fluctuations are behind some of the most fascinating physical processes in the universe, including spontaneous emission, the Lamb shift, and the Casimir force. Recent theory and experiments indicate that the properties of materials placed in photonic cavities may be altered, even in the complete absence of any external fields, through interaction with the fluctuating vacuum electromagnetic fields. Judicious engineering of the quantum vacuum surrounding the matter inside a cavity can lead to significant and nonintuitive modifications of electronic and vibrational states, producing a ``vacuum dressed'' material. These exciting new ideas have stimulated discussions regarding the fundamental physics of vacuum-matter interactions and also broadened the scope of potential applications using zero-point fluctuations to engineer materials. This Perspective will first discuss recent experimental and theoretical developments on vacuum-modified condensed matter systems, which usually require the realization of the so-called ultrastrong light-matter coupling regime. Then, we will overview some of the most promising cavity designs for enhancing vacuum electromagnetic fields in materials with various energy scales. Finally, we will discuss urgent open questions and technical challenges to be solved in this emerging field.</description>

      <title>Performance of multiple filter-cavity schemes for frequency-dependent squeezing in gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave detectors use state-of-the-art quantum technologies to circumvent vacuum fluctuations via squeezed states of light. Future detectors such as Einstein Telescope may require the use of two filter cavities or a 3-mirror, coupled filter cavity to achieve a complex rotation of the squeezing ellipse in order to reduce the quantum noise over the whole detector bandwidth. In this work, we compare the theoretical feasibility and performances of these two systems and their resilience with respect to different degradation sources (optical losses, mismatching, locking precision). We provide both analytical models and numerical insights. We extend previous analysis on squeezing degradation and find that the coupled cavity scheme provides similar or better performances than the two-cavity option, in terms of resilience with respect to imperfections and optical losses. We propose a possible two-step implementation scheme for Einstein Telescope using a single filter cavity that can be possibly upgraded into a coupled filter cavity.</description>

      <title>Heliostat Optical Error Inspection with Polarimetric Imaging Drone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) field, optical errors have significant impacts on the collection efficiency of heliostats. Fast, cost-effective, labor-efficient, and non-intrusive autonomous field inspection remains a challenge. Approaches using imaging drone, i.e., Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system integrated with high resolution visible imaging sensors, have been developed to address these challenges; however, these approaches are often limited by insufficient imaging contrast. Here we report a polarimetry-based method with a polarization imaging system integrated on UAV to enhance imaging contrast for in-situ detection of heliostat mirrors without interrupting field operation. We developed an optical model for skylight polarization pattern to simulate the polarization images of heliostat mirrors and obtained optimized waypoints for polarimetric imaging drone flight path to capture images with enhanced contrast. The polarimetric imaging-based method improved the success rate of edge detections in scenarios which were challenging for mirror edge detection with conventional imaging sensors. We have performed field tests to achieve significantly enhanced heliostat edge detection success rate and investigate the feasibility of integrating polarimetric imaging method with existing imaging-based heliostat inspection methods, i.e., Polarimetric Imaging Heliostat Inspection Method (PIHIM). Our preliminary field test results suggest that the PIHIM hold the promise to enable sufficient imaging contrast for real-time autonomous imaging and detection of heliostat field, thus suitable for non-interruptive fast CSP field inspection during its operation.</description>

      <title>Highly reliable, ultra-wideband, isolator-free quantum-dot mode-locked frequency combs for optical interconnects beyond 3.2Tb/s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum dot mode-locked laser-based optical frequency combs are emerging as a critical solution for achieving low-cost, high-efficiency, and large-capacity optical interconnects. The practical implementation of wavelength division multiplexing interconnects necessitates a temperature-stable OFC source with a minimum 100 GHz channel spacing to enable high-bandwidth modulation while mitigating the complexity of optical filtering and detection. By leveraging the advanced co-doping technique and a colliding pulse mode-locking scheme, here, we report a compact, ultra-wideband, highly reliable, isolator-free 100 GHz-spacing InAs/GaAs QD OFC source operating up to a record temperature of 140 {\deg}C. The comb source delivers a record 3 dB optical bandwidth of 14.312 nm, containing flat-top comb lines, each supporting 128 Gb/s PAM-4 modulation, which results in a total throughput of 3.328 Tb/s with an extremely low power consumption of 0.394 pJ/bit at 25{\deg}C. Performance remains stable at 85 {\deg}C, with negligible degradation of device critical metrics. Remarkably, accelerated aging tests under harsh conditions (85 {\deg}C with 8x threshold current injection) revealed a mean time to failure of approximately 207 years. The QD OFC source demonstrated in this work, for the first time, establishes a concrete link between fundamental research on comb sources and their practical deployment in next-generation, high-density optical interconnect systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum light and radiation in Rindler spacetime: from uncertainty relations to the cosmological implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02417</link>

Abstract: Based on an analogy between diffraction integral formalism of classical field propagation and Feynman path integral approach to quantum field theory, we develop a quantum model for light and radiation in Rindler spacetime. The framework helps to reveal acceleration-induced contributions to the traditional Heisenberg position-momentum uncertainty relation. A modified Planck energy density distribution of radiation is established and reveals equivalence between temperature and Rindler acceleration as advocated by standard Unruh and anti-Unruh effects. Later, by defining an equivalent acceleration, we investigate some cosmological implications of the model with regards to redshift and expansion of the Universe. In this context, we contend that the accelerated expansion of the Universe, in addition to possessing some well-defined limits corresponding to early and local Universe epochs, may also hint towards dynamical nature of dark energy. The findings provide glimpse into future table-top experiments aimed at emulating gravitational and other cosmological phenomena in terrestrial lab setups.</description>

      <title>Can TCOs Transform Cavity-QED?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transparent conductive oxides (TCO) enable confinement of charge-sensitive ions and Rydberg atoms proximal to dielectric structures including waveguides and photon detectors. However, optical loss precludes the use of TCOs within high-finesse optical micro-resonators. Here we characterize a ZnO-based TCO that markedly reduces optical absorption. At 1650\text{ nm} we observe a 22,000 finesse in a Fabry-P\'erot optical cavity coated with a 30\text{ nm} ZnO layer. This is a 5000 times reduction relative to indium tin oxide (ITO) at this wavelength. The same ZnO film exhibits 0.01\text{ \ensuremath{\Omega}\ensuremath{\cdot}cm} surface resistivity at DC. We anticipate a step change in cavity-QED systems incorporating ultra-low loss TCOs like ZnO.</description>

      <title>Polaromechanical cooling of multiple mechanical modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong coupling between light and matter gives rise to polaritons. Further coupling polaritons to phonons leads to the formation of hybrid polaromechanical systems. Recent experiments have achieved the strong coupling between polaritons and phonons in two different configurations, namely, the magnon-photon-phonon and exciton-photon-phonon systems, which makes it possible to prepare and control mechanical states via manipulating the polaritons. Here, we present a polaromechanical cooling theory and show how multiple mechanical modes can be simultaneously cooled by using polaritons with a single drive field. This is achieved by exploiting the great tunability of the polariton frequencies. Specifically, $N$ polaritons can be tuned to resonantly enhance the anti-Stokes scatterings associated with $N$ mechanical modes, leading to the cooling of all the mechanical modes at once. We explicitly show how such polaromechanical cooling can simultaneously cool two mechanical modes, and then discuss how to apply it to cool multiple mechanical modes and to various polaromechanical systems, such as magnon-, exciton-, and plasmon-polaromechanical systems.</description>

      <title>Adiabaticity violation under arbitrarily slow evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum adiabatic theorem, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, asserts that a gapped quantum system remains in its instantaneous eigenstate during sufficiently slow evolution, provided no resonances occur. Here we challenge this principle and show that adiabaticity can be violated even in arbitrarily slow processes. We introduce two new parameters, Instantaneous Transition Accumulation (ITA) and Instantaneous Transition Probability (ITP), to redefine the framework of adiabatic evolution. These parameters, grounded in cross-Berry connections and eigenstate amplitudes, reveal the dynamic and geometric factors governing adiabaticity. Using a new Phase Difference Manipulation (PDM) method, we control ITP and ITA to induce adiabaticity violation in a Landau-Zener (LZ) process. We experimentally demonstrate this counterintuitive phenomenon in a photonic waveguide system, where a slow LZ process defies adiabaticity, switching energy levels despite a fivefold slower evolution speed than a conventional adiabatic process. This discovery reshapes our understanding of quantum evolution and holds potential for quantum computing, topological physics, and photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>$^{229}$Th Nuclear Spectroscopy in an Opaque Material: Laser-Based Conversion Electron M\"ossbauer Spectroscopy of $^{229}$ThO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we report the first demonstration of laser-induced conversion electron M\"{o}ssbauer spectroscopy of the $^{229}$Th nuclear isomeric state, which provides the ability to probe the nuclear transition in a material that is opaque to light resonant with the nuclear transition. Specifically, we excite the nuclear transition in a thin ThO$_2$ sample whose band gap ($\sim$ 6 eV) is considerably smaller than the nuclear isomeric state energy (8.4 eV). As a result, the excited nucleus can quickly decay by internal conversion, resulting in the ejection of electrons from the surface. By collecting these conversion electrons, nuclear spectroscopy can be recorded. Unlike fluorescence spectroscopy, this technique is compatible with materials whose work function is less than the nuclear transition energy, opening a wider class of systems to study. Further, because ThO$_2$ can be made from spinless isotopes and the internal conversion decay process reduces the isomeric state lifetime to only $\sim$10 $\mu$s, allowing $\sim$10$^8$ relative reduction in clock interrogation time, a conversion-electron-based nuclear clock could lead to a $\sim$10$^4$ reduction in clock instability.</description>

      <title>All-Optical Azimuthal Trapping of Dissipative Kerr Multi-Solitons for Relative Noise Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal cavity solitons, or dissipative Kerr solitons (DKS) in integrated microresonators, are essential for deployable metrology technologies. Such applications favor the lowest noise state, typically the single-DKS state where one soliton is in the resonator. Other multi-DKS states can also be reached, offering better conversion efficiency and thermal stability, potentially simplifying DKS-based technologies. Yet they exhibit more noise due to relative soliton jitter, and are usually not compatible with targeted applications. We demonstrate that Kerr-induced synchronization, an all-optical trapping technique, can azimuthally pin the multi-DKS state to a common reference field. This method ensures repetition rate noise independent of the number of solitons, making a multi-DKS state indistinguishable from a single-DKS state in that regard, akin to trapped-soliton molecule behavior. Supported by theoretical analysis and experimental demonstration in an integrated microresonator, this approach provides metrological capacity regardless of the number of cavity solitons, benefiting numerous DKS-based metrology applications.</description>

      <title>Error-Free Demodulation of Pixelated Interferograms: Updated review and circumstantial evidence of plagiarism by 4D Technology Corporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14927v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the historical development that led to error-free phase demodulation of pixelated spatial-carrier interferograms between 2004 and 2010. It also evaluates evidence suggesting that 4D Technology Corporation (4DTC), in their SPIE 7790 publication [18], may have adopted key concepts from a manuscript submitted by Servin and collaborators, which at that time was still under peer review [17]. We analyze 4DTC algorithms based on 2x2 and 3x3 spatial convolution phase shifting algorithms (SC-PSA), developed from 2004 to 2009 [9-15], and show that they were fundamentally limited to narrow bandwidth fringe demodulation. Notably, only one 4DTC's paper [13] acknowledged major phase errors when these methods were applied to wideband pixelated fringes, but the problem remained unsolved. In 2010, the team at Centro de Investigaciones en Optica (CIO), led by Servin, entered the field [16,17]. At that point, CIO and 4DTC were the only two known groups pursuing error free demodulation of wideband pixelated interferograms. In June 2010, Servin et al submitted to Optics Express [17] a definitive error-free solution introducing a new method: the complex fringe-carrier product followed by step-edge low-pass Fourier filtering. This approach fully superseded the 2x2 and 3x3 kernels used by 4DTC [9-15], reaching the theoretical slope limit for pixelated sensors. Given the notable phase demodulation similarities between papers [17] and [18], and that the presentation of [18] was just seven weeks after Servin submission [17], it is plausible that 4DTC or an affiliate had early access to the submission. The circumstantial evidence suggests that core ideas from [17] were incorporated into 4DTC August presentation [18]. This paper retraces that scientific path and examines the ethical implications of uncredited appropriation in optical research.</description>

      <title>Neural nanophotonic object detector with ultra-wide field-of-view</title>

Abstract: Intelligent object detection, which extracts crucial information like targets categories and locations, plays a vital role in emerging technologies including autonomous driving, the Internet of Things, and next-generation mobile communication systems. With the advancement of intelligent object detectors towards higher integration and miniaturization, their portability and adaptability to a broader range of scenarios have been significantly enhanced. However, this progress comes at the cost of reduced detection quality and narrower field-of-view, which severely impacts overall performances. Here we present a neural nanophotonic object detector based on a metalens array, capable of delivering high-quality imaging with an ultra-wide field-of-view of 135{\deg}. The combined neural network not only further improves the imaging quality, but also enables the detector to achieve high-precision target recognition and localization. Moreover, we integrated the neural nanophotonic object detector into a miniature unmanned aerial vehicle to enable wide-angle imaging and intelligent recognition of various real-world dynamic objects, demonstrating the high mobility and flexibility of our neural nanophotonic object detector. Our study presents a systematic framework for advancing revolutionary intelligent detection systems, offering significant potential for a wide range of future applications.</description>

      <title>Photoluminescence-Based Gas Sensing with MoS2 Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are highly appealing for gas sensors, lab-on-a-chip devices and bio-sensing applications because of their strong light-matter interaction and high surface-to-volume ratio. The ability to grow these van der Waals materials on different substrates and waveguide geometries opens a horizon toward scalable on-chip photonic nanodevices. Here, we report on a versatile technique for real time remote optical gas sensing using two-dimensional TMDs. The adsorption of the gas molecules on the monolayer surface provides a gateway for gas sensing based on charge-transfer-induced photoluminescence variation. For gases that are weakly adsorbed on the surface of monolayer TMDs, purging the monolayers' surface by an inert gas like N2 can desorb gases from the monolayers at room temperature. We demonstrate CO, NO and NO2 detection by monitoring photoluminescence from semiconducting MoS2 monolayers grown on SiO2/Si chips at a level of 10 ppm with fast response time. Observations are supported by our density functional theory calculations, which predict a significant interaction between these gases and MoS2 monolayers. These findings may lead to advances in remote sensing, surface-sensitive bioanalytics and lab-on-a-chip sensors.</description>

      <title>A Polarimetry-based Field-deployable Non-interruptive Mirror Soiling Detection Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The soiling level of heliostat mirrors in Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) fields is one of the key factors that significantly influences optical efficiency. State-of-the-art methods of monitoring heliostats soiling levels still face various challenges, including slow speed, labor-intensive operations, resolution and accuracy constraints or interruptions to solar field operations. We present a rapid, cost-effective, and non-intrusive method for mirror soiling detection based on polarimetric imaging, referred to as Polarimetric Imaging-based Mirror Soiling (PIMS). The compact PIMS device is designed for integration with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), enabling rapid, large-area assessments of heliostat mirrors for efficient soiling detection. Our method utilizes the correlation between the Degree of Linear Polarization (DoLP) and surface soiling level based on Mie scattering theory and Monte Carlo simulations. Field deployment of the PIMS method requires minimal device installation, and its UAV-based operation allows for soiling detection without interrupting plant activities. The PIMS method holds the potential for mirror soiling detection across various concentrated solar power (CSP) plants and can be further adapted for other types of solar fields, such as parabolic trough systems.</description>
