      <title>Can the Odderon be "Supercritical"?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the postulate that a $C$-odd exchange leads to repulsion in the particle-particle system (say, $pp$) and to attraction in the antiparticle-particle system (say, $\bar{p}p$), we show that the Odderon intercept cannot be greater than unity.</description>

      <title>Baryon-baryon, meson-meson, and meson-baryon interactions in nonrelativistic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals potentials describing interactions between color-singlet mesons and/or baryons vanish at leading order in potential nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics (pNRQCD). This result and constraints from Gauss's law are used to prove that weakly-coupled pNRQCD van der Waals potentials in generic non-Abelian gauge theories with only heavy quarks are too weak to form bound states whose color state is a product of color-singlets. Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of four, five, and six quarks with equal masses provide numerical evidence that exotic color configurations are higher energy than products of color-singlet hadrons, suggesting that equal-mass fully-heavy tetraquark, pentaquark, and hexaquark bound states do not exist at next-to-leading order in pNRQCD and at all orders in QCD-like theories in which all quark masses are asymptotically large. Mechanisms for generating hadron-hadron bound states are identified, which necessarily involve large quark-mass hierarchies, relativistic effects arising from the presence of sufficiently light quarks, or nonperturbative effects outside the scope of weakly-coupled pNRQCD.</description>

      <title>A Prediction for Maximum Supercooling in SU(N) Confinement Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal confinement phase transition (PT) in $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory is first-order for $N\geq 3$, with bounce action scaling as $N^2$. Remarkably, lattice data for the action include a small coefficient whose presence likely strongly alters the PT dynamics. We give evidence, utilizing insights from softly-broken SUSY YM models, that the small coefficient originates from a deconfined phase instability just below the critical temperature. We predict the maximum achievable supercooling in $SU(N)$ theories to be a few percent, which can be tested on the lattice. We briefly discuss the potentially significant suppression of the associated cosmological gravitational wave signals.</description>

      <title>Spectral function approach in NuWro: modeling of multinucleon final states in quasielastic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino-oscillation experiments performed in the few-GeV energy region create an urgent demand for a significant improvement in the accuracy of modeling of neutrino interactions with atomic nuclei. Here, we report an updated implementation of the spectral function approach in the \nuwro{} Monte Carlo generator, which consistently treats multinucleon final-states in quasielastic scattering at the inclusive and exclusive level. After validating its accuracy against inclusive electron-scattering data, we compare its predictions to various neutrino cross sections from MicroBooNE. We find that with the multinucleon contribution, these data are reproduced with $\chi^2$ per degree of freedom of 1.3--1.8, compared to 2.7--7.2 without it.</description>

      <title>Extended Color Twin Higgs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a novel variation of the mirror Twin Higgs model in which the color gauge group in both sectors is extended to SU(4$)_c$ and spontaneously broken to SU(3$)_c$ exclusively in the visible sector. Through this process, the mirror $Z_2$ symmetry is spontaneously broken, allowing for a phenomenologically viable electroweak vacuum alignment. This structure produces interesting collider signatures, including heavy vectors and fermions with fractional electric charges. The twin sector, with unbroken SU(4$)_c$, produces interesting cosmological characteristics, such as the possibility to reduce $\Delta N_\text{eff}$ and stable spin-0 baryons. The enlarged top quark sector required by the extended color gauge symmetry preserves naturalness, with even less tuning than the original twin Higgs in many circumstances.</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis and neutrino mass with one right-handed neutrino and Higgs inflaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel and minimal setup where the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe and neutrino oscillation data can be satisfied with only one right-handed neutrino (RHN) and a second Higgs doublet with the latter being also responsible for driving cosmic inflation. While inflation is realised via non-minimal coupling of the Higgs to gravity, baryon asymmetry is generated via Affleck-Dine leptogenesis. Due to the presence of only two new fields beyond the standard model (BSM), the proposed setup remains very predictive with only a small allowed parameter space consistent with the PLANCK 2018 and ACT 2025 data simultaneously. The preferred mass spectrum of the BSM particles also keeps the detection prospects alive at terrestrial experiments.</description>

      <title>Fermion mass ratios from the exceptional Jordan algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the "three generations" problem and the pattern of charged-fermion masses from the vantage of octonionic and Clifford algebra structures. Working with the exceptional Jordan algebra J3(OC) (right-handed flavor) and the symmetric cube of SU(3) (left-handed charge frame), we show that a single minimal ladder in the symmetric cube, together with the Dynkin Z2 swap (the A2 diagram flip), leads to closed-form expressions for the square-root mass ratios of all three charged families. The universal Jordan spectrum (q - delta, q, q + delta) with a theoretically derived delta squared = 3/8 fixes the endpoint contrasts; fixed Clebsch factors (2, 1, 1) ensure rung cancellation ("edge universality") so that adjacent ratios depend only on which edge is taken. The down ladder determines one step, its Dynkin reflection gives the lepton ladder, and choosing the other outward leg from the middle yields the up sector.
  From the same inputs we obtain compact CKM "root-sum rules": with one 1-2 phase and a mild 2-3 cross-family normalization, the framework reproduces the Cabibbo angle and Vcb and provides leading predictions for Vub and Vtd/Vts. We perform apples-to-apples phenomenology (common scheme/scale) and find consistency with current determinations within quoted uncertainties. Conceptually, rank-1 idempotents (points of the octonionic projective plane), fixed symmetric-cube Clebsches, and the Dynkin swap together account for why electric charge is generation-blind while masses follow the observed hierarchies, and they furnish clear, falsifiable mass-ratio relations beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory Factorization for Diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a factorization formula for coherent and incoherent $ep$ diffraction using the soft collinear effective theory, utilizing multiple power expansion parameters to handle different kinematic regions. This goes beyond the known hard-collinear diffractive factorization to address the small-$x$ Regge dynamics and Pomeron exchange from first principles. The effective field theory analysis also uncovers and factorizes an important irreducible incoherent background generated by color-nonsinglet exchange, dubbed "quasi-diffraction", for which we calculate the associated Sudakov suppression. For unpolarized scattering we show that there are four diffractive structure functions at leading power, and point out the importance of studying $F_{3,4}^D$ through asymmetries, in addition to $F_{2,L}^D$. For the quasi-diffractive background, we make model independent predictions for ratios of the corresponding structure functions in a perturbative kinematic region. Our analysis also makes predictions for six leading-power spin-dependent structure functions. Finally, we provide connections to diffractive parton distributions, and assess the Ingelman-Schlein model. Our work lays a path for further QCD-based studies of diffraction.</description>

      <title>Rephasing Invariant Formula for the CP Phase in the Kobayashi-Maskawa Parametrization and the Exact Sum Rule with the Unitarity Triangle $\delta_{\rm PDG} + \delta_{\rm KM} = \pi - \alpha + \gamma$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we obtain a rephasing invariant formula for the CP phase in the Kobayashi--Maskawa parameterization $\delta_{\rm KM} = \arg [ - { V_{ud} \det V_{\rm CKM} / V_{us} V_{ub} V_{cd} V_{td}} ]$. General perturbative expansion of the formula and observed value $\delta_{\rm KM} \simeq \pi/2$ reveal that the phase difference of the 1-2 mixings $e^{i (\rho_{12}^{d} - \rho_{12}^{u})}$ is close to maximal for sufficiently small 1-3 quark mixings $s_{13}^{u,d}$. Moreover, by combining this result with another formula for the CP phase $\delta_{\rm PDG}$ in the PDG parameterization, we derived an exact sum rule $\delta_{\rm PDG} + \delta_{\rm KM} = \pi - \alpha + \gamma$ which relating the phases and the angles $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ of the unitarity triangle.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the magnitude of two loop corrections to the muon magnetic dipole moment in the mass insertion approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of muon magnetic dipole moment (MDM) experiments, particularly the high-precision measurements at Fermilab National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL), experimental data have become increasingly precise. Up to now, the deviation of muon MDM between the experimental data and the standard model prediction is still existing, which may be caused by the new physics contribution. The two loop supersymmetric diagrams can produce important corrections to muon MDM. For many two loop diagrams, we analyse the order of the contribution to select the important two loop diagrams and neglect the tiny one, which is in favor of distinguishing the important two loop diagrams from all the two loop diagrams.
  In our analysis, we use the mass insertion approximation. There is no rotation matrix during the study and the resulting factors become more intuitive, so the mass insertion method is more suitable for this study of ours.</description>

      <title>Doubly heavy spin-$\frac {3}{2} $ baryons spectrum in the ground and excited states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study employs QCD sum rules to predict the masses and residues of spin-$\frac {3}{2} $ doubly heavy baryons including two heavy quarks (c and/or b) and one light quark, specifically focusing on $ \Xi_{cc}^*$, $ \Xi_{bc}^*$, $ \Xi_{bb}^*$, $ \Omega_{cc}^*$, $ \Omega_{bc}^*$ and $ \Omega_{bb}^*$. Our study provides results for the ground state ($1S$), first orbital excitation ($1P$), and the first radial excitation ($2S$), within a consistent theoretical framework. In addition to mass spectra, we provide residue calculations as well. The calculated residues are essential for estimating the decay widths and branching ratios of these baryons at different decay channels. Our analysis incorporates nonperturbative QCD effects through operators up to dimension ten, leading to improved precision in the mass and residue calculations. These predictions offer crucial guidance for ongoing and future experimental searches, particularly in light of the current lack of empirical data for the ground and excited states, and provide a basis for comparison with future experimental data.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Spectrum from the Production of Dark Matter via the freeze-in Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the first detection of gravitational waves by ground-based interferometers, it has emerged as a novel probe for exploring physics in the early universe. The particle nature of cold dark matter (DM) and its underlying production mechanisms remain long-standing unresolved issues in the field. Notably, if DM is generated through the freeze-in mechanism in the early universe, direct laboratory detection becomes extraordinarily challenging due to its extremely weak coupling with standard model particles. In this study, we calculate the graviton bremsstrahlung process involved in the freeze-in production of dark matter, deriving the gravitational wave spectra for both the conventional freeze-in mechanism and ultraviolet freeze-in scenarios. Our analysis reveals that these spectra exhibit distinct characteristics, though they fall beyond the detection limits of currently proposed gravitational wave experiments. However, advancements in high-frequency gravitational wave detection technologies in the future may offer a means to indirectly probe the ultraviolet freeze-in mechanism.</description>

      <title>Right handed neutrino production from $Z^\prime$ interactions in forward search experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two general $U(1)$ extensions of the Standard Model (SM) those generate tiny neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism after general $U(1)$ breaking. These models predict a new neutral gauge boson ($Z'$) and right-handed neutrinos (RHNs), the latter introduced for anomaly cancellation and neutrino mass generation. In both scenarios, left- and right-handed fermions couple differently to the $Z'$, and RHNs mix with light neutrinos, enabling variety of decay modes. Focusing on the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) and the future FASER2 experiment, we explore RHN pair production from $Z'$ decays in two cases: (i) long-lived $Z'$ decays to visible modes and long-lived RHNs, and (ii) short-lived $Z'$ decays to long-lived RHNs, which further decay visibly inside FASER2. We estimate projected limits on the general $U(1)$ gauge coupling, $Z'$ mass, RHN mass, and light-heavy neutrino mixing for various $U(1)$ charge assignments, and compare them with current experimental bounds.</description>

      <title>Mass spectrum of the $\Omega\bar{\Omega}$ states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the mass spectrum of the $\Omega\bar{\Omega}$ states with quantum numbers $J^{PC}=0^{-+}$, $1^{--}$, $0^{++}$, and $1^{++}$ within the framework of QCD sum rules. Employing suitably constructed interpolating currents, the analyses are carried out with the operator product expansion (OPE) including condensate contributions up to dimension $12$. Our results indicate the existence of four possible baryonium states with masses $m_{0^{-+}}=(3.22\pm0.07)$ GeV, $m_{1^{--}}=(3.28\pm0.08)$ GeV, $m_{0^{++}}=(3.46\pm0.09)$ GeV, and $m_{1^{++}}=(3.54\pm0.11)$ GeV. For the $0^{-+}$ and $1^{--}$ states, the predicted masses lie below the corresponding dibaryon thresholds, suggesting possible bound-state configurations. In contrast, the $0^{++}$ and $1^{++}$ states are found above the respective thresholds, implying resonance-like behavior. Potential decay channels for these baryonium candidates are discussed, with emphasis on those accessible to current experimental facilities such as BESIII, Belle II, and LHCb.</description>

      <title>Effects of light-mass fermionic dark matter on the equilibrium and stability of white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White dwarfs (WDs) can be used as laboratories to test strong gravity and high-density regimes, once their equation of state is not so uncertain as the one of neutron stars. This makes them also a useful tool to constrain dark-matter models. In this work, we study dark matter white dwarfs (DMWD) composed of white dwarf matter admixed with fermionic dark matter in a two-fluid general relativistic framework. Dark matter particles are considered to have masses between $0.1-10$ GeV. The equilibrium configurations and stability are derived, showing that the DMWD can be more compact, with masses around 1.3 $M\odot$ and radii around 500 km. The increasing compactness leads to changes in the fundamental modes of radial oscillations ($\sim20\%$ for 0.1 GeV DM), which produce detectable shifts in GW frequencies. The interplay between dark matter and normal matter thus provides a compelling avenue for interpreting deviations in observed WD properties and for placing constraints on DM characteristics through astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Jet Image Tagging Using Deep Learning: An Ensemble Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jet classification in high-energy particle physics is important for understanding fundamental interactions and probing phenomena beyond the Standard Model. Jets originate from the fragmentation and hadronization of quarks and gluons, and pose a challenge for identification due to their complex, multidimensional structure. Traditional classification methods often fall short in capturing these intricacies, necessitating advanced machine learning approaches. In this paper, we employ two neural networks simultaneously as an ensemble to tag various jet types. We convert the jet data to two-dimensional histograms instead of representing them as points in a higher-dimensional space. Specifically, this ensemble approach, hereafter referred to as Ensemble Model, is used to tag jets into classes from the JetNet dataset, corresponding to: Top Quarks, Light Quarks (up or down), and W and Z bosons. For the jet classes mentioned above, we show that the Ensemble Model can be used for both binary and multi-categorical classification. This ensemble approach learns jet features by leveraging the strengths of each constituent network achieving superior performance compared to either individual network.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Formation and Spin in Matter Domination Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we calculate the mass distribution of primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the matter-dominated (MD) era by the peak theory. We apply the Zel'dovich approximation to track the nonlinear evolution of overdensities and compute the PBH abundance and mass function by incorporating a PBH formation criterion based on the hoop conjecture. We find that the PBH abundance $\beta$ follows the scaling law $\beta \simeq A_\gamma \sigma_h^{*5}$ for $\sigma_h^*\ll 1$. Here, $\sigma_h^*$ is the quantity that characterizes the variance of the density fluctuation at the horizon entry. We also find that, in contrast to the previous estimates, the PBH spin is very small for $\sigma_h^*\ll 1$ but could be larger for larger $\sigma_h^*$ and broader power spectra. Finally, specializing to a monochromatic power spectrum, we prove analytically that the PBH mass distribution becomes effectively monochromatic and reveal that the resultant PBH abundance is approximately 19 times the previous prediction.</description>

      <title>Probing Nucleon-$\Omega_{\rm ccc}$Interaction via Lattice QCD at Physical Quark Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the S-wave interactions between the nucleon ($N$) and the triply charmed Omega baryon ($\Omega_{\mathrm{ccc}}$) using (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD with a physical pion mass ($m_\pi \simeq 137.1$ MeV) on a lattice volume $\simeq (8.1~\mathrm{fm})^3$. The charm quark is implemented with a relativistic heavy-quark action at its physical mass. Employing the time-dependent HAL QCD method, the $N$-$\Omega_{\mathrm{ccc}}$ potentials in the spin-1 ($^3\mathrm{S}_1$) and spin-2 ($^5\mathrm{S}_2$) channels are extracted. In both channels, overall attraction is found with the scattering parameters, $a_0 = 0.56(0.13)\left(^{+0.26}_{-0.03}\right)$ fm and $r_{\mathrm{eff}} = 1.60(0.05)\left(^{+0.04}_{-0.12}\right)$ fm for the $^3\mathrm{S}_1$ channel, and
  $a_0 = 0.38(0.12)\left(^{+0.25}_{-0.00}\right)$ fm and $r_{\mathrm{eff}} = 2.04(0.10)\left(^{+0.03}_{-0.22}\right)$ fm for the $^5\mathrm{S}_2$ channel, indicating the absence of a dibaryon bound state. The extracted potentials are further decomposed into spin-independent and spin-dependent components. The spin-independent potential is a dominant component and features a short-range attractive core and a long-range attractive tail, while the spin-dependent potential shows short-range attraction (repulsion) in the spin-1 (spin-2) channel. Qualitative comparisons with previous studies of the $N$-$J/\psi$ and $N$-$\Omega_{\rm{sss}}$ systems at $m_\pi \simeq 146$ MeV are provided, emphasizing the role of heavy-hadron chromo-polarizability arising from soft-gluon exchange between the nucleon and flavor-singlet hadrons. The charm quark mass dependence of the $N$-$\Omega_{\rm ccc}$ potential is investigated as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The latest observational data of Planck satellite shows nontrivial value of polarization rotation angle caused by cosmic birefringence in the early universe. Moreover, the asymmetry of baryons versus anti-baryons still remains mysterious. Both of them indicates that there should be hidden new physics such as fundamental symmetry breaking. In this paper, we try to interpret these two events in framework of nonmetricity modified gravity. We introduce an interaction term between nonmetricity-based function and matter current, and calculate both the rotation angle and baryon-to-photon ratio. We also constrain the model parameters using the current observational data. With some specific examples, we demonstrate that in nonmetricity gravity theory, these two events can be interpreted in a unified way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex-valued Feynman integrals in the imaginary time formalism and zero-temperature limit suffer from particular types of infrared divergences that can not be regulated by integration dimension alone. Related problems leading to integration order dependent results are even further pronounced in the presence of additional scales such as external momenta. This plays a noticeable role in systems featuring fermionic degrees of freedom such as cold Quantum Chromodynamics, where loop integrals are complexified by chemical potential(s). Working in the limit of vanishing temperature, we utilize novel complex-valued extensions to bubble Feynman integrals and study momentum expansions of fermionic loop integrals. The expansions are then used to illustrate the mechanisms of manifested discrepancies between orders of integration, associated with the residue theorem. Finally, we address the issues by introducing a representation avoiding the observed ambiguity and briefly overview classes of integrals insensitive to problems from external momenta.</description>

      <title>On frequentist confidence intervals in a non-Gaussian regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study frequentist confidence intervals based on graphical profile likelihoods (Wilks' theorem, likelihood integration), and the Feldman-Cousins (FC) prescription, a generalisation of the Neyman belt construction, in a setting with non-Gaussian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) posteriors. Our simplified setting allows us to recycle the MCMC chain as an input in all methods, including mock simulations underlying the FC approach. We find all methods agree to within $10 \%$ in the close to Gaussian regime, but extending methods beyond their regime of validity leads to greater discrepancies. Importantly, we recover a $\sim 2 \sigma$ shift in cosmological parameters between low and high redshift cosmic chronometer data with the FC method, but only when one fits all parameters back to the mocks. We observe that fixing parameters, a common approach in the literature, risks underestimating confidence intervals.</description>

      <title>Scalar-induced gravitational waves with non-Gaussianity up to all orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) are ubiquitous in many early-Universe processes accompanied by non-Gaussianity; hence, precise calculations of SIGWs involve a full understanding of non-Gaussianity. In this Letter, we propose to use the lattice simulations to directly calculate the energy density spectra of SIGWs with non-Gaussianity up to all orders. Our proposal has been first verified to match the existing semi-analytical results with non-Gaussianity, and then applied to more general cases, including high-order primordial non-Gaussianities, the logarithmic dependence in curvature perturbations, the curvaton model, and the ultra slow-roll model. We find that even a modest non-Gaussianity can significantly alter ultraviolet behaviors in SIGW spectra, necessitating special cautions in future detections as well as mutual constraints on/from primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Oscillating nuclear charge radii as sensors for ultralight dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that coupling of ultralight dark matter (UDM) to quarks and gluons would lead to an oscillation of the nuclear charge radius for both the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) axion and scalar dark matter. Consequently, the resulting oscillation of electronic energy levels could be resolved with optical atomic clocks, and their comparisons can be used to investigate UDM-nuclear couplings, which were previously only accessible with other platforms. We demonstrate this idea using the ${}^2S_{1/2} (F=0)\leftrightarrow {}^2F_{7/2} (F=3)$ electric octupole and ${}^2S_{1/2} (F=0)\leftrightarrow \,{}^2D_{3/2} (F=2)$ electric quadrupole transitions in ${}^{171}Yb^+$. Based on the derived sensitivity coefficients for these two transitions and a long-term comparison of their frequencies using a single trapped ${}^{171}Yb^+$ ion, we find bounds on the scalar UDM-nuclear couplings and the QCD axion decay constant. These results are at a similar level compared to the tightest spectroscopic limits, and future investigations, also with other optical clocks, promise significant improvements.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Masses and Mixing in an Axion Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework that simultaneously addresses three critical issues: tiny neutrino masses and their mixing patterns, dark matter, and the strong CP problem. Our model extends the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry by incorporating modular $S_3$ symmetry, which plays a central role in explaining the observed neutrino mixing structure. The field content includes two vector-like colored fermions and three colored scalars as $S_3$ singlets, an isospin doublet inert scalar and a singlet PQ scalar, each assigned appropriate modular weights. We show that such an extension, together with a suitable assignment of modular weights to the fields, can lead to holomorphic modular forms of Yukawa interactions, which can be derived from a superpotential. Furthermore, we explore an extension of the model to include non-holomorphic Yukawa interactions in the non-supersymmetric framework and show that the results are distinct from the holomorphic case. Tiny neutrino masses are generated radiatively through colored mediators, while the KSVZ-type axion appears to dynamically resolve the strong CP problem. We investigate the phenomenology of lepton flavor violation and the muon $g-2$ anomaly within this framework. Additionally, we explore the axion's properties and its role as dark matter.</description>

      <title>Axion Icebergs: Clockwork ALPs at hadron colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scenarios with multiple pseudoscalars are interesting as they usually tend to provide a framework to naturally realize a light axion with a large decay constant which has rich applications in cosmology, especially in the context of inflation and light dark matter physics. On the other hand, from a particle physics perspective, this facilitates a solution to the strong CP problem with a low Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking scale. One such realization is afforded within the framework of the clockwork mechanism where the axion can have suppressed couplings with the gluons or photons while its companion axion-like particles (ALPs) have relatively unsuppressed couplings, thereby facilitating detectability. We study a minimal clockwork model for the QCD axion invoking a KSVZ-like setup and examine the visibility of its unique multi-ALP $(a_n)$ signature at the LHC, the most sensitive channel being $p p \to a_n \, (+ \, {\rm additional \, jets})$ followed by $a_n \to \gamma \gamma$. In congruence with the astrophysical and cosmological bounds for the axion, a striking feature emerges for the case of light ALPs $(m \sim \mathcal{O}(10 \, {\rm GeV}))$ wherein the mass-splittings among the former are so small that the signal profile mimics that of a single broad resonance, or an $axion$ $iceberg$. The scenario is found to be imminently testable by the end of LHC's Run 3 phase for an integrated luminosity of $\sim 300 {\rm \, fb^{-1}}$. A larger average ALP mass, on the other hand, results in multiple closely-spaced peaks with a characteristic signal profile, and would be expected to be seen at the forthcoming HL-LHC. Possible additional signals are also listed.</description>

      <title>Periodic Cosmic String Formation and Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study string formation and dynamics in a scalar field theory with a global $U(1)$ symmetry. If a scalar field $\Phi$ is initially displaced from the minimum of a wine-bottle potential, even if uniformly over large spatial patches, small spatial perturbations to $\Phi$ grow via parametric resonance as $\Phi$ oscillates; this occurs for a wide range of initial $U(1)$ charge densities. The growth of perturbations leads to the formation of spatially coherent, temporally stable "counter-rotating regions" (CRR): spatially connected regions exhibiting $\Phi$ evolution with large, opposite-sign rotation speeds in field space which persist over long durations. These CRR are separated by domain boundaries that have a large field gradient and zero rotational speed in field space. String or vortex topological defects form, are confined to, and then annihilate periodically on these boundaries. We demonstrate these periodic dynamics with numerical simulations in both 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions, in both Minkowski spacetime and in a radiation-dominated FLRW universe, and we explain some features of the evolution (semi-)analytically. At late times in an expanding universe, when $\Phi$ approaches the potential minimum, the CRR and vortices dissipate into scalar radiation. Phenomenologically, periodic bursts of string formation and annihilation can lead to periodic bursts of gravitational-wave production. For small initial $U(1)$ charge density, these gravitational-wave bursts can be synchronized across the whole Universe. Owing to their periodic nature, they could give rise to a gravitational-wave frequency spectrum consisting of a forest of peaks. These periodic scalar field dynamics also occur with large, untuned initial $U(1)$ charge density; they may thus have implications for models that depend on a coherent field rotation, such as kination and the axion kinetic-misalignment mechanism.

      <title>Inflationary Gravitational Waves and Laboratory Searches as Complementary Probes of Right-handed Neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15374v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the damping of inflationary gravitational waves (GW) that re-enter the Hubble horizon before or during a post-inflationary era dominated by a meta-stable, right-handed neutrino (RHN), whose out-of-equilibrium decay releases entropy. Within a minimal type-I seesaw extension of the Standard Model (SM), we explore the conditions under which the population of thermally produced RHNs remain long-lived and cause a period of matter-domination. We find that the suppression of the GW spectrum occurs above a characteristic frequency determined by the RHN mass and active-sterile mixing. For RHN masses in the range $0.1$-$10$ GeV and mixing $10^{-12} \lesssim |V_{eN}|^2 \lesssim 10^{-5}$, we estimate such characteristic frequencies and the signal-to-noise ratio to assess the detection prospects in GW observatories such as THEIA, $\mu$-ARES, LISA, BBO and ET. Additionally we use LIGO data to put upper bounds on the reheating temperature after inflation, for a given blue-tilted GW spectrum. We find complementarity between GW signals and laboratory searches in SHiP, DUNE and LEGEND-1000. Notably, RHN masses of $0.2$-$2$ GeV and mixing $10^{-10} \lesssim |V_{eN}|^2 \lesssim 10^{-7}$ are testable in both laboratory experiments and GW observations. Additionally, GW experiments can probe the canonical seesaw regime of light neutrino mass generation, a region largely inaccessible to laboratory searches.</description>

      <title>Kinetically Modified Palatini Inflation Meets ACT Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23243v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the coexistence of a non-minimal coupling to gravity $f_{\mathcal{R}}=1+c{\mathcal{R}} \phi^{n/2}$ with a kinetic mixing of the form $f_K = f_{\mathcal{R}}^m$ -- where $n=2$ and 4 and $0.5 \le m \le 10$ -- reconciles chaotic inflation based on the $\phi^n$ potential with the recent ACT results, if we adopt the Palatini formulation of gravity. The attainment of inflation allows for subplanckian inflaton values and energy scales below the cut-off scale of the corresponding effective theory. The model can be also embedded in supergravity by introducing two chiral superfields and a monomial superpotential, linear with respect to the inflaton-accompanying field. Its stabilization is achieved thanks to a compact contribution to the Kaehler potential, whose the inflationary part includes an holomorphic logarithmic term and a real one multiplying a shift-symmetric quadratic polynomial term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We point out that a QCD-like dark sector can be coupled to the Standard Model by gauging the topological Skyrme current, which measures the dark baryon number in the infrared, to give a technically natural model for dark matter. This coupling allows for a semi-annihilation process $\chi \chi \rightarrow \chi X_\mu$, where $X_\mu$ is the gauge boson mediator and $\chi$ a dark pion field, which plays the dominant role in setting the dark matter relic abundance. The topological interaction is purely $p$-wave and so free from indirect detection constraints. We show that the dark matter pion mass needs to be in the range $10$ MeV $\lesssim m_\chi \lesssim$ $1$ TeV; towards the lighter end of this range, there can moreover be significant self-interactions. We discuss prospects for probing this scenario at collider experiments, ranging from the LHC to low-energy $e^+ e^-$ colliders, future Higgs factories, and beam-dump experiments.</description>

      <title>Vector Boson Fusion Signatures of Superheavy Majorana Neutrinos at Muon Colliders</title>

Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity of future high-energy muon colliders to heavy Majorana neutrinos, considering both opposite-sign ($\mu^+\mu^-$) and same-sign ($\mu^+\mu^+$) collision modes. We focus on $\mu^+\mu^-$ colliders operating at centre-of-mass energies of 1, 3 and 10 TeV, as well as the proposed $\mu$TRISTAN facility at 2 TeV, and we analyse the production of heavy neutrinos via vector boson fusion in the $t$-channel, a mechanism that becomes dominant in the multi-TeV regime. We evaluate its exclusion potential in terms of the heavy neutrino mass and the mixing of the heavy neutrino with its Standard Model counterparts, using both cut-based selections and boosted decision trees trained to exploit the distinct kinematic signatures of heavy Majorana neutrino exchanges. Our results demonstrate the complementarity between collider configurations, and show that active-sterile mixing angles as small as 0.001 could be probed for neutrino masses up to 100 TeV, an experimentally inaccessible region of the parameter space at current facilities. Altogether, this work establishes the discovery potential of muon colliders for testing super-heavy Majorana neutrinos, complementary to conventional probes, and provides compelling motivation for the next generation of high-energy lepton colliders.</description>

      <title>Light PIDM in Warped Extra Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional Planckian Interacting Dark Matter (PIDM), which interacts exclusively through gravity, typically requires heavy DM candidates (with mass $10^3-10^{15}$ GeV) and very high reheating temperature ($T_{\rm rh}\gtrsim 10^{15}$ GeV). In this article, we explore a novel realization of PIDM in warped five-dimensions, consisting of an "Ultra Violet"$-$"Dark"$-$"Infra Red" (UV-DB-IR) brane setup, where the DM can be a Dark brane composite light state with mass 1 MeV $-$ 1 TeV. The DM sector is assumed to interact solely via gravity in five-dimensions. After orbifolding and performing a Kaluza-Klein (KK) decomposition, the DM is assumed to be localized onto the DB, which is positioned in the extra-dimension such that the DM interacts with both the massless graviton and its massive KK excitations, with suppressed couplings to remain consistent with the ethos of the PIDM framework. The light (heavy) Standard Model matter is assumed to be localized near UV (IR) branes for the geometric Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism, while their KK modes are localized close to the IR brane. We show that this construction allows for a viable and efficient freeze-in production mechanism for light composite PIDM, consistent with TeV-scale reheating temperature.</description>

      <title>ACT-Inspired Kaehler-Based Inflationary Attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new class of cosmological attractors which are compatible with the recent ACT results. They are based on two types of fractional Kaehler potentials, K, for a gauge-singlet inflaton phi which reduce, along the inflationary path, to the form N/(1-phi^qM)^p with qM=1, 2 and 0.1&lt; p&lt;10. The combination of these K's with the chaotic potentials phi^n (where n=2, 4) within a non-linear sigma model leads to inflationary observables which are consistent with the current data and largely independent from qM and n. Endowing these K's with a shift symmetry we also offer a supergravity realization of our models introducing two chiral superfields and a monomial superpotential, linear with respect to the inflaton-accompanying field. The attainment of inflation with subplanckian inflaton values and the large values for the tensor-to-scalar ratio, which increases with N, are two additional attractive features of our proposal.</description>

      <title>Bias with a Timer: Axion Domain Wall Decay and Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the interplay of the post-inflationary QCD axion and a light scalar field for the axion domain wall decay and dark matter (DM). The scalar field possesses a nonzero vacuum expectation value (VEV) during inflation, so that its interaction with the axion effectively serves as an explicit Peccei-Quinn (PQ) violating term. At a temperature below the PQ phase transition, the effective PQ violating interaction generates the axion potential which generally contains multiple degenerate vacua leading to the formation of the axion string-domain wall networks. The following QCD phase transition provides another contribution to the axion potential making domain walls decay before they dominate the Universe. Later, the scalar field starts to relax to the minimum of its potential with a vanishing VEV, turning off the effective PQ violating interaction so that the axion potential is aligned with the QCD vacuum. We keep track of the evolution of the axion-scalar system and discuss the production of the axion DM through the domain wall decay and the (trapped) misalignment. We find that the string-wall network in some cases can decay due to its structural instability, rather than the volume pressure, and the correct axion DM abundance is realized with the decay constant larger than that of the conventional post-inflationary QCD axion without fine tuning.</description>

      <title>Multijet topology in high-energy nuclear collisions: jet broadening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04649v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents the first theoretical investigation of the medium modification of jet broadening as an event-shape observable in multijet final states due to jet quenching in high-energy nuclear collisions. The partonic spectrum of $pp$ collisions with next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV is provided by the POWHEG$+$PYTHIA8 event generator, while the linear Boltzmann transport (LBT) model is utilized to investigate the energy loss of fast partons as they traverse through the hot and dense QCD medium. We present the jet broadening distributions in multijet final states for both $pp$ and PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV, then observe an enhancement at the small jet broadening region and suppression at the large jet broadening region in PbPb collisions relative to that in $pp$. This suggests that medium modification with parton energy loss in the QGP leads to a more concentrated energy flow in all observed multijet events in PbPb reactions. We also demonstrate that the intertwining of two effects, the jet number reduction and the restructured contribution, results in the novel behavior of nuclear modification of the jet broadening observable in PbPb collisions.</description>

      <title>Flavor Equilibration of Supernova Neutrinos: Exploring the Dynamics of Slow Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos experience collective flavor conversion in extreme astrophysical environments such as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). One manifestation of collective conversion is slow flavor conversion (SFC), which has recently attracted renewed interest owing to its ubiquity across different regions of the supernova environment. In this study, we systematically examine the evolution of kinematic decoherence in a dense neutrino gas undergoing SFC, considering lepton number asymmetries as large as $30\%$. Our findings show that the neutrino gas asymptotically evolves toward a generic state of coarse-grained flavor equilibration which is constrained by approximate lepton number conservation. The equilibration occurs within a few factors of the inverse vacuum oscillation frequency, $\omega^{-1}$, which corresponds to (anti)neutrinos reaching near flavor equipartition after a few kilometers for typical supernova neutrino energies. Notably, the quasi-steady state of the neutrino number densities can be quantitatively described by the neutrino-antineutrino number density ratio $n_{\bar{\nu}_e}/n_{\nu_e}$ alone. Such a simple estimation opens new opportunities for incorporating SFC into CCSN simulations, particularly in regions where SFC develops on scales much shorter than those of collisions.</description>

      <title>A general Fourier expansion of post-Newtonian binary dynamics based on quasi-Keplerian framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have introduced a new Fourier-expansion technique for computing gravitational-wave emission from non-spinning binaries in the post-Newtonian framework. Using this approach, we derived the full set of 3PN dynamical quantities and gravitational-wave Fourier modes and have released the corresponding numerical code as open source. Furthermore, applying the method to the tail contribution of the energy flux, we found that it can be resummed into an exceptionally compact expression. These advances pave the way for more convenient and accurate frequency-domain waveform modeling in the future.</description>
