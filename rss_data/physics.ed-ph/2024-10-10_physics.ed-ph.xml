      <title>Extending the European Competence Framework for Quantum Technologies: new proficiency triangle and qualification profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing industrial relevance of quantum technologies (QTs), a new quantum workforce with special qualification will be needed. Building this workforce requires educational efforts, from short-term training to degree programs. In order to plan, map and compare such efforts, personal qualifications or job requirements, standardization is necessary. The European Competence Framework for Quantum Technologies (CFQT) provides a common language for QT education. The 2024 update to version 2.5 extends it with the new proficiency triangle and qualification profiles: The proficiency triangle proposes six proficiency levels for three proficiency areas, specifying knowledge and skills for each level. Nine qualification profiles show prototypical qualifications or job roles relevant to the quantum industry with the required proficiency, examples, and suggestions. This is an important step towards the standardization of QT education. The CFQT update is based on the results of an analysis of 34 interviews on industry needs. The initial findings from the interviews were complemented by iterative refinement and expert consultation, as well as by ML-driven analysis and mapping of job posts, revealing recommendations for formulating job posts.</description>

      <title>Reformulation of Classical Thermodynamics from Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a reformulation of classical equilibrium thermodynamics by replacing the obscure and ambiguous concept of entropy with the clear and intuitive concept of information stored in a thermodynamic system. Specifically, we rewrite the laws of thermodynamics in the mathematical terminology borrowed from information theory with an emphasis on information instead of entropy and on binary logarithm instead of natural one. We also define a modified ideal gas constant denoted as $\mathcal{R}$ that quantifies the energy cost of storing or retrieving a mole of information. Moreover an application to the ideal gas is carried and new insight on the evolution of the system is acquired. This new formulation might serve as a basis to teaching thermodynamics, where one deals with the concept of energy and information both stored in a thermodynamic system and avoids the lack of cognitive representations inherent in the concept of entropy.</description>

      <title>On cat-human interaction from the viewpoint of physics: an equation of motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides an enjoyable example through which several concepts of classical mechanics can be understood. We introduce an equation that models the motion of a cat in the presence of a person. The cat is considered as a point particle moving in a potential induced by the person. We demonstrate that this approach to the problem reproduces characteristic behaviors of these curious animals. For instance, the fact that cats do not typically come when they are called, or that they remain longer on the lap of their favorite person; even "zoomies" are reproduced (cats randomly run back and forth across the house). We use this model problem to explore topics of current research such as stochastic equations and periodically driven systems. The pedagogical value of this work and its potential use in teaching are discussed.</description>
