      <title>A pH Sensor Scaffold for Mapping Spatiotemporal Gradients in Three Dimensional In Vitro Tumour Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of extracellular pH at single cell resolution is challenging and requires advanced sensibility. Sensing pH at a high spatial and temporal resolution might provide crucial information in understanding the role of pH and its fluctuations in a wide range of physio-pathological cellular processes, including cancer. Here, a method to embed silica-based fluorescent pH sensors into alginate-based three-dimensional (3D) microgels tumour models, coupled with a computational method for fine data analysis, is presented. By means of confocal laser scanning microscopy, live-cell time-lapse imaging of 3D alginate microgels was performed and the extracellular pH metabolic variations were monitored in both in vitro 3D mono- and 3D co-cultures of tumour and stromal pancreatic cells. The results show that the extracellular pH is cell line-specific and time-dependent. Moreover, differences in pH were also detected between 3D monocultures versus 3D co-cultures, thus suggesting the existence of a metabolic crosstalk between tumour and stromal cells. In conclusion, the system has the potential to image multiple live cells types in a 3D environment and to decipher in real-time their pH metabolic interplay under controlled experimental conditions, thus being also a suitable platform for drug screening and personalized medicine.</description>

      <title>Transcription factor clusters as information transfer agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deciphering how genes interpret information from the concentration of transcription factors (TFs) within the cell nucleus remains a fundamental question in gene regulation. Recent advancements have unveiled the heterogeneous distribution of TF molecules in the nucleus, posing challenges to the precise decoding of concentration signals. To explore this phenomenon, we employ high-resolution single-cell imaging of a fluorescently tagged TF protein, Bicoid, in living fly embryos. We show that accumulation of Bicoid in submicron clusters preserves the spatial information of the maternal Bicoid gradient, and that cluster intensity, size, and frequency offer remarkably precise spatial cues. We further discover that various known gene targets of Bicoid activation colocalize with clusters and that for the target gene Hunchback, this colocalization is dependent on its enhancer binding affinity. Modeling information transfer through these clusters suggests that clustering offers a more rapid sensing mechanism for global nuclear concentrations than freely diffusing TF molecules detected by simple enhancers.</description>

      <title>Collective self-caging of active filaments in virtual confinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motility coupled to responsive behavior is essential for many microorganisms to seek and establish appropriate habitats. One of the simplest possible responses, reversing the direction of motion, is believed to enable filamentous cyanobacteria to form stable aggregates or accumulate in suitable light conditions. Here, we demonstrate that filamentous morphology in combination with responding to light gradients by reversals has consequences far beyond simple accumulation: Entangled aggregates form at the boundaries of illuminated regions, harnessing the boundary to establish local order. We explore how the light pattern, in particular its boundary curvature, impacts aggregation. A minimal mechanistic model of active flexible filaments resembles the experimental findings, thereby revealing the emergent and generic character of these structures. This phenomenon may enable elongated microorganisms to generate adaptive colony architectures in limited habitats, or guide the assembly of biomimetic fibrous materials.</description>

Abstract: From microscopic fungi to colossal whales, fluidic ejections are a universal and intricate phenomenon in biology, serving vital functions such as animal excretion, venom spraying, prey hunting, spore dispersal, and plant guttation. This review delves into the complex fluid physics of ejections across various scales, exploring both muscle-powered active systems and passive mechanisms driven by gravity or osmosis. We introduce a framework using dimensionless numbers to delineate transitions from dripping to jetting and elucidate the governing forces. Highlighting the understudied area of complex fluid ejections, this work not only rationalizes the biophysics involved but also uncovers potential engineering applications in soft robotics, additive manufacturing, and drug delivery. By bridging biomechanics, the physics of living systems, and fluid dynamics, this review offers valuable insights into the diverse world of fluid ejections and paves the way for future bioinspired research across the spectrum of life.</description>

Abstract: The tumor microenvironment (TME) features distinct hallmarks, including acidosis, hypoxia, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and altered ion fluxes, which are crucial targets for early cancer biomarker detection, tumor diagnosis, and therapeutic strategies. A variety of imaging and sensing techniques have been developed and employed in both research and clinical settings to visualize and monitor cellular and TME dynamics. Among these, ratiometric fluorescence-based sensors have emerged as powerful analytical tools, providing precise and sensitive insights into the TME and enabling real-time detection and tracking of dynamic changes. In this comprehensive review, we discuss the latest advancements in ratiometric fluorescent probes designed for optical mapping of pH, oxygen, ROS, ions, and biomarkers within the TME. We elucidate their structural designs and sensing mechanisms, as well as their applications in in vitro and in vivo detection. Furthermore, we explore integrated sensing platforms that reveal the spatiotemporal behavior of complex tumor cultures, highlighting the potential of high-resolution imaging techniques combined with computational methods. This review aims to provide a solid foundation for understanding the current state of the art and the future potential of fluorescent nano- and microparticles in the field of cellular microenvironment sensing.</description>

      <title>Numerical studies of triangulated vesicles with anisotropic membrane inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we implement the deviatoric curvature model to examine dynamically triangulated surfaces with anisotropic membrane inclusions. The Monte-Carlo numerical scheme is devised to not only minimize the total bending energy of the membrane but also the in-plane nematic order of the inclusions by considering the mismatch between the curvature of the membrane and the intrinsic curvature of the inclusion. Neighboring inclusions can either attract with nearest-neighbor interaction or with a nematic interaction derived from liquid crystal theory. Orientational order determines whether vesicles fully covered with inclusions result in bulbs connected by necks or long tubes. Remarkably, when inclusions on vesicles with no vacancies interact non-nematically, a spontaneous local order can lead to a bulb transition which may have implications in cell or organelle division. Furthermore we find that average nematic order is inversely proportional to the number of thin necks formed in the vesicles. Our method shows good convergence and is suitable for further upgrades, for example to vesicles constrained by volume.</description>

      <title>A Miniaturized Device for Ultrafast On-demand Drug Release based on a Gigahertz Ultrasonic Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-demand controlled drug delivery is essential for the treatment of a wide range of chronic diseases. As the drug is released at the time when required, its efficacy is boosted and the side effects are minimized. However, so far, drug delivery devices often rely on the passive diffusion process for a sustained release, which is slow and uncontrollable. Here, we present a miniaturized microfluidic device for wirelessly controlled ultrafast active drug delivery, driven by an oscillating solid-liquid interface. The oscillation generates acoustic streaming in the drug reservoir, which opens an elastic valve to deliver the drug. High-speed microscopy reveals the fast response of the valve on the order of 1 ms, which is more than three orders of magnitude faster than the start-of-the-art. The amount of the released drug exhibits a linear relationship with the working time and the electric power applied to the ultrasonic resonator. The trigger of the release is wirelessly controlled via a magnetic field, and the system shows stable output in a continuous experiment for two weeks. The integrated system shows great promise as a long-term controlled drug delivery implant for chronic diseases.</description>

      <title>Topological balance of cell distributions in plane monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most of normal proliferative epithelia of plants and metazoans are topologically invariant and characterized by similar cell distributions according to the number of cell neighbors (DCNs). Here we study peculiarities of these distributions and explain why the DCN obtained from the location of intercellular boundaries and that based on the Voronoi tessellation with nodes located on cell nuclei may differ from each other. As we demonstrate, special microdomains where four or more intercellular boundaries converge are topologically charged. Using this fact, we deduce a new equation describing the topological balance of the DCNs. The developed theory is applied for a series of microphotographs of non-tumoral epithelial cells of the human cervix (HCerEpiC) to improve the image processing near the edges of microphotographs and reveal the topological invariance of the examined monolayers. Special contact microdomains may be present in epithelia of various natures, however, considering the well-known vertex model of epithelium, we show that such contacts are absent in the usual solid-like state of the model and appear only in the liquid-like cancer state. Also, we discuss a possible biological role of special contacts in context of proliferative epithelium dynamics and tissue morphogenesis.</description>

      <title>Correlating fluorescence microscopy, optical and magnetic tweezers to study single chiral biopolymers such as DNA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10087v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biopolymer topology is critical for determining interactions inside cell environments, exemplified by DNA where its response to mechanical perturbation is as important as biochemical properties to its cellular roles. The dynamic structures of chiral biopolymers exhibit complex dependence with extension and torsion, however the physical mechanisms underpinning the emergence of structural motifs upon physiological twisting and stretching are poorly understood due to technological limitations in correlating force, torque and spatial localization information. We present COMBI-Tweez (Combined Optical and Magnetic BIomolecule TWEEZers), a transformative tool that overcomes these challenges by integrating optical trapping, time-resolved electromagnetic tweezers, and fluorescence microscopy, demonstrated on single DNA molecules, that can controllably form and visualise higher order structural motifs including plectonemes. This technology combined with cutting-edge MD simulations provides quantitative insight into complex dynamic structures relevant to DNA cellular processes and can be adapted to study a range of filamentous biopolymers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simple method to compute the controllable set of chemical reaction systems with enzyme concentrations as the control parameters is presented. The method features the fact that the catalyst enhances the reaction rate while not changing the equilibrium, and it enables the efficient computation of the global controllability of linear- and nonlinear models. The method is applied to the reversible Brusselator and the toy model of cellular metabolism. With the metabolism model, we show that the stoichiometric rays is a powerful tool for quantifying the ``life-death boundary" of the cell model.</description>

      <title>An electromechanics-driven fluid dynamics model for the simulation of the whole human heart</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a multiphysics and geometric multiscale computational model, suitable to describe the hemodynamics of the whole human heart, driven by a four-chamber electromechanical model. We first present a study on the calibration of the biophysically detailed RDQ20 activation model (Regazzoni et al., 2020) that is able to reproduce the physiological range of hemodynamic biomarkers. Then, we demonstrate that the ability of the force generation model to reproduce certain microscale mechanisms, such as the dependence of force on fiber shortening velocity, is crucial to capture the overall physiological mechanical and fluid dynamics macroscale behavior. This motivates the need for using multiscale models with high biophysical fidelity, even when the outputs of interest are relative to the macroscale. We show that the use of a high-fidelity electromechanical model, combined with a detailed calibration process, allows us to achieve remarkable biophysical fidelity in terms of both mechanical and hemodynamic quantities. Indeed, our electromechanical-driven CFD simulations - carried out on an anatomically accurate geometry of the whole heart - provide results that match the cardiac physiology both qualitatively (in terms of flow patterns) and quantitatively (when comparing in silico results with biomarkers acquired in vivo). We consider the pathological case of left bundle branch block, and we investigate the consequences that an electrical abnormality has on cardiac hemodynamics thanks to our multiphysics integrated model. The computational model that we propose can faithfully predict a delay and an increasing wall shear stress in the left ventricle in the pathological condition. The interaction of different physical processes in an integrated framework allows us to faithfully describe and model this pathology, by capturing and reproducing the intrinsic multiphysics nature of the human heart.</description>

      <title>Unconstrained quantitative magnetization transfer imaging: disentangling T1 of the free and semi-solid spin pools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the inception of magnetization transfer (MT) imaging, it has been widely assumed that Henkelman's two spin pools have similar longitudinal relaxation times, which motivated many researchers to constrain them to each other. However, several recent publications reported a $T_1^s$ of the semi-solid spin pool that is much shorter than $T_1^f$ of the free pool. While these studies tailored experiments for robust proofs-of-concept, we here aim to quantify the disentangled relaxation processes on a voxel-by-voxel basis in a clinical imaging setting, i.e., with an effective resolution of 1.24mm isotropic and full brain coverage in 12min. To this end, we optimized a hybrid-state pulse sequence for mapping the parameters of an unconstrained MT model. We scanned four people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) and four healthy controls with this pulse sequence and estimated $T_1^f \approx 1.84$s and $T_1^s \approx 0.34$s in healthy white matter. Our results confirm the reports that $T_1^s \ll T_1^f$ and we argue that this finding identifies MT as an inherent driver of longitudinal relaxation in brain tissue. Moreover, we estimated a fractional size of the semi-solid spin pool of $m_0^s \approx 0.212$, which is larger than previously assumed. An analysis of $T_1^f$ in normal-appearing white matter revealed statistically significant differences between individuals with MS and controls.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08820v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many physical or biological systems, diffusion can be described by Brownian motions with stochastic diffusion coefficients (DCs). In the present study, we investigate properties of the diffusion with a broad class of stochastic DCs with a novel approach. We show that for a finite time, the propagator is non-Gaussian and heavy-tailed. This means that when the mean square displacements are the same, for a finite time, some of the diffusing particles with stochastic DCs diffuse farther than the particles with deterministic DCs or exhibiting a fractional Brownian motion. We also show that when a stochastic DC is ergodic, the propagator converges to a Gaussian distribution in the long time limit. The speed of convergence is determined by the autocovariance function of the DC.</description>

Abstract: Self-propelled micron-size particles suspended in a fluid, like bacteria or synthetic microswimmers, are strongly non-equilibrium systems where particle motility breaks the microscopic detailed balance, often resulting in large-scale collective motion. Previous theoretical work has identified long-range hydrodynamic interactions as the main driver of collective motion in unbounded dilute suspension of rear-actuated ("pusher") microswimmers. In contrast, most experimental studies of collective motion in microswimmer suspensions have been carried out in quasi-2-dimensional geometries such as in thin films or near solid or fluid interfaces, where both the swimmers' motion and their long-range flow fields become altered due to the proximity of a boundary. Here, we study numerically a minimal model of microswimmers in such a restricted geometry, where the particles move in the midplane between two no-slip walls. For pushers, we demonstrate collective motion with only short-ranged order, in contrast with the long-ranged flows observed in unbounded systems. For front-actuated ("puller") microswimmers, we discover a long-wavelength density instability resulting in the formation of dense microswimmer clusters. Both types of collective motion are fundamentally different from their previously studied counterparts in unbounded domains. Our results illustrate that hydrodynamic screening due to the presence of a wall is subdominant in determining the collective state of the suspension, which is instead dictated by the geometrical restriction of the swimmers' motion.</description>

      <title>The Larmor frequency shift of a white matter magnetic microstructure model with multiple sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00086v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic susceptibility imaging may provide valuable information about chemical composition and microstructural organization of tissue. However, its estimation from the MRI signal phase is particularly difficult as it is sensitive to magnetic tissue properties ranging from the molecular to macroscopic scale. The MRI Larmor frequency shift measured in white matter (WM) tissue depends on the myelinated axons and other magnetizable sources such as iron-filled ferritin. We have previously derived the Larmor frequency shift arising from a dense media of cylinders with scalar susceptibility and arbitrary orientation dispersion. Here we extend our model to include microscopic WM susceptibility anisotropy as well as spherical inclusions with scalar susceptibility to represent subcellular structures, biologically stored iron etc. We validate our analytical results with computer simulations and investigate the feasibility of estimating susceptibility using simple iterative linear least squares without regularization or preconditioning. This is done in a digital brain phantom synthesized from diffusion MRI (dMRI) measurements of an ex vivo mouse brain at ultra-high field.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we address the challenge of analyzing electrophysiological measurements in neuronal networks. Our computational model, based on the Reservoir Computing Network (RCN) architecture, deciphers spatio-temporal data obtained from electrophysiological measurements of neuronal cultures. By reconstructing the network structure on a macroscopic scale, we reveal the connectivity between neuronal units. Notably, our model outperforms common methods like Cross-Correlation and Transfer-Entropy in predicting the network's connectivity map. Furthermore, we experimentally validate its ability to forecast network responses to specific inputs, including localized optogenetic stimuli.</description>
