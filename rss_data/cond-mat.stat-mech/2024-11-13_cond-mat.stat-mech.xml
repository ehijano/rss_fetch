      <title>Wetting, Algebraic Curves and Conformal Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies of wetting in a two-component square-gradient model of interfaces in a fluid mixture, showing three-phase bulk coexistence, have revealed some highly surprising features. Numerical results show that the density profile paths, which form a tricuspid shape in the density plane, have curious geometric properties, while conjectures for the analytical form of the surface tensions imply that nonwetting may persist up to the critical end points, contrary to the usual expectation of critical point wetting. Here, we solve the model exactly and show that the profile paths are conformally invariant quartic algebraic curves that change genus at the wetting transition. Being harmonic, the profile paths can be represented by an analytic function in the complex plane which then conformally maps the paths onto straight lines. Using this, we derive the conjectured form of the surface tensions and explain the geometrical properties of the tricuspid and its relation to the Neumann triangle for the contact angles. The exact solution confirms that critical point wetting is absent in this square-gradient model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the law of entropy non-decrease directly from Kelvin principle for simple and compound systems without using Clausius inequality.A key of the derivation is a formulation of entropy utilizing a Carnot machine, which is equivalent to Clausius entropy based on heat and Gyftopoulos-Beretta entropy based on work.</description>

      <title>Entropy production along a deterministic motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a stochastic dynamics to be associated to a deterministic motion defined by a set of first order differential equation. The transitions that defined the stochastic dynamics are unidirectional and the rates are equal to the absolute value of the velocity vector field associate to the deterministic motion. From the stochastic dynamics we determine the entropy production and the entropy flux. This last quantity is found to be the negative of the divergence of the velocity vector field. In the case of a Hamiltonian dynamics it vanishes identically.</description>

      <title>Temperature-driven flows in nanochannels: Theory and Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motion of a fluid induced by thermal gradients in the absence of driving forces is known as thermo-osmosis. The physical explanation of this phenomenon stems from the emergence of gradients in the tangential pressure due to the presence of a confining surface. The microscopic origin of the effect was recently elucidated in the framework of linear response theory. Here, by use of conservation laws, we provide an explicit solution of the equations governing the fluid flow at stationarity in slab geometry, expressing the thermo-osmotic coefficient as the integrated mass current-heat current correlation function (which vanishes in the bulk). A very simple expression for the pressure gradient in terms of equilibrium properties is also derived. To test the theoretical predictions in a controlled setting, we performed extensive nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations in two dimensions. Few simple models of wall-particle interactions are examined and the resulting pressure drop and velocity profile are compared with the theoretical predictions both in the liquid and in the gas regime.</description>

      <title>Microscopic fluctuations in the spreading fronts of circular wetting liquid droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study numerically the kinetic roughening properties of the precursor fronts of nonvolatile liquid droplets spreading on solid substrates, for the case of circular droplets, more frequently addressed in experiments. To this end, we perform kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations of a lattice gas model whose kinetic roughening behavior has been recently assessed in a band geometry [J.\ M.\ Marcos {\em et al.}, Phys.\ Rev.\ E {\bf 105}, 054801 (2022)]. We compare the scaling behaviors of the spreading fronts obtained for the two geometries, in view of the occurrence of, for example, different universality subclasses for different growth geometries for the related important Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. For circular droplets we obtain that the average front position increases (sub-)diffusively as $R\sim t^{\delta}$, where $\delta \lesssim 1/2$ shows a stronger dependence on the conditions considered for temperature and substrate wettability than in band geometry. In spite of this, front fluctuations for circular droplets behave qualitatively similar to those seen for band geometries, with kinetic roughening exponent values which similarly depend on temperature $T$ but become $T$-independent for sufficiently high $T$. Circular droplets also display intrinsic anomalous scaling with different values of the roughness exponent at short and large length scales, and fluctuations statistics which are close to the Tracy-Widom probability distribution function that applies in the corresponding KPZ universality subclass, now the one expected for interfaces with an overall circular symmetry.</description>

      <title>Integrable fishnet circuits and Brownian solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce classical many-body dynamics on a one-dimensional lattice comprising local two-body maps arranged on discrete space-time mesh that serve as discretizations of Hamiltonian dynamics with arbitrarily time-varying coupling constants. Time evolution is generated by passing an auxiliary degree of freedom along the lattice, resulting in a `fishnet' circuit structure. We construct integrable circuits consisting of Yang-Baxter maps and demonstrate their general properties, using the Toda and anisotropic Landau-Lifschitz models as examples. Upon stochastically rescaling time, the dynamics is dominated by fluctuations and we observe solitons undergoing Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Chaos in Time: A Dissipative Continuous Quasi Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While a generic open quantum system decays to its steady state, continuous time crystals (CTCs) develop spontaneous oscillation and never converge to a stationary state. Just as crystals develop correlations in space, CTCs do so in time. Here, we introduce a Continuous Quasi Time Crystals (CQTC). Despite being characterized by the presence of non-decaying oscillations, this phase does not retain its long-range order, making it the time analogous of quasi-crystal structures. We investigate the emergence of this phase in a system made of two coupled collective spin sub-systems, each developing a CTC phase upon the action of a strong enough drive. The addition of a coupling enables the emergence of different synchronized phases, where both sub-systems oscillate at the same frequency. In the transition between different CTC orders, the system develops chaotic dynamics with aperiodic oscillations. These chaotic features differ from those of closed quantum systems, as the dynamics is not characterized by a unitary evolution. At the same time, the presence of non-decaying oscillations makes this phenomenon distinct from other form of chaos in open quantum system, where the system decays instead. We investigate the connection between chaos and this quasi-crystalline phase using mean-field techniques, and we confirm these results including quantum fluctuations at the lowest order.</description>

      <title>Two-stage relaxation of operators through domain wall and magnon dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The out-of-time ordered correlator (OTOC) has become a popular probe for quantum information spreading and thermalization. In systems with local interactions, the OTOC defines a characteristic butterfly lightcone that separates a regime not yet disturbed by chaos from one where time-evolved operators and the OTOC approach their equilibrium value. This relaxation has been shown to proceed in two stages, with the first stage exhibiting an extensive timescale and a decay rate slower than the gap of the transfer matrix -- known as the ``phantom eigenvalue". In this work, we investigate the two-stage relaxation of the OTOC towards its equilibrium value in various local quantum circuits. We apply a systematic framework based on an emergent statistical model, where the dynamics of two single-particle modes -- a domain wall and a magnon -- govern the decay rates. Specifically, a configuration with coexisting domain wall and magnon modes generates the phantom rate in the first stage, and competition between these modes determines the second stage. We also examine this relaxation within the operator cluster picture. The magnon modes translates into a bound state of clusters and domain wall into a random operator, giving consistent rates. Finally, we extend our findings from random in time circuits to a broad class of Floquet models.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Long-Range Forces in Light Harvesting Proteins: Pivotal Roles of Temperature and Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrodynamic interactions between biomolecules are of potential biological interest for signaling warranting investigation of their activation through various mechanisms in living systems. Here, using as model system a light harvesting protein within the phycobilisome antenna system of red algae, we proved that not only light exposure but also thermal energy alone can trigger attractive electrodynamic interactions up to hundreds of nanometer. The latter are sustained by low frequency collective modes and while the second mode appears only upon illumination, the fundamental one can be activated by temperature alone. Activation of such collective modes and ED interactions might influence conformational rearrangements and energy transport within the phycobilisome antenna system. This is a paradigm-shift that underscores the immense potential of biological systems in exploiting different forms of input energy to achieve optimal energy transfer.</description>

      <title>Subtle Nuances between Quantum and Classical regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the semiclassical limit of an integrable-chaotic bosonic many-body quantum system, providing nuanced insights into its behavior. We examine classical-quantum correspondences across different interaction regimes of bosons in a triple-well potential, ranging from the integrable to the self-trapping regime, and including the chaotic one. The close resemblance between the phase-space mean projections of classical trajectories and those of Husimi distributions evokes the Principle of Uniform Semiclassical Condensation (PUSC) of Wigner functions of eigenstates. Notably, the resulting figures also exhibit patterns reminiscent of Jason Gallas's "shrimp" shapes.</description>

      <title>Firing Rate Models as Associative Memory: Excitatory-Inhibitory Balance for Robust Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Firing rate models are dynamical systems widely used in applied and theoretical neuroscience to describe local cortical dynamics in neuronal populations. By providing a macroscopic perspective of neuronal activity, these models are essential for investigating oscillatory phenomena, chaotic behavior, and associative memory processes. Despite their widespread use, the application of firing rate models to associative memory networks has received limited mathematical exploration, and most existing studies are focused on specific models. Conversely, well-established associative memory designs, such as Hopfield networks, lack key biologically-relevant features intrinsic to firing rate models, including positivity and interpretable synaptic matrices that reflect excitatory and inhibitory interactions. To address this gap, we propose a general framework that ensures the emergence of re-scaled memory patterns as stable equilibria in the firing rate dynamics. Furthermore, we analyze the conditions under which the memories are locally and globally asymptotically stable, providing insights into constructing biologically-plausible and robust systems for associative memory retrieval.</description>

      <title>$2$-R\'enyi CCNR Negativity of Compact Boson for multiple disjoint intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate mixed-state bipartite entanglement between multiple disjoint intervals using the computable cross-norm criterion (CCNR). We consider entanglement between a single interval and the union of remaining disjoint intervals, and compute $2$-R\'enyi CCNR negativity for $2$d massless compact boson. The expression for $2$-R\'enyi CCNR negativity is given in terms of cross-ratios and Riemann period matrices of Riemann surfaces involved in the calculation. In general, the Riemann surfaces involved in the calculation of $n$-R\'enyi CCNR negativity do not possess a $Z_n$ symmetry. We also evaluate the Reflected R\'enyi entropy related to the $2$-R\'enyi CCNR negativity. This Reflected R\'enyi entropy is a universal quantity. We extend these calculations to the $2$d massless Dirac fermions as well. Finally, the analytical results are checked against the numerical evaluations in the tight-binding model and are found to be in good agreement.</description>

      <title>Generating and analyzing small-size datasets to explore physical observables in quantum Ising systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a detailed analysis of datasets generated from simulations of two-dimensional quantum spin systems using the quantum Ising model at absolute zero temperature. Our focus is on examining how fundamental physical properties, energy, magnetization, and entanglement entropy, evolve under varying external transverse magnetic fields and system sizes. From the Quantum Toolbox in Python (QuTiP), we simulate systems with 4, 8, and 16 spins arranged in square lattices, generating extensive datasets with 5000 samples per magnetic field value. The Hamiltonian operator incorporates quantum mechanical effects such as superposition and tunneling, challenging classical interpretations of spin states. We compute extended Pauli operators and construct the Hamiltonian to include spin-spin interactions and transverse field terms. Our analysis reveals that as the system size increases, fluctuations in energy and entanglement entropy become more evident, indicating lifted sensitivity to external perturbations and suggesting the onset of quantum phase transitions. Spin-spin correlation functions demonstrate that interactions are predominantly local, but larger systems exhibit more complex and fluctuating correlations. These findings provide valuable insights into the behavior of quantum spin systems and lay the groundwork for future machine learning applications aimed at predicting physical quantities and identifying phase transitions from a quantum perspective.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of energy-consuming random walkers: Variability in energy helps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy considerations can significantly affect the behavior of a population of energy-consuming agents with limited energy budgets, for instance, in the movement process of people in a city. We consider a population of interacting agents with an initial energy budget walking on a graph according to an exploration and return (to home) strategy that is based on the current energy of the person. Each move reduces the available energy depending on the flow of movements and the strength of interactions, and the movement ends when an agent returns home with a negative energy. We observe that a uniform distribution of initial energy budgets results in a larger number of visited sites per consumed energy (efficiency) compared to case that all agents have the same initial energy if return to home is relevant from the beginning of the process. The uniform energy distribution also reduces the amount of uncertainties in the total travel times (entropy production) which is more pronounced when the strength of interactions and exploration play the relevant role in the movement process. That is variability in the energies can help to increase the efficiency and reduce the entropy production specially in presence of strong interactions.</description>

      <title>Geometric constructions of generalized dual-unitary circuits from biunitarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework for constructing solvable lattice models of chaotic many-body quantum dynamics with multiple unitary directions using biunitary connections. We show that a network of biunitary connections on the Kagome lattice naturally defines a multi-unitary circuit, where three `arrows of time' directly reflect the lattice symmetry. These models unify various constructions of hierarchical dual-unitary and triunitary gates and present new families of models with solvable correlations and entanglement dynamics. Using multilayer constructions of biunitary connections, we additionally introduce multilayer circuits with monoclinic symmetry and higher level hierarchical dual-unitary solvability and discuss their (non-)ergodicity. Our work demonstrates how different classes of solvable models can be understood as arising from different geometric structures in spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lennard-Jones (LJ) systems exhibit strikingly invariant structure and dynamics when energy polydispersity is introduced [Ingebrigtsen and Dyre, J. Phys. Chem. B 127, 2837 (2023)]. For instance, at a given state point the radial distribution function and the mean-square displacement as a function of time are virtually unaffected by energy polydispersity, which is in contrast to what happens when size polydispersity is introduced. We here argue - and validate by simulations of up to 30% polydispersity - that this invariance reflects an approximate invariance of the constant-potential-energy surface. $NVU$ dynamics is defined as geodesic motion at constant potential energy; because this dynamics is equivalent to Newtonian dynamics in the thermodynamic limit, the approximate invariance of the constant-potential-energy surface implies virtually the same structure and dynamics of energy polydisperse LJ systems as for the single-component version. In contrast, the constant-potential-energy surface is shown to be significantly affected by the introduction of size polydispersity.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium phase transitions in hybrid Voronoi models of cell colonies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eukaryotic cells are characterized by a stiff nucleus whose effect in modeling the collective behavior of cell aggregates is usually underestimated. However, increasing experimental evidence links nuclear modifications with phenotypic transition, like the one between epithelial and mesenchymal states. In this work, we explore the effect of short-range repulsive forces in the non-equilibrium dynamics of the self-propelled Voronoi model. We show that the competition between steric repulsions (representing nuclear/cellular compressibility) and Vertex interactions (mimicking cell-cell adhesion/interaction and cytoskeleton organization) generate a variety of non-equilibrium phase transitions from Motility-Induced Phase Separation to mesenchymal-like phases up to disordered confluent configurations. Notably, we found that tuning the nucleus's effective size/compressibility provides an additional way to cross the boundary between the different possible phases in line with experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh effective action for hydrodynamics with approximate symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamic theories with approximate symmetries in the recently developed effective action approach on the Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) contour. We employ the method of spurious symmetry transformation for small explicit symmetry-breaking parameters to systematically constrain symmetry-breaking effects in the non-equilibrium effective action for hydrodynamics. We apply our method to the hydrodynamic theory of chiral symmetry in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at finite temperature and density and its explicit breaking by quark masses. We show that the spurious symmetry and the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) relation dictate that the Ward-Takahashi identity for the axial symmetry, i.e., the partial conservation of axial vector current (PCAC) relation, contains a relaxational term proportional to the axial chemical potential, whose kinetic coefficient is at least of the second order in the quark mass. In the phase where the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken, and the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone pions appear as hydrodynamic variables, this relaxation effect is subleading compared to the conventional pion mass term in the PCAC relation, which is of the first order in the quark mass. On the other hand, in the chiral symmetry-restored phase, we show that our relaxation term, which is of the second order in the quark mass, becomes the leading contribution to the axial charge relaxation. Therefore, the leading axial charge relaxation mechanism is parametrically different in the quark mass across a chiral phase transition.</description>

      <title>Interplay between local and global order controls bifurcations in nonreciprocal systems without a conservation law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We elucidate the generic bifurcation behavior of local and global order in the short-range interacting nonreciprocal Ising model evolving under Glauber dynamics. We show that a critical magnitude of nearest-neighbor correlations within the respective lattices controls the emergence of coherent oscillations of global order as a result of frustration. Local order is maintained during these oscillations, implying non-trivial spatio-temporal correlations. Long-lived states emerge in the strong-interaction regime. The residence time in either of these states eventually diverges, giving rise to ordered non-equilibrium steady states via a saddle-node-infinite-period bifurcation. Our work provides a comprehensive microscopic understanding of collective phenomena in nonreciprocal matter without conservation laws.</description>

      <title>One-body dynamical correlation function of Lieb-Liniger model at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00282v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamical correlated properties of one-dimensional (1D) Bose gases provide profound understanding of novel physics emergent from collective excitations, for instance, the breakdown of off-diagonal long-range order, and the establishment of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) theory. However, due to the non-perturbative nature of 1D many-body systems, the exact evaluation of correlation functions is notoriously difficult. Here by means of form factor approach based on algebraic Bethe ansatz and numerics, we present a thorough study on the one-body dynamical correlation function (1BDCF) of the Lieb-Liniger model at finite temperature. The influence of thermal fluctuation and dynamical interaction on the behavior of 1BDCF has been demonstrated and analyzed from various perspectives, including the spectral distribution, the line-shape of 1BDCF, and the static correlations etc. The static correlation properties, i.e. the momentum distribution and one body density matrix are shown in good agreement with the TLL prediction.</description>

      <title>Dissipatons as generalized Brownian particles for open quantum systems: Dissipaton-embedded quantum master equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10666v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dissipaton theory had been proposed as an exact and nonperturbative approach to deal with open quantum system dynamics, where the influence of Gaussian environment is characterized by statistical quasi-particles named as dissipatons. In this work, we revisit the dissipaton equation of motion theory and establish an equivalent dissipatons-embedded quantum master equation (DQME), which gives rise to dissipatons as generalized Brownian particles. As explained in this work, the DQME supplies a direct approach to investigate the statistical characteristics of dissipatons and thus the physically supporting hybrid bath modes. Numerical demonstrations are carried out on the electron transfer model, exhibiting the transient statistical properties of the solvation coordinate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The numerical conformal bootstrap has become in the last 15 years an indispensable tool for studying strongly coupled CFTs in various dimensions. Here we review the main developments in the field in the last 5 years, since the appearance of the previous comprehensive review \cite{Poland:2018epd}. We describe developments in the software ({\tt SDPB 2.0}, {\tt scalar\_blocks}, {\tt blocks\_3d}, {\tt autoboot}, {\tt hyperion}, {\tt simpleboot}), and on the algorithmic side (Delauney triangulation, cutting surface, tiptop, navigator function, skydive). We also describe the main physics applications which were obtained using the new technology.</description>

      <title>Universal non-thermal power-law distribution functions from the self-consistent evolution of collisionless electrostatic plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distribution functions of collisionless systems are known to show non-thermal power law tails. Interestingly, collisionless plasmas in various physical scenarios, (e.g., the ion population of the solar wind) feature a $v^{-5}$ tail in the velocity ($v$) distribution, whose origin has been a long-standing mystery. We show this power law tail to be a natural outcome of the self-consistent collisionless relaxation of driven electrostatic plasmas. We perform a quasilinear analysis of the perturbed Vlasov-Poisson equations to show that the coarse-grained mean distribution function (DF), $f_0$, follows a quasilinear diffusion equation with a diffusion coefficient $D(v)$ that depends on $v$ through the plasma dielectric constant. If the plasma is isotropically forced on scales much larger than the Debye length with a white noise-like electric field, then $D(v)\sim v^4$ for $\sigma&lt;v&lt;\omega_{\mathrm{P}}/k$, with $\sigma$ the thermal velocity, $\omega_{\mathrm{P}}$ the plasma frequency and $k$ the maximum wavenumber of the perturbation; the corresponding $f_0$, in the quasi-steady state, develops a $v^{-\left(d+2\right)}$ tail in $d$ dimensions ($v^{-5}$ tail in 3D), while the energy ($E$) distribution develops an $E^{-2}$ tail irrespective of the dimensionality of space. Any redness of the noise only alters the scaling in the high $v$ end. Non-resonant particles moving slower than the phase-velocity of the plasma waves ($\omega_{\mathrm{P}}/k$) experience a Debye-screened electric field, and significantly less (power law suppressed) acceleration than the near-resonant particles. Thus, a Maxwellian DF develops a power law tail. The Maxwellian core ($v&lt;\sigma$) eventually also heats up, but over a much longer timescale than that over which the tail forms. We definitively show that self-consistency (ignored in test-particle treatments) is crucial for the development of the universal $v^{-5}$ tail.</description>

      <title>A universal inequality on the unitary 2D CFT partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the conjecture proposed by Hartman, Keller and Stoica [HKS14]: the grand-canonical free energy of a unitary 2D CFT with a sparse spectrum below the scaling dimension $\frac{c}{12}+\epsilon$ and below the twist $\frac{c}{12}$ is universal in the large $c$ limit for all $\beta_L\beta_R \neq 4\pi^2$.
  The technique of the proof allows us to derive a one-parameter (with parameter $\alpha\in(0,1]$) family of universal inequalities on the unitary 2D CFT partition function with general central charge $c\geqslant 0$, using analytical modular bootstrap. We derive an iterative equation for the domain of validity of the inequality on the $(\beta_L,\beta_R)$ plane. The infinite iteration of this equation gives the boundary of maximal-validity domain, which depends on the parameter $\alpha$ in the inequality.
  In the $c \to \infty$ limit, with the additional assumption of a sparse spectrum below the scaling dimension $\frac{c}{12} + \epsilon$ and the twist $\frac{\alpha c}{12}$ (with $\alpha \in (0,1]$ fixed), our inequality shows that the grand-canonical free energy exhibits a universal large $c$ behavior in the maximal-validity domain. This domain, however, does not cover the entire $(\beta_L, \beta_R)$ plane, except in the case of $\alpha = 1$. For $\alpha = 1$, this proves the conjecture proposed by [HKS14], and for $\alpha &lt; 1$, it quantifies how sparseness in twist affects the regime of universality. Furthermore, this implies a precise lower bound on the temperature of near-extremal BTZ black holes, above which we can trust the black hole thermodynamics.</description>
