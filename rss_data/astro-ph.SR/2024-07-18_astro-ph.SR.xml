      <title>The multiple nature of CC Com: one of the ultra-short orbital period late-type contact binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of very short-period contact binaries provides an important laboratory in which the most important and problematic astrophysical processes of stellar evolution take place. Short-period contact systems, such as CC Com are particularly important for binary evolution. Close binary systems, especially those with multiple system members, have significant period variations, angular momentum loss mechanisms predominance, and pre-merger stellar evolution, making them valuable astrophysical laboratories. In this study, observations of CC Com, previously reported as a binary system, and new observations from the T\"UB\.ITAK National Observatory (TUG) and the space-based telescope TESS have revealed that there is a third object with a period of about eight years and a fourth object with a period of about a century orbiting the binary system. From simultaneous analysis of all available light curves and radial velocities, the sensitive orbital and physical parameters of the system components are derived. The orbital parameters of the components are P$_{\rm A}=0.221\pm0$ days, P$_{\rm B}=7.9\pm0.1$ yr, P$_{\rm C}=98\pm5$ yr, $e_3$ = 0.06, $e_4$ = 0.44 and the physical parameters as M$_{\rm A1}=0.712\pm0.009$ M$_{\odot}$, M$_{\rm A2}=0.372\pm0.005$ M$_{\odot}$, $m_{B;i'=90^\circ}$=0.074 M$_{\odot}$, $m_{C;i'=90^\circ}$=0.18 M$_{\odot}$, R$_{\rm A1}=0.693\pm0.006$ R$_{\odot}$, R$_{\rm A2}=0.514\pm0.005$ R$_{\odot}$, L$_{\rm A1}$ = 0.103 L$_\odot$, L$_{\rm A2}$ = 0.081 L$_\odot$. Finally, the evolutionary status of the multiple system CC Com and its component stars is discussed.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal Observations of a Flare Loop-top using IRIS Fe XXI: Implications for Turbulence and Electron Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The excess broadening of high-temperature spectral lines, long observed near the tops of flare arcades, is widely considered to result from magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. According to different theories, plasma turbulence is also believed to be a candidate mechanism for particle acceleration during solar flares. However, the degree to which this broadening is connected to the acceleration of non-thermal electrons remains largely unexplored outside of recent work, and many observations have been limited by limited spatial resolution and cadence. Using the Interface Region Imaging Spectrometer (IRIS), we present spatially resolved observations of loop-top broadenings using hot (11MK) Fe XXI 1354.1 \r{A} line emission at ~9s cadence during the 2022 March 30 X1.3 flare. We find non-thermal velocities upwards of 65km/s that decay linearly with time, indicating the presence and subsequent dissipation of plasma turbulence. Moreover, the initial Fe XXI signal was found to be co-spatial and co-temporal with microwave emission measured by the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA), placing a population of non-thermal electrons in the same region as the loop-top turbulence. Evidence of electron acceleration at this time is further supported by hard X-ray measurements from the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) aboard Solar Orbiter. Using the decay of non-thermal broadenings as a proxy for turbulent dissipation, we found the rate of energy dissipation to be consistent with the power of non-thermal electrons deposited into the chromosphere, suggesting a possible connection between turbulence and electron acceleration.</description>

      <title>A question of personalities: evolution of viscous and wind-driven protoplanetary discs in the presence of dead zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether the angular momentum of protoplanetary discs is redistributed by viscosity or extracted by magnetised winds is a long-standing question. Demographic indicators, such as gas disc sizes and stellar accretion rates, have been proposed as ways of distinguishing between these two mechanisms. In this paper, we implement one-dimensional gas simulations to study the evolution of "hybrid" protoplanetary discs simultaneously driven by viscosity and magnetised winds, with dead zones present. We explore how the variations of disc properties, including initial disc sizes, dead zone sizes and angular momentum transport efficiency, affect stellar accretion rates, disc surface density profiles, disc sizes, disc lifetimes, and cumulative mass loss by different processes. Our models show that the expansion of the gas disc size can be sustained when the majority of angular momentum is removed by the magnetised wind for individual protoplanetary discs. However, when we can only observe discs via demographic screenshots, the variation of disc sizes with time is possibly diminished by the disc "personalities", by which we mean the variations of initial disc properties among different discs. Our "hybrid" models re-assess association of the two demographic indicators with mechanisms responsible for angular momentum transport and suggest additional diagnostics are required to assist the differentiation.</description>

      <title>Blue supergiants as a progenitor of intermediate-luminosity red transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current perspective about the explosions of blue supergiants is that they resemble SN 1987A. These so-called peculiar Type II supernovae, however, are one of the rarest types of supernovae and may not hence be the fate of all blue supergiants. In this work, we explore other explosion scenarios for blue supergiants. We create synthetic light curves from the explosions of blue supergiant models born from binary mergers, over a range of explosion energies and 56Ni masses. We find that blue supergiant explosions may also lead to intermediate-luminosity red transients. We thus identify two categories of supernovae possible from blue supergiant explosions: those with high 56Ni masses (&gt; ~ 0.01 Msun) result in slow-rising, dome-shaped light curves like SN 1987A. Lower 56Ni masses result in low-luminosity, short-plateau light curves resembling some intermediate-luminosity red transients and Type II supernovae like SN 2008bp, which are possible from the explosions of compact blue supergiants and not from the far more extended red supergiants. Our results indicate that blue supergiant explosions are more diverse than SN 1987A-like events and may be hidden among different kinds of transients, explaining the possible discrepancies between the expected fraction of blue supergiants born from binary mergers and the observed fraction of SN 1987A-like supernovae.</description>

      <title>Superluminous supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12302v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a population of supernovae (SNe) whose peak luminosities are much larger than those of canonical SNe. Although SLSNe were simply defined by their peak luminosity at first, it is currently recognized that they show rich spectroscopic diversities including hydrogen-poor (Type I) and hydrogen-rich (Type II) subtypes. The exact mechanisms making SLSNe luminous are still not fully understood, but there are mainly four major suggested luminosity sources (radioactive decay of 56Ni, circumstellar interaction, magnetar spin-down, and fallback accretion). We provide an overview of observational properties of SLSNe and major theoretical models for them. Future transient surveys are expected to discover SLSNe at high redshifts which will provide a critical information in revealing their nature.</description>

      <title>Westward hotspot offset explained by subcritical dynamo action in an ultra-hot Jupiter atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hot Jupiters are tidally-locked Jupiter-sized planets close to their host star. They have equilibrium temperatures above about 1000 K. Photometric observations find that the hotspot, the hottest location in the atmosphere, is shifted with respect to the substellar point. Some observations show eastward and some show westward hotspot offsets, while hydrodynamic simulations show an eastward offset due to advection by the characteristic eastward mean flow. In particular for ultra-hot Jupiters with equilibrium temperatures above 2000 Kelvin, electromagnetic effects must be considered since the ionization-driven significant electrical conductivity and the subsequent induction of magnetic fields likely result in substantial Lorentz forces. We here provide the first magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulation of an ultra-hot Jupiter atmosphere at an equilibrium temperature of about 2400 K that fully captures non-linear electromagnetic induction effects. We find a new turbulent flow regime, hitherto unknown for hot Jupiters. Its main characteristic is a break-down of the well-known laminar mean flows. This break-down is triggered by strong local magnetic fields. These fields are maintained by a subcritical dynamo process. It is initiated by a sufficiently strong background field from an assumed deep dynamo region at a realistic amplitude around 2.5 G. Our results show a zero or westward hotspot offset for the dynamo case, depending on atmospheric properties, while the hydrodynamic case has the usual eastward offset. Since our simulation has an eastward mean flow at the equator, radial flows must be important for producing the zero or westward hotspot offset. A subcritical dynamo offers a new scenario for explaining the diversity of observed hotspot offsets. In this scenario, the dynamo has been initiated by sufficiently strong fields at some time in the past only for a part of the population.</description>

      <title>Neutrino beaming in ultraluminous X-ray pulsars as a result of gravitational lensing by neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray pulsars experiencing extreme mass accretion rates can produce neutrino emission in the MeV energy band. Neutrinos in these systems are emitted in close proximity to the stellar surface and subsequently undergo gravitational bending in the space curved by a neutron star. This process results in the formation of a distinct beam pattern of neutrino emission and gives rise to the phenomenon of neutrino pulsars. The energy flux of neutrinos, when averaged over the neutron star's pulsation period, can differ from the isotropic neutrino energy flux, which impacts the detectability of bright pulsars in neutrinos. We investigate the process of neutrino beam pattern formation, accounting for neutron star transparency to neutrinos and gravitational bending. Based on simulated neutrino beam patterns, we estimate the potential difference between the actual and apparent neutrino luminosity. We show that the apparent luminosity can greatly exceed the actual luminosity, albeit only in a small fraction of cases, depending on the specific equation of state and the mass of the star. For example, the amplification can exceed a factor of ten for $\approx0.2\%$ of typical neutron stars with mass of $1.4\,M_\odot$. Strong amplification is less probable for neutron stars of higher mass. In the case of strange stars, a fraction of high energy neutrinos can be absorbed and the beam pattern, as well as the amplification of apparent neutrino luminosity, depend on neutrino energy.</description>

      <title>A global view on star formation: The GLOSTAR Galactic plane survey. XI. Radio source catalog IV: $2^\circ &lt; \ell &lt; 28^\circ$, $36^\circ &lt; \ell &lt; 60^\circ$ and $|b| &lt; 1^\circ$</title>

Abstract: The GLOSTAR survey studies star formation with the VLA and the Effelsberg 100m telescope in the Galactic plane (-2d&lt;l&lt;60d; |b|&lt;1d) and the Cygnus X region with unprecedented sensitivity in both flux density (~50uJy/beam) and the capability of detecting emission with angular scales in the range from 1" to the largest radio structures in the Galaxy.
  We provide a complete GLOSTAR-VLA D-configuration radio source catalog for the covered part of the Galactic disk. A catalog for the pilot region (28d&lt;l&lt;36d) has been published in a previous paper and here we present the complementary catalog for the area within 2d&lt;l&lt;28d, 36d&lt;l&lt;60d and |b|&lt;1d.
  Observations were taken with the VLA in a 4-8GHz band to image 100 degrees$^2$ of the inner Galactic disk at a reference frequency of 5.8GHz, using 260h of telescope time. We determined spectral indices inside the observed band and in the frequency range 1.4-5.8GHz by complementing our results with those from the THOR survey (1-2GHz).
  The final images have an angular resolution of 18" and an average sensitivity of 123uJy/beam. The sensitivity is better (~60uJy/beam) in areas free of extended emission. The Galactic disk catalog presented in this work, consists of 11211 radio sources. Of these, 1965 are known large-scale structure sources such as star-forming region complexes, well-known SNRs, SNR candidates or parts thereof. The remaining 9227 are discrete individual sources. Source parameters, namely flux densities, sizes, spectral indices, and classifications are reported. We identify 769 HII region candidates, 359 are newly classified as such. The mean value of spectral indices of 225 HII regions is 0.14$\pm$0.02, consistent with most of them emitting optically thin thermal radio emission. Combining our results with the previously published catalog of the pilot region, the final GLOSTAR-VLA D-configuration catalog contains 12981 radio sources.</description>

      <title>"Halfway to Rayleigh" and other Insights to the Rossby Wave Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Rossby wave instability (RWI) is the fundamental non-axisymmetric radial shear instability in disks. The RWI can facilitate disk accretion, set the shape of planetary gaps and produce large vortices. It arises from density and/or temperature features, such as radial gaps, bumps or steps. A general, sufficient condition to trigger the RWI is lacking, which we address by studying the linear RWI in a suite of simplified models, including incompressible and compressible shearing sheets and global, cylindrical disks. We focus on enthalpy amplitude and width as the fundamental properties of disk features with various shapes. We find analytic results for the RWI boundary and growth rates across a wide parameter space, in some cases with exact derivations and in others as a description of numerical results. Features wider than a scale-height generally become unstable about halfway to Rayleigh instability, i.e.\ when the squared epicyclic frequency is about half the Keplerian value, reinforcing our previous finding. RWI growth rates approximately scale as enthalpy amplitude to the 1/3 power, with a weak dependence on width, across much of parameter space. Global disk curvature affects wide planetary gaps, making the outer gap edge more susceptible to the RWI. Our simplified models are barotropic and height-integrated, but the main results should carry over to more complex and realistic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Understanding the effects of spacecraft trajectories through solar coronal mass ejection flux ropes using 3DCOREweb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03271v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of spacecraft positioning and trajectory on in situ signatures of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Employing the 3DCORE model, a 3D flux rope model that can generate in situ profiles for any given point in space and time, we conduct forward modeling to analyze such signatures for various latitudinal and longitudinal positions, with respect to the flux rope apex, at 0.8~au. Using this approach, we explore the appearance of the resulting in situ profiles for different flux rope types, with different handedness and inclination angles, for both high and low twist CMEs. Our findings reveal that CMEs exhibit distinct differences in signatures between apex hits and flank encounters, with the latter displaying elongated profiles with reduced rotation. However, constant, non-rotating in situ signatures are only observed for flank encounters of low twist CMEs, suggesting the existence of untwisted magnetic field lines within CME legs. Additionally, our study confirms the unambiguous appearance of different flux rope types in in situ signatures, contributing to the broader understanding and interpretation of observational data. Given the model assumptions, this may refute trajectory effects to be the cause for mismatching flux rope types as identified in solar signatures. While acknowledging limitations inherent in our model, such as the assumption of constant twist and non-deformable torus-like shape, we still draw relevant conclusions within the context of global magnetic field structures of CMEs and the potential for distinguishing flux rope types based on in situ observations.</description>

      <title>The Maximum Black Hole Mass at Solar Metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the current knowledge and uncertainties in detailed stellar evolution and wind modelling to evaluate the mass of the most massive stellar black hole (BH) at solar metallicity. Contrary to common expectations that it is the most massive stars that produce the most massive BHs, we find that the maximum $M_{\rm BH}^{\rm Max} \simeq 30 \pm 10\,M_{\odot}$ is found in the canonical intermediate range between $M_{\rm ZAMS} \simeq 30$ and $50\,M_{\odot}$ instead. The prime reason for this seemingly counter-intuitive finding is that very massive stars (VMS) have increasingly high mass-loss rates, leading to substantial mass evaporation before they expire as stars, ending as lighter BHs than their canonical O-star counterparts.</description>

      <title>STELLA lightcurves of energetic pair instability supernovae in the context of SN2018ibb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SN2018ibb is a recently observed hydrogen poor super-luminous supernova which appears to be powered by the decay of $30\;\rm{M_\odot}$ of radioactive nickel. This supernova has been suggested to show hybrid signatures of a pair instability supernova and an interacting supernova. In a previous paper, we found that rotating, metal enriched pair instability supernova progenitors appeared to check both of these boxes. In this paper, we model the lightcurves of the pair instability supernovae using STELLA. We find that the STELLA models can explain the overall shape of the bolometric lightcurve of SN2018ibb, though not specific morphological features such as the luminosity peak or the bump at roughly three hundred days after the peak. We also estimate the contribution from interaction, and find that with relatively low wind velocities, the circum-stellar medium originating from the stellar winds is consistent with the evidence for interaction in the spectra. The observed values of the photosphere velocity in the hundred days after peak luminosity are similar to the STELLA models, but the deceleration is lower. This leads to the biggest inconsistency which is the black body temperature of SN2018ibb being much hotter than any of the STELLA models. We note that this high temperature (and the flat velocity) may be difficult to reconcile with the long rise time of SN2018ibb, but nevertheless conclude that if it is accurate, this discrepancy represents a challenge for SN2018ibb being a robust PISN candidate. This result is noteworthy given the lack of other scenarios for this supernova.</description>

      <title>Progenitor and explosion properties of SN 2023ixf estimated based on a light-curve model grid of Type II supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We estimate the progenitor and explosion properties of the nearby Type II SN 2023ixf using a synthetic model grid of Type II supernova light curves. By comparing the light curves of SN 2023ixf with the pre-existing grid of Type II supernovae containing about 228,000 models with different combinations of the progenitor and explosion properties, we obtain the chi2 value for every model and evaluate the properties of the models providing small values of chi2. We found that the light-curve models with the progenitor zero-age main-sequence mass of 10 Msun, the explosion energy of (2-3)e51 erg, the 56Ni mass of 0.04-0.06 Msun, the mass-loss rate of 1e-3 - 1e-2 Msun/yr with a wind velocity of 10 km/s, and the dense, confined circumstellar matter radius of (6-10)e14 cm match well to the observed light curves of SN 2023ixf. The photospheric velocity evolution of these models is also consistent with the observed velocity evolution. We note that the progenitor mass estimate could be affected by the adopted progenitor models. Although our parameter estimation is based on a pre-existing model grid and we do not perform any additional computations, the estimated parameters are consistent with those obtained by the detailed modeling of SN 2023ixf previously reported. This result shows that comparing the pre-existing model grid is a reasonable way to obtain a rough estimate for the properties of Type II supernovae. This simple way to estimate the properties of Type II supernovae will be essential in the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) era when thousands of Type II supernovae are expected to be discovered yearly.</description>

Abstract: Irregular satellites (IS) are believed to have been captured during the Solar system's dynamical history and provide clues for the Solar system's formation and evolution. IS occupy a large fraction of the Hill sphere of their host planet and their orbits are highly perturbed by the Sun. We use a novel formalism developed in paper I to characterise their orbits in terms of an effective secular Hamiltonian (the Brown Hamiltonian) that accounts for their large orbital separations. We find that prograde satellites generally follow the Brown Hamiltonian, while retrograde satellites (which extend further) deviate more significantly. Nevertheless, the phase portrait is much better described by the Brown Hamiltonian for all satellites. We construct a semi-analytic criterion that predicts the librating orbit based on the effective energy due to the Brown Hamiltonian. We also check our results with highly accurate N-body integrations of satellite orbits, where initial conditions are loaded directly from the updated ephemeris from the NASA Horizons database. Although the retrograde librating orbits occupy more area in the parameter space, the vast majority of librating IS are prograde. Using our method we find $13$ librating satellites, $8$ of them previously known to librate, and the rest shown to librate for the first time. Further observations of existing and new satellites could shed more light on the dynamical history of the Solar system and satellite formation and test our results.</description>
