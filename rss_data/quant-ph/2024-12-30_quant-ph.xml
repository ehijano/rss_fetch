      <title>Von Neumann Entropy and Quantum Algorithmic Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A state $\rho=(\rho_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence such that $\rho_n$ is a density matrix on $n$ qubits. It formalizes the notion of an infinite sequence of qubits. The von Neumann entropy $H(d)$ of a density matrix $d$ is the Shannon entropy of its eigenvalue distribution. We show: (1) If $\rho$ is a computable quantum Schnorr random state then $\lim_n [H(\rho_n )/n] = 1$. (2) We define quantum s-tests for $s\in [0,1]$, show that $\liminf_n [H(\rho_n)/n]\geq \{ s: \rho$ is covered by a quantum s-test $\}$ for computable $\rho$ and construct states where this inequality is an equality. (3) If $\exists c \exists^\infty n H(\rho_n)&gt; n-c$ then $\rho$ is strong quantum random. Strong quantum randomness is a randomness notion which implies quantum Schnorr randomness relativized to any oracle. (4) A computable state $(\rho_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is quantum Schnorr random iff the family of distributions of the $\rho_n$'s is uniformly integrable. We show that the implications in (1) and (3) are strict.</description>

      <title>Laplace expansions and tree decompositions: polytime algorithm for shallow nearest-neighbour Boson Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a Boson Sampling quantum optical experiment we send $n$ individual photons into an $m$-mode interferometer and we measure the occupation pattern on the output. The statistics of this process depending on the permanent of a matrix representing the experiment, a #P-hard problem to compute, is the reason behind ideal and fully general Boson Sampling being hard to simulate on a classical computer. We exploit the fact that for a nearest-neighbour shallow circuit, i.e. depth $D = \mathcal{O}(\log m)$, one can adapt the algorithm by Clifford &amp; Clifford (2018) to exploit the sparsity of the shallow interferometer using an algorithm by Cifuentes &amp; Parrilo (2016) that can efficiently compute a permanent of a structured matrix from a tree decomposition. Our algorithm generates a sample from a shallow circuit in time $\mathcal{O}(n^22^\omega \omega^2) + \mathcal{O}(\omega n^3)$, where $\omega$ is the treewidth of the decomposition which satisfies $\omega \le 2D$ for nearest-neighbour shallow circuits. The key difference in our work with respect to previous work using similar methods is the reuse of the structure of the tree decomposition, allowing us to adapt the Laplace expansion used by Clifford &amp; Clifford which removes a significant factor of $m$ from the running time, especially as $m&gt;n^2$ is a requirement of the original Boson Sampling proposal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore both the internal and external atomic degrees of freedom to observe entanglement between the modes produced by a mirrorless optical parametric oscillator (MOPO) operating below the oscillation threshold in a sample of free space cold cesium atoms. The platform allows the generation of multipartite entanglement among many optical modes that could potentially be used in quantum network technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Thermodynamics of a Power-Law Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling quantum thermal machines provides a practical approach to describing the thermodynamic properties of quantum technologies and devices. For this purpose, power-law potentials are often employed as working mediums of quantum thermodynamic cycles to investigate the concepts of heat, work, and efficiency. With this in mind, we present the results for the Stirling and Otto numerical modeling of quantum thermal machines that use a general power law potential with a characteristic $q$ exponent. We calculate its energy spectra, showing that it recovers the traditional forms of harmonic oscillator and 1-D potential well. We derive expressions for the reduced energy exchanges during a complete cycle and for the efficiency/coefficient of performance as a function of the exponent $q$, the bath temperatures, and the frequency ratio. From these results, we identify parameters that yield desired properties, such as optimized performance and transitions between different operation modes. The findings highlight the role of power-like potentials in optimizing quantum heat engines and support the design of tailored engines with specific performance characteristics.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling of a chiral molecule with circularly polarised modes inside a cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the discriminatory interaction of a chiral molecule with circularly polarised modes inside a cavity. Starting from a generalised Jaynes--Cummings model that includes both electric and magnetic dipole couplings, we derive the Rabi frequency and associated Casimir--Polder potential for a cavity with a single mode of given handedness. One finds that both acquire a discriminatory component whose sign depends on the relative handedness of molecule and cavity mode. We generalise this result to a cavity that supports two modes of different handedness on the basis of superradiant collective field states.</description>

      <title>Circuit Folding: Modular and Qubit-Level Workload Management in Quantum-Classical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is an emerging technology that offers exponential speedups for certain problems. At the core of quantum-centric supercomputing is advanced middleware that manages the interaction between quantum hardware and classical computing infrastructure. Circuit knitting is a technique that leverages classical computation to offload some of the computational burden from quantum circuits, enabling them to exceed the capacity of current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. This is done by partitioning large circuits into smaller subcircuits, though at the cost of classical reconstruction and increased sampling overhead. Despite significant advancements in reducing the theoretical costs of circuit knitting, efficiently deploying these techniques across a broad range of quantum algorithms remains a challenge. In this work, we propose CiFold, a novel graph-based system that, at the individual qubit's level, identifies and leverages repeated structures within quantum circuits. By folding these repeated modules in parallel, CiFold constructs a meta-graph that guides the partitioning process, optimizing the cutting strategy through the integration of advanced circuit knitting techniques. Our system has been extensively evaluated across various quantum algorithms, achieving up to 799.2\% reduction in quantum resource usage, demonstrating its scalability and substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Enhancing tripartite photon-phonon-magnon entanglement by synergizing parametric amplifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tripartite entanglement as a remarkable resource in quantum information science has been extensively investigated in hybrid quantum systems, whereas it is generally weak and prone to be suppressed by noise, restricting its practical application in quantum technologies. Here, we propose how to enhance the tripartite entanglement among magnons, photons and phonons in a hybrid cavity-magnon optomechanical system by exploiting a synergistic effect of the optical parametric amplification (OPA) and mechanical parametric amplification (MPA). We find that in the case of individually applying the OPA or MPA, the tripartite entanglement can be enhanced by several folds. Remarkably, upon suitably tuning the phase matching of the two parametric fields presented simultaneously, the strengths of the entanglement can be further enhanced due to the constructive interference between the OPA and MPA. We also show that our method can improve the robustness of the entanglement against thermal noise. Our work provides a promising method for manipulating the entanglement with easy tunability and may serve as a useful tool for the enhancement and protection of fragile quantum resources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum batteries, consisting of quantum cells, are anticipated to surpass their classical counterparts in performance because of the presence of quantum correlations. Recent theoretical study introduces the quantum battery capacity that is defined according to the highest and the lowest energy during the charging and discharging procedures. Here, we present an experimental verification of quantum battery capacity and its relationships with other quantum characters of battery by using two-photon states. This reveals a distinguished feature of quantum battery capacity and its trade-off relationship with the entropy of the battery state, as well as with measures of coherence and entanglement.</description>

      <title>Shallow Implementation of Quantum Fingerprinting with Application to Quantum Finite Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum fingerprinting is a technique that maps classical input word to a quantum state. The obtained quantum state is much shorter than the original word, and its processing uses less resources, making it useful in quantum algorithms, communication, and cryptography. One of the examples of quantum fingerprinting is quantum automata algorithm for \(MOD_{p}=\{a^{i\cdot p} \mid i \geq 0\}\) languages, where $p$ is a prime number.
  However, implementing such an automaton on the current quantum hardware is not efficient.
  Quantum fingerprinting maps a word \(x \in \{0,1\}^{n}\) of length \(n\) to a state \(\ket{\psi(x)}\) of \(O(\log n)\) qubits, and uses \(O(n)\) unitary operations. Computing quantum fingerprint using all available qubits of the current quantum computers is infeasible due to a large number of quantum operations.
  To make quantum fingerprinting practical, we should optimize the circuit for depth instead of width in contrast to the previous works. We propose explicit methods of quantum fingerprinting based on tools from additive combinatorics, such as generalized arithmetic progressions (GAPs), and prove that these methods provide circuit depth comparable to a probabilistic method. We also compare our method to prior work on explicit quantum fingerprinting methods.</description>

      <title>Experimental secure entanglement-free quantum remote sensing over 50 km of optical fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secure quantum remote sensing (SQRS) uses quantum states to gather information about distant objects or environments while ensuring secure data transmission against eavesdropping. It has potential applications in various fields, including environmental monitoring, military surveillance, and disaster response, where both data accuracy and transmission security are critical. Recent experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of SQRS using entanglement states. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an SQRS that can estimate a phase without requiring entanglement, offering the practical advantage that single-qubit states are easier to prepare. We successfully estimate the preset phase information at a remote site over a fiber distance of 50 km, which serves as a key step toward long-distance applications.</description>

      <title>Boosted fusion gates above the percolation threshold for scalable graph-state generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fusing small resource states into a larger, fully connected graph-state is essential for scalable photonic quantum computing. Theoretical analysis reveals that this can only be achieved when the success probability of the fusion gate surpasses a specific percolation threshold of 58.98% by using three-photon GHZ states as resource states. However, such an implementation of a fusion gate has never been experimentally realized before. Here, we successfully demonstrate a boosted fusion gate with a theoretical success probability of 75%, using deterministically generated auxiliary states. The success probability is experimentally measured to be 71.0(7)%. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of the boosted fusion gate by fusing two Bell states with a fidelity of 67(2)%. Our work paves a crucial path toward scalable linear optical quantum computing.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently estimating large numbers of non-commuting observables is an important subroutine of many quantum science tasks. We present the derandomized shallow shadows (DSS) algorithm for efficiently learning a large set of non-commuting observables, using shallow circuits to rotate into measurement bases. Exploiting tensor network techniques to ensure polynomial scaling of classical resources, our algorithm outputs a set of shallow measurement circuits that approximately minimizes the sample complexity of estimating a given set of Pauli strings. We numerically demonstrate systematic improvement, in comparison with state-of-the-art techniques, for energy estimation of quantum chemistry benchmarks and verification of quantum many-body systems, and we observe DSS's performance consistently improves as one allows deeper measurement circuits. These results indicate that in addition to being an efficient, low-depth, stand-alone algorithm, DSS can also benefit many larger quantum algorithms requiring estimation of multiple non-commuting observables.</description>

Abstract: Quantum machine learning may permit to realize more efficient machine learning calculations with near-term quantum devices. Among the diverse quantum machine learning paradigms which are currently being considered, quantum memristors are promising as a way of combining, in the same quantum hardware, a unitary evolution with the nonlinearity provided by the measurement and feedforward. Thus, an efficient way of deploying neuromorphic quantum computing for quantum machine learning may be enabled.</description>

      <title>Relative Quantum Resource Theory and Operational Applications in Subchannel Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central problem in quantum resource theory is to give operational meaning to quantum resources that can provide clear advantages in certain physical tasks compared to the convex set of resource-free states. We propose to extend this basic principle by defining the relative superiority of resources over a specific convex set of resource states, also provide a relative advantage in physical tasks based on this extended principle. This allows the generalized robustness measure to quantify the relative maximal advantage due to a given resource state over a specific convex set of resource states in the subchannel discrimination, thereby showing that the operational interpretation of resource measures also holds in a relative perspective. In addition, we offer a new framework for defining the deficiency of a given state in physical tasks compared to the set of maximum resource states. The geometric measure we provide satisfies the conditions of the framework for quantum coherence and entanglement, and it accurately quantifies the minimal disadvantage due to a given state compared to maximumresourcestates inthe subchannel discrimination in certain situations. These two extensions and new interpretations expand the scope of quantum resource theories and provide a more comprehensive operational interpretation.</description>

      <title>Harnessing high-dimensional symmetric and anti-symmetric Bell states through quantum interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional quantum entanglement is an essential resource in quantum technology since it provides benefits in increasing the information capacity and processing speed. Thus, the controlled harnessing of high-dimensional entanglement has long been hailed as a necessary prerequisite towards practical quantum applications. By using a deterministic quantum state filter that implemented through quantum interference, we present a generalised formulation for the complete high-dimensional symmetric and anti-symmetric Bell basis, and experimentally prepare four-dimensional orbital angular momentum Bell states that provide the well-behaved symmetric or anti-symmetric properties. Additionally, we use a concise yet efficient scan of temporal delay to directly observe high-dimensional two-photon interference effects in spatial modes. These results provide an alternative way for harnessing high-dimensional entanglement, and may facilitate the use of quantum interference for more complex quantum information processing tasks that beyond qubits.</description>

      <title>Adaptivity can help exponentially for shadow tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years there has been significant interest in understanding the statistical complexity of learning from quantum data under the constraint that one can only make unentangled measurements. While a key challenge in establishing tight lower bounds in this setting is to deal with the fact that the measurements can be chosen in an adaptive fashion, a recurring theme has been that adaptivity offers little advantage over more straightforward, nonadaptive protocols.
  In this note, we offer a counterpoint to this. We show that for the basic task of shadow tomography, protocols that use adaptively chosen two-copy measurements can be exponentially more sample-efficient than any protocol that uses nonadaptive two-copy measurements.</description>

      <title>An experimental proposal certification for any three-qubit generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states based on the fine-grained steering inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-party quantum steering is an important concept in quantum information theory and quantum mechanics, typically related to quantum entanglement and quantum nonlocality. It enables precise manipulation of large quantum systems, which is essential for large-scale quantum computing, simulations, and quantum communication. Recently, a quantum steering certification for any three-qubit generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GGHZ) states based on the fine-grained steering inequality was proved [Quantum Studies: Mathematics and Foundations, 2022, 9(2): 175-198]. Here we provide an experimental proposal to prepare the GGHZ states in photon system. The measurement observalbes in each party can be realized by different polarization optical elements. By choosing the angles of the waveplates, our experiment proposal can observe the maximum quantum violation for any three-qubit GGHZ states. Our proposal can be easily extended to high-dimensional qubits and multi-photon GHZ states, which provides a method to study the complex multi-party quantum protocols.</description>

      <title>Thermal quantum correlations of a single electron in a double quantum dot with transverse magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the thermal quantum correlations in a semiconductor double quantum dot system. The device comprises a single electron in a double quantum dot subjected to a longitudinal magnetic field and a transverse magnetic field gradient. The thermal entanglement of the single electron is driven by the charge and spin qubits. Utilizing the density matrix formalism, we derive analytical expressions for thermal concurrence and correlated coherence. The main goal of this work is to provide a good understanding of the effects of temperature and various parameters on quantum coherence. Additionally, our findings indicate that the transverse magnetic field can be employed to adjust the thermal entanglement and quantum coherence of the system. We also highlight the roles of thermal entanglement and correlated coherence in generating quantum correlations, noting that thermal correlated coherence is consistently more robust than thermal entanglement. This suggests that quantum algorithms based solely on correlated coherence might be more resilient than those relying on entanglement.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for Vector Set Orthogonal Normalization and Matrix QR Decomposition with Polynomial Speedup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector set orthogonal normalization and matrix QR decomposition are fundamental problems in matrix analysis with important applications in many fields. We know that Gram-Schmidt process is a widely used method to solve these two problems. However, the existing methods, including Gram-Schmidt process have problems of high complexity, scaling $O(N^3)$ in the system dimension $N$, which leads to difficulties when calculating large-scale or ill-conditioned problems. With the development of quantum information processing, a series of quantum algorithms have been proposed, providing advantages and speedups over classical algorithms in many fields. In this paper, we propose quantum algorithms to solve these two problems based on the idea of Gram-Schmidt process and quantum phase estimation. The complexity of proposed quantum algorithms is also theoretically and numerically analyzed. We find that our algorithms provide polynomial acceleration over the best-known classical and quantum algorithms on these two problems, scaling $O(N^2\mathrm{poly}(\log N))$ in the dimension $N$ of the system.</description>

      <title>Characterizing resources for multiparameter estimation of SU(2) and SU(1,1) unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the estimation of multiple parameters generated by a unitary evolution with non-commuting Hamiltonians that form a closed algebra. In particular, we consider the three-parameter estimation of SU(2) and SU(1,1) unitaries and analyze the ideal scaling of precision in terms of typical resources such as the total particle number, identifying novel probe states that can achieve Heisenberg scaling for all the three parameters. On top of that, we also consider a more pragmatic framework where the estimation is performed via the so-called method of moments, i.e., via measurements of signal-to-noise ratios of time-evolved observables, which we restrict to be the first two moments of the Hamiltonian generators. We consider the ideal classes of states that we have identified by maximizing the quantum Fisher information matrix, and analyze the maximal precision achievable from measuring only the first two moments of the generators. As a result, we find that in this context with limited resources accessible, the twin-Fock state emerges as the only probe state that allows the estimation of two out of the three parameters with Heisenberg precision scaling. We also analyze further states, including Gaussian states, as well as Schr{\"o}dinger-cat-like states, this time restricting to measurements linear in the su(2) and su(1,1) operators. In this case, we find that while the former can indeed achieve Heisenberg scaling for one or two parameters, the latter cannot, which confirms the fact that more complicated measurements would be needed in that case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the potential of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver in solving Dynamic Portfolio Optimization problems surpassing the 100 qubit utility frontier. We systematically analyze how to scale this strategy in complexity and size, from 6 to 112 qubits, by testing different combinations of ansatz and optimizer on a real Quantum Processing Unit. We achieve best results when using a combination of a Differential Evolution classical optimizer and an ansatz circuit tailored to both the problem and the properties of the Quantum Processing Unit.</description>

      <title>Squeezing in conditional measurement setup with coherent input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditional Measurement scheme which employs linear optical elements and photon detection is the fertile ground for nonclassical state generation. We consider a simple setup that requires a coherent state and a number state as inputs of the beam splitter, and a photon detector. We show that by tuning the parameters involved in the setup, we can achieve optimal squeezing from the setup. This is facilitated by writing the output state of the conditional measurement as displaced qudits. Setting aside displacement which plays no role in squeezing, the finite-dimensional representation makes it possible to calculate the maximal amount of squeezing. By fixing the detection at one photon level irrespective of any number state input and carefully chosen coherent parameter and beam splitter reflectivity values, one can reach the maximal squeezing at least for lower number state inputs. This is in contrast to the earlier attempts in atom field interaction models etc., where the squeezing obtained was far from saturation. To accommodate the experimental imperfections, we consider the impure nature of the photon source and detector inefficiency.</description>

      <title>VQE for Ising Model \&amp; A Comparative Analysis of Classical and Quantum Optimization Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we delved into several optimization methods, both classical and quantum, and analyzed the quantum advantage that each of these methods offered, and then we proposed a new combinatorial optimization scheme, deemed as QN-SPSA+PSR which combines calculating approximately Fubini-study metric (QN-SPSA) and the exact evaluation of gradient by Parameter-Shift Rule (PSR). The QN-SPSA+PSR method integrates the QN-SPSA computational efficiency with the precise gradient computation of the PSR, improving both stability and convergence speed while maintaining low computational consumption. Our results provide a new potential quantum supremacy in the VQE's optimization subroutine and enhance viable paths toward efficient quantum simulations on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Computing (NISQ) devices. Additionally, we also conducted a detailed study of quantum circuit ansatz structures in order to find the one that would work best with the Ising model and NISQ, in which we utilized the symmetry of the investigated model.</description>

      <title>New-type geometric gates in atomic arrays without Rydberg blockade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rydberg blockade effect plays an important role in realizing two-qubit gates in atomic arrays. Meanwhile, such mechanics will increase the crosstalk between atoms and enhance the decoherence. In this paper, we propose a new scheme to realize the controlled-phase gate without Rydberg blockade. The scheme works effectively with large atomic spacings and is insensitive to the thermal motions of atoms. The proposal is robust against random noises due to the geometric characteristic and operates fast based on the non-adiabatic evolution. The proposed gate is actually a new-type geometric gate that consolidates the non-adiabatic holonomic control and the unconventional geometric control simultaneously. The interference between two different types of geometric phases can be investigated. Furthermore, we show that the scheme with weak Rydberg interaction requires much less physical resources than the present Rydberg blockade scheme. Therefore, our proposal provides a fast and robust way to realize geometric quantum control, and it may trigger the discoveries of new geometric gates in high-dimensional Hilbert space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the utilization of higher-order discretization techniques in optimizing the gate count needed for quantum computer based solutions of partial differential equations. To accomplish this, we present an efficient approach for decomposing $d$-band diagonal matrices into Pauli strings that are grouped into mutually commuting sets.
  Using numerical simulations of the one-dimensional wave equation, we show that higher-order methods can reduce the number of qubits necessary for discretization, similar to the classical case, although they do not decrease the number of Trotter steps needed to preserve solution accuracy. This result has important consequences for the practical application of quantum algorithms based on Hamiltonian evolution.</description>

      <title>Degrees of Entanglement in Systems of Three Indistinguishable Bosons: Revisiting the GHZ State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the concept of entanglement for distinguishable particles is well established, defining entanglement and non-locality in systems of indistinguishable particles, which require the use of the (anti)symmetrization postulate, remains challenging, and multiple approaches have been proposed to address this issue. In this work we study the problem of detecting genuine tripartite entanglement among systems of indistinguishable bosons. A genuine entangled state is one that cannot be separable under any bipartition, where separability in the indistinguishable regime is defined by the existence of single particle properties within each subsystem, without the possibility of knowing which property belongs to which subsystem. We use an algorithm that allows us to search for these single particle properties and, consequently, rank states according to their degree of separability. In particular, we introduce a state of indistinguishable bosons with analogous properties to those of the standard GHZ state.</description>

      <title>Analog quantum simulation of small-polaron physics in arrays of neutral atoms with Rydberg-dressed resonant dipole-dipole interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have seen growing interest in sharp polaronic transitions in systems with strongly momentum-dependent interactions of an itinerant excitation (electron, hole, exciton) with dispersionless phonons. This work presents a scheme for investigating such phenomena in a controllable fashion within the framework of an analog quantum simulator based on an array of neutral atoms in optical tweezers. The envisioned analog simulator, in which the atoms interact through Rydberg-dressed resonant dipole-dipole interaction, allows one to study the rich interplay of Peierls- and breathing-mode-type excitation-phonon interactions. Based on a numerically-exact treatment of one special case of this system -- namely, the case with equal Peierls- and breathing-mode coupling strengths -- a sharp small-polaron transition was shown to take place for a critical value of the effective excitation-phonon coupling strength. This transition signifies the change from a completely bare (undressed by phonons) excitation below the transition point and a strongly phonon-dressed one (small polaron) above it. This work also highlights the comparative advantages of highly-controllable Rydberg-atom-based systems to other physical platforms for simulating polaronic phenomenology, which could be exploited to study the nonequilibrium dynamics of the small-polaron formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The connectivity between qubits plays a crucial role in the performance of quantum extreme reservoir computing (QERC), particularly regarding long-range and inter-modular connections. We demonstrate that sufficiently long-range connections within a single module can achieve performance comparable to fully connected networks in supervised learning tasks. Further analysis of inter-modular connection schemes -- such as boundary, parallel, and arbitrary links -- shows that even a small number of well-placed connections can significantly enhance QERC performance. These findings suggest that modular QERC architectures, which could be more easily implemented on two-dimensional quantum chips or through the integration of small quantum systems, provide an effective approach for machine learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration and modeling of near-infrared nonlinear third-order triple-photon generation stimulated over one mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triple Photon Generation (TPG) is a third-order nonlinear optical interaction in which a photon, i.e. the pump, splits into three lower energy photons, i.e. modes 1, 2 and 3. The triplets possess different quantum signatures from those of photon pairs, with a strong interest in quantum information. In the present study, we performed the first experimental demonstration of TPG stimulated over one mode of the triplet, mode 1, the previous work on TPG concerning stimulation over two modes,2 and 3. The nonlinear medium is a KTiOPO4 crystal pumped in the picosecond regime (15 ps, 10 Hz) at a pump wavelength of 532 nm. The stimulation beam is emitted by a tunable optical parametric generator: the phase-matching was found at a stimulation wavelength of 1491 nm, the other two modes of the triplet being both at 1654 nm in orthogonal polarizations. Using superconducting nanowires single photon detectors, the measurement of the polarizations and wavelength signatures of the two generated modes are in full agreement with calculations. It has been possible to generate a total number of photons per pulse on modes 2 and 3 up to 2x10-4, which corresponds to the generation of 10-4 triplets per pulse, or 10-5 triplets per second since the repetition rate is equal to 10 Hz. We interpreted these results in the framework of a model we developed on the basis of the nonlinear momentum operator in the Heisenberg representation under the undepleted pump and stimulation approximation.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Inspired Weight-Constrained Neural Network: Reducing Variable Numbers by 100x Compared to Standard Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although quantum machine learning has shown great promise, the practical application of quantum computers remains constrained in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. To take advantage of quantum machine learning, we investigate the underlying mathematical principles of these quantum models and adapt them to classical machine learning frameworks. Specifically, we develop a classical weight-constrained neural network that generates weights based on quantum-inspired insights. We find that this approach can reduce the number of variables in a classical neural network by a factor of 135 while preserving its learnability. In addition, we develop a dropout method to enhance the robustness of quantum machine learning models, which are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks. This technique can also be applied to improve the adversarial resilience of the classical weight-constrained neural network, which is essential for industry applications, such as self-driving vehicles. Our work offers a novel approach to reduce the complexity of large classical neural networks, addressing a critical challenge in machine learning.</description>

      <title>Approximate quantum 3-colorings of graphs and the quantum Max 3-Cut problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that, to each synchronous non-local game $\mathcal{G}=(I,O,\lambda)$ with $|I|=n$ and $|O|=m \geq 3$, there is an associated graph $G_{\lambda}$ for which approximate winning strategies for the game $\mathcal{G}$ and the $3$-coloring game for $G_{\lambda}$ are preserved. That is, using a similar graph to previous work of the author (Ann. Henri Poincar\'{e}, 2024), any synchronous strategy for $\text{Hom}(G_{\lambda},K_3)$ that wins the game with probability $1-\varepsilon$ with respect to the uniform probability distribution on the edges, yields a strategy in the same model that wins the game $\mathcal{G}$ with respect to the uniform distribution with probability at least $1-h(n,m)\varepsilon^{\frac{1}{2}}$, where $h$ is a polynomial in $n$ and $2^m$. As an application, we prove that the gapped promise problem for quantum $3$-coloring is undecidable. Moreover, we prove that there exists an $\alpha \in (0,1)$ for which determining whether the non-commutative Max-$3$-Cut of a graph is $|E|$ or less than $\alpha |E|$ is RE-hard, thus giving a positive answer to a problem posed by Culf, Mousavi and Spirig (arXiv:2312.16765), along with evidence for a sharp computability gap in the non-commutative Max-$3$-Cut problem. We also prove that there is some $\alpha \in (0,1)$ such that determining the non-commutative (respectively, commuting operator framework) versions of the Max-$3$-Cut of a graph within a factor of $\alpha$ is uncomputable. All of these results avoid use of the unique games conjecture.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic topological passage based on coupling of giant atom with two Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an adiabatic topological passage of two Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains mediated by a giant atom. When two finite SSH chains are in the topological phase and the frequency of the giant atom is equal to the center frequency of the SSH chains, the system is reduced to a subsystem that describes the coupling of a giant atom to the edge states of two SSH chains. In this case, we can find dark states that act as adiabatic topological passages. This allows us to adiabatically transfer excitations of the giant atom to either one end of two SSH chains in a fully controllable way. In addition, we show good robustness of the adiabatic topological passages to both giant atom frequency mismatch and the coupling disorders in two SSH chains. Our study provides a method to realize quantum information processing and fabricate quantum optical devices based on the coupling of the giant atom to topological matter.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Connection Patterns between Mobile Phones and Base Stations using Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In current mobile networks, optimizing which base station a mobile phone in a particular area connects to is crucial for ensuring good communication quality for each mobile phone but presents a challenging combinatorial optimization problem. In this study, we optimize the connection patterns to base stations using quantum annealing which is a generic solver using quantum fluctuation. However, since the number of qubits on a quantum annealer is limited, it is necessary to consider a formulation that efficiently utilizes qubits. By adopting a variable reduction formulation, we significantly reduce the qubit requirements compared to the naive formulation that is typically used when considering pattern-matching problems. Furthermore, experiments using quantum annealing revealed that the accuracy of the approximate solution obtained by the new formulation is superior to that of the conventional formulation. Additionally, we demonstrate that the new formulation provides better solutions than the conventional formulation as the problem size increases, even when using simulated annealing, the classical counterpart of quantum annealing.</description>

      <title>Comparative Performance Analysis of Quantum Machine Learning Architectures for Credit Card Fraud Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As financial fraud becomes increasingly complex, effective detection methods are essential. Quantum Machine Learning (QML) introduces certain capabilities that may enhance both accuracy and efficiency in this area. This study examines how different quantum feature map and ansatz configurations affect the performance of three QML-based classifiers-the Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC), the Sampler Quantum Neural Network (SQNN), and the Estimator Quantum Neural Network (EQNN)-when applied to two non-standardized financial fraud datasets. Different quantum feature map and ansatz configurations are evaluated, revealing distinct performance patterns. The VQC consistently demonstrates strong classification results, achieving an F1 score of 0.88, while the SQNN also delivers promising outcomes. In contrast, the EQNN struggles to produce robust results, emphasizing the challenges presented by non-standardized data. These findings highlight the importance of careful model configuration in QML-based financial fraud detection. By showing how specific feature maps and ansatz choices influence predictive success, this work guides researchers and practitioners in refining QML approaches for complex financial applications.</description>

      <title>Exponentially accurate open quantum simulation via randomized dissipation with minimal ancilla</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating open quantum systems is an essential technique for understanding complex physical phenomena and advancing quantum technologies. Some quantum algorithms for simulating Lindblad dynamics achieve logarithmically short circuit depth in terms of accuracy $\varepsilon$ by coherently encoding all possible jump processes with a large ancilla consumption. Minimizing the space complexity while achieving such a logarithmic depth remains an important challenge. In this work, we present a quantum algorithm for simulating general Lindblad dynamics with multiple jump operators aimed at an observable estimation, that achieves both a logarithmically short circuit depth and a minimum ancilla size. Toward simulating an exponentially accurate Taylor expansion of the Lindblad propagator to ensure the circuit depth of $\mathcal{O} (\log(1/\varepsilon))$, we develop a novel random circuit compilation method that leverages dissipative processes with only a single jump operator; importantly, the proposed method requires the minimal-size, $4 + \lceil \log M \rceil$, ancilla qubits where each single jump operator has at most $M$ Pauli strings. This work represents a significant step towards making open quantum system simulations more feasible on early fault-tolerant quantum computing devices.</description>

      <title>Traversing Quantum Control Robustness Landscapes: A New Paradigm for Quantum Gate Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimization of robust quantum control is often tailored to specific tasks and suffers from inefficiencies due to the complexity of cost functions that account for gate infidelity, noise susceptibility, and intricate constraints. Our recent findings suggest a more efficient approach through the engineering of quantum gates, beginning with any arbitrary robust control configuration. We first introduce the Quantum Control Robustness Landscape (QCRL), a conceptual framework that maps control parameters to noise susceptibility. This framework facilitates a systematic investigation of equally robust controls for diverse quantum operations. By navigating through the level sets of the QCRL, our algorithm Robustness-Invariant Pulse Variation allows for the variation of control pulses while preserving robustness. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our single- and two-qubit gates exceed the quantum error correction threshold even with substantial noise, thereby relaxing the extremely stringent noise protection mechanisms in quantum computing systems. This methodology opens up a new paradigm for quantum gate engineering capable of effectively suppressing generic noise.</description>

      <title>A C-Band Cryogenic GaAs MMIC Low-Noise Amplifier for Quantum Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale superconducting quantum computers require massive numbers of high-performance cryogenic low-noise amplifiers (cryo-LNA) for qubit readout. Here we present a C-Band monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) cryo-LNA for this purpose. This cryo-LNA is based on 150 nm GaAs pseudomorphic high electron mobility transistor (pHEMT) process and implemented with a three-stage cascaded architecture, where the first stage adopts careful impedance match to optimize the noise and return loss. The integration of negative feedback loops adopted in the second and third-stage enhances the overall stability. Moreover, the pHEMT-self bias and current multiplexing circuitry structure facilitate the reduction of power consumption and require only single bias line. Operating at an ambient temperature of 3.6 K and consuming 15 mW, the cryo-LNA demonstrates good performance in the C-band, reaching a 5 K equivalent noise temperature and an average gain of 40 dB. We further benchmark this cryo-LNA with superconducting qubits, achieving an average single-shot dispersive readout fidelity of 98.3% without assistance from a quantum-limited parametric amplifier. The development of GaAs cryo-LNA diversifies technical support necessary for large-scale quantum applications.</description>

      <title>GHZ-W Genuinely Entangled Subspace Verification with Adaptive Local Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genuinely entangled subspaces (GESs) are valuable resources in quantum information science. Among these, the three-qubit GHZ-W GES, spanned by the three-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and W states, is a universal and crucial entangled subspace resource for three-qubit systems. In this work, we develop two adaptive verification strategies, the XZ strategy and the rotation strategy, for the three-qubit GHZ-W GES using local measurements and one-way classical communication. These strategies are experimentally feasible, efficient and possess a concise analytical expression for the sample complexity of the rotation strategy, which scales approximately as $2.248/\epsilon\ln(1/\delta)$, where $\epsilon$ is the infidelity and $1-\delta$ is the confidence level. Furthermore, we comprehensively analyze the two-dimensional two-qubit subspaces and classify them into three distinct types, including unverifiable entangled subspaces, revealing intrinsic limitations in local verification of entangled subspaces.</description>

      <title>Single-qubit quantum gate at an arbitrary speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information processing comprises physical processes, which obey the quantum speed limit (QSL): high speed requires strong driving. Single-qubit gates using Rabi oscillation, which is based on the rotating wave approximation (RWA), satisfy this bound in the form that the gate time $T$ is inversely proportional to the Rabi frequency $\Omega$, characterizing the driving strength. However, if the gate time is comparable or shorter than the qubit period $T_{0} \equiv 2\pi / \omega_{0}$, the RWA actually breaks down since the Rabi frequency has to be large compared to the qubit frequency $\omega_{0}$ due to the QSL, which is given as $T \gtrsim \pi/\Omega$. We show that it is possible to construct a universal set of single-qubit gates at this strong-coupling and ultrafast regime, by adjusting the central frequency $\omega$ and the Rabi frequency $\Omega$ of the driving pulse. We observe a transition in the scaling behavior of the central frequency from the long-gate time regime ($T \gg T_{0}$) to the short-gate time ($T \ll T_{0}$) regime. In the former, the central frequency is nearly resonant to the qubit, i.e., $\omega \simeq \omega_{0}$, whereas in the latter, the central frequency is inversely proportional to the gate time, i.e., $\omega \sim \pi/T$. We identify the transition gate time at which the scaling exponent $n$ of the optimal central frequency $\omega \sim T^{n}$ changes from $n=0$ to $n=-1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically addressable electron spin clusters are of interest for quantum computation, simulation and sensing. However, with interaction length scales of a few tens of nanometers in the strong coupling regime, they are unresolved in conventional confocal microscopy, making individual readout problematic. Here we show that when using a single shot readout technique, collective states of the combined register space become accessible. By using spin to charge conversion of the defects we draw the connection between the intricate photon count statistics with spin state tomography using deep neural networks. This approach is particularly versatile with further scaling the number of constituent spins in a cluster due to complexity of the analytical treatment. We perform a proof of concept measurement of the correlated classical signal, paving the way for using our technique in realistic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the ground-state energy of Hamiltonians in quantum systems is an important task. In this work, we demonstrate that the ground-state energy can be accurately estimated without controlled time evolution by using adiabatic state preparation (ASP) and Ramsey-type measurement. By considering the symmetry of the Hamiltonian governing the time evolution during ASP, we can prepare a superposition of the ground state and reference state whose eigenvalue is known. This enables the estimation of the ground-state energy via Ramsey-type measurement. Furthermore, our method is robust against non-adiabatic transitions, making it suitable for use with early fault-tolerant quantum computers and quantum annealing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of a system coupled to a suitable environment is a promising approach in quantum computing for determining the ground state of physical systems. However, this approach requires not only the $\textit{existence}$ of an environment that allows the system to dissipate energy and evolve to its ground state, but also the environment's characteristics to be $\textit{known}$ in detail. In this paper, we propose an algorithm with a sufficient condition for achieving polynomial-time complexity in ground state preparation: the existence of an environment that enables the system to evolve to its ground state in polynomial time, while such environment's details may remain $\textit{unknown}$. The proposed algorithm is Super-bath Quantum Eigensolver, which solves the system's ground state by utilizing quasi-steady state preparation and simulating the coupling between the system and the super-bath. Supported by experimental lifetime data of nuclear metastable states, we suggest that our algorithm is applicable to determine nuclear ground states in polynomial time. These results highlight the potential advantage of quantum computing in addressing ground state problems in real-world physical systems.</description>

      <title>Achieving Robust Single-Photon Blockade with a Single Nanotip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backscattering losses, due to intrinsic imperfections or external perturbations that are unavoidable in optical resonators, can severely affect the performance of practical photonic devices. In particular, for quantum single-photon devices, robust quantum correlations against backscattering losses, which are highly desirable for diverse applications, have remained largely unexplored. Here, we show that single-photon blockade against backscattering loss, an important purely quantum effect, can be achieved by introducing a nanotip near a Kerr nonlinear resonator with intrinsic defects. We find that the quantum correlation of single photons can approach that of a lossless cavity even in the presence of strong backscattering losses. Moreover, the behavior of such quantum correlation is distinct from that of the classical mean-photon number with different strengths of the nonlinearity, due to the interplay of the resonator nonlinearity and the tip-induced optical coupling. Our work sheds new light on protecting and engineering fragile quantum devices against imperfections, for applications in robust single-photon sources and backscattering-immune quantum devices.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Mixer Allocation Algorithm for the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Hadfield et al. proposed the quantum alternating operator ansatz algorithm (QAOA+), an extension of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), to solve constrained combinatorial optimization problems (CCOPs). Compared with QAOA, QAOA+ enables the search for optimal solutions within a feasible solution space by encoding problem constraints into the mixer Hamiltonian, thus reducing the search space and eliminating the possibility of yielding infeasible solutions. However, QAOA+ may require substantial gates and circuit depth when the mixer is applied to all qubits in each layer, and the implementation cost of the mixer is high. To address these challenges, we propose the adaptive mixer allocation (AMA) algorithm. AMA constructs a feasible space by selectively applying the mixer to partial qubits in each layer based on the evolution of the optimization process. The performance of AMA in solving the maximum independent set (MIS) problem is investigated. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that, under the same number of optimization runs, AMA achieves a higher optimal approximation ratio--$1.82\%$ ($3.02\%$) higher than QAOA+ on ER (3-regular) graphs. Additionally, AMA significantly reduces the resource consumption, achieving only $34.08\%$ ($29.77\%$) of QAOA+ circuit depth and $15.05\%$ ($18.72\%$) of the number of CNOT gates, respectively, on ER (3-regular) graphs. These results highlight the ability of AMA to enhance computational efficiency and solution quality, making it particularly valuable for resource-constrained quantum devices.</description>

      <title>An unholy trinity: TFNP, polynomial systems, and the quantum satisfiability problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of Total Function NP (TFNP) and its subclasses says that, even if one is promised an efficiently verifiable proof exists for a problem, finding this proof can be intractable. Despite the success of the theory at showing intractability of problems such as computing Brouwer fixed points and Nash equilibria, subclasses of TFNP remain arguably few and far between. In this work, we define two new subclasses of TFNP borne of the study of complex polynomial systems: Multi-homogeneous Systems (MHS) and Sparse Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (SFTA). The first of these is based on B\'ezout's theorem from algebraic geometry, marking the first TFNP subclass based on an algebraic geometric principle. At the heart of our study is the computational problem known as Quantum SAT (QSAT) with a System of Distinct Representatives (SDR), first studied by [Laumann, L\"auchli, Moessner, Scardicchio, and Sondhi 2010]. Among other results, we show that QSAT with SDR is MHS-complete, thus giving not only the first link between quantum complexity theory and TFNP, but also the first TFNP problem whose classical variant (SAT with SDR) is easy but whose quantum variant is hard. We also show how to embed the roots of a sparse, high-degree, univariate polynomial into QSAT with SDR, obtaining that SFTA is contained in a zero-error version of MHS. We conjecture this construction also works in the low-error setting, which would imply SFTA is contained in MHS.</description>

      <title>Continuous majorization in quantum phase space with Wigner negativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different variants of partial orders among quantum states arise naturally in the context of various quantum resources. For example, in discrete variable quantum computation, stabilizer operations naturally produce an order between input and output states; in technical terms this order is vector majorization of discrete Wigner functions in discrete phase space. The order results in inequalities for magic monotones. In the continuous variable case, a natural counterpart would be continuous majorization of Wigner functions in quantum phase space. Indeed, this concept was recently proposed and explored (mostly restricting to the single-mode case) in Van Herstraeten, Jabbour, Cerf, Quantum 7, 1021 (2023). In this work, we develop the theory of continuous majorization in the general $N$-mode case. In particular, we propose extensions to include states with finite Wigner negativity. Among our results, we prove a conjecture made by Van Herstraeten, Jabbour and Cerf for the convex hull of $N$-mode Gaussian states, and a phase space counterpart of Uhlmann's theorem of majorization.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-Driven Energy Exchange in a Two-Qubit Quantum Battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the dynamics of quantum batteries (QBs), focusing on the pivotal role of quantum entanglement in mediating inter-cellular energy transfer within a two-cell configuration (two-qubit), wherein one cell is directly coupled to the charging source. Employing the Lindblad master equation to model the system's evolution, the influence of coherent state amplitudes, detuning, inter-cellular coupling strength, and dissipation rates on stored energy, energy fluctuations, concurrence-quantified entanglement, and their parametric interrelations is scrutinized. Our results indicate a direct correlation between the degree of entanglement and energy transfer efficiency between the qubits. Specifically, the stronger the entanglement between primary cell, which is connected to the charger, and secondary cell, the more effectively energy is transferred. This demonstrates that enhanced entanglement significantly facilitates energy transfer between the two qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the recently introduced particle interpretation of the double-slit experiment [arXiv:2112.05512 (2024)], all interference phenomena can be reinterpreted in terms of particle states that couple (bright) or do not couple (dark) with the detectors. Here, we extend the two-mode analysis to multiple modes, particularly mode-locked pulsed lasers, and show that collective particle states of multiple light modes feature a significantly larger number of dark than bright states. By linking interference in time-independent multi-slit experiments (same-mode frequencies) to time-dependent multimode experiments (different frequencies), we demonstrate that pulsed laser light comprises a continuous photon beam, with photons forming bright states during pulses and dark states between them. To confirm this, we analyzed mode-locked lasers, finding that the ratio of the number of bright to dark states aligns with the pulse-to-interval duration ratio.</description>

      <title>Transmon qutrit-based simulation of spin-1 AKLT systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qutrit-based quantum circuits could help reduce the overall circuit depths, and hence the noise, when the system of interest has local dimension of three. Accessing second excited states in superconducting transmons provides a straightforward hardware realization of three-level systems, or qutrits, useful for such ternary encoding. In this work, we successfully calibrate pulse gates to a low error rate to obtain transmon qutrits. We use these qutrits to simulate one-dimensional spin-1 AKLT states (Affleck, Lieb, Kennedy, and Tasaki) which exhibit a multitude of interesting phenomena such as topologically protected ground states, string order and the existence of a robust Berry phase. We demonstrate the efficacy of qutrit-based simulation by preparing high-fidelity ground states of the AKLT Hamiltonian with open boundaries for various chain lengths. We then use ground state preparations of the perturbed AKLT Hamiltonian with periodic boundaries to calculate the Berry phase and illustrate non-trivial ground state topology. We further present scalable methods for preparing the AKLT state and computing its Berry phase, and use tensor network simulations to establish the advantage of qutrit-based implementation over qubit-based ones in the presence of noise. Our work provides a pathway toward more general spin-1 physics simulations using transmon qutrits, with applications in chemistry, magnetism, and topological phases of matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize Krylov construction to periodically driven (Floquet) quantum systems using the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle. Compared to other approaches, our method works faster and maps any quantum dynamics to a one-dimensional tight-binding Krylov chain. We also suggest a classification of chaotic and integrable Floquet systems based on the asymptotic behavior of Krylov chain hopping parameters (Verblunsky coefficients). We illustrate this classification with random matrix ensembles, kicked top, and kicked Ising chain.</description>

      <title>Entangled dual-comb spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical frequency combs have emerged as a cornerstone for a wide range of areas, including spectroscopy, ranging, optical clocks, time and frequency transfer, waveform synthesis, and communications. However, quantum mechanical fluctuations of the optical carrier impose fundamental performance limits on the precision of traditional classical laser frequency combs, particularly in their use for interferometry and spectroscopy. Entanglement, as a quintessential quantum resource, allows for surpassing the fundamental limits of classical systems. Here, we introduce and experimentally demonstrate entangled dual-comb spectroscopy (EDCS) that surmounts the fundamental limits of classical DCS. EDCS builds on tailored entangled spectral structures of the frequency combs, enabling simultaneous detection of all comb lines below the standard quantum limit of classical DCS. Applying EDCS in gas detection, we achieve a 2.6 dB enhancement in signal-to-noise ratio and a 1.7-fold reduction in integration time over classical DCS, rendering EDCS particularly suited for dynamic chemical and biological sensing, where fast, precise measurements subject to power constraints are required. EDCS represents a new paradigm for quantum frequency combs, underscoring their prospects in a plethora of applications in precision metrology, spectroscopy, and timekeeping.</description>

      <title>Concentration of ergotropy in many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ergotropy -- the maximal amount of unitarily extractable work -- measures the ``charge level'' of quantum batteries. We prove that in large many-body batteries ergotropy exhibits a concentration of measure phenomenon. Namely, the ergotropy of such systems is almost constant for almost all states sampled from the Hilbert--Schmidt measure. We establish this by first proving that ergotropy, as a function of the state, is Lipschitz-continuous with respect to the Bures distance, and then applying Levy's measure concentration lemma. In parallel, we showcase the analogous properties of von Neumann entropy, compiling and adapting known results about its continuity and concentration properties. Furthermore, we consider the situation with the least amount of prior information about the state. This corresponds to the quantum version of the Jeffreys prior distribution -- the Bures measure. In this case, there exist no analytical bounds guaranteeing exponential concentration of measure. Nonetheless, we provide numerical evidence that ergotropy, as well as von Neumann entropy, concentrate also in this case.</description>

      <title>A local automaton for the 2D toric code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a local decoder for the 2D toric code using ideas from the hierarchical classical cellular automata of Tsirelson and G\'acs. Our decoder is a circuit of strictly local quantum operations preserving a logical state for exponential time in the presence of circuit-level noise without the need for non-local classical computation or communication. Our construction is not translation invariant in spacetime, but can be made time-translation invariant in 3D with stacks of 2D toric codes. This solves the open problem of constructing a local topological quantum memory below four dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An ansatz applied to the two-dimensional Ising model in an external magnetic field h gives rise to an exactly soluble model. The singularity in the magnetization found by Onsager does not survive the presence of the external magnetic field as found earlier by Lee and Yang in 1952. However, the singularity in the heat capacity remains even in the presence of the magnetic field. A surprising result is the presence of negative heat capacity for h &gt; 0.</description>

      <title>Efficient Circuit Cutting and Scheduling in a Multi-Node Quantum System with Dynamic EPR Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite advancements, current quantum hardware faces significant challenges, including limited qubit counts and high susceptibility to noise, which hinder the execution of large, complex algorithms. To address these limitations, multi-node quantum systems and quantum circuit cutting techniques partition large circuits into smaller subcircuits that can be executed on individual quantum machines and then reconstructed using classical resources. However, these methods introduce new challenges, such as the large overhead from subcircuit reconstruction and additional noise from entangled EPR pairs, especially in multi-node quantum systems. In this paper, we propose the Efficient Circuit Cutting and Scheduling (EC2S) system, which integrates EPR pairs with circuit cutting to address these issues. EC2S improves system performance by transitioning from logical to physical EPR pairs and further reduces computational overhead by minimizing the number of subcircuits during the reconstruction phase. \sol~ is implemented using Qiskit and evaluated on both real quantum hardware and various emulators. Compared to the state-of-the-art Qiskit-Addon-Cut, EC2S achieves significant improvements in fidelity, up to 16.7\%, and reduces system-wide expenditure by up to 99.5\%.</description>

      <title>The moments of the spectral form factor in SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In chaotic quantum systems the spectral form factor exhibits a universal linear ramp and plateau structure with superimposed erratic oscillations. The mean signal and the statistics of the noise can be probed by the moments of the spectral form factor, also known as higher-point spectral form factors. We identify saddle points in the SYK model that describe the moments during the ramp region. Perturbative corrections around the saddle point indicate that SYK mimics random matrix statistics for the low order moments, while large deviations for the high order moments arise from fluctuations near the edge of the spectrum. The leading correction scales inversely with the number of random parameters in the SYK Hamiltonian and is amplified in a sparsified version of the SYK model, which we study numerically, even in regimes where a linear ramp persists. Finally, we study the $q=2$ SYK model, whose spectral form factor exhibits an exponential ramp with increased noise. These findings reveal how deviations from random matrix universality arise in disordered systems and motivate their interpretation from a bulk gravitational perspective.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the quench dynamics of a two-dimensional Rashba spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate. Our study focuses on quenching the system from a zero-momentum phase to a plane-wave phase. During this quench, topological defects emerge in the form of vortices. These vortices and anti-vortices exhibit a random spatial distribution with equal numbers, mirroring the core principles of Kosterlitz-Thouless physics. In a uniform system, we observe an exponential scaling of both the vortex production time and the vortex number with the quench rate, consistent with the conventional Kibble-Zurek mechanism. The decay of which adheres to a logarithmic law, aligning with experimental observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Ising models with transverse and longitudinal fields on the hypercubic lattices with dimensions higher than one have no local conserved quantities other than the Hamiltonian. This holds for any value of the longitudinal field, including zero, as far as the transverse field and the Ising interactions are nonzero. The conserved quantity considered here is ``local'' in a very weak sense: it can be written as a linear combination of operators whose side lengths of the supports in one direction do not exceed half the system size, while the side lengths in the other directions are arbitrary. We also prove that the above result holds even in the ladder system. Our results extend the recently developed technique of the proof of absence of local conserved quantities in one-dimensional systems to higher dimensions and to the ladder.</description>

      <title>Diffraction of walking drops by a standing Faraday wave</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kapitza-Dirac effect is the diffraction of quantum particles by a standing wave of light. We here report an analogous phenomenon in pilot-wave hydrodynamics, wherein droplets walking across the surface of a vibrating liquid bath are deflected by a standing Faraday wave. We show that, in certain parameter regimes, the statistical distribution of the droplet deflection angles reveals a diffraction pattern reminiscent of that observed in the Kapitza-Dirac effect. Through experiments and simulations, we show that the diffraction pattern results from the complex interactions of the droplets with the standing wave. Our study highlights non-resonant effects associated with the detuning of the droplet bouncing and the bath vibration, which are shown to lead to drop speed variations and droplet sorting according to the droplet's phase of impact. We discuss the similarities and differences between our hydrodynamic system and the discrete and continuum interpretations of the Kapitza-Dirac effect, and introduce the notion of ponderomotive effects in pilot-wave hydrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how Carrollian symmetries become important in the construction of one-dimensional fermionic systems with all flat-band spectra from first principles. The key ingredient of this construction is the identification of Compact Localised States (CLSs), which appear naturally by demanding $\textit{supertranslation}$ invariance of the system. We use CLS basis states, with inherent $\textit{ultra-local}$ correlations, to write down an interacting theory which shows a non-trivial phase structure and an emergent Carroll conformal symmetry at the gapless points. We analyze this theory in detail for both zero and finite chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Transferring vibrational states of trapped atoms via a Rydberg electron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show theoretically that it is possible to coherently transfer vibrational excitation between trapped neutral atoms over a micrometer apart. To this end we consider three atoms, where two are in the electronic ground state and one is excited to a Rydberg state whose electronic orbital overlaps with the positional wave functions of the two ground-state atoms. The resulting scattering of the Rydberg electron with the ground-state atoms provides the interaction required to transfer vibrational excitation from one trapped atom to the other. By numerically investigating the dependence of the transfer dynamics on the distance between traps and their relative frequencies we find that there is a "sweet spot" where the transfer of a vibrational excitation is nearly perfect and fast compared to the Rydberg lifetime. We investigate the robustness of this scenario with respect to changes of the parameters. In addition, we derive a intuitive effective Hamiltonian which explains the observed dynamics.</description>

      <title>The light-matter correlation energy functional of the cavity-coupled two-dimensional electron gas via quantum Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform extensive simulations of the two-dimensional cavity-coupled electron gas in a modulating potential as a minimal model for cavity quantum materials. These simulations are enabled by a newly developed quantum-electrodynamical (QED) auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method. We present a procedure to greatly reduce finite-size effects in such calculations. Based on our results, we show that a modified version of weak-coupling perturbation theory is remarkably accurate for a large parameter region. We further provide a simple parameterization of the light-matter correlation energy as a functional of the cavity parameters and the electronic density. These results provide a numerical foundation for the development of the QED density functional theory, which was previously reliant on analytical approximations, to allow quantitative modeling of a wide range of systems with light-matter coupling.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of a chiral scalar on the torus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the entanglement entropy of an interval for a chiral scalar on a circle at an arbitrary temperature. We use the resolvent method, which involves expressing the entropy in terms of the resolvent of a certain operator, and we compute that resolvent by solving a problem that entails finding an analytic function on the complex torus with certain jump conditions at the interval. The resolvent is relevant by itself, since it can be used to compute any function of the reduced density matrix. We illustrate that by also computing all the R\'enyi entropies for the model.</description>

      <title>Significant circular Unruh effect at small acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the transition rates of an atom rotating in a circular orbit, which is coupled with fluctuating electromagnetic fields in vacuum. We find that when the rotational angular velocity exceeds the transition frequency of the atom, the excitation rate can reach the same order of magnitude as the emission rate, even with an extremely low centripetal acceleration resulting from a very small orbital radius. For experimentally accessible centripetal accelerations, the excitation rate of centripetally accelerated atoms can be up to ten to the power of two hundred thousand times that of linearly accelerated atoms with the same acceleration. Our result suggests that the circular version of the Unruh effect can be significant even at very small centripetal accelerations, contrary to the common belief that a large Unruh effect requires large acceleration. This finding sheds new light on the experimental detection of the circular Unruh effect.</description>

      <title>Two superconducting thin films systems with potential integration of different quantum functionalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computation based on superconducting circuits utilizes superconducting qubits with Josephson tunnel junctions. Engineering high-coherence qubits requires materials optimization. In this work, we present two superconducting thin film systems, grown on silicon (Si), and one obtained from the other via annealing. Cobalt (Co) thin films grown on Si were found to be superconducting [EPL 131 (2020) 47001]. These films also happen to be a self-organised hybrid superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor (S/F/S) structure. The S/F/S hybrids are important for superconducting $\pi$-qubits [PRL 95 (2005) 097001] and in quantum information processing. Here we present our results on the superconductivity of a hybrid Co film followed by the superconductivity of a CoSi$_2$ film, which was prepared by annealing the Co film. CoSi$_2$, with its $1/f$ noise about three orders of magnitude smaller compared to the most commonly used superconductor aluminium (Al), is a promising material for high-coherence qubits. The hybrid Co film revealed superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ = 5 K and anisotropy in the upper critical field between the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. The anisotropy was of the order of ratio of lateral dimensions to thickness of the superconducting Co grains, suggesting a quasi-2D nature of superconductivity. On the other hand, CoSi$_2$ film showed a $T_c$ of 900 mK. In the resistivity vs. temperature curve, we observe a peak near $T_c$. Magnetic field scan as a function of $T$ shows a monotonic increase in intensity of this peak with temperature. The origin of the peak has been explained in terms of parallel resistive model for the particular measurement configuration. Although our CoSi$_2$ film contains grain boundaries, we observed a perpendicular critical field of 15 mT and a critical current density of 3.8x10$^7$ A/m$^2$, comparable with epitaxial CoSi$_2$ films.</description>

      <title>HBT interferometry and Quantum Detection of Primordial Gravitational Waves in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity (to be precise, its projectable version) is recognized as a renormalizable, unitary, and asymptotically free quantum field theory of gravity. Notably, one of its cosmological predictions is that it can produce scale-invariant primordial density fluctuations and primordial gravitational waves without relying on inflation. In this paper, we investigate the quantum nature of the primordial gravitational waves generated in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity. It has been suggested that, for some inflationary models, the non-classicality of primordial gravitational waves in the squeezed coherent quantum state can be detected using the Hanbury Brown - Twiss (HBT) interferometry. We show that in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity, scale-invariant primordial gravitational waves can be generated during both the radiation-dominated and matter-dominated eras of the Universe. Moreover, the frequency range of their quantum signatures is shown to extend beyond that of inflationary models.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by phenomenology of myriad recently-identified topologically non-trivial phases of matter, we introduce effective field theories (EFTs) for the quantum skyrmion Hall effect (QSkHE). We employ a single, unifying generalisation for this purpose: in essence, a lowest Landau level projection defining a non-commutative, fuzzy sphere with position coordinates proportional to SU(2) generators of matrix representation size $N\times N$, may host an intrinsically 2+1 dimensional, topologically non-trivial many-body state for small $N$ as well as large $N$. That is, isospin degrees of freedom associated with a matrix Lie algebra with $N \times N$ generators potentially encode some finite number of spatial dimensions for $N\ge 2$, a regime in which isospin has previously been treated as a label. This statement extends to more general $p$-branes subjected to severe fuzzification as well as membranes. As a consequence of this generalisation, systems with $d$ Cartesian spatial coordinates and isospin degrees of freedom encoding an additional $\delta$ fuzzy coset space coordinates can realise topologically non-trivial states of intrinsic dimensionality up to $d$+$\delta$+1. We therefore identify gauge theories with extra fuzzy dimensions generalised to retain dependence upon gauge fields over fuzzy coset spaces even for severe fuzzification (small $N$), as EFTs for the QSkHE. We furthermore generalise these EFTs to space manifolds with local product structure exploiting the dimensional hierarchy of (fuzzy) spheres. For this purpose, we introduce methods of anisotropic fuzzification and propose formulating topological invariants on fuzzy coset spaces as artifacts of projecting matrix Lie algebras to occupied subspaces. Importantly, we focus on phenomenology indicating the 2+1 D SU(2) gauge theory should be generalised using this machinery, and serves as a minimal EFT of the QSkHE.</description>

      <title>Signatures of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect in the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given recent discovery of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, we re-examine the related canonical Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Within the framework of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, isospin degree(s) of freedom of the BHZ model encode additional spatial dimensions. Consistent with this framework, we observe phenomena similar to those of the four dimensional Chern insulator, revealed by weakly breaking time-reversal symmetry. Bulk-boundary correspondence of these states includes real-space boundary orbital angular momentum textures and gapless boundary modes that are robust against magnetic disorder, consistent with compactified three dimensional boundary Weyl nodes (WN$_F$s) of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. These theoretical findings are furthermore consistent with past experimental work reporting unexpected edge conduction in HgTe quantum wells under applied Zeeman and orbital magnetic fields. This past work is therefore potentially the first known experimental observation of signatures of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect beyond the quantum Hall effect.</description>

      <title>A non-semisimple non-invertible symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the action of a non-semisimple, non-invertible symmetry on spin chains, whose topological defects encode the category of modules over the Taft algebra of dimension 4. Sacrificing Hermiticity, we construct several symmetric, frustration-free, gapped Hamiltonians with real spectra and analyse their ground state subspaces. Our study reveals two intriguing phenomena. First, we identify an $\mathbb{S}^1$-parametrised family of symmetric states, all of which belong to the same gapped phase with respect to the invertible subsymmetry, yet transform inequivalently under the non-semisimple symmetry. Second, we find a model where a product state and the so-called W state spontaneously break the symmetry. We further relate the indistinguishability of these two states in the infinite-volume limit to the notion that they are associated with a simple object and its projective cover, respectively, in a non-semisimple module category.</description>

      <title>Celestial Quantum Error Correction II: From Qudits to Celestial CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A holographic CFT description of asymptotically flat spacetimes inherits vacuum degeneracies and IR divergences from its gravitational dual. We devise a Quantum Error Correcting (QEC) framework to encode both effects as correctable fluctuations on the CFT dual. The framework is physically motivated by embedding a chain of qudits in the so-called Klein spacetime and then taking a continuum $N\to \infty$ limit. At finite $N$ the qudit chain 1) enjoys a discrete version of celestial symmetries and 2) supports a Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code. The limit results in hard states with quantized BMS hair in the celestial torus forming the logical subspace, robust under errors induced by soft radiation. Technically, the construction leverages the recently studied $w_{1+\infty}$ hierarchy of soft currents and its realization from a sigma model in twistor space.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cluster State Model with Haagerup Fusion Category Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a (1+1)D lattice model, inspired by a weak Hopf algebra generalization of the cluster state model, which realizes Haagerup fusion category symmetry and features a tensor product Hilbert space. The construction begins with a reconstruction of the Haagerup weak Hopf algebra $H_3$ from the Haagerup fusion category, ensuring that the representation category of $H_3$ is equivalent to Haagerup fusion category. Utilizing the framework of symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), we develop an ultra-thin weak Hopf quantum double model, characterized by a smooth topological boundary condition. We show that this model supports Haagerup fusion category symmetry. Finally, we solve the ground state of the model in terms of a weak Hopf matrix product state, which serves as a natural generalization of the cluster state, embodying Haagerup fusion category symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform three-photon photoassociation to obtain high resolution spectra of $^{87}$Rb trilobite dimers for the principal quantum numbers $n = 22,24,25,26$, and 27. The large binding energy of the molecules in combination with a relative spectroscopic resolution of $10^{-4}$ provides a rigorous benchmark for existing theoretical models. A recently developed Green's function framework, which circumvents the convergence issues that afflicted previous studies,, is employed to theoretically reproduce the vibrational spectrum of the molecule with high accuracy. The relatively large molecular binding energy are primarily determined by the low energy $S$-wave electron-atom scattering length, thereby allowing us to extract the $^3S_1$ scattering phase shift with unprecedented accuracy, at low energy regimes inaccessible to free electrons.</description>

      <title>Tensor Network Estimation of Distribution Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks are a tool first employed in the context of many-body quantum physics that now have a wide range of uses across the computational sciences, from numerical methods to machine learning. Methods integrating tensor networks into evolutionary optimization algorithms have appeared in the recent literature. In essence, these methods can be understood as replacing the traditional crossover operation of a genetic algorithm with a tensor network-based generative model. We investigate these methods from the point of view that they are Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs). We find that optimization performance of these methods is not related to the power of the generative model in a straightforward way. Generative models that are better (in the sense that they better model the distribution from which their training data is drawn) do not necessarily result in better performance of the optimization algorithm they form a part of. This raises the question of how best to incorporate powerful generative models into optimization routines. In light of this we find that adding an explicit mutation operator to the output of the generative model often improves optimization performance.</description>

      <title>g-factor theory of Si/SiGe quantum dots: spin-valley and giant renormalization effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the $g$-factor physics of Si/SiGe quantum dots is crucial for realizing high-quality spin qubits. While previous work has explained some aspects of $g$-factor physics in idealized geometries, the results do not extend to general cases and they miss several important features. Here, we construct a theory that gives $g$ in terms of readily computable matrix elements, and can be applied to all Si/SiGe heterostructures of current interest. As a concrete example, which currently has no $g$-factor understanding, we study the so-called Wiggle Well structure, containing Ge concentration oscillations inside the quantum well. Here we find a significant renormalization of the $g$-factor compared to conventional Si/SiGe quantum wells. We also uncover a giant $g$-factor suppression of order $\mathcal{O}(1)$, which arises due to spin-valley coupling, and occurs at locations of low valley splitting. Our work therefore opens up new avenues for $g$-factor engineering in Si/SiGe quantum dots.</description>

      <title>The Instability of a Quantum Superposition of Time Dilations</title>

      <description>arXiv:1410.2303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the relativistic concept of time dilation we show that a superposition of gravitational potentials can lead to nonunitary time evolution. For sufficiently weak gravitational potentials one can still define, for all intents and purposes, a global coordinate system. A probe particle in a superposition of weak gravitational fields will, however, experience dephasing due to the different time dilations. The corresponding instability timescale is accessible to experiments, and can be used as a degree of macroscopicity. Finally, we suggest an experiment with smoothly tunable amplification in a microwave interferometer that allows a quantitative study of the quantum to classical boundary.</description>

      <title>Proposal for an experiment to verify Wigner's rotation at non-relativistic speeds with massive spin-$1/2$ particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03389</link>

Abstract: The Wigner rotation of quantum particles with spin is one of the fascinating consequences of interplay between special relativity and quantum mechanics. In this paper we show that a direct experimental verification of Wigner's rotation is in principle accessible in the regime of non-relativistic velocities at $\sim 10^3$ m/s for massive spin-$1/2$ particles. We discuss how the experiment could be carried out in a laboratory using cold neutrons. The measurement at non-relativistic velocities becomes possible through letting neutrons propagate for a sufficiently long time because Wigner rotation is a cumulative effect.</description>

      <title>Bipartite polygon models: entanglement classes and their nonlocal behaviour</title>

Abstract: Hardy's argument constitutes an elegantly logical test for identifying nonlocal features of multipartite correlations. In this paper, we investigate Hardy's nonlocal behavior within a broad class of operational theories, including the qubit state space as a specific case. Specifically, we begin by examining a wider range of operational models with state space descriptions in the form of regular polygons. First, we present a systematic method to characterize the possible forms of entangled states within bipartite compositions of these models. Then, through explicit examples, we identify the classes of entangled states that exhibit Hardy-type nonlocality. Remarkably, our findings highlight a closer analogy between odd polygon models and the qubit state space in terms of their bipartite Hardy nonlocal behavior compared to even-sided polygons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the emergence of mixed-state Hardy nonlocality in any operational model is determined by a specific symmetry inherent in its dynamic description. Finally, our results uncover an unexplored class of almost-quantum correlations that can be associated with an explicit operational model.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing can empower machine learning models by enabling kernel machines to leverage quantum kernels for representing similarity measures between data. Quantum kernels are able to capture relationships in the data that are not efficiently computable on classical devices. However, there is no straightforward method to engineer the optimal quantum kernel for each specific use case. We present an approach to this problem, which employs optimization techniques, similar to those used in neural architecture search and AutoML, to automatically find an optimal kernel in a heuristic manner. To this purpose we define an algorithm for constructing a quantum circuit implementing the similarity measure as a combinatorial object, which is evaluated based on a cost function and then iteratively modified using a meta-heuristic optimization technique. The cost function can encode many criteria ensuring favorable statistical properties of the candidate solution, such as the rank of the Dynamical Lie Algebra. Importantly, our approach is independent of the optimization technique employed. The results obtained by testing our approach on a high-energy physics problem demonstrate that, in the best-case scenario, we can either match or improve testing accuracy with respect to the manual design approach, showing the potential of our technique to deliver superior results with reduced effort.</description>

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms, which consist of optimal parameterized quantum circuits, are promising for demonstrating quantum advantages in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. Apart from classical computational resources, different kinds of quantum resources have their contributions to the process of computing, such as information scrambling and entanglement. Characterizing the relation between the complexity of specific problems and quantum resources consumed by solving these problems is helpful for us to understand the structure of VQAs in the context of quantum information processing. In this work, we focus on the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), which aims to solve combinatorial optimization problems. We study information scrambling and entanglement in QAOA circuits, respectively, and discover that for a harder problem, more quantum resource is required for the QAOA circuit to obtain the solution in most cases. We note that in the future, our results can be used to benchmark the complexity of quantum many-body problems by information scrambling or entanglement accumulation in the computing process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04448v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the fourth major release of the xSPDE toolbox, which solves stochastic partial and ordinary differential equations, with applications in biology, chemistry, engineering, medicine, physics and quantum technologies. It computes statistical averages, including time-step and sampling error estimation. xSPDE can provide higher order convergence, Fourier spectra and probability densities. The toolbox has graphical output and $\chi^{2}$ statistics, as well as weighted, projected, or forward-backward equations. It can generate input-output quantum spectra. The equations can have independent periodic, Dirichlet, and Neumann or Robin boundary conditions in any dimension, for any vector component, and at either end of any interval. xSPDE has functions that can numerically solve both ordinary and partial differential stochastic equations of any type, obtaining correlations, probabilities and averages. The toolbox has a core treating stochastic differential equations, with averages, probability distributions and full error estimates. There are stochastic extensions treating applications to partial differential equations, projected equations, quantum stochastic equations, master equations and quantum phase-space simulations including Gaussian boson sampling experiments.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the quantum correlation between light and matter in bipartite quantum systems, drawing on the Jaynes-Cummings model and the Tavis-Cummings model, which are well-established in cavity quantum electrodynamics. Through the resolution of the quantum master equation, we can derive the dissipative dynamics in open systems. To assess the extent of quantum correlation, several measures are introduced: von Neumann entropy, concurrence and quantum discord. The effects of initial entanglement and dissipation intensity on quantum discord are carefully examined. Furthermore, we examined the dynamics of quantum discord within the $\rm{OH}^+$ model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum measurement, often referred to as positive operator-valued measurement (POVM), is a set of positive operators $P_j=P_j^\dag\geq 0$ summing to identity, $\sum_jP_j=\mathbb{1}$. This can be seen as a generalization of a probability distribution of positive real numbers summing to unity, whose evolution is given by a stochastic matrix. We describe discrete transformations in the set of quantum measurements by {\em blockwise stochastic matrices}, composed of positive blocks that sum columnwise to identity, using the notion of {\em sequential product} of matrices. We show that such transformations correspond to a sequence of quantum measurements. Imposing additionally the dual condition that the sum of blocks in each row is equal to identity, we arrive at blockwise bistochastic matrices (also called {\em quantum magic squares}). Analyzing their dynamical properties, we formulate our main result: a quantum analog of the Ostrowski description of the classical Birkhoff polytope, which introduces the notion of majorization between quantum measurements. Our framework provides a dynamical characterization of the set of blockwise bistochastic matrices and establishes a resource theory in this set.</description>

Abstract: Communication security has to evolve to a higher plane in the face of the threat from the massive computing power of the emerging quantum computers. Quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) constitutes a promising branch of quantum communication, which is provably secure and overcomes the threat of quantum computing, whilst conveying secret messages directly via the quantum channel. In this survey, we highlight the motivation and the status of QSDC research with special emphasis on its theoretical basis and experimental verification. We will detail the associated point-to-point communication protocols and show how information is protected and transmitted. Finally, we discuss the open challenges as well as the future trends of QSDC networks, emphasizing again that QSDC is not a pure quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol, but a fully-fledged secure communication scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01965v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase estimation is a major mission in quantum metrology, especially in quantum interferometry. A full phase estimation scheme usually includes the optimal probe state and measurement. For the finite-dimensional states in Fock basis, the N00N state ceases to be optimal when the average particle number is fixed yet not equal to the state dimension minus one, and what is the true optimal finite-dimensional probe state in this case is still undiscovered. Hereby we present several theorems to answer this question and provide a complete optimal scheme to realize the ultimate precision limit in practice. These optimal finite-dimensional probe states reveal an important fact that the state dimension could be treated as a metrological resource, and the given scheme is particularly useful in scenarios where weak light or limited particle number is demanded.</description>

      <title>Efficient and high-performance routing of lattice-surgery paths on three-dimensional lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Encoding logical qubits with surface codes and performing multi-qubit logical operations with lattice surgery is one of the most promising approaches to demonstrate fault-tolerant quantum computing. Thus, a method to efficiently schedule a sequence of lattice-surgery operations is vital for high-performance fault-tolerant quantum computing. A possible strategy to improve the throughput of lattice-surgery operations is splitting a large instruction into several small instructions such as Bell state preparation and measurements and executing a part of them in advance. However, scheduling methods to fully utilize this idea have yet to be explored. In this paper, we propose a fast and high-performance scheduling algorithm for lattice-surgery instructions leveraging this strategy. We achieved this by converting the scheduling problem of lattice-surgery instructions to a graph problem of embedding 3D paths into a 3D lattice, which enables us to explore efficient scheduling by solving path search problems in the 3D lattice. Based on this reduction, we propose a method to solve the path-finding problems, Dijkstra projection. We numerically show that this method reduced the execution time of benchmark programs generated from quantum phase estimation algorithms by 2.7 times compared with a naive method based on greedy algorithms. Our study establishes the relation between the lattice-surgery scheduling and graph search problems, which leads to further theoretical analysis on compiler optimization of fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05080v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement with single-particle states is advantageous in quantum technology because of their ability to encode and process information more securely than their multi-particle analogs. Threeway and nonlocal two-way entangled single-particle states are desirable in this context. Herein, we generate genuine three-way entanglement from an initially separable state involving three degrees of freedom of a quantum particle, which evolves via a 2D alternate quantum walk employing a resource-saving single-qubit coin. We achieve maximum possible values for the three-way entanglement quantified by the {\pi}-tangle between the three degrees of freedom. We also generate optimal nonlocal two-way entanglement, quantified by the negativity between the nonlocal position degrees of freedom of the particle. This prepared architecture using quantum walks can be experimentally realized with a photon.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Improved Dispersive Qubit Readout with Squeezed Light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been a long-standing goal to improve dispersive qubit readout with squeezed light. However, injected external squeezing (IES) {\it cannot} enable a practically interesting increase in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and simultaneously, the increase of the SNR due to the use of intracavity squeezing (ICS) is even {\it negligible}. Here, we {\it counterintuitively} demonstrate that using IES and ICS together can lead to an {\it exponential} improvement of the SNR for any measurement time, corresponding to a measurement error reduced typically by many orders of magnitude. More remarkably, we find that in a short-time measurement, the SNR is even improved exponentially with {\it twice} the squeezing parameter. As a result, we predict a fast and high-fidelity readout. This work offers a promising path toward exploring squeezed light for dispersive qubit readout, with immediate applications in quantum error correction and fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15686v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum-inspired classical algorithms provide us with a new way to understand the computational power of quantum computers for practically-relevant problems, especially in machine learning. In the past several years, numerous efficient algorithms for various tasks have been found, while an analysis of lower bounds is still missing. Using communication complexity, in this work we propose the first method to study lower bounds for these tasks. We mainly focus on lower bounds for solving linear regressions, supervised clustering, principal component analysis, recommendation systems, and Hamiltonian simulations. For those problems, we prove a quadratic lower bound in terms of the Frobenius norm of the underlying matrix. As quantum algorithms are linear in the Frobenius norm for those problems, our results mean that the quantum-classical separation is at least quadratic. As a generalisation, we extend our method to study lower bounds analysis of quantum query algorithms for matrix-related problems using quantum communication complexity. Some applications are given.</description>

      <title>Two-stage Quantum Estimation and the Asymptotics of Quantum-enhanced Transmittance Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider estimation of a single unknown parameter embedded in a quantum state. Quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound (QCRB) is the ultimate limit of the mean squared error for any unbiased estimator. While it can be achieved asymptotically for a large number of quantum state copies, the measurement required often depends on the true value of the parameter of interest. Prior work addresses this paradox using a two-stage approach: in the first stage, a preliminary estimate is obtained by applying, on a vanishing fraction of quantum state copies, a sub-optimal measurement that does not depend on the parameter of interest. In the second stage, the preliminary estimate is used to construct the QCRB-achieving measurement that is applied to the remaining quantum state copies. This is akin to two-step estimators for classical problems with nuisance parameters. Unfortunately, the original analysis imposes conditions that severely restrict the class of classical estimators applied to the quantum measurement outcomes, hindering applications of this method. We relax these conditions to substantially broaden the class of usable estimators for single-parameter problems at the cost of slightly weakening the asymptotic properties of the two-stage method. We also account for nuisance parameters. We apply our results to obtain the asymptotics of quantum-enhanced transmittance sensing.</description>

      <title>Fidelity decay and error accumulation in random quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of fidelity decay and error accumulation in faulty quantum circuit models. Our work devises an analytical bound for the average fidelity between desired and faulty output states, accounting for errors that may arise during the implementation of two-qubit gates and multi-qubit permutations. It is shown that fidelity decays exponentially with both circuit depth and the number of qubits raised to an architecture-dependent power, and determine the decay rates as a function of the two types of errors. Furthermore, we establish a robust linear relationship between fidelity and the heavy output frequency used in Quantum Volume tests to benchmark quantum processors, under the considered errors protocol. These findings pave the way for predicting the behavior of fidelity in the presence of specific errors and offer insights into the best strategies for increasing Quantum Volume.</description>

      <title>Advantage Distillation for Quantum Key Distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution promises information-theoretically secure communication, with data post-processing playing a vital role in extracting secure keys from raw data. While hardware advancements have significantly improved practical implementations, optimizing post-processing techniques offers a cost-effective avenue to enhance performance. Advantage distillation, which extends beyond standard information reconciliation and privacy amplification, has proven instrumental in various post-processing methods. However, the optimal post-processing remains an open question. Therefore, it is important to develop a comprehensive framework to encapsulate and enhance these existing methods. In this work, we propose an advantage distillation framework for quantum key distribution, generalizing and unifying existing key distillation protocols. Inspired by entanglement distillation, our framework not only integrates current techniques but also improves upon them. Notably, by employing classical linear codes, we achieve higher key rates, particularly in scenarios where one-time pad encryption is not used for post-processing. Our approach provides insights into existing protocols and offers a systematic way for further enhancements in quantum key distribution.</description>

      <title>Architecture for fast implementation of qLDPC codes with optimized Rydberg gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an implementation of bivariate bicycle codes (Nature {\bf 627}, 778 (2024)) based on long-range Rydberg gates between stationary neutral atom qubits. An optimized layout of data and ancilla qubits reduces the maximum Euclidean communication distance needed for non-local parity check operators. An optimized Rydberg gate pulse design enables $\sf CZ$ entangling operations with fidelity ${\mathcal F}&gt;0.999$ at a distance greater than $12~\mu\rm m$. The combination of optimized layout and gate design leads to a quantum error correction cycle time of $\sim 1.28~\rm ms$ for a $[[144,12,12]]$ code, nearly a factor of two improvement over previous designs.</description>

      <title>Boosting the generation rate of squeezed single-photon states by generalized photon subtraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In optical quantum information processing with continuous variables, optical non-Gaussian quantum states are essential for universal and fault-tolerant quantum computation. Experimentally, their most typical generation method is photon subtraction (PS), where single-photon detection by an on/off detector probabilistically heralds the generation of squeezed single-photon states. In PS, however, trying to avoid unwanted multiphoton detection inevitably limits the generation rate, hindering the application of squeezed single-photon states. Here, we theoretically show that generalized photon subtraction (GPS), a simple extension of PS, can improve the generation rate while maintaining the quality of the generated states. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate the generation rate improvement for 2-dB- and 4-dB-squeezed single-photon states compared to PS, by more than one order of magnitude, particularly for the case of 2 dB. Our results will accelerate the application of squeezed single-photon states to more advanced quantum information protocols.</description>

      <title>Harmonic generation with topological edge states and electron-electron interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been found previously that the presence or absence of topological edge states in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model has a huge impact on harmonic generation spectra. More specifically, the yield of harmonics for harmonic orders that correspond to photon energies below the band gap is many orders of magnitude different in the trivial and topological phase. It is shown in this work that this effect is still present if electron-electron interaction is taken into account, i.e., if a Hubbard term is added to the SSH Hamiltonian. To that end, finite SSH-Hubbard chains at half filling are considered that are short enough to be accessible to exact diagonalization but already showing edge states in the topological phase. We show that the huge difference in the harmonic yield between the trivial and the topological phase can be reproduced with few-level models employing only the many-body ground state and a few excited many-body states.</description>

      <title>Comparative Study of Quantum Transpilers: Evaluating the Performance of qiskit-braket-provider, qBraid-SDK, and Pytket Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of popular SDK-to-SDK quantum transpilers (that is transpilers that takes a quantum circuit from an initial SDK and output a quantum circuit in another SDK), focusing on critical metrics such as correctness, failure rate, and transpilation time. To ensure unbiased evaluation and accommodate diverse quantum computing scenarios, we developed two dedicated tools: RandomQC, for generating random quantum circuits across various types (pure random, VQE-like, and SDK-specific circuits), and Benchmarq, to streamline the benchmarking process. Using these tools, we benchmarked prominent quantum transpilers as of February 2024. Our results highlight the superior performance of the qiskit-braket-provider, a specialized transpiler from Qiskit to Braket, achieving a remarkably low failure rate of 0.2\%. The qBraid-SDK, offering generalized transpilation across multiple SDKs, demonstrated robust but slower performance. The pytket extensions, while fast, faced limitations with complex circuits due to their one-to-one transpilation approach. In particular, the exceptional performance of the qiskit-bracket-provider stems not only from its specialization but also from its architecture, which combines one-to-one transpilation with gate decomposition for unsupported gates, enhancing both speed and capability. This study aims to provide practical guidelines to users of SDK-to-SDK quantum transpilers and guidance to developers for improving the design and development of future tools.</description>

      <title>Using a Feedback-Based Quantum Algorithm to Analyze the Critical Properties of the ANNNI Model Without Classical Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the critical properties of the Anisotropic Next-Nearest-Neighbor Ising (ANNNI) model using a feedback-based quantum algorithm (FQA). We demonstrate how this algorithm enables the computation of both ground and excited states without relying on classical optimization methods. By exploiting symmetries in the algorithm initialization, we show how targeted initial states can increase convergence and facilitate the study of excited states. Using this approach, we study the quantum phase transitions with the Finite Size Scaling method, analyze correlation functions through spin correlations in the ground state, and examine magnetic structure by calculating structure factors via the Discrete Fourier Transform. Our findings highlight FQA's potential as a versatile tool for studying not only the ANNNI model but also other quantum systems, providing insights into quantum phase transitions and the magnetic properties of complex spin models.</description>

Abstract: Quantum coherence, rooted in the superposition nature of quantum mechanics, is one core quantum resource in quantum technologies. Until now, various measures, operational interpretations and generalizations about coherence have been proposed. In recent years, the role of coherence in quantum dynamics and technologies has attracted much attention. In this work, we fully exhibit the effect of coherence in unitary evolutions. Firstly, by introducing the new concept, average quantum distance, we show that for time-independent Hamiltonians, quantum coherence is the average evolution speed and vice versa. Secondly, beyond this average setting, for general cases, we show that how coherence and Hamiltonians' eigenvalues determine the instantaneous evolution speed together, where their trade-off is actually the energy uncertainty. Our results definitely clarify the role coherence playing in quantum systems' dynamics, paving one new way for research about quantum resources in dynamical processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error-correcting codes, such as subspace, subsystem, and Floquet codes, are typically constructed within the stabilizer formalism, which does not fully capture the idea of fault-tolerance needed for practical quantum computing applications. In this work, we explore the remarkably powerful formalism of detector error models, which fully captures fault-tolerance at the circuit level. We introduce the detector error model formalism in a pedagogical manner and provide several examples. Additionally, we apply the formalism to three different levels of abstraction in the engineering cycle of fault-tolerant circuit designs: finding robust syndrome extraction circuits, identifying efficient measurement schedules, and constructing fault-tolerant procedures. We enhance the surface code's resistance to measurement errors, devise short measurement schedules for color codes, and implement a more efficient fault-tolerant method for measuring logical operators.</description>

Abstract: The cost of distributed quantum operations such as the telegate and teledata protocols is high due to latencies from distributing entangled photons and classical information. This paper proposes an extension to the telegate and teledata protocols to allow for asynchronous classical communication which hides the cost of distributed quantum operations. We then discuss the benefits and limitations of these asynchronous protocols and propose a potential way to improve these asynchronous protocols using nonunitary operators. Finally, a quantum network card is described as an example of how asynchronous quantum operations might be used.</description>

      <title>In situ Qubit Frequency Tuning Circuit for Scalable Superconducting Quantum Computing: Scheme and Experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frequency tunable qubit plays a significant role for scalable superconducting quantum processors. The state-of-the-art room-temperature electronics for tuning qubit frequency suffers from unscalable limit, such as heating problem, linear growth of control cables, etc. Here we propose a scalable scheme to tune the qubit frequency by using in situ superconducting circuit, which is based on radio frequency superconducting quantum interference device (rf-SQUID). We demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that the qubit frequency could be modulated by inputting several single pulses into rf-SQUID. Compared with the traditional scheme, our scheme not only solves the heating problem, but also provides the potential to exponentially reduce the number of cables inside the dilute refrigerator and the room-temperature electronics resource for tuning qubit frequency, which is achieved by a time-division-multiplex (TDM) scheme combining rf-SQUID with switch arrays. With such TDM scheme, the number of cables could be reduced from the usual $\sim 3n$ to $\sim \log_2{(3n)} + 1$ for two-dimensional quantum processors comprising $n$ qubits and $\sim 2n$ couplers. Our work paves the way for large-scale control of superconducting quantum processor.</description>

      <title>An analogue of the P\"oschl-Teller anharmonic oscillator on an $N$-dimensional sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Schr\"odinger particle on an $N$-dimensional ($N\geqslant2$) hypersphere of radius $R$ is considered. The particle is subjected to the action of a force characterized by the potential $V(\theta)=2m\omega_{1}^{2}R^{2}\tan^{2}(\theta/2)+2m\omega_{2}^{2}R^{2}\cot^{2}(\theta/2)$, where $0\leqslant\theta\leqslant\pi$ is the hyperlatitude angular coordinate. In the general case when $\omega_{1}\neq\omega_{2}$, this is a model of a hyperspherical analogue of the P\"oschl-Teller anharmonic oscillator. Energy eigenvalues and normalized eigenfunctions for this system are found in closed analytical forms. For $N=2$, our results reproduce those obtained by Kazaryan et al. [Physica E 52 (2013) 122]. For $N\geqslant2$ arbitrary and for $\omega_{2}=0$, the results of Mardoyan and Petrosyan [J. Contemp. Phys. 48 (2013) 70] for their model of an isotropic hyperspherical harmonic oscillator are recovered. The Euclidean limit for the anharmonic oscillator in question is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Probability-based approach to hybrid classical-quantum systems of any size: Generalized Gleason and Kraus theorems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid classical-quantum systems are of interest in numerous fields, from quantum chemistry to quantum information science. A fully quantum effective description of them is straightforward to formulate when the classical subsystem is discrete. But it is not obvious how to describe them in the general case. We propose a probability-based approach starting with four axioms for hybrid classical-quantum probability measures that readily generalize the usual ones for classical and quantum probability measures. They apply to discrete and non-discrete classical subsystems and to finite and infinite dimensional quantum subsystems. A generalized Gleason theorem that gives the mathematical form of the corresponding hybrid states is shown. This form simplifies when the classical subsystem probabilities are described by a probability density function with respect to a natural reference measure, for example the familiar Lebesgue measure. We formulate a requirement for the transformations, that is, the finite-time evolutions, of hybrid probability measures analogous to the complete positive assumption for quantum operations. For hybrid systems with reference measure, we prove a generalized Kraus theorem that fully determines the considered transformations provided they are continuous with respect to an appropriate metric. Explicit expressions for these transformations are derived when the classical and quantum subsystems are non-interacting, the classical subsystem is discrete, or the Hilbert space of the quantum subsystem is finite-dimensional. We also discuss the quantification of the correlations between the classical and quantum subsystems and a generalization of the quantum operations usually considered in the study of quantum entanglement.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive explanation of ZZ coupling in superconducting qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major challenge for scaling up superconducting quantum computers is unwanted couplings between qubits, which lead to always-on ZZ couplings that impact gate fidelities by shifting energy levels conditional on qubit states. To tackle this challenge, we introduce analytical and numerical techniques, including a diagrammatic perturbation theory and a state-assignment algorithm. Together, these tools enable us to explain the emergence of ZZ coupling in three linked pictures, where each picture tells us more about the underlying mechanisms creating the ZZ coupling. These pictures generalize previous efforts, which focused on specific setups and a single mechanism. The deeper understanding that we provide of the mechanisms behind the ZZ coupling facilitate finding parameter regions of weak and strong ZZ coupling. We showcase our techniques for a system consisting of two fixed-frequency transmon qubits connected by a flux-tunable transmon coupler. There, we find three types of parameter regions with zero or near-zero ZZ coupling, all of which are accessible with current technology. We furthermore find regions of strong ZZ coupling nearby, which may be used to implement adiabatic controlled-phase gates and quantum simulations. Our framework is applicable to many types of qubits and opens up for the design of large-scale quantum computers with improved gate fidelities.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Communications is a field that promises advances in cryptography, quantum computing and clock synchronisation, among other potential applications. However, communication based on quantum phenomena requires an extreme level of isolation from external disturbances, making the transmission of quantum signals together with classical ones difficult. A range of techniques has been tested to introduce quantum communications in already deployed optical networks which also carry legacy traffic. This comes with challenges, not only at the physical layer but also at the operations and management layer. To achieve a broad acceptance among network operators, the joint management and operation of quantum and classical resources, compliance with standards, and quality and legal assurance need to be addressed. This article presents a detailed account of solutions to the above issues, deployed and evaluated in the MadQCI (Madrid Quantum Communication Infrastructure) testbed. This network is designed to integrate quantum communications in the telecommunications ecosystem by installing quantum-key-distribution modules from multiple providers in production nodes of two different operators. The modules were connected through an optical-switched network with more than 130 km of deployed optical fibre. The tests were done in compliance with strict service level agreements that protected the legacy traffic of the pre-existing classical network. The goal was to achieve full quantum-classical compatibility at all levels, while limiting the modifications of optical transport and encryption and complying with as many standards as possible. This effort was intended to serve as a blueprint, which can be used as the foundation of large-scale quantum network deployments.

Abstract: Quantum computing could impact various industries, with the automotive industry with many computational challenges, from optimizing supply chains and manufacturing to vehicle engineering, being particularly promising. This chapter investigates state-of-the-art quantum algorithms to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and scalability across the automotive value chain. We explore recent advances in quantum optimization, machine learning, and numerical and chemistry simulations, highlighting their potential and limitations. We identify and discuss key challenges in near-term and fault-tolerant algorithms and their practical use in industrial applications. While quantum algorithms show potential in many application domains, current noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware limits scale and, thus, business benefits. In the long term, fault-tolerant systems promise theoretical speedups; however, they also require further progress in hardware and software (e.\,g., related to error correction and data loading). We expect that with this progress, significant practical benefits will emerge eventually.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Framework for Engineering Arbitrary Floquet Hamiltonian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a systematic perturbative framework to engineer an arbitrary target Hamiltonian in the Floquet phase space of a periodically driven oscillator based on Floquet-Magnus expansion. The high-order errors in the engineered Floquet Hamiltonian are mitigated by adding high-order driving potentials perturbatively. We introduce a transformation method that allows us to obtain an analytical expression of the leading-order correction drive for engineering a target Hamiltonian with discrete rotational and chiral symmetries in phase space. We also provide a numerically efficient procedure to calculate high-order correction drives and apply it to engineer the target Hamiltonian with degenerate eigenstates of multi-component cat states that are important for fault-tolerant hardware-efficiency bosonic quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Efficient quantum pseudorandomness under conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficiency of locally generating unitary designs, which capture statistical notions of quantum pseudorandomness, lies at the heart of wide-ranging areas in physics and quantum information technologies. While there are extensive potent methods and results for this problem, the evidently important setting where continuous symmetries or conservation laws (most notably U(1) and SU(d)) are involved is known to present fundamental difficulties. In particular, even the basic question of whether any local symmetric circuit can generate 2-designs efficiently (in time that grows at most polynomially in the system size) remains open with no circuit constructions provably known to do so, despite intensive efforts. In this work, we resolve this long-standing open problem for both U(1) and SU(d) symmetries by explicitly constructing local symmetric quantum circuits which we prove to converge to symmetric unitary 2-designs in polynomial time using a combination of representation theory, graph theory, and Markov chain methods. As a direct application, our constructions can be used to efficiently generate near-optimal covariant quantum error-correcting codes, confirming a conjecture in [PRX Quantum 3, 020314 (2022)].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and investigate a data access model (approximate sample and query) that is satisfiable by the preparation and measurement of block encoded states, as well as in contexts such as classical quantum circuit simulation or Pauli sampling. We illustrate that this abstraction is compositional and has some computational power. We then apply these results to obtain polynomial improvements over the state of the art in the sample and computational complexity of distributed inner product estimation. By doing so, we provide a new interpretation for why Pauli sampling is useful for this task. Our results partially characterize the power of time-limited fault-tolerant quantum circuits aided by classical computation. They are a first step towards extending the classical data Quantum Singular Value Transform dequantization results to a quantum setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement of bipartite squeezed states generated by holomorphic Hermite functions of two complex variables is investigated using phase-space approach based on the Wigner distribution function. Orthogonality of the holomorphic Hermite functions implies the relationship between certain real parameter associated with the non-rotational measure in the Bargmann space and the squeezing parameter. The mutual relation between squeezing and entanglement is elucidated with the help of Peres-Horodecki positive partial transpose criterion formulated in the phase-space version for continuous-variable systems. The quantitative characteristics of the entanglement is determined using the log-negativity criterion. The oscillator-like model of a two-particle quantum-mechanical system is developed to illustrate the presented findings.</description>

      <title>Can Schroedingerist Wavefunction Physics Explain Brownian Motion? III: A One-Dimensional Heavy and Light Particles Model Exhibiting Brownian-Motion-Like Trajectories and Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08764v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two prior papers of this series, it was proposed that a wavefunction model of a heavy particle and a collection of light particles might generate ``Brownian-Motion-Like" trajectories as well as diffusive motion (displacement proportional to the square-root of time) of the heavy particle, but did not exhibit a concrete instance. Here we introduce a one-space-dimensional model which, granted a finite perturbation series, fulfills the criteria for BML trajectories and diffusion. We note that Planck's constant makes an appearance in the diffusion coefficient, which further differentiates the present theory from the work of Poincare and Einstein in the previous century.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric protocols for mode pairing quantum key distribution with finite-key analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mode pairing quantum key distribution (MP-QKD) protocol has attracted considerable attention for its capability to ensure high secure key rates over long distances without requiring global phase locking. However, ensuring symmetric channels for the MP-QKD protocol is challenging in practical quantum communication networks. Previous studies on the asymmetric MP-QKD protocol have relied on ideal decoy state assumptions and infinite-key analysis, which are unattainable for real-world deployment. In this paper, we conduct a security analysis of asymmetric MP-QKD protocol with the finite-key analysis, where we discard the previously impractical assumptions made in the decoy-state method. Combined with statistical fluctuation analysis, we globally optimized the 12 independent parameters in the asymmetric MP-QKD protocol by employing our modified particle swarm optimization. The simulation results demonstrate that our work can achieve significantly enhanced secure key rates and transmission distances compared to the original strategy with adding extra attenuation. We further investigate the relationship between the intensities and probabilities of signal, decoy, and vacuum states with transmission distance, facilitating its more efficient deployment in future quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Implementation of Magic State Injection within Heavy-Hexagon Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magic state injection process is a critical component of fault-tolerant quantum computing, and numerous studies have been conducted on this topic. Many existing studies have focused on square-lattice structures, where each qubit connects directly to four other qubits via two-qubit gates. However, hardware that does not follow a lattice structure, such as IBM's heavy-hexagon structure, is also under development. In these non-lattice structures, many quantum error correction (QEC) codes designed for lattice-based system cannot be directly applied. Adapting these codes often requires incorporating additional qubits, such as flag qubits. This alters the properties of the QEC code and introduces new variables into the magic state injection process. In this study, we implemented and compared the magic state injection process on a heavy-hexagon structure with flag qubits and a lattice structure without flag qubits. Additionally, we considered biased errors in superconducting hardware and investigated the impact of flag qubits under these conditions. Our analysis reveals that the inclusion of flag qubits introduces distinct characteristics into the magic state injection process, which are absent in systems without flag qubits. Based on these findings, we identify several critical considerations for performing magic state injection on heavy-hexagon systems incorporating flag qubits. Furthermore, we propose an optimized approach to maximize the efficacy of this process in such systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intra-system entanglement occurs between non-separable modes within the same system. For optical systems, the various degrees of freedom of light represent different modes, and the potential use of light to create higher dimensional classical entangle states offers a promising potential to drive new technological developments. In this work, we present experimental results demonstrating the orthogonality between transverse orbital angular momentum (t-OAM) of different spatiotemporal topological charges, a previously unverified property of t-OAM. Based on those results, we developed methods to create and characterize a novel family of t-OAM and polarization entangled spatiotemporal structured light. We further provide theoretical analysis to support our study of the entanglement between those modes. By demonstrating the feasibility of leveraging t-OAM as a new family of modes for classical entanglement, our work represents a new advancement towards higher dimensional classical entanglement strategies.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Quantum Circuit Cutting Framework for Sampling Overhead Reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent quantum circuit cutting technique enables simulating large quantum circuits on distributed smaller devices, significantly extending the capabilities of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. However, this method incurs substantial classical postprocessing and additional quantum resource demands, as both postprocessing complexity and sampling overhead scale exponentially with the number of cuts introduced. In this work, we propose an enhanced circuit cutting framework ShotQC with effective sampling overhead reduction. It effectively reduces sampling overhead through two key optimizations: shot distribution and cut parameterization. The former employs an adaptive Monte Carlo method to dynamically allocate more quantum resources to subcircuit configurations that contribute more to variance in the final outcome. The latter leverages additional degrees of freedom in postprocessing to further suppress variance. By integrating these optimization methods, ShotQC achieves significant reductions in sampling overhead without increasing classical postprocessing complexity, as demonstrated on a range of benchmark circuits.</description>

      <title>Reducing QUBO Density by Factoring Out Semi-Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and Quantum Annealing are prominent approaches for solving combinatorial optimization problems, such as those formulated as Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). These algorithms aim to minimize the objective function $x^T Q x$, where $Q$ is a QUBO matrix. However, the number of two-qubit CNOT gates in QAOA circuits and the complexity of problem embeddings in Quantum Annealing scale linearly with the number of non-zero couplings in $Q$, contributing to significant computational and error-related challenges. To address this, we introduce the concept of \textit{semi-symmetries} in QUBO matrices and propose an algorithm for identifying and factoring these symmetries into ancilla qubits. \textit{Semi-symmetries} frequently arise in optimization problems such as \textit{Maximum Clique}, \textit{Hamilton Cycles}, \textit{Graph Coloring}, and \textit{Graph Isomorphism}. We theoretically demonstrate that the modified QUBO matrix $Q_{\text{mod}}$ retains the same energy spectrum as the original $Q$. Experimental evaluations on the aforementioned problems show that our algorithm reduces the number of couplings and QAOA circuit depth by up to $45\%$. For Quantum Annealing, these reductions also lead to sparser problem embeddings, shorter qubit chains and better performance. This work highlights the utility of exploiting QUBO matrix structure to optimize quantum algorithms, advancing their scalability and practical applicability to real-world combinatorial problems.</description>

      <title>Pilot-Quantum: A Quantum-HPC Middleware for Resource, Workload and Task Management</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As quantum hardware continues to scale, managing the heterogeneity of resources and applications -- spanning diverse quantum and classical hardware and software frameworks -- becomes increasingly critical. Pilot-Quantum addresses these challenges as a middleware designed to provide unified application-level management of resources and workloads across hybrid quantum-classical environments. It is built on a rigorous analysis of existing quantum middleware systems and application execution patterns. It implements the Pilot Abstraction conceptual model, originally developed for HPC, to manage resources, workloads, and tasks. It is designed for quantum applications that rely on task parallelism, including: (i) Hybrid algorithms, such as variational approaches, and (ii) Circuit cutting systems, used to partition and execute large quantum circuits. Pilot-Quantum facilitates seamless integration of quantum processing units (QPUs), classical CPUs, and GPUs, while supporting high-level programming frameworks like Qiskit and Pennylane. This enables users to design and execute hybrid workflows across diverse computing resources efficiently. The capabilities of Pilot-Quantum are demonstrated through mini-applications -- simplified yet representative kernels focusing on critical performance bottlenecks. We present several mini-apps, including circuit execution across hardware and simulator platforms (e.g., IBM's Eagle QPU), distributed state vector simulation, circuit cutting, and quantum machine learning workflows, demonstrating significant scale (e.g., a 41-qubit simulation on 256 GPUs) and speedups (e.g., 15x for QML, 3.5x for circuit cutting).</description>

      <title>A non-relativistic theory of quantum mechanics and gravity with local modulus symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.07749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have constructed a non-relativistic theory of quantum mechanics and gravity based on local modulus symmetry. Our theory has three main new features compared to conventional quantum mechanics and Newtonian gravity. They include a new quantum metric function needed to modify the complex conjugate of the wave function, a gravitational Poisson equation that accounts for part of the gravitational potential energy but not all, and a new background energy term in the quantum particle equation of motion. In an expanding universe, these theoretical features produce new effects that deviate from predictions of conventional quantum mechanics and Newtonian gravity. The quantum metric function yields negligible change for microscopic objects but produces quantum pointer states for macroscopic objects, thus providing a solution to the quantum measurement problem. The extra term in the gravitational potential energy is negligible in smaller bound systems but can become dominant at the galactic scales. Its potential association with the mass discrepancy problem in the galactic systems is discussed. The new background energy term turns out to be half of the Planck constant multiplied by the Hubble constant. It has a peculiar numerical value related to the Planck energy density and the current estimate of the dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper proposes an acceleration effect that a local short-time acceleration produces an additional broadening to spectral line, while the central value of the line remains unaffected. The effect can be considered as a local and non-uniform generalization of Unruh effect. Although the acceleration-induced line broadening effect is too small to be measured in ordinary lab setup, it may offer us a key concept to gain a simple and unified perspective on the cosmic acceleration and the radial acceleration discrepancy of rotating galaxies. We find that the measurement of the acceleration of the cosmic expansion by fitting the distance-redshift relation is essentially the measurement of the line or redshift broadening, and the cosmic acceleration induced line broadening also plays a crucial role in the acceleration discrepancy at the outskirt of rotating galaxies. Possible predictions of the effect are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Path integral derivation of the thermofield double state in causal diamonds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03541v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we adopt the framework developed by R. Laflamme in \textit{Physica A}, \textbf{158}, pp. 58-63 (1989) to analyze the path integral of a massless -- conformally invariant -- scalar field defined on a causal diamond of size $2\alpha$ in 1+1 dimensions. By examining the Euclidean geometry of the causal diamond, we establish that its structure is conformally related to the cylinder $S^{1}_{\beta} \otimes \mathbb{R}$, where the Euclidean time coordinate $\tau$ has a periodicity of $\beta$. This property, along with the conformal symmetry of the fields, allows us to identify the connection between the thermofield double (TFD) state of causal diamonds and the Euclidean path integral defined on the two disconnected manifolds of the cylinder. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the temperature of the TFD state, derived from the conditions in the Euclidean geometry and analytically calculated, coincides with the temperature of the causal diamond known in the literature. This derivation highlights the universality of the connection between the Euclidean path integral formalism and the TFD state of the causal diamond, as well as it further establishes causal diamonds as a model that exhibits all desired properties of a system exhibiting the Unruh effect.</description>

      <title>Cryptomite: A versatile and user-friendly library of randomness extractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Cryptomite, a Python library of randomness extractor implementations. The library offers a range of two-source, seeded and deterministic randomness extractors, together with parameter calculation modules, making it easy to use and suitable for a variety of applications. We also present theoretical results, including new extractor constructions and improvements to existing extractor parameters. The extractor implementations are efficient in practice and tolerate input sizes of up to $2^{40}&gt;10^{12}$ bits. Contrary to alternatives using the fast Fourier transform, we implement convolutions efficiently using the number-theoretic transform to avoid rounding errors, making them well suited to cryptography. The algorithms and parameter calculation are described in detail, including illustrative code examples and performance benchmarking.</description>

      <title>Topology of Discrete Quantum Feedback Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A general framework for analyzing topology of quantum channels of single-particle systems is developed to find a class of genuinely dynamical topological phases that can be realized by means of discrete quantum feedback control. We provide a symmetry classification of quantum channels by identifying ten symmetry classes of discrete quantum feedback control with projective measurements. We construct various types of topological feedback control by using topological Maxwell's demons that achieve robust feedback-controlled chiral or helical transport against noise and decoherence. Topological feedback control thus offers a versatile tool for creating and controlling nonequilibrium topological phases in open quantum systems that are distinct from non-Hermitian and Lindbladian systems and should provide a guiding principle for topology-based design of quantum feedback control.</description>

      <title>Exact Solution of Bipartite Fluctuations in One-Dimensional Fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18523v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emergence of hydrodynamics in quantum many-body systems has recently garnered growing interest. The recent experiment of ultracold atoms [J. F. Wienand {\it et al.}, Nat. Phys. (2024), doi:10.1038/s41567-024-02611-z] studied emergent hydrodynamics in hard-core bosons using a bipartite fluctuation, which quantifies how the particle number fluctuates in a subsystem. In this Letter, we theoretically study the variance of a bipartite fluctuation in one-dimensional noninteracting fermionic dynamics starting from an alternating state, deriving the exact solution of the variance and its asymptotic linear growth law for the long-time dynamics. To compare the theoretical prediction with the experiment, we generalize our exact solution by incorporating the incompleteness of the initial alternating state, deriving the general linear growth law analytically. We find that it shows good agreement with the experimentally observed variance growth without any fitting parameters. Furthermore, we estimate a time scale for the local equilibration using our exact solution, finding that the time scale is independent of the initial incompleteness. To investigate the interaction effect, we implement numerical studies for the variance growth in interacting fermions, which has yet to be explored experimentally. As a result, we find that the presence of interactions breaks the linear variance growth derived in the noninteracting fermions. Our exact solutions and numerical findings here lay a foundation for growing bipartite fluctuations in quantum many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Defect conformal field theory from Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coupling between defects and extended critical degrees of freedom gives rise to the intriguing theory known as defect conformal field theory (CFT). In this work, we introduce a novel family of boundary and interface CFTs by coupling $N$ Majorana chains with SYK$_q$ interactions at the defect. Our analysis reveals that the interaction with $q=2$ constitutes a new marginal defect. Employing a versatile saddle-point method, we compute unique entanglement characterizations, including the $g$ function and effective central charge, of the defect CFT. Furthermore, we analytically evaluate the transmission coefficient using CFT techniques. Surprisingly, the transmission coefficient deviates from the universal relation with the effective central charge across the defect at the large $N$ limit, suggesting that our defect CFT extends beyond all known examples of Gaussian defect CFT.</description>

      <title>Speed-Accuracy Trade-Off Relations in Quantum Measurements and Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In practical measurements, it is widely recognized that reducing the measurement time leads to decreased accuracy. However, whether an inherent speed-accuracy trade-off exists as a fundamental physical constraint for quantum measurements is not obvious, and the answer remains unknown. Here, we establish a fundamental speed-accuracy trade-off relation based on the energy conservation law and the locality. Our trade-off works as a no-go theorem that the zero-error measurement for the operators that are non-commutative with the Hamiltonian cannot be implemented with finite time. This relation universally applies to various existing errors and disturbances defined for quantum measurements. We furthermore apply our methods to quantum computations and provide another speed-accuracy trade-off relation for unitary gate implementations, which works as another no-go theorem that any error-less implementations of quantum computation gates changing energy cannot be implemented with finite time, and a speed-disturbance trade-off for general quantum operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of the quark quasifragmentation function (qFF) using an equal-time and spatially boosted form of the Collins-Soper fragmentation function where the out-meson fragment is replaced by the current asymptotic condition. We derive the qFF for a fermion in two-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED2) using the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian after a mapping onto spin qubits in a spatial lattice with open boundary conditions. This form is suitable for quantum computations. We compute the qFF by exact diagonalization of the spin Hamiltonian. The results are compared to the qFF following from the Drell-Levy-Yan result for QED2, both at strong and weak coupling, and to two-dimensional quantum chromodynamics in the lowest Fock approximation.</description>

      <title>Unambiguous detection of high energy vortex states via the superkick effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vortex states of photons, electrons, and other particles are freely propagating wave packets with helicoidal wave fronts winding around the axis of a phase vortex. A particle prepared in a vortex state carries a non-zero orbital angular momentum projection on the propagation direction, a quantum number that has never been exploited in experimental particle and nuclear physics. Low-energy vortex photons, electrons, neutrons, and helium atoms have been demonstrated in experiment and found numerous applications, and there exist proposals of boosting them to higher energies. However, verification that a high energy particle is indeed in a vortex state will be a major challenge, since the low energy techniques become impractical at higher energies. Here, we propose a new diagnostic method based of the so-called superkick effect, which can unambiguously detect the presence of a phase vortex. A proof-of-principle experiment with vortex electrons can be done with existing technology, and its realization will also constitute the first observation of the superkick effect.</description>

      <title>State-dependent mobility edge in kinetically constrained models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we show that the kinetically constrained quantum East model lies between a quantum scarred and a many-body localized system featuring an unconventional type of mobility edge in the spectrum. We name this scenario $\textit{state-dependent}$ mobility edge: while the system does not exhibit a sharp separation in energy between thermal and non-thermal eigenstates, the abundance of non-thermal eigenstates results in slow entanglement growth for $\textit{many}$ initial states, such as product states, below a finite energy density. We characterize the state-dependent mobility edge by looking at the complexity of classically simulating dynamics using tensor network for system sizes well beyond those accessible via exact diagonalization. Focusing on initial product states, we observe a qualitative change in the dynamics of the bond dimension needed as a function of their energy density. Specifically, the bond dimension typically grows $\textit{polynomially}$ in time up to a certain energy density, where we locate the state-dependent mobility edge, enabling simulations for long times. Above this energy density, the bond dimension typically grows $\textit{exponentially}$ making the simulation practically unfeasible beyond short times, as generally expected in interacting theories. We correlate the polynomial growth of the bond dimension to the presence of many non-thermal eigenstates around that energy density, a subset of which we compute via tensor network. The outreach of our findings encompasses quantum sampling problems and the efficient simulation of quantum circuits beyond Clifford families.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15231v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the information loss at the cosmological apparent horizon in an expanding universe does not obey Landauer's principle for efficient information erasure. This is in contrast to what happens for black holes, where the principle is upheld exactly. We discuss about the implications this result provides for the differences between information loss at black holes and that at the cosmological apparent horizon, which we term the "Cosmological Information Paradox". We also discuss how this result may point towards incompleteness of quasi-local descriptions of energy and could also point towards different thermodynamic settings in gravitational systems and how information thermodynamics as we know it may have limits to its applicability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light scalar fields are frequently used in modern physics, for example, as candidates for dark energy or dark matter. Open quantum dynamical effects, like frequency shifts, induced by such fields in probe particles used in interferometry experiments might open up new perspectives for constraining such models. In this article, we consider a probe scalar particle as a rough approximation for an atom in matter wave interferometry and discuss the frequency shifts induced by interactions with an environment comprising either one of two screened scalar field models: chameleons or symmetrons. For the $n=-4$ chameleon, we revise a previously obtained expression for the induced frequency shift, but confirm that it can likely not be used to obtain new constraints. However, for symmetrons, we find that induced frequency shifts have the potential to tightly constrain previously unreachable parts of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Lorentz violation alleviates gravitationally induced entanglement degradation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lorentz violation is a significant phenomenon in the framework of quantum physics, with implications for fundamental symmetries. In this paper, we explore the effects of Lorentz violation on quantum entanglement through a black hole spacetime that is coupled with a Lorentz-violating field. We establish the relationship between the Hartle-Hawking vacuum state and the Boulware number states for this case, and employ the near horizon approximation in an appropriate form to rewrite the black hole metric into a Rindler-like form. Subsequently, using this revised metric, the analytical forms of logarithmic negativity and mutual information are derived and plotted as functions of Rob's distance from the $ r=0 $ point. Based on the results, we find that the coupling between spacetime and the Lorentz-violating vector field alleviates gravity-induced entanglement degradation. At high mode frequencies, the effects of Lorentz violation are negligible, but they become significant at low frequencies. This suggests that investigating Lorentz violation at astrophysical scales requires low-frequency detectors, as the low energy of these fields enhances the significance of the Lorentz-violating field's non-zero vacuum expectation value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum annealing can efficiently obtain solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. Size-reduction methods are used to treat large-scale combinatorial optimization problems that cannot be input directly into a quantum annealer because of its size limitation. Various size-reduction methods using fixing spins have been proposed as quantum-classical hybrid methods to obtain solutions. However, the high performance of these hybrid methods is yet to be clearly elucidated. In this study, we adopted a parameterized fixing spins method to verify the effects of fixing spins. The results revealed that setting the appropriate number of spins of the subproblem is crucial for obtaining a satisfactory solution, and the energy gap expansion is confirmed after fixing spins.</description>

      <title>Informational analysis of the confinement of an electron in an asymmetric double quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quasi-unidimensional one-electron double quantum dot is studied within the framework of Shannon informational entropy. Its confinement potential, which is described by an asymmetric harmonic-gaussian function, consists of two wells separated by a potential barrier, and the asymmetry of the potential in respect to the center of the barrier is parameterized by $x_0$. In this work we employ Shannon informational entropy as a tool to investigate changes in the electronic confinement resulting from the modifications in the degree of asymmetry $x_0$. In particular, we notice that Shannon entropy turns out to be very sensitive to the change from the symmetric to the antisymmetric regime. Moreover, we show that Shannon entropy as a function of $x_0$ for an electronic excited state displays an irregular behavior whenever the state energy is in the vicinity of a local extreme (a maximum or a minimum); connected with this we observe an oscillatory behavior of the energy of the excited states as a function of $x_0$.</description>

Abstract: We show that quantum geometry sets a bound on the $q^4$ term in the static structure factor $S(q)$. Bands that saturate this bound satisfy a form of Laplace's equation, leading us to refer to them as \textit{harmonic bands}. We provide some examples of harmonic bands in one- and two-dimensional systems, including Landau levels.</description>

Abstract: The emptiness formation problem is addressed for a one-dimensional quantum polytropic gas characterized by an arbitrary polytropic index $\gamma$, which defines the equation of state $P \sim \rho^\gamma$, where $P$ is the pressure and $\rho$ is the density. The problem involves determining the probability of the spontaneous formation of an empty interval in the ground state of the gas. In the limit of a macroscopically large interval, this probability is dominated by an instanton configuration. By solving the hydrodynamic equations in imaginary time, we derive the analytic form of the emptiness instanton. This solution is expressed as an integral representation analogous to those used for correlation functions in Conformal Field Theory. Prominent features of the spatiotemporal profile of the instanton are obtained directly from this representation.</description>

      <title>Trees that can be grown in "too many" ways: A review of Bouch's construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We carefully review the hierarchical construction by Bouch [1] of trees on the square lattice that can be grown from its root in $L!/C^L$ distinct ways, where $L$ denotes the number of bonds constituting the tree, and $C&gt;1$ is a constant. (As discussed in Section IV.A of [2] and Appendix A.3 of [3], this result has an implication on the operator growth in quantum spin systems in two or higher dimensions.)</description>

      <title>Analytic 3D vector non-uniform Fourier crystal optics in arbitrary $\bar{\bar{\varepsilon}}$ dielectric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17224</link>

Abstract: To find a suitable incubator for nonlinear crystal optics(NCO), we have revisited linear crystal optics(LCO). At the methodological level, three widely used plane wave bases are compared in terms of eigenanalysis in reciprocal space and light field propagation in real space. Inspired by complex ray tracing, we expand M.V. Berry's 2003 uniform plane wave model to non-uniform Fourier crystal optics(FCO) and ultimately derive the explicit form of its 3$\times$2 transition matrix, bridging the two major branches of crystal optics(CO) in reciprocal space, where either ray direction $\hat{k}$ or spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ serves as the input variable. Using this model, we create the material-matrix tetrahedral compass(M-M TC) to conduct a detailed analysis of how the four fundamental characteristics of materials (linear/circular birefringence/dichroism) influence the eigensystems of the vector electric field in two-dimensional(2D) spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ domain and its distribution in three-dimensional(3D) $\bar{r}$ space with a crystal-2f system. Along this journey, we have uncovered new territories in LCO in both real and reciprocal space, such as infinite singularities arranged in disk-, ring-, and crescent-like shapes, ``L shorelines'' resembling hearts, generalized haunting theorem, double conical refraction, and optical knots it induces. We also present our model's early applications in focal engineering and NCO.</description>
