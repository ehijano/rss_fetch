      <title>Hermes: A General-Purpose Proxy-Enabled Networking Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Hermes, a general-purpose networking architecture built on an overlay of reconfigurable proxies. Hermes delegates networking responsibilities from applications and services to the overlay proxies. It employs a range of proxying and tunneling techniques, utilizes HTTP as its core component, and incorporates assisting components to facilitate service delivery, enhance communication, and improve end-users' experience. To substantiate these benefits, we prototyped Hermes and demonstrated its ability to efficiently address service and communication challenges. We showed that Hermes enables end-to-end solutions for compatibility with legacy applications and protocols and reliable delivery in highly disadvantaged networking conditions. Furthermore, Hermes demonstrated its ability to provide end-to-end, business-logic-driven handling of general IP traffic and to serve as a communication pipeline for Named Data Networking, facilitating the development and adoption of future networking architectures.</description>

      <title>FastRAG: Retrieval Augmented Generation for Semi-structured Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently processing and interpreting network data is critical for the operation of increasingly complex networks. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques have improved data processing in network management. However, existing RAG methods like VectorRAG and GraphRAG struggle with the complexity and implicit nature of semi-structured technical data, leading to inefficiencies in time, cost, and retrieval. This paper introduces FastRAG, a novel RAG approach designed for semi-structured data. FastRAG employs schema learning and script learning to extract and structure data without needing to submit entire data sources to an LLM. It integrates text search with knowledge graph (KG) querying to improve accuracy in retrieving context-rich information. Evaluation results demonstrate that FastRAG provides accurate question answering, while improving up to 90% in time and 85% in cost compared to GraphRAG.</description>

      <title>Unconsidered Installations: Discovering IoT Deployments in the IPv6 Internet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internet-wide studies provide extremely valuable insight into how operators manage their Internet of Things (IoT) deployments in reality and often reveal grievances, e.g., significant security issues. However, while IoT devices often use IPv6, past studies resorted to comprehensively scan the IPv4 address space. To fully understand how the IoT and all its services and devices is operated, including IPv6-reachable deployments is inevitable-although scanning the entire IPv6 address space is infeasible. In this paper, we close this gap and examine how to best discover IPv6-reachable IoT deployments. To this end, we propose a methodology that allows combining various IPv6 scan direction approaches to understand the findability and prevalence of IPv6-reachable IoT deployments. Using three sources of active IPv6 addresses and eleven address generators, we discovered 6658 IoT deployments. We derive that the available address sources are a good starting point for finding IoT deployments. Additionally, we show that using two address generators is sufficient to cover most found deployments and save time as well as resources. Assessing the security of the deployments, we surprisingly find similar issues as in the IPv4 Internet, although IPv6 deployments might be newer and generally more up-to-date: Only 39% of deployments have access control in place and only 6.2% make use of TLS inviting attackers, e.g., to eavesdrop sensitive data.</description>

      <title>Towards Smart Fronthauling Management: Experimental Insights from a 5G Testbed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fronthaul connection is a key component of Centralized RAN (C-RAN) architectures, consistently required to handle high capacity demands. However, this critical feature is at risk when the transport link relies on wireless technology. Fortunately, solutions exist to enhance the reliability of wireless links. In this paper, we recall the theoretical fronthaul model, present a dynamic reconfiguration strategy and perform a conclusive experiment. Specifically, we showcase the setup of a wireless fronthaul testbed and discuss the resulting measurements. For this task, we leveraged the commercial hardware provided by the High-Frequency Campus Lab (HFCL), a private 5G network with millimeter wave (mmWave) radio access interface. Our experiments provide original data on the fronthaul utilization in this real deployment, demonstrating both a good accordance with the theoretical model discussed in [1] and the viability of one stabilizing solution.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Layer Blockchain Simulator and Performance Evaluation of Social Internet of Vehicles with Multi-Connectivity Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication brings significant challenges, such as data integrity and vulnerabilities stemming from centralized management. This paper presents an innovative integration of decentralized blockchain technology with V2X communication through a multi-layered architecture that combines the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) traffic simulator and the BlockSim blockchain simulator. In addition, as the Social Internet of Vehicles (SIoV) emerges, efficient resource management becomes indispensable for ensuring seamless communication. We also propose a reference multi-connectivity management method named Enhanced MAX-SINR, designed to advance research in blockchain-specific approaches, taking into account retransmission successfull rates. We evaluate blockchain performance in diverse environments such as urban, suburban, and rural areas, demonstrating that enhancing the success rate of retransmitted blockchain-related messages significantly boosts blockchain transaction performance and provides a foundation for developing intelligent SIoV systems.</description>

      <title>Generative AI-enabled Digital Twins for 6G-enhanced Smart Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 6G networks are envisioned to enable a wide range of applications, such as autonomous vehicles and smart cities. However, this rapid expansion of network topologies makes the management of 6G wireless networks more complex and leads to performance degradation. Even though state-of-the-art applications on network services are providing promising results, they also risk disrupting the network's performance. To overcome this, the services have to leverage what-if implementations covering a variety of scenarios. At this point, traditional simulations fall short of encompassing the dynamism and complexity of a physical network. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Generative AI-based Digital Twins. For this, we derive an optimization formula to differentiate different network scenarios by considering the specific key performance indicators (KPIs) for wireless networks. Then, we fed this formula to the generative AI with the historical twins and real-time twins to start generating the desired topologies. To evaluate the performance, we implement network and smart-city-oriented services, namely massive connectivity, tiny instant communication, right-time synchronization, and truck path routes. The simulation results reveal that our approach can achieve 38% more stable network throughput in high device density scenarios. Furthermore, the generated scenario accuracy is able to reach up to 98% level, surpassing the baselines.</description>

      <title>Explainable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Extended Reality Codec Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended Reality (XR) services are set to transform applications over 5th and 6th generation wireless networks, delivering immersive experiences. Concurrently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) advancements have expanded their role in wireless networks, however, trust and transparency in AI remain to be strengthened. Thus, providing explanations for AI-enabled systems can enhance trust. We introduce Value Function Factorization (VFF)-based Explainable (X) Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms, explaining reward design in XR codec adaptation through reward decomposition. We contribute four enhancements to XMARL algorithms. Firstly, we detail architectural modifications to enable reward decomposition in VFF-based MARL algorithms: Value Decomposition Networks (VDN), Mixture of Q-Values (QMIX), and Q-Transformation (Q-TRAN). Secondly, inspired by multi-task learning, we reduce the overhead of vanilla XMARL algorithms. Thirdly, we propose a new explainability metric, Reward Difference Fluctuation Explanation (RDFX), suitable for problems with adjustable parameters. Lastly, we propose adaptive XMARL, leveraging network gradients and reward decomposition for improved action selection. Simulation results indicate that, in XR codec adaptation, the Packet Delivery Ratio reward is the primary contributor to optimal performance compared to the initial composite reward, which included delay and Data Rate Ratio components. Modifications to VFF-based XMARL algorithms, incorporating multi-headed structures and adaptive loss functions, enable the best-performing algorithm, Multi-Headed Adaptive (MHA)-QMIX, to achieve significant average gains over the Adjust Packet Size baseline up to 10.7%, 41.4%, 33.3%, and 67.9% in XR index, jitter, delay, and Packet Loss Ratio (PLR), respectively.</description>

      <title>Q-CSM: Q-Learning-based Cognitive Service Management in Heterogeneous IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dramatic increase in the number of smart services and their diversity poses a significant challenge in Internet of Things (IoT) networks: heterogeneity. This causes significant quality of service (QoS) degradation in IoT networks. In addition, the constraints of IoT devices in terms of computational capability and energy resources add extra complexity to this. However, the current studies remain insufficient to solve this problem due to the lack of cognitive action recommendations. Therefore, we propose a Q-learning-based Cognitive Service Management framework called Q-CSM. In this framework, we first design an IoT Agent Manager to handle the heterogeneity in data formats. After that, we design a Q-learning-based recommendation engine to optimize the devices' lifetime according to the predicted QoS behaviour of the changing IoT network scenarios. We apply the proposed cognitive management to a smart city scenario consisting of three specific services: wind turbines, solar panels, and transportation systems. We note that our proposed cognitive method achieves 38.7% faster response time to the dynamical IoT changes in topology. Furthermore, the proposed framework achieves 19.8% longer lifetime on average for constrained IoT devices thanks to its Q-learning-based cognitive decision capability. In addition, we explore the most successive learning rate value in the Q-learning run through the exploration and exploitation phases.</description>

      <title>CAIP: Detecting Router Misconfigurations with Context-Aware Iterative Prompting of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model checkers and consistency checkers detect critical errors in router configurations, but these tools require significant manual effort to develop and maintain. LLM-based Q&amp;A models have emerged as a promising alternative, allowing users to query partitions of configurations through prompts and receive answers based on learned patterns, thanks to transformer models pre-trained on vast datasets that provide generic configuration context for interpreting router configurations. Yet, current methods of partition-based prompting often do not provide enough network-specific context from the actual configurations to enable accurate inference. We introduce a Context-Aware Iterative Prompting (CAIP) framework that automates network-specific context extraction and optimizes LLM prompts for more precise router misconfiguration detection. CAIP addresses three challenges: (1) efficiently mining relevant context from complex configuration files, (2) accurately distinguishing between pre-defined and user-defined parameter values to prevent irrelevant context from being introduced, and (3) managing prompt context overload with iterative, guided interactions with the model. Our evaluations on synthetic and real-world configurations show that CAIP improves misconfiguration detection accuracy by more than 30% compared to partition-based LLM approaches, model checkers, and consistency checkers, uncovering over 20 previously undetected misconfigurations in real-world configurations.</description>

      <title>Enhanced FIWARE-Based Architecture for Cyberphysical Systems With Tiny Machine Learning and Machine Learning Operations: A Case Study on Urban Mobility Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of AI and the Internet of Things is accelerating the digital transformation of society. Mobility computing presents specific barriers due to its real-time requirements, decentralization, and connectivity through wireless networks. New research on edge computing and tiny machine learning (tinyML) explores the execution of AI models on low-performance devices to address these issues. However, there are not many studies proposing agnostic architectures that manage the entire lifecycle of intelligent cyberphysical systems. This article extends a previous architecture based on FIWARE software components to implement the machine learning operations flow, enabling the management of the entire tinyML lifecycle in cyberphysical systems. We also provide a use case to showcase how to implement the FIWARE architecture through a complete example of a smart traffic system. We conclude that the FIWARE ecosystem constitutes a real reference option for developing tinyML and edge computing in cyberphysical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Securely exchanging contact information is essential for establishing trustworthy communication channels that facilitate effective online collaboration. However, current methods are neither user-friendly nor scalable for large groups of users. In response, we introduce PairSonic, a novel group pairing protocol that extends trust from physical encounters to online communication. PairSonic simplifies the pairing process by automating the tedious verification tasks of previous methods through an acoustic out-of-band channel using smartphones' built-in hardware. Our protocol not only facilitates connecting users for computer-supported collaboration, but also provides a more user-friendly and scalable solution to the authentication ceremonies currently used in end-to-end encrypted messengers like Signal or WhatsApp. PairSonic is available as open-source software: https://github.com/seemoo-lab/pairsonic</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trustworthy digital communication requires the secure exchange of contact information, but current approaches lack usability and scalability for larger groups of users. We evaluate the usability of two secure contact exchange systems: the current state of the art, SafeSlinger, and our newly designed protocol, PairSonic, which extends trust from physical encounters to spontaneous online communication. Our lab study (N=45) demonstrates PairSonic's superior usability, automating the tedious verification tasks from previous approaches via an acoustic out-of-band channel. Although participants significantly preferred our system, minimizing user effort surprisingly decreased the perceived security for some users, who associated security with complexity. We discuss user perceptions of the different protocol components and identify remaining usability barriers for CSCW application scenarios.</description>

      <title>Federated Continual Learning for Edge-AI: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge-AI, the convergence of edge computing and artificial intelligence (AI), has become a promising paradigm that enables the deployment of advanced AI models at the network edge, close to users. In Edge-AI, federated continual learning (FCL) has emerged as an imperative framework, which fuses knowledge from different clients while preserving data privacy and retaining knowledge from previous tasks as it learns new ones. By so doing, FCL aims to ensure stable and reliable performance of learning models in dynamic and distributed environments. In this survey, we thoroughly review the state-of-the-art research and present the first comprehensive survey of FCL for Edge-AI. We categorize FCL methods based on three task characteristics: federated class continual learning, federated domain continual learning, and federated task continual learning. For each category, an in-depth investigation and review of the representative methods are provided, covering background, challenges, problem formalisation, solutions, and limitations. Besides, existing real-world applications empowered by FCL are reviewed, indicating the current progress and potential of FCL in diverse application domains. Furthermore, we discuss and highlight several prospective research directions of FCL such as algorithm-hardware co-design for FCL and FCL with foundation models, which could provide insights into the future development and practical deployment of FCL in the era of Edge-AI.</description>

      <title>Positioning of a Next Generation Mobile Cell to Maximise Aggregate Network Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In wireless communications, the need to cover operation areas, such as seaports, is at the forefront of discussion, especially regarding network capacity provisioning. Radio network planning typically involves determining the number of fixed cells, considering link budgets and deploying them geometrically centered across targeted areas. This paper proposes a solution to determine the optimal position for a mobile cell, considering 3GPP path loss models. The optimal position for the mobile cell maximises the aggregate network capacity offered to a set of User Equipments (UEs), with gains up to 187% compared to the positioning of the mobile cell at the UEs geometrical center. The proposed solution can be used by network planners and integrated into network optimisation tools.
