      <title>Thermo-mechanical Properties of Hierarchical Biocomposite Materials from Photosynthetic Microorganisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extrusion 3D-printing of biopolymers and natural fiber-based biocomposites allows for the fabrication of complex structures, ranging from gels for healthcare applications to eco-friendly structural materials. However, traditional polymer extrusion demands high-energy consumption to pre-heat the slurries and reduce material viscosity. Additionally, natural fiber reinforcement often requires harsh treatments to improve adhesion to the matrix. Here, we overcome these challenges by introducing a systematic framework to fabricate natural biocomposite materials via a sustainable and scalable process. Using Chlorella vulgaris microalgae as the matrix, we optimize the bioink composition and the 3D-printing process to fabricate multifunctional, lightweight, hierarchical materials. A systematic dehydration approach prevents cracking and failure of the 3D-printed structure, maintaining a continuous morphology of aggregated microalgae cells that can withstand high shear forces during processing. Hydroxyethyl cellulose acts as a binder and reinforcement for Chlorella cells, leading to biocomposites with a bending stiffness above 1.5 GPa. The Chlorella biocomposites demonstrate isotropic heat transfer, functioning as effective thermal insulators with a thermal conductivity of 0.10 W/mK at room temperature. These materials show promise in applications requiring balanced thermal insulation and structural capabilities, positioning them as a sustainable alternative to conventional materials in response to increasing global materials demand.</description>

      <title>Memory in neural activity: long-range order without criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "criticality hypothesis", based on observed scale-free correlations in neural activity, suggests that the animal brain operates at a critical point of transition between two phases. However, what these phases are, or whether such a hypothesis is at all valid, is still debated. Here, using a cortical dynamics model based on the work of Wilson and Cowan, we provide both analytical and numerical evidence that a phase of long-range order (LRO) in neural activity may be induced simply by memory (time non-locality) without invoking criticality. The cortical dynamics model contains two distinct time scales: a fast time scale that governs the neural dynamics and a slow one that controls the amount of available resources, acting as the system's memory. When the resource timescale is sufficiently long compared to the activity timescale, we observe an LRO phase, which manifests in avalanche size and duration distributions which follow scale-free probability distributions and satisfy finite-size scaling. When the slow and fast time scales are no longer sufficiently distinct, LRO is destroyed. Since this LRO phase spans a wide range of parameters, it is robust against perturbations, a desirable property not shared by critical systems.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of Friction Coefficients to Analyze Hydration Effects on a C$_{60}$(OH)$_{\rm n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To analyze hydration effects on macromolecular diffusion, the friction coefficients of macromolecules were examined using molecular dynamics simulations with an all-atom model. In the present study, a method was introduced to decompose the molecular friction coefficient into the contributions for each site on the macromolecule. The method was applied to several fullerenols in ambient water. The friction coefficients for the hydrophilic part, such as the OH group, were larger than those for the hydrophobic part, such as the C. The hydration effect did not depend only on the kind of functional group but also on surface roughness. This approach would be useful in explaining the experimentally observed large changes in diffusion coefficients of proteins that were accompanied by conformation changes.</description>

      <title>Influence of on-site low-ureolysis bacteria and high-ureolysis bacteria on the effectiveness of MICP processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microbially Induced Calcium Carbonate Precipitation (MICP) is an eco-friendly technique that enhances soil mechanical properties using urease-producing microorganisms, especially Sporosarcina pasteurii. However, field trials often yield suboptimal results due to the presence of indigenous soil microbes. To evaluate their impact, bacteria from natural soil were classified into two groups: low-ureolysis and high-ureolysis. These were combined with S. pasteurii in experiments using microfluidic chips and sand columns. The analysis covered bacterial populations, urease activity, pH changes, calcium carbonate crystal metrics, and unconfined compressive strength (UCS). Results indicated that mixing low-ureolysis bacteria with S. pasteurii resulted in a 74-84% reduction in bacterial activity and a 60% decrease in chemical conversion rate, leading to a 60% drop in UCS. In contrast, combining high-ureolysis bacteria with S. pasteurii reduced bacterial activity by 49-54%, which was less than the 64% reduction seen with S. pasteurii alone. This combination improved calcium carbonate conversion rates by 9% to 45% and slightly enhanced UCS.The study highlights the distinct effects of low-ureolysis and high-ureolysis bacteria on MICP efficiency, particularly regarding their influence on pH. Low-ureolysis bacteria decrease pH, while high-ureolysis bacteria increase it. Maintaining high bacterial activity and precipitation rates is crucially dependent on pH levels. Future strategies could focus on reducing the presence of low-ureolysis bacteria or sustaining higher pH levels to enhance MICP effectiveness in field applications.</description>

      <title>Active nematic response to a deformable body or boundary: elastic deformations and anchoring-induced flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A body immersed in a nematic liquid crystal disturbs the fluid's preferred molecular configuration and increases its stored elastic energy. In an active nematic, the fluid components also generate a stress in the bulk fluid. By introducing either an immersed body or boundary, a fluid flow can be triggered due to anchoring boundary conditions. The fluid imposes elastic, viscous, and active stresses on such surfaces, which, if compliant, may result in a surface deformation. We study the deformations and stress in a linearly elastic body placed in an active nematic in two-dimensions. Using complex variables techniques, exact expressions for the fluid flow, director field, surface tractions, and body deformation are derived. Qualitative differences between elastic and active stress-driven deformations are identified, depending on an active Ericksen number, anchoring conditions, and body material properties, thereby suggesting a new method for measuring the active stresses in active anisotropic biological systems. Flow profiles, external confinement, and anchoring-induced stirring are also addressed.</description>

      <title>The signal synchronization function of myelin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The myelinated axons are widely present in both central and peripheral nervous systems. Its unique compact spiraling structure poses significant challenges to understanding its biological functions and developmental mechanisms. Conventionally, myelin is considered as an insulating layer to achieve saltatory conduction for the enhancement of the neural signal speed, which serves as the foundation of neuroscience. However, this insulating hypothesis is inadequate to account for various experimental observations, especially the long unmyelinated tract observed in the cortex. We here show non-random distributions in three ultrastructural features of myelin: the non-random spiraling directions, the localization preferences of myelin outer tongues, and the radial components along boundaries between oppositely spiraled myelin sheaths. These phenomena are predicted by a novel concept of myelin biological function, which we propose as the signal synchronization function. Our findings demonstrate that cytoplasmic channels within myelin may act as coiled inductors, facilitating electromagnetic induction between adjacent myelin sheaths, and thereby promoting signal synchronization between axons. This, in turn, explains the non-random ultrastructural features observed. We believe these insights lay the foundation for a new understanding of myelin inductive function.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Transport</title>

Abstract: Nucleocytoplasmic transport is essential for cellular function, presenting a canonical example of rapid molecular sorting inside cells. It consists of a coordinated interplay between import/export of molecules in/out the cell nucleus. Here, we investigate the role of spatio-temporal dynamics of the nucleocytoplasmic transport and its regulation. We develop a biophysical model that captures the main features of the nucleocytoplasmic transport, in particular, its regulation through the Ran cycle. Our model yields steady-state profiles for the molecular components of the Ran cycle, their relaxation times, as well as the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic molecule ratio. We show that these quantities are affected by their spatial dynamics and heterogeneity within the nucleus. Specifically, we find that the spatial nonuniformity of Ran Guanine Exchange Factor (RanGEF) - particularly its proximity to the nuclear envelope - increases the Ran content in the nucleus. We further show that RanGEF's accumulation near the nuclear envelope results from its intrinsic dynamics as a nuclear cargo, transported by the Ran cycle itself. Overall, our work highlights the critical role of molecular spatial dynamics in cellular processes, and proposes new avenues for theoretical and experimental inquiries into the nucleocytoplasmic transport.</description>

      <title>Photoemission of spin-polarized electrons from aligned grains and chiral symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unique biosignature of life on Earth is the homochirality of organic compounds such as amino acids, proteins, and sugars. High-energy spin-polarized (spin-up or spin-down) electrons (SPEs) from the $\beta$ decay of radioactive nuclei were proposed as a source of symmetry breaking, leading to homochirality; however, their exact role is much debated. Here we propose magnetically aligned dust grains as a new source of SPEs due to photoemission of electrons having aligned spins by the Barnett effect. For the interstellar UV radiation field of strength $G_{\rm UV}$, we found that the SPE emission rate is $\Gamma_{\rm pe}^{\rm SPE}\sim 10^{-14}G_{\rm UV}$ electrons per second per H, the fraction of spin-polarized to total photoelectrons is $\sim 10\%$, and the SPE yield (photoelectron number per UV photon) can reach $\sim 1\%$, using the modern theory of grain alignment. SPEs emitted from aligned grains could play an important role in chiral-induced spin selectivity-driven reduction chemistry in the icy grain mantles, producing an enantiomer excess of chiral molecules formed on the grain mantle. Finally, we suggest magnetically aligned grains could directly impact the enantioselectivity through the chiral-induced spin-selective adsorption effect and exchange interaction. We estimated the disalignment of electron spins and depolarization by elastic scattering using the Mott theory and found that these effects are negligible for low-energy SPEs, so that the spins of SPEs remain well aligned during their jurney through dust grains and the gas. Our proposed mechanism might explain the chiral asymmetry of prebiotic molecules detected in numerous comets, asteroids, and meteorites.</description>

      <title>General theory for localizing the where and when of entropy production meets single-molecule experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The laws of thermodynamics apply to biophysical systems on the nanoscale as described by the framework of stochastic thermodynamics. This theory provides universal, exact relations for quantities like work, which have been verified in experiments where a fully resolved description allows direct access to such quantities. Complementary studies consider partially hidden, coarse-grained descriptions, in which the mean entropy production typically is not directly accessible but can be bounded in terms of observable quantities. Going beyond the mean, we introduce a fluctuating entropy production that applies to individual trajectories in a coarse-grained description under time-dependent driving. Thus, this concept is applicable to the broad and experimentally significant class of driven systems in which not all relevant states can be resolved. We provide a paradigmatic example by studying an experimentally verified protein unfolding process. As a consequence, the entire distribution of the coarse-grained entropy production rather than merely its mean retains spatial and temporal information about the microscopic process. In particular, we obtain a bound on the distribution of the physical entropy production of individual unfolding events.</description>
