      <title>Learning to Provably Satisfy High Relative Degree Constraints for Black-Box Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a method for learning a control policy guaranteed to satisfy an affine state constraint of high relative degree in closed loop with a black-box system. Previous reinforcement learning (RL) approaches to satisfy safety constraints either require access to the system model, or assume control affine dynamics, or only discourage violations with reward shaping. Only recently have these issues been addressed with POLICEd RL, which guarantees constraint satisfaction for black-box systems. However, this previous work can only enforce constraints of relative degree 1. To address this gap, we build a novel RL algorithm explicitly designed to enforce an affine state constraint of high relative degree in closed loop with a black-box control system. Our key insight is to make the learned policy be affine around the unsafe set and to use this affine region to dissipate the inertia of the high relative degree constraint. We prove that such policies guarantee constraint satisfaction for deterministic systems while being agnostic to the choice of the RL training algorithm. Our results demonstrate the capacity of our approach to enforce hard constraints in the Gym inverted pendulum and on a space shuttle landing simulation.</description>

      <title>Scalable Synthesis of Formally Verified Neural Value Function for Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20532v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis provides a formal method for guaranteeing safety in constrained control problems. It synthesizes a value function to represent a long-term safe set called feasible region. Early synthesis methods based on state space discretization cannot scale to high-dimensional problems, while recent methods that use neural networks to approximate value functions result in unverifiable feasible regions. To achieve both scalability and verifiability, we propose a framework for synthesizing verified neural value functions for HJ reachability analysis. Our framework consists of three stages: pre-training, adversarial training, and verification-guided training. We design three techniques to address three challenges to improve scalability respectively: boundary-guided backtracking (BGB) to improve counterexample search efficiency, entering state regularization (ESR) to enlarge feasible region, and activation pattern alignment (APA) to accelerate neural network verification. We also provide a neural safety certificate synthesis and verification benchmark called Cersyve-9, which includes nine commonly used safe control tasks and supplements existing neural network verification benchmarks. Our framework successfully synthesizes verified neural value functions on all tasks, and our proposed three techniques exhibit superior scalability and efficiency compared with existing methods.</description>

      <title>Input Convex Neural Network-Assisted Optimal Power Flow in Distribution Networks: Modeling, Algorithm Design, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an input convex neural network (ICNN)-Assisted optimal power flow (OPF) in distribution networks. Instead of relying purely on optimization or machine learning, the ICNN-Assisted OPF is a combination of optimization and machine learning. It utilizes ICNN to learn the nonlinear but convex mapping from control variables to system state variables, followed by embedding into constrained optimization problems as convex constraints. Utilizing a designed ICNN structure, a fast primal-dual gradient method is developed to solve the ICNN-Assisted OPF, with the chain rule of deep learning applied to accelerate the algorithmic implementation. Convergence and optimally properties of the algorithm design are further established. Finally, different distribution network applications are discussed and proposed by means of the ICNN-Assisted OPF.</description>

      <title>Embracing Fairness in Consumer Electricity Markets using an Automatic Market Maker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As consumer flexibility becomes expected, it is important that the market mechanisms which attain that flexibility are perceived as fair. We set out fairness issues in energy markets today, and propose a market design to address them. Consumption is categorised as either essential or flexible with different prices and reliability levels for each. Prices are generated by an Automatic Market Maker (AMM) based on instantaneous scarcity and resource is allocated using a novel Fair Play algorithm. We empirically show the performance of the system over 1 year for 101 UK households and benchmark its performance against more classical approaches.</description>

      <title>Distributed Adaptive Time-Varying Optimization with Global Asymptotic Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we study distributed time-varying optimization for a multi-agent system. We first focus on a class of time-varying quadratic cost functions, and develop a new distributed algorithm that integrates an average estimator and an adaptive optimizer, with both bridged by a Dead Zone Algorithm. Based on a composite Lyapunov function and finite escape-time analysis, we prove the closed-loop global asymptotic convergence to the optimal solution under mild assumptions. Particularly, the introduction of the estimator relaxes the requirement for the Hessians of cost functions, and the integrated design eliminates the waiting time required in the relevant literature for estimating global parameter during algorithm implementation. We then extend this result to a more general class of time-varying cost functions. Two numerical examples verify the proposed designs.</description>

      <title>Impact of Geographical Separation on Spectrum Sharing Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing demand for wireless services, spectrum management agencies and service providers (SPs) are seeking more flexible mechanisms for spectrum sharing to accommodate this growth. Such mechanisms impact the market dynamics of competitive SPs. Prior market models of spectrum sharing largely focus on scenarios where competing SPs had identical coverage areas. We depart from this and consider a scenario in which two competing SPs have overlapping but distinct coverage areas. We study the resulting competition using a Cournot model. Our findings reveal that with limited shared bandwidth, SPs might avoid overlapping areas to prevent potential losses due to interference. Sometimes SPs can strategically cooperate by agreeing not to provide service in the overlapping areas and, surprisingly, customers might also benefit from such cooperation under certain circumstances. Overall, market outcomes exhibit complex behaviors that are influenced by the sizes of coverage areas and the bandwidth of the shared spectrum.</description>

      <title>Robust LQ Optimal Control for Wind Turbine Power Tracking Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a robust linear quadratic optimal control approach for accurate active power tracking of wind turbines is presented. For control synthesis, linear matrix inequalities are employed using an augmented wind turbine state model with uncertain parameters. The resulting controller ensures robust stability in different operating regions. In a case study, the novel approach is compared to existing controllers from literature. Simulations indicate that the controller improves power tracking accuracy while leading to similar mechanical wear as existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Generalized Ellipsoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of symmetric convex bodies called generalized ellipsoids of degree $d$ (GE-$d$s), with ellipsoids corresponding to the case of $d=0$. Generalized ellipsoids (GEs) retain many geometric, algebraic, and algorithmic properties of ellipsoids. We show that the conditions that the parameters of a GE must satisfy can be checked in strongly polynomial time, and that one can search for GEs of a given degree by solving a semidefinite program whose size grows only linearly with dimension. We give an example of a GE which does not have a second-order cone representation, but show that every GE has a semidefinite representation whose size depends linearly on both its dimension and degree. In terms of expressiveness, we prove that for any integer $m\geq 2$, every symmetric full-dimensional polytope with $2m$ facets and every intersection of $m$ co-centered ellipsoids can be represented exactly as a GE-$d$ with $d \leq 2m-3$. Using this result, we show that every symmetric convex body can be approximated arbitrarily well by a GE-$d$ and we quantify the quality of the approximation as a function of the degree $d$. Finally, we present applications of GEs to several areas, such as time-varying portfolio optimization, stability analysis of switched linear systems, robust-to-dynamics optimization, and robust polynomial regression.</description>

      <title>Haptic feedback of front car motion can improve driving control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the role of haptic feedback in a car-following scenario, where information about the motion of the front vehicle is provided through a virtual elastic connection with it. Using a robotic interface in a simulated driving environment, we examined the impact of varying levels of such haptic feedback on the driver's ability to follow the road while avoiding obstacles. The results of an experiment with 15 subjects indicate that haptic feedback from the front car's motion can significantly improve driving control (i.e., reduce motion jerk and deviation from the road) and reduce mental load (evaluated via questionnaire). This suggests that haptic communication, as observed between physically interacting humans, can be leveraged to improve safety and efficiency in automated driving systems, warranting further testing in real driving scenarios.</description>

      <title>An anisotropic traffic flow model with look-ahead effect for mixed autonomy traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we extend the Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) non-equilibrium traffic flow model to take into account the look-ahead capability of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), and the mixed flow dynamics of human driven and autonomous vehicles. The look-ahead effect of CAVs is captured by a non-local averaged density within a certain distance (the look-ahead distance). We show, using wave perturbation analysis, that increased look-ahead distance loosens the stability criteria. Our numerical experiments, however, showed that a longer look-ahead distance does not necessarily lead to faster convergence to equilibrium states. We also examined the impact of spatial distributions and market penetrations of CAVs and showed that increased market penetration helps stabilizing mixed traffic while the spatial distribution of CAVs have less effect on stability. The results revealed the potential of using CAVs to stabilize traffic, and may provide qualitative insights on speed control in the mixed autonomy environment.</description>

      <title>Accelerated forward-backward and Douglas-Rachford splitting dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine convergence properties of continuous-time variants of accelerated Forward-Backward (FB) and Douglas-Rachford (DR) splitting algorithms for nonsmooth composite optimization problems. When the objective function is given by the sum of a quadratic and a nonsmooth term, we establish accelerated sublinear and exponential convergence rates for convex and strongly convex problems, respectively. Moreover, for FB splitting dynamics, we demonstrate that accelerated exponential convergence rate carries over to general strongly convex problems. In our Lyapunov-based analysis we exploit the variable-metric gradient interpretations of FB and DR splittings to obtain smooth Lyapunov functions that allow us to establish accelerated convergence rates. We provide computational experiments to demonstrate the merits and the effectiveness of our analysis.</description>

      <title>Implementation of Formal Standard for Interoperability in M&amp;S/System of Systems Integration with DEVS/SOA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) is finding increasing application in development and testing of command and control systems comprised of information-intensive component systems. Achieving interoperability is one of the chief System of Systems (SoS) engineering objectives in the development of command and control (C2) capabilities for joint and coalition warfare. In this paper, we apply an SoS perspective on the integration of M&amp;S with such systems. We employ recently developed interoperability concepts based on linguistic categories along with the Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) formalism to implement a standard for interoperability. We will show how the developed standard is implemented in DEVS/SOA net-centric modeling and simulation framework that uses XML-based Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). We will discuss the simulator interfaces and the design issues in their implementation in DEVS/SOA. We will illustrate the application of DEVS/SOA in a multi-agent test instrumentation system that is deployable as a SOA.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents the design of an extremum seeking controller based on sliding modes and cyclic search for real-time optimization of non-linear multivariable dynamic systems. These systems have arbitrary relative degree, compensated by the technique of time-scaling. The resulting approach guarantees global convergence of the system output to a small neighborhood of the optimum point. To corroborate with the theoretical results, numerical simulations are presented considering a system with two inputs and one output, which rapidly converges to the optimal parameters of the objective function.</description>

      <title>Optimizing 5G-Advanced Networks for Time-critical Applications: The Role of L4S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As 5G networks strive to support advanced time-critical applications, such as immersive Extended Reality (XR), cloud gaming, and autonomous driving, the demand for Real-time Broadband Communication (RTBC) grows. In this article, we present the main mechanisms of Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable Throughput (L4S). Subsequently, we investigate the support and challenges of L4S technology in the latest 3GPP 5G-Advanced Release 18 (R18) standard. Our case study, using a prototype system for a real-time communication (RTC) application, demonstrates the superiority of L4S technology. The experimental results show that, compared with the GCC algorithm, the proposed L4S-GCC algorithm can reduce the stalling rate by 1.51%-2.80% and increase the bandwidth utilization by 11.4%-31.4%. The results emphasize the immense potential of L4S technology in enhancing transmission performance in time-critical applications.</description>

      <title>Bounded-Time Nonblocking Supervisory Control of Timed Discrete-Event Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently an automaton property of quantitative nonblockingness was proposed in supervisory control of untimed discrete-event systems (DES), which quantifies the standard nonblocking property by capturing the practical requirement that all tasks be completed within a bounded number of steps. However, in practice tasks may be further required to be completed in specific time. To meet this new requirement, in this paper we introduce the concept of bounded-time nonblockingness, which extends the concept of quantitative nonblockingness from untimed DES to timed DES. This property requires that each task must be completed within a bounded time counted by the number of ticks, rather than bounded number of transition steps in quantitative nonblockingness. Accordingly, we formulate a new bounded-time nonblocking supervisory control problem (BTNSCP) of timed DES, and characterize its solvability in terms of a new concept of bounded-time language completability. Then we present an approach to compute the maximally permissive solution to the new BTNSCP.</description>

      <title>On Future Power Systems Digital Twins: A Vision Towards a Standard Architecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The energy sector's digital transformation brings mutually dependent communication and energy infrastructure, tightening the relationship between the physical and the digital world. Digital twins (DT) are the key concept for this. This paper initially discusses the evolution of the DT concept across various engineering applications before narrowing its focus to the power systems domain. By reviewing different definitions and applications, we present a new definition of DTs specifically tailored to power systems. Based on the proposed definition and extensive deliberations and consultations with distribution system operators, energy traders, and municipalities, we introduce a vision of a standard DT ecosystem architecture that offers services beyond real-time updates and can seamlessly integrate with existing transmission and distribution system operators' processes, while reconciling with concepts such as microgrids and local energy communities based on a system-of-systems view. We also discuss our vision related to the integration of power system DTs into various phases of the system's life cycle, such as long-term planning, emphasizing challenges that remain to be addressed, such as managing measurement and model errors, and uncertainty propagation. Finally, we present our vision of how artificial intelligence and machine learning can enhance several power systems DT modules established in the proposed architecture.</description>

      <title>Safe and Non-Conservative Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Driving Handling Unanticipated Behaviors of Traffic Participants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trajectory planning for autonomous driving is challenging because the unknown future motion of traffic participants must be accounted for, yielding large uncertainty. Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC)-based planners provide non-conservative planning, but do not rule out a (small) probability of collision. We propose a control scheme that yields an efficient trajectory based on SMPC when the traffic scenario allows, still avoiding that the vehicle causes collisions with traffic participants if the latter move according to the prediction assumptions. If some traffic participant does not behave as anticipated, no safety guarantee can be given. Then, our approach yields a trajectory which minimizes the probability of collision, using Constraint Violation Probability Minimization techniques. Our algorithm can also be adapted to minimize the anticipated harm caused by a collision. We provide a thorough discussion of the benefits of our novel control scheme and compare it to a previous approach through numerical simulations from the CommonRoad database.</description>

      <title>Addressing Trust Issues for Vehicle to Grid in Distributed Power Grids Using Blockchains</title>

Abstract: While blockchain offers inherent security, trust issues among stakeholders in vehicle-to-grid (V2G) applications remain unresolved due to a lack of regulatory frameworks and standardization. Additionally, a tailored decentralized privacy-preserved coordination scheme for blockchain in V2G networks is needed to ensure user privacy and efficient energy transactions. This paper proposes a V2G trading and coordination scheme tailored to the decentralized nature of blockchain as well as the interests of stakeholders utilizing smart charging points (SCPs) and Stackelberg game model. Case studies using real-world data from Southern University of Science and Technology demonstrate the efficacy of proposed scheme in reducing EV charging costs and the potential for supporting auxiliary grid services.</description>

      <title>A Unified Formulation of Geometry-aware Dynamic Movement Primitives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.03374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning from demonstration (LfD) is considered as an efficient way to transfer skills from humans to robots. Traditionally, LfD has been used to transfer Cartesian and joint positions and forces from human demonstrations. The traditional approach works well for some robotic tasks, but for many tasks of interest, it is necessary to learn skills such as orientation, impedance, and/or manipulability that have specific geometric characteristics. An effective encoding of such skills can be only achieved if the underlying geometric structure of the skill manifold is considered and the constrains arising from this structure are fulfilled during both learning and execution. However, typical learned skill models such as dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) are limited to Euclidean data and fail in correctly embedding quantities with geometric constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel and mathematically principled framework that uses concepts from Riemannian geometry to allow DMPs to properly embed geometric constrains. The resulting DMP formulation can deal with data sampled from any Riemannian manifold including, but not limited to, unit quaternions and symmetric and positive definite matrices. The proposed approach has been extensively evaluated both on simulated data and real robot experiments. The performed evaluation demonstrates that beneficial properties of DMPs, such as convergence to a given goal and the possibility to change the goal during operation, apply also to the proposed formulation.</description>

      <title>Best-response algorithms for a class of monotone Nash equilibrium problems with mixed-integer variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the convergence properties of traditional best-response (BR) algorithms in computing solutions to mixed-integer Nash equilibrium problems (MI-NEPs) that turn into a class of monotone Nash equilibrium problems (NEPs) once relaxed the integer restrictions. We show that the sequence produced by a Jacobi/Gauss-Seidel BR method always approaches a bounded region containing the entire solution set of the MI-NEP, whose tightness depends on the problem data, and it is related to the degree of strong monotonicity of the relaxed NEP. When the underlying algorithm is applied to the relaxed NEP, we establish data-dependent complexity results characterizing its convergence to the unique solution of the NEP. In addition, we derive one of the very few sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions to MI-NEPs. The theoretical results developed bring important practical benefits, illustrated on a numerical instance of a smart building control application.</description>

      <title>Exponential Auto-Tuning Fault-Tolerant Control of N Degrees-of-Freedom Manipulators Subject to Torque Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15852v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel auto-tuning subsystem-based fault-tolerant control (SBFC) system designed for robotic manipulator systems with n degrees of freedom (DoF). It initially proposes a novel model for joint torques, incorporating an actuator fault correction model to account for potential faults and a mathematical saturation function to mitigate issues related to unforeseen excessive torque. This model is designed to prevent the generation of excessive torques even by faulty actuators. Subsequently, a robust subsystem-based adaptive control strategy is proposed to force system states closely along desired trajectories, while tolerating various actuator faults, excessive torques, and unknown modeling errors. Furthermore, optimal SBFC gains are determined by tailoring the JAYA algorithm (JA), a high-performance swarm intelligence technique, standing out for its capacity to optimize without the need for meticulous tuning of algorithm-specific parameters, relying instead on its intrinsic principles. Notably, this control framework ensures uniform exponential stability (UES). The enhancement of accuracy and tracking time for reference trajectories, along with the validation of theoretical assertions, is demonstrated through the presentation of simulation outcomes.</description>
