      <title>Generalized Measures of Population Synchrony</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronized behavior among individuals is a ubiquitous feature of populations. Understanding mechanisms of (de)synchronization demands meaningful, interpretable, computable quantifications of synchrony, relevant to measurements that can be made of dynamic populations. Despite the importance to analyzing and modeling populations, existing notions of synchrony often lack rigorous definitions, may be specialized to a particular experimental system and/or measurement, or may have undesirable properties that limit their utility. We introduce a notion of synchrony for populations of individuals occupying a compact metric space that depends on the Fr\'{e}chet variance of the distribution of individuals. We establish several fundamental and desirable mathematical properties of this synchrony measure, including continuity and invariance to metric scaling. We establish a general approximation result that controls the disparity between synchrony in the true space and the synchrony observed through a discretization of state space, as may occur when observable states are limited by measurement constraints. We develop efficient algorithms to compute synchrony in a variety of state spaces, including all finite state spaces and empirical distributions on the circle, and provide accessible implementations in an open-source Python module. To demonstrate the usefulness of the synchrony measure in biological applications, we investigate several biologically relevant models of mechanisms that can alter the dynamics of synchrony over time, and reanalyze published data concerning the dynamics of the intraerythrocytic developmental cycles of $\textit{Plasmodium}$ parasites. We anticipate that the rigorous definition of population synchrony and the mathematical and biological results presented here will be broadly useful in analyzing and modeling populations in a variety of contexts.</description>

      <title>Modelling the dynamics of online food delivery services on the spread of food-borne diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a deterministic mathematical model for the transmission of food-borne diseases in a population consisting of humans and flies. We employ the Caputo operator to examine the impact of governmental actions and online food delivery services on the transmission of food-borne diseases. The proposed model investigates important aspects such as positivity, boundedness, disease-free equilibrium, basic reproduction number and sensitivity analysis. The existence and uniqueness of a solution for the initial value problem is established using Banach and Schauder type fixed point theorems. Functional techniques are employed to demonstrate the stability of the proposed model under the Hyers-Ulam condition. For an approximate solution, the iterative fractional order Predictor-Corrector scheme is utilized. The simulation of this scheme is conducted using Matlab as the numeric computing environment, with various fractional order values ranging from 0.75 to 1. Over time, all compartments demonstrate convergence and stability. The numerical simulations highlight the necessity for the government to implement the most effective food safety control interventions. These measures could involve food safety awareness and training campaigns targeting restaurant managers, staff members involved in online food delivery, as well as food delivery personnel.</description>

      <title>Mathematical model to assess the impact of contact rate and environment factor on transmission dynamics of rabies in humans and dogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical model to understand how rabies spreads among humans, free-range, and domestic dogs. By analyzing the model, we discovered that there are equilibrium points representing both disease-free and endemic states. We calculated the basic reproduction number, $\mathcal{R}_{0}$, using the next generation matrix method. When $\mathcal{R}_{0}&lt;1$, the disease-free equilibrium is globally stable, whereas when $\mathcal{R}_{0}&gt;1$, the endemic equilibrium is globally stable. To identify the most influential parameters in disease transmission, we used the normalized forward sensitivity index. Our simulations revealed that the contact rates between the infectious agent and humans, free-range dogs, and domestic dogs have the most significant impact on rabies transmission. The study also examines how periodic changes in transmission rates affect the disease dynamics, emphasizing the importance of transmission frequency and amplitude on the patterns observed in rabies spread. Therefore, the study proposes that to mitigate the factors most strongly linked to disease sensitivity, effective disease control measures should primarily prioritize on reducing the population of both free-range and domestic dogs in open environments.</description>

      <title>Rate of epidemic spreading on complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The initial phase of an epidemic is often characterised by an exponential increase in the number of infected individuals. In well-mixed populations, this exponential increase is controlled by the basic reproduction number R0 and the distribution of times between consecutive infection along an infection chain. However, we are still lacking a general understanding of how epidemics spread when individual interactions form a complex network. Here, we derive an expression for the rate of exponential spread of an epidemic on a complex network. We find that this rate is affected by the degree distribution, the network assortativity, and the level of clustering. Our result holds for a broad range of networks, aside from networks with very broad degree distribution, where no clear exponential regime is present. The theory presented in this paper bridges the gap between classic epidemiology and the theory of complex network, with broad implications for model inference and policy making.</description>

      <title>How Does Culture Evolve?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter synthesizes evidence from cognitive science, evolutionary theory, anthropology, psychological studies, and computational models for a complex systems inspired theory of creativity, and its role in cultural evolution. Creativity is guided by the global shape of one's integrated network of memories, concepts, and beliefs: one's worldview. This integrated structure and its dynamical change over time are described using autocatalytic networks. Autocatalytic networks can interact with each other, and they can grow and evolve; through interactions between their components, they generate novel components. Thus, they are used to describe cultural change both within and between individuals, as well as across cultural lineages. The chapter outlines autocatalytic network models of the origin of culture, the cognitive developmental process by which each child becomes a participant in cultural evolution, and the role of imitation, leadership, and social media on cultural evolution, as well as the trade-off between creativity and continuity.</description>

      <title>How big does a population need to be before demographers can ignore individual-level randomness in demographic events?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When studying a national-level population, demographers can safely ignore the effect of individual-level randomness on age-sex structure. When studying a single community, or group of communities, however, the potential importance of individual-level randomness is less clear. We seek to measure the effect of individual-level randomness in births and deaths on standard summary indicators of age-sex structure, for populations of different sizes, focusing on on demographic conditions typical of historical populations. We conduct a microsimulation experiment where we simulate events and age-sex structure under a range of settings for demographic rates and population size. The experiment results suggest that individual-level randomness strongly affects age-sex structure for populations of about 100, but has a much smaller effect on populations of 1,000, and a negligible effect on populations of 10,000. Our conclusion is that analyses of age-sex structure in historical populations with sizes on the order 100 must account for individual-level randomness in demographic events. Analyses of populations with sizes on the order of 1,000 may need to make some allowance for individual-level variation, but other issues, such as measurement error, probably deserve more attention. Analyses of populations of 10,000 can safely ignore individual-level variation.</description>

      <title>The impact of fear and behaviour response to established and novel diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a disease transmission model that allows individuals to acquire fear and change their behaviour to reduce transmission. Fear is acquired through contact with infected individuals and through the influence of fearful individuals. We analyze the model in two limits: First, an Established Disease Limit (EDL), where the spread of the disease is much faster than the spread of fear, and second, a Novel Disease Limit (NDL), where the spread of the disease is comparable to that of fear. For the EDL, we show that the relative rate of fear acquisition to disease transmission controls the size of the fearful population at the end of a disease outbreak, and that the fear-induced contact reduction behaviour has very little impact on disease burden. Conversely, we show that in the NDL, disease burden can be controlled by fear-induced behaviour depending on the rate of fear loss. Specifically, fear-induced behaviour introduces a contact parameter $p$, which if too large prevents the contact reduction from effectively managing the epidemic. We analytically identify a critical prophylactic behaviour parameter $p=p_c$ where this happens leading to a discontinuity in epidemic prevalence. We show that this change in disease burden introduces multiple epidemic waves.</description>

      <title>Genealogical processes of non-neutral population models under rapid mutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that genealogical trees arising from a broad class of non-neutral models of population evolution converge to the Kingman coalescent under a suitable rescaling of time. As well as non-neutral biological evolution, our results apply to genetic algorithms encompassing the prominent class of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods. The time rescaling we need differs slightly from that used in classical results for convergence to the Kingman coalescent, which has implications for the performance of different resampling schemes in SMC algorithms. In addition, our work substantially simplifies earlier proofs of convergence to the Kingman coalescent, and corrects an error common to several earlier results.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary dynamics of any multiplayer game on regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiplayer games on graphs are at the heart of theoretical descriptions of key evolutionary processes that govern vital social and natural systems. However, a comprehensive theoretical framework for solving multiplayer games with an arbitrary number of strategies on graphs is still missing. Here, we solve this by drawing an analogy with the Balls-and-Boxes problem, based on which we show that the local configuration of multiplayer games on graphs is equivalent to distributing $k$ identical co-players among $n$ distinct strategies. We use this to derive the replicator equation for any $n$-strategy multiplayer game under weak selection, which can be solved in polynomial time. As an example, we revisit the second-order free-riding problem, where costly punishment cannot truly resolve social dilemmas in a well-mixed population. Yet, in structured populations, we derive an accurate threshold for the punishment strength, beyond which punishment can either lead to the extinction of defection or transform the system into a rock-paper-scissors-like cycle. The analytical solution also qualitatively agrees with the phase diagrams that were previously obtained for non-marginal selection strengths. Our framework thus allows an exploration of any multi-strategy multiplayer game on regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Computing macroscopic reaction rates in reaction-diffusion systems using Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03089v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic reaction-diffusion models are employed to represent many complex physical, biological, societal, and ecological systems. The macroscopic reaction rates describing the large-scale kinetics in such systems are effective, scale-dependent parameters that need to be either measured experimentally or computed using a microscopic model. In a Monte Carlo simulation of stochastic reaction-diffusion systems, microscopic probabilities for specific events to happen serve as the input control parameters. Finding the functional dependence of emergent macroscopic rates on the microscopic probabilities is a difficult problem, and there is no systematic analytical way to achieve this goal. Therefore, we introduce a straightforward numerical method of using Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the macroscopic reaction rates by directly obtaining the count statistics of how many events occur per simulation time step. Our technique is first tested on well-understood fundamental examples, namely restricted birth processes, diffusion-limited two-particle coagulation, and two-species pair annihilation kinetics. Next we utilize the thus gained experience to investigate how the microscopic algorithmic probabilities become coarse-grained into effective macroscopic rates in more complex model systems such as the Lotka--Volterra model for predator-prey competition and coexistence, as well as the rock-paper-scissors or cyclic Lotka--Volterra model as well as its May--Leonard variant that capture population dynamics with cyclic dominance motifs. Thereby we achieve a deeper understanding of coarse-graining in spatially extended stochastic reaction systems and the nontrivial relationships between the associated microscopic and macroscopic model parameters. The proposed technique should generally provide a useful means to better fit Monte Carlo simulation results to experimental or observational data.</description>
