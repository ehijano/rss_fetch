      <title>Outcomes from a Workshop on a National Center for Quantum Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In response to numerous programs seeking to advance quantum education and workforce development in the United States, experts from academia, industry, government, and professional societies convened for a National Science Foundation-sponsored workshop in February 2024 to explore the benefits and challenges of establishing a national center for quantum education. Broadly, such a center would foster collaboration and build the infrastructure required to develop a diverse and quantum-ready workforce. The workshop discussions centered around how a center could uniquely address gaps in public, K-12, and undergraduate quantum information science and engineering (QISE) education. Specifically, the community identified activities that, through a center, could lead to an increase in student awareness of quantum careers, boost the number of educators trained in quantum-related subjects, strengthen pathways into quantum careers, enhance the understanding of the U.S. quantum workforce, and elevate public engagement with QISE. Core proposed activities for the center include professional development for educators, coordinated curriculum development and curation, expanded access to educational laboratory equipment, robust evaluation and assessment practices, network building, and enhanced public engagement with quantum science.</description>

      <title>Classical Mechanics from Energy Conservation or: Why not Momentum?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is demonstrated that energy conservation allows for a "heuristic" derivation of Newtonian mechanics, if the energy is presumed to be an additive function of position and velocity. It is shown that energy must be depicted as a function of position and momentum in order to allow for the correct relativistic equations. Accordingly it is argued that not only quantum theory but also special relativity is intrinsically Hamiltonian and requires a description by coordinates and momenta instead of coordinates and velocities. Furthermore it is argued that the usual historical order of the "formulations" of mechanics, from Newtonian via Lagrangian to Hamiltonian mechanics, is illogical and misleading. Therefore it should be reversed.</description>
