      <title>Multi-mode cooling of a Bose-Einstein condensate with linear quantum feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate measurement-based feedback control over the motional degrees of freedom of an oblate quasi-2D atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) subject to continuous density monitoring. We develop a linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) model that describes the multi-mode dynamics of the condensate's collective excitations under continuous measurement and control. Crucially, the multi-mode cold-damping feedback control we consider uses a realistic state-estimation scheme that does not rely upon a particular model of the atomic dynamics. We present analytical results showing that collective excitations can be cooled to below single-phonon average occupation (ground-state cooling) across a broad parameter regime and identify the conditions under which the lowest steady-state phonon occupation is asymptotically achieved. Further, we develop multi-objective optimization methods that explore the trade-off between cooling speed and the final energy of the cloud and provide numerical simulations demonstrating the ground-state cooling of the lowest ten motional modes above the condensate ground state. Our investigation provides concrete guidance on the feedback control design and parameters needed to experimentally realize a feedback-cooled BEC.</description>

      <title>Confinement-induced resonances for the creation of quasi-1D ultra cold gases of alkali--alkaline-earth dimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the role of confinement-induced resonances (CIRs) in low-dimensional ultracold atomic mixtures for the formation of weakly bound dimers. To this end, we examine the scattering properties of a binary atomic mixture confined by a quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) potential. In this regime, the interspecies two-body interaction is modeled as an effective 1D zero-range pseudopotential, with a coupling strength $g_\mathrm{1D}$ derived as a function of the three-dimensional scattering length $a$. This framework enables the study of CIRs in harmonically confined systems, with particular attention to the case of mismatched transverse trapping frequencies for the two atomic species. Finally, we consider the Bose-Fermi mixture of $^{87}$Rb and $^{87}$Sr, and identify values of the experimentally accessible parameters for which CIRs can be exploited to create weakly bound molecules.</description>

      <title>Simplifying higher-order perturbation theory for ring-shaped Bose-Hubbard systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, higher-order perturbation theory is applied and tailored to one-dimensional ring-shaped Bose-Hubbard systems. Spectral and geometrical properties are used to structurally simplify the contributions and reduce computational effort without sacrificing accuracy. For this, a guide for the computation of the individual perturbational orders up to order nine is provided, alongside a both system-specific and parametrization-dependent convergence criterion. The simplification scheme described is found to be applicable to a wider class of Bose-Hubbard systems with different lattice geometries. An exemplary validation of these findings is included in the form of explicit calculations of ground state energies of the three-site Bose-Hubbard system with repulsive on-site interactions. These calculations are successfully checked against numerical computations of exact diagonalization results.</description>

      <title>Creating and melting a supersolid by heating a quantum dipolar system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that rising the temperature of a dipolar gas under certain conditions leads to a transition to a supersolid state. Here, we employ the path integral Monte Carlo method, which exactly accounts for both thermal and correlation effects, to study that phenomenology in a system of $^{162}$Dy atoms in the canonical ensemble. Our microscopic description allows to quantitatively characterize the emergence of spatial order and superfluidity, the two ingredients that define a supersolid state. Our calculations prove that temperature on its own can promote the formation of a supersolid in a dipolar system. Furthermore, we bridge this exotic phenomenology with the more usual melting of the supersolid at a higher temperature. Our results offer insight into the interplay between thermal excitations, the dipole-dipole interaction, quantum statistics and supersolidity.</description>

      <title>Expansion-contraction duality breaking in a Planck-scale sensitive cosmological quantum simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the experimental simulation of cosmological perturbations governed by a Planck-scale induced Lorentz violating dispersion, aimed at distinguishing between early-universe models with similar power spectra. Employing a novel variant of the scaling approach for the evolution of a Bose-Einstein condensate with both contact and dipolar interactions, we show that scale invariance, and in turn, the duality of the power spectrum is broken at large momenta for an inflating gas, and at small momenta for a contracting gas. We thereby furnish a Planck-scale sensitive approach to analogue quantum cosmology that can readily be implemented in the quantum gas laboratory.</description>

      <title>Integrals of motion as slow modes in dissipative many-body operator dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Lindbladian operator dynamics in many-body quantum systems with one or more integrals of motion (IOM), subject to weak local dissipation. We demonstrate that IOMs with small support become slow modes of these dynamics, in the sense that their Frobenius norm decays more slowly compared to generic operators. As a result, the eigenoperators of such Lindbladians with slowest decay rates have a large overlap with the IOMs of the underlying Hamiltonian. We demonstrate this correspondence between slow modes and IOMs numerically for a number of many-body models, and further corroborate it with perturbative arguments. These results open up a new method for the identification of IOMs, and provide insights into the dissipative many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Topology meets symmetry breaking: Hidden order, intrinsically gapless topological states and finite-temperature topological transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the discovery of phase transitions driven by topological defects, the classification of phases of matter has been significantly extended beyond Ginzburg and Landau's paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). In particular, intrinsic and symmetry-protected topological (SPT) orders have been discovered in (mostly gapped) quantum many-body ground states. However, these are commonly viewed as zero-temperature phenomena, and their robustness in a gapless ground state or against thermal fluctuations remains challenging to tackle. Here we introduce an explicit construction for SPT-type states with hidden order associated with SSB: They feature (quasi) long-range correlations along appropriate edges, but short-range order in the bulk; ground state degeneracy associated with SSB; and non-local string order in the bulk. We apply our construction to predict two types of finite-temperature SPT transitions, in the Ising and BKT class respectively, where the usual signs of criticality appear despite the absence of a diverging correlation length in the bulk. While the state featuring hidden Ising order is gapped, the other SPT state associated with the BKT-SPT transition has hidden $U(1)$, or XY-order and constitutes an intrinsically gapless SPT state, associated with a gapless Goldstone mode. Specifically, in this work we discuss spins with global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ or $U(1)$ symmetry coupled to link variables constituting a loop gas model. By mapping this system to an Ising-gauge theory, we demonstrate that one of the SPT phases we construct corresponds to the Higgs-SPT phase at $T=0$ -- which we show here to remain stable at finite temperature. Our work paves the way for a more systematic search for hidden order SPT phases, including in gapless systems, and raises the question if a natural (finite-$T$) spin liquid candidate exists that realizes hidden order in the Higgs-SPT class.</description>

      <title>The SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard Model on two sites: Bethe Ansatz solution and Quantum Phase Transition of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Model in the large-N limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) on two sites, where N is the number of flavors of each fermion, corresponds to an exactly solvable two-level many-boson model that Richardson [J. Math. Phys. 9, 1327 (1968)] analytically solved long ago. We express the Bethe ansatz solutions as a function of the physical parameters of the SU(N) FHM, and recast its eigenvalues and eigenstates in terms of the Richardson pair energies and creation operators. In this context, the connection with the well-studied Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model, known as equivalent to the Richardson model, is established and serves as a guideline to the prediction of some N-body physics phenomena in the two-site SU(N) FHM with N particles. In particular, the LMG second-order quantum phase transition (QPT) is shown to occur in the SU(N) FHM for an attractive density-density interaction U equal to U_c=-1/(2N), in units of the (absolute value of the) tunneling amplitude between the two sites. We show the finite-size energies, the gap, and the kinetic energy, which all reveal the transition, as a function of U for values of N from N = 3 to N = 36, suggesting that the QPT could be experimentally achieved with current technologies involving SU(N) ultracold atoms or molecules. Finally, we show the entanglement entropy of the first site with respect to the second, and it scales like N at the transition, in contrast with several two-mode models.</description>

      <title>Fast and direct preparation of a genuine lattice BEC via the quantum Mpemba effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient method for dissipatively preparing a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) directly on a lattice, avoiding the need for a two-staged preparation procedure currently used in ultracold-atom platforms. Our protocol is based on driving the lattice-subsystem into a non-equilibrium steady state, which we show to exhibit a lattice analog of a true BEC, where the depletion can be controlled via the dissipation strength. Furthermore, exploiting a symmetry-based Mpemba effect, we analytically identify a class of simple, experimentally-realizable states that converge exponentially faster to the steady state than typical random initializations. We also show how to tune the momentum of the created high-fidelity BEC by combining superfluid immersion with lattice shaking. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations of the dissipative dynamics. This protocol paves the way to unlock the enormous potential of a dissipative preparation of highly entangled states in analog quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Multi-mode NOON states generation with ultracold atoms via geodesic counterdiabatic driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a protocol for the generation of NOON states with ultracold atoms, leveraging the Bose-Hubbard model in the self-trapping regime. By the means of an optimized adiabatic protocol, we achieve a significant reduction in the time required for the preparation of highly entangled NOON states, involving two or more modes. Our method saturates the quantum speed limit, ensuring both efficiency and high fidelity in state preparation. A detailed analysis of the geodesic counterdiabatic driving protocol and its application to the Bose-Hubbard system highlights its ability to expand the energy gap, facilitating faster adiabatic evolution. Through perturbation theory, we derive effective parameters that emulate the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian, enabling experimentally viable implementations with constant physical parameters. This approach is demonstrated to yield exponential time savings compared to standard geodesic driving, making it a powerful tool for creating complex entangled states for applications in quantum metrology and quantum information. Our findings pave the way for scalable and precise quantum state control in ultracold atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Effective (Floquet) Lindblad generators from spectral unwinding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17072v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A mathematical description of the reduced dynamics of an open quantum system can often be given in terms of a completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP) map, also known as quantum channel. In a seminal work by Wolf et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 150402 (2008)], it was shown that deciding whether a given quantum channel was generated from an underlying effective Markovian dynamics, with time-independent generator of Lindblad form, is generally an NP-hard problem. The difficulty is related to the fact that one has to search through all possible branches of the operator logarithm of the map, in order to identify, if any of the resulting effective generators is of Lindblad form. In this work we show that in cases where one has access to the full reduced dynamics at all previous times (the dynamical map) one can significantly facilitate the search for an effective generator by making use of Floquet theory. By performing a spectral unwinding such that the effective micromotion is minimized, the effective Floquet generator is often an excellent candidate for an effective generator of Lindblad form. This significantly reduces the complexity of the search for an effective generator of Lindblad form in many (though not all) cases. Our results are relevant for engineering Floquet Lindbladians in complex many-body systems.</description>
