      <title>Long Coalition Leads to Shrink? The Roles of Tipping and Technology-Sharing in Climate Clubs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global cooperation is posited as a pivotal solution to address climate change, yet significant barriers, like free-riding, hinder its realization. This paper develops a dynamic game-theoretic model to analyze the stability of coalitions under multiple stochastic climate tippings, and a technology-sharing mechanism is designed in the model to combat free-ridings. Our results reveal that coalitions tend to shrink over time as temperatures rise, owing to potential free-ridings, despite a large size of initial coalition. The threat of climate tipping reduces the size of stable coalitions compared to the case where tipping is ignored. However, at post-tipping period, coalitions temporarily expand as regions respond to the shock, though this cooperation is short-lived and followed by further shrink. Notably, technology-sharing generates greater collective benefits than sanctions, suggesting that the proposed dynamic technology-sharing pathway bolsters coalition resilience against free-riding while limiting the global warming. This framework highlights the critical role of technology-sharing in fostering long-term climate cooperation under climate tipping uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence, Lean Startup Method, and Product Innovations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although AI has the potential to drive significant business innovation, many firms struggle to realize its benefits. We examine how the Lean Startup Method (LSM) influences the impact of AI on product innovation in startups. Analyzing data from 1,800 Chinese startups between 2011 and 2020, alongside policy shifts by the Chinese government in encouraging AI adoption, we find that companies with strong AI capabilities produce more innovative products. Moreover, our study reveals that AI investments complement LSM in innovation, with effectiveness varying by the type of innovation and AI capability. We differentiate between discovery-oriented AI, which reduces uncertainty in novel areas of innovation, and optimization-oriented AI, which refines and optimizes existing processes. Within the framework of LSM, we further distinguish between prototyping focused on developing minimum viable products, and controlled experimentation, focused on rigorous testing such as AB testing. We find that LSM complements discovery oriented AI by utilizing AI to expand the search for market opportunities and employing prototyping to validate these opportunities, thereby reducing uncertainties and facilitating the development of the first release of products. Conversely, LSM complements optimization-oriented AI by using AB testing to experiment with the universe of input features and using AI to streamline iterative refinement processes, thereby accelerating the improvement of iterative releases of products. As a result, when firms use AI and LSM for product development, they are able to generate more high quality product in less time. These findings, applicable to both software and hardware development, underscore the importance of treating AI as a heterogeneous construct, as different AI capabilities require distinct organizational processes to achieve optimal outcomes.</description>

      <title>Social Media Can Reduce Misinformation When Public Scrutiny is High</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Misinformation poses a growing global threat to institutional trust, democratic stability, and public decision-making. While prior research has often portrayed social media as a channel for spreading falsehoods, less is known about the conditions under which it may instead constrain misinformation by enhancing transparency and accountability. Here we show this dual potential in the context of local governments' GDP reporting in China, where data falsifications are widespread. Analyzing official reports from 2011 to 2019, we find that local governments have overstated GDP on average. However, after adopting social media for public communications, the extent of misreporting declines significantly but only in regions where the public scrutiny over political matters is high. In such regions, social media increases the cost of misinformation by facilitating greater information disclosure and bottom-up monitoring. In contrast, in regions with low public scrutiny, adopting social media can exacerbate data manipulation. These findings challenge the prevailing view that social media primarily amplifies misinformation and instead highlight the importance of civic engagement as a moderating force. Our findings show a boundary condition for the spread of misinformation and offer insights for platform design and public policy aimed at promoting accuracy and institutional accountability.</description>

      <title>Optimal Regulation and Investment Incentives in Financial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine optimal regulation of financial networks with debt interdependencies between financial firms. We first characterize when it is firms have an incentive to choose excessively risky portfolios and overly correlate their portfolios with those of their counterparties. We then characterize how optimal regulation depends on a firm's financial centrality and its available investment opportunities. In standard core-periphery networks, optimal regulation depends non-monotonically on the correlation of banks' investments, with maximal restrictions for intermediate levels of correlation. Moreover, it can be uniquely optimal to treat banks asymmetrically: restricting the investments of one core bank while allowing an otherwise identical core bank (in all aspects, including network centrality) to invest freely.</description>

      <title>A new equilibrium: COVID-19 lockdowns and WFH persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper documents a robust link between COVID-19 lockdowns and the uptake and persistence of working from home (WFH) practices. Exploiting rich longitudinal data, we use a difference-in-differences strategy to compare office workers in three heavily locked-down Australian states to similar workers in less affected states. Locked-down workers sustain 43% higher WFH levels through 2023 - 0.5 days per week - with a monotonic dose-response relationship. Persistence is driven by adjustments on both sides of the labor market: employers downsize office space and open remote or hybrid positions, while employees relocate away from city centers and invest in home offices and technology.</description>

      <title>Modern approaches to building effective interpretable models of the property market using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we review modern approaches to building interpretable models of property markets using machine learning on the base of mass valuation of property in the Primorye region, Russia. The researcher, lacking expertise in this topic, encounters numerous difficulties in the effort to build a good model. The main source of this is the huge difference between noisy real market data and ideal data which is very common in all types of tutorials on machine learning. This paper covers all stages of modeling: the collection of initial data, identification of outliers, the search and analysis of patterns in data, the formation and final choice of price factors, the building of the model, and the evaluation of its efficiency. For each stage, we highlight potential issues and describe sound methods for overcoming emerging difficulties on actual examples. We show that the combination of classical linear regression with interpolation methods of geostatistics allows to build an effective model for land parcels. For flats, when many objects are attributed to one spatial point the application of geostatistical methods is difficult. Therefore we suggest linear regression with automatic generation and selection of additional rules on the base of decision trees, so called the RuleFit method. Thus we show, that despite the strong restriction as the requirement of interpretability which is important in practical aspects, for example, legal matters, it is still possible to build effective models of real property markets.</description>

      <title>Cognitive Hierarchy in Day-to-day Network Flow Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When making route decisions, travelers may engage in a certain degree of reasoning about what the others will do in the upcoming day, rendering yesterday's shortest routes less attractive. This phenomenon was manifested in a recent virtual experiment that mimicked travelers' repeated daily trip-making process. Unfortunately, prevailing day-to-day traffic dynamical models failed to faithfully reproduce the collected flow evolution data therein. To this end, we propose a day-to-day traffic behavior modeling framework based on the Cognitive Hierarchy theory, in which travelers with different levels of strategic-reasoning capabilities form their own beliefs about lower-step travelers' capabilities when choosing their routes. Two widely-studied day-to-day models, the Network Tatonnement Process dynamic and the Logit dynamic, are extended into the framework and studied as examples. Calibration of the virtual experiment is performed using the extended Network Tatonnement Process dynamic, which fits the experimental data reasonably well. We show that the two extended dynamics have multiple equilibria, one of which is the classical user equilibrium. While analyzing global stability is intractable due to the presence of multiple equilibria, local stabilities near equilibria are developed analytically and verified by numerical experiments. General insights on how key parameters affect the stability of user equilibria are unveiled.</description>

      <title>Solving equilibrium problems in economies with financial markets, home production, and retention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new methodology to compute equilibria for general equilibrium problems on exchange economies with real financial markets, home-production, and retention. We demonstrate that equilibrium prices can be determined by solving a related maxinf-optimization problem. We incorporate the non-arbitrage condition for financial markets into the equilibrium formulation and establish the equivalence between solutions to both problems. This reduces the complexity of the original by eliminating the need to directly compute financial contract prices, allowing us to calculate equilibria even in cases of incomplete financial markets.
  We also introduce a Walrasian bifunction that captures the imbalances and show that maxinf-points of this function correspond to equilibrium points. Moreover, we demonstrate that every equilibrium point can be approximated by a limit of maxinf points for a family of perturbed problems, by relying on the notion of lopsided convergence.
  Finally, we propose an augmented Walrasian algorithm and present numerical examples to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach. Our methodology allows for efficient calculation of equilibria in a variety of exchange economies and has potential applications in finance and economics.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Replace Human Subjects? A Large-Scale Replication of Scenario-Based Experiments in Psychology and Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being integrated into scientific research, particularly in the social sciences, where understanding human behavior is critical. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in replicating human-like responses in various psychological experiments. We conducted a large-scale study replicating 156 psychological experiments from top social science journals using three state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and DeepSeek v3). Our results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate high replication rates for main effects (73-81%) and moderate to strong success with interaction effects (46-63%), They consistently produce larger effect sizes than human studies, with Fisher Z values approximately 2-3 times higher than human studies. Notably, LLMs show significantly lower replication rates for studies involving socially sensitive topics such as race, gender and ethics. When original studies reported null findings, LLMs produced significant results at remarkably high rates (68-83%) - while this could reflect cleaner data with less noise, as evidenced by narrower confidence intervals, it also suggests potential risks of effect size overestimation. Our results demonstrate both the promise and challenges of LLMs in psychological research, offering efficient tools for pilot testing and rapid hypothesis validation while enriching rather than replacing traditional human subject studies, yet requiring more nuanced interpretation and human validation for complex social phenomena and culturally sensitive research questions.</description>
