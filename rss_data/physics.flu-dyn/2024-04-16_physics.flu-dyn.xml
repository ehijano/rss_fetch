      <title>Energy stability of magnetohydrodynamic flow in channels and ducts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the energy stability of pressure-driven laminar magnetohydrodynamic flow in a rectangular duct with transverse homogeneous magnetic field and electrically insulating walls. For sufficiently strong fields, the laminar velocity distribution has a uniform core and convex Hartmann and Shercliff boundary layers on the walls perpendicular and parallel to the magnetic field. The problem is discretized by a double expansion in Chebyshev polynomials in the cross-stream coordinates. The linear eigenvalue problem for the critical Reynolds number depends on the streamwise wavenumber, Hartmann number and the aspect ratio. We consider the limits of small and large aspect ratios in order to compare with stability models based on one-dimensional base flows. For large aspect ratios we find good numerical agreement with results based on the quasi-two-dimensional approximation. The lift-up mechanism dominates in the limit of zero streamwise wavenumber and provides a linear dependence between the critical Reynolds and Hartmann number in the duct. The duct results for small aspect ratio converge to Orr's original energy stability result for spanwise uniform perturbations imposed on the plane Poiseuille base flow. We also examine different possible symmetries of eigenmodes as well as the purely hydrodynamic case in the duct geometry.</description>

      <title>Causal analysis of inner and outer motions in near-wall turbulent flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the causality of near-wall inner and outer turbulent motions. Here we define the inner motions as the self-sustained near-wall cycle and the outer motions as those living in the logarithmic layer exhibiting a footprint on the near-wall region. We perform causal analysis using two different methods: one is the transfer entropy, based on the information theory, and the other one is the Liang--Kleeman information-flow theory. The causal-analysis methods are applied to several scenarios, including a linear and a non-linear problem, a low-dimensional model of the near-wall cycle of turbulence, as well as the interaction between inner and outer turbulent motions in a channel at a friction Reynolds number of $Re_{\tau}=1000$. We find that both methods can well predict the causal links in the linear problem, and the information flow can identify more of the nonlinear problem. Despite richer causalities revealed by the transfer entropy for turbulent-flow problems, both methods can successfully identify the streak-vortex regeneration mechanism that majorly sustains the near-wall turbulence. It is also indicated that both bottom-up and top-down influences of inner and outer motions may coexist in addition to the multiscale self-sustaining mechanism. Lastly, we mention that the computation of the information flow is much more efficient than the transfer entropy. The present study suggests that the information flow can have great potential in causal inference for turbulent-flow problems besides the transfer entropy.</description>

      <title>Flattening-off of droplet bouncing trend under high ambient gas pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was previously observed that colliding liquid droplets in a gaseous medium tend to bounce off at elevated gas pressure up to about 12 atm. In this letter, we extended the droplet collision experiment to up to 41 atm for the first time and reported a noticeable discovery that the tendency is flattened off at higher pressures. The colliding droplets stop bouncing but start to coalesce beyond a critical Weber number, which increases with pressure but tends to a limit value at 21 atm and above. A scaling analysis taking into account the gas-film dynamics, the rarefied gas effects, and van der Waals force well correlates with the experimental discovery.</description>

      <title>Assessment of a Multiphase Formulation of One-Dimensional Turbulence using Direct Numerical Simulation of a Decaying Turbulent Interfacial Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between turbulence and surface tension is studied numerically using the one-dimensional-turbulence (ODT) model. ODT is a stochastic model simulating turbulent flow evolution along a notional one-dimensional line of sight by applying instantaneous maps that represent the effects of individual turbulent eddies on property fields. It provides affordable high resolution of interface creation and property gradients within each phase, which are key for capturing the local behavior as well as overall trends, and has been shown to reproduce the main features of an experimentally determined regime diagram for primary jet breakup. Here, ODT is used to investigate the interaction of turbulence with an initially planar interface. The notional flat interface is inserted into a periodic box of decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence, simulated for a variety of turbulent Reynolds and Weber numbers. Unity density and viscosity ratios serve to focus solely on the interaction between fluid inertia and the surface-tension force. Statistical measures of interface surface density and spatial structure along the direction normal to the initial surface are compared to corresponding direct-numerical-simulation (DNS) data. Allowing the origin of the lateral coordinate system to follow the location of the median interface element improves the agreement between ODT and DNS, reflecting the absence of lateral non-vortical displacements in ODT. Beyond the DNS-accessible regime, ODT is shown to obey the predicted parameter dependencies of the Kolmogorov critical scale in both the inertial and dissipative turbulent-cascade sub-ranges. Notably, the probability density function of local fluctuations of the critical scale is found to collapse to a universal curve across both sub-ranges.</description>

      <title>Order-lifted data inversion/retrieval method of neighbor cells to implement general high-order schemes in unstructured-mesh-based finite-volume solution framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces an order-lifted inversion/retrieval method for implementing high-order schemes within the framework of an unstructured-mesh-based finite-volume method. This method defines a special representation called the data order-lifted inversion of neighbor cells (DOLINC) differential, which transforms the degrees of freedom of wide templates into differentials of various orders stored in local grid cells. Furthermore, to retrieve the original far-field information without bias during the reconstruction/interpolation of face values, the corresponding accurate inversion formulas are derived based on the defined DOLINC differentials. The order-lifted inversion method can be applied to multi-dimensional polyhedral-mesh solvers by considering the influence of grid non-uniformity on high-order schemes. It seamlessly accommodates multi-process parallel computing for high-order methods without requiring special consideration for the boundary interface. This method not only enhances the numerical accuracy of second-order finite-volume methods, but also demonstrates a significant computational-speed advantage over similar methods. A series of benchmark cases, including the linear advection, Burgers, and Euler equations, are comprehensively validated to assess the practical performance of the method. The results indicate that the unstructured-mesh high-order schemes implemented based on this method achieve theoretical accuracy in practical computations and substantially reduce computational costs compared with methods that increase grid resolution.</description>

      <title>Using Biot-Savart to shrink Eulerian domains while maintaining or improving external flow accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel boundary condition formulated using a Biot-Savart vorticity integral inside an Eulerian fluid domain that maintains high-accuracy results even when the domain boundary is within a body-length of immersed solid boundaries. The Biot-Savart condition is incorporated into a general solver with Eulerian velocity-pressure fields by including the pressure-induced body vorticity during the incompressible-flow projection-step. We use a multilevel approach to reduce the computational cost of the evaluation of the Biot-Savart integral from O(N) to O(\log N) and formally show that the error associated with this approach is bounded by the total vorticity contained in the lower levels and that it scales with the inverse power of the problem's dimension. We use two-dimensional and three-dimensional analytic vortex problems to demonstrate this scaling is correct and select appropriate multilevel coarsening parameters accordingly. We show that the new method exactly captures the analytical added-mass force of a square plate accelerated from rest even when the entire domain only extends 1/2 diameter from the plate. The new method also predicts essentially identical time-varying drag forces for a two-dimensional circle regardless of domain size, while classical boundary conditions require a domain nearly 10 times larger to converge on the new method's result. Finally, we study the sensitivity of deflected wakes to the new domain boundary conditions and show that only in minimal domains, 5 times smaller than the reference domain, the omission of the far-field wake influences the flow field and the forces on the body. Doubling the domain size recovers the correct results.</description>

      <title>Data-driven turbulence modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter provides an introduction to data-driven techniques for the development and calibration of closure models for the Reynolds-Averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) equations. RANS models are the workhorse for engineering applications of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and are expected to play an important role for decades to come. However, RANS model inadequacies for complex, non-equilibrium flows and uncertainties in modeling assumptions and calibration data are still a major obstacle to the predictive capability of RANS simulations. In the following, we briefly recall the origin and limitations of RANS models, and then review their shortcomings and uncertainties. Then, we provide an introduction to data-driven approaches to RANS turbulence modeling. The latter can range from simple model parameter inference to sophisticated machine learning techniques. We conclude with some perspectives on current and future research trends.</description>

      <title>Surfactant-laden bubble bursting: dynamics of capillary waves and Worthington jet at large Bond number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical study of the main sub-stages preceding aerosol formation via bursting bubbles: capillary wave propagation along the bubble, convergence at the bubble's apex, the ascent of a Worthington jet and its break-up to release liquid drops. We focus on two crucial yet overlooked aspects of the system: the presence of surface-active agents and dynamics driven by non-negligible gravitational effects, quantified by the Bond number. Our results propose, for the first time, a mechanism explaining capillary wave retardation in the presence of surfactants, involving the transition from bi- to uni-directional Marangoni stresses, which pull the interface upwards, countering the motion of the waves. We also quantitatively elucidate the variable nature of the waves' velocity with various surfactant parameters, including surfactant solubility and elasticity, a departure from the constant behaviour well-documented in clean interfaces.</description>

      <title>Threshold Current Density for Diffusion-controlled Stability of Electrolytic Surface Nanobubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the stability mechanism of surface micro/nanobubbles adhered to gas-evolving electrodes is essential for improving the efficiency of water electrolysis, which is known to be hindered by the bubble coverage on electrodes. Using molecular simulations, the diffusion-controlled evolution of single electrolytic nanobubbles on wettability-patterned nanoelectrodes is investigated. These nanoelectrodes feature hydrophobic islands as preferential nucleation sites and allow the growth of nanobubbles in the pinning mode. In these simulations, a threshold current density distinguishing stable nanobubbles from unstable nanobubbles is found. When the current density remains below the threshold value, nucleated nanobubbles grow to their equilibrium states, maintaining their nanoscopic size. However, for the current density above the threshold value, nanobubbles undergo unlimited growth and can eventually detach due to buoyancy. Increasing the pinning length of nanobubbles increases the degree of nanobubble instability. By connecting the current density with the local gas oversaturation, an extension of the stability theory for surface nanobubbles [Lohse and Zhang, Phys. Rev. E, 2015, 91, 031003(R)] accurately predicts the nanobubble behavior found in molecular simulations, including equilibrium contact angles and the threshold current density. For larger systems that are not accessible to molecular simulations, continuum numerical simulations with the finite difference method combined with the immersed boundary method are performed, again demonstrating good agreement between numerics and theories.</description>

      <title>From laminar to chaotic flow via stochastic resonance in viscoelastic channel flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research indicates that low-inertia viscoelastic channel flow experiences supercritical non-normal mode elastic instability from laminar to sustained chaotic flow due to finite-size perturbations. The challenge of this study is to elucidate a realization of such a pathway when the intensity of the elastic wave is too low to amplify velocity fluctuations above the instability onset. The study identifies two subregions in the transition flow regime at Weissenberg number $Wi&gt;Wi_c$, the instability onset. In the lower subregion at $Wi_c\leq Wi\leq 300$, we discover periodic spikes in the streamwise velocity time series $u(t)$ that appear in the chaotic power spectrum as low-frequency, high-intensity peaks resembling stochastic resonance (SR). In contrast, the spanwise velocity power spectrum, $E_w$, remains flat with low-intensity, noisy, and broad elastic wave peaks. The spikes significantly distort the probability density function of $u$, initiating and amplifying random streaks and wall-normal vorticity fluctuations. The SR appearance is similar to dynamical systems where chaotic attractor and limit cycle interact with external white noise. This similarity is confirmed by presenting a phase portrait in two subregions of the transition regime. In the upper subregion at $Wi&gt;400$ the periodic spikes disappear and $E_w$ becomes chaotic with a large intensity elastic wave sufficient to self-organize and synchronize the streaks into cycles and to amplify the wall normal vorticity according to a recently proposed mechanism.</description>

      <title>Turbulent ice-ocean boundary layers in the well-mixed regime: insights from direct numerical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The meltwater mixing line (MML) model provides a theoretical prediction of near-ice water mass properties that is useful to compare with observations. If oceanographic measurements reported in a temperature-salinity diagram overlap with the MML prediction, then it is usually concluded that the local dynamics are dominated by the turbulent mixing of an ambient water mass with nearby melting ice. While the MML model is consistent with numerous observations, it is built on an assumption that is difficult to test with field measurements, especially near the ice boundary, namely that the effective (turbulent and molecular) salt and temperature diffusivities are equal. In this paper, this assumption is tested via direct numerical simulations of a canonical model for externally-forced ice-ocean boundary layers in a uniform ambient. We focus on the well-mixed regime by considering an ambient temperature close to freezing and run the simulations until a statistical steady state is reached. The results validate the assumption of equal effective diffusivities across most of the boundary layer. Importantly, the validity of the MML model implies a linear correlation between the mean salinity and temperature profiles normal to the interface that can be leveraged to construct a reduced ice-ocean boundary layer model based on a single scalar variable called thermal driving. We demonstrate that the bulk dynamics predicted by the reduced thermal driving model are in good agreement with the bulk dynamics predicted by the full temperature-salinity model. Then, we show how the results from the thermal driving model can be used to estimate the interfacial heat and salt fluxes, and the melt rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform direct numerical simulations of sub-Kolmogorov, inertial spheroids settling under gravity in homogeneous, isotropic turbulence and find that small-scale clustering, measured via the correlation dimension, depends sensitively on their aspect ratios. In particular, such particles are shown to cluster more as their anisotropy increases. Further, the approach rate for pairs of spheroids are calculated and found to deviate significantly from the spherical-particle limit. Our study, spanning a range of Stokes numbers and aspect ratios, provides critical inputs for developing collision models to understand the dynamics of sedimenting, anisotropic particles in general and ice crystals in clouds in particular.</description>

Abstract: Big data and machine learning are driving comprehensive economic and social transformations and are rapidly re-shaping the toolbox and the methodologies of applied scientists. Machine learning tools are designed to learn functions from data with little to no need of prior knowledge. As continuous developments in experimental and numerical methods improve our ability to collect high-quality data, machine learning tools become increasingly viable and promising also in disciplines rooted in physical principles. These notes explore how machine learning can be integrated and combined with more classic methods in fluid dynamics. After a brief review of the machine learning landscape, we show how many problems in fluid mechanics can be framed as machine learning problems and we explore challenges and opportunities. We consider several relevant applications: aeroacoustic noise prediction, turbulence modelling, reduced-order modelling and forecasting, meshless integration of (partial) differential equations, super-resolution and flow control. While this list is by no means exhaustive, the presentation will provide enough concrete examples to offer perspectives on how machine learning might impact the way we do research and learn from data.</description>

      <title>A probabilistic, data-driven closure model for RANS simulations with aleatoric, model uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven, closure model for Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations that incorporates aleatoric, model uncertainty. The proposed closure consists of two parts. A parametric one, which utilizes previously proposed, neural-network-based tensor basis functions dependent on the rate of strain and rotation tensor invariants. This is complemented by latent, random variables which account for aleatoric model errors. A fully Bayesian formulation is proposed, combined with a sparsity-inducing prior in order to identify regions in the problem domain where the parametric closure is insufficient and where stochastic corrections to the Reynolds stress tensor are needed. Training is performed using sparse, indirect data, such as mean velocities and pressures, in contrast to the majority of alternatives that require direct Reynolds stress data. For inference and learning, a Stochastic Variational Inference scheme is employed, which is based on Monte Carlo estimates of the pertinent objective in conjunction with the reparametrization trick. This necessitates derivatives of the output of the RANS solver, for which we developed an adjoint-based formulation. In this manner, the parametric sensitivities from the differentiable solver can be combined with the built-in, automatic differentiation capability of the neural network library in order to enable an end-to-end differentiable framework. We demonstrate the capability of the proposed model to produce accurate, probabilistic, predictive estimates for all flow quantities, even in regions where model errors are present, on a separated flow in the backward-facing step benchmark problem.</description>

      <title>Morphology of clean and surfactant-laden droplets in homogeneous isotropic turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform direct numerical simulations of surfactant-laden droplets in homogeneous isotropic turbulence with Taylor Reynolds number of 180. The droplets are modelled using the volume of fluid method, and the soluble surfactant is transported using an advection-diffusion equation. Effects of surfactant on the droplet and local flow statistics are well approximated using a lower, averaged value of surface tension, allowing us to extend the framework developed by Hinze (1955) and Kolmogorov (1949) for surfactant-free bubbles. The Kolmogorov-Hinze scale $d_H$ is indeed found to be a pivotal length scale in the droplets' dynamics, separating the coalescence-dominated (droplets smaller than $d_H$) and the breakage-dominated (droplets larger than $d_H$) regimes in the droplet size distribution. We find that droplets smaller than $d_H$ have compact, regular, spheroid-like shapes, whereas droplets larger than $d_H$ have long, convoluted, filamentous shapes with a diameter equal to $d_H$. This results in two different scaling laws for the interfacial area of the droplet. The normalised area, $A/d_H^2$, of droplets smaller than $d_H$ is proportional to $d^2$, while the area of droplets larger than $d_H$ is proportional to $d^3$, where $d$ is the droplet size. We further characterise the large filamentous droplets by computing the number of handles (loops of the dispersed phase extending into the carrier phase) and voids (regions of the carrier fluid entirely enclosed by the dispersed phase) on each droplet. The number of handles per unit length of filament scales inversely with surface tension. The number of voids is proportional to the droplet size and independent of surface tension. Handles are indeed an unstable feature of the interface and are destroyed by the restoring effect of surface tension, whereas voids can move freely in the interior of the droplets, unaffected by surface tension.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation covariance-based study of roll-streak dynamics in Poiseuille flow turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02085v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although the roll-streak (R-S) is fundamentally involved in the dynamics of wall-turbulence, the physical mechanism responsible for its formation and maintenance remains controversial. In this work we investigate the dynamics maintaining the R-S in turbulent Poiseuille flow at R=1650. Spanwise collocation is used to remove spanwise displacement of the streaks and associated flow components, which isolates the streamwise-mean flow R-S component and the second-order statistics of the streamwise-varying fluctuations that are collocated with the R-S. This streamwise-mean/fluctuation partition of the dynamics facilitates exploiting insights gained from the analytic characterization of turbulence in the second-order statistical state dynamics (SSD), referred to as S3T, and its closely associated restricted nonlinear dynamics (RNL) approximation. Symmetry of the statistics about the streak centerline permits separation of the fluctuations into sinuous and varicose components. The Reynolds stress forcing induced by the sinuous and varicose fluctuations acting on the R-S is shown to reinforce low- and high-speed streaks respectively. This targeted reinforcement of streaks by the Reynolds stresses occurs continuously as the fluctuation field is strained by the streamwise-mean streak and not intermittently as would be associated with streak-breakdown events. The Reynolds stresses maintaining the streamwise-mean roll arise primarily from the dominant POD modes of the fluctuations, which can be identified with the time average structure of optimal perturbations growing on the streak. These results are consistent with a universal process of R-S growth and maintenance in turbulent shear flow arising from roll forcing generated by straining turbulent fluctuations, which was identified using the S3T SSD.</description>

      <title>Wall modes and the transition to bulk convection in rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate states of rapidly rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection in a cylindrical cell over a range of Rayleigh number $3\times10^5\leq Ra \leq 5\times10^{9}$ and Ekman number $10^{-6} \leq Ek \leq 10^{-4}$ for Prandtl number $Pr = 0.8$ and aspect ratios $1/5 \leq \Gamma \leq 5$ using direct numerical simulations. We characterize, for perfectly insulating sidewall boundary conditions, the first transition to convection via wall mode instability and the nonlinear growth and instability of the resulting wall mode states including a secondary transition to time dependence. We show how the radial structure of the vertical velocity $u_z$ and the temperature $T$ is captured well by the linear eigenfunctions of the wall mode instability where the radial width of $u_z$ is $\delta_{u_z} \sim Ek^{1/3} r/H$ whereas $\delta_T \sim e^{-k r}$ ($k$ is the wavenumber of an laterally infinite wall mode state). The disparity in spatial scales for $Ek = 10^{-6}$ means that the heat transport is dominated by the radial structure of $u_z$ since $T$ varies slowly over the radial scale $\delta_{u_z}$. We further describe how the transition to a state of bulk convection is influenced by the presence of the wall mode states. We use temporal and spatial scales as measures of the local state of convection and the Nusselt number $Nu$ as representative of global transport. Our results elucidate the evolution of the wall state of rotating convection and confirm that wall modes are strongly linked with the boundary zonal flow (BZF) being the robust remnant of nonlinear wall mode states. We also show how the heat transport ($Nu$) contributions of wall modes and bulk modes are related and discuss approaches to disentangling their relative contributions.</description>

      <title>Towards a general description of the cavitation threshold in acoustic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditionally, the occurrence of cavitation has been related to the ratio between flow velocity and pressure gradient in the case of hydrodynamic cavitation, or some combination of vapor pressure and surface tension. However, both formulations present a large discrepancy with experimental data for cases in which cavitation is induced by acoustic waves. The present study aims to identify a more suitable cavitation threshold for such cases. The methodology adopted in this work consists of a combination of visualization with high-speed cameras and direct measurements using a hydrophone. The data collected confirmed that the vapor pressure is not a proper indicator of cavitation occurrence for an acoustic system characterized by high frequencies. The main reason behind the inability of vapor pressure to predict incipient cavitation in acoustic systems is that they evolve very quickly toward strong gradients in pressure, and the quasi-static assumptions used by traditional models are not valid. Instead, the system evolves towards a metastable state [Brennen, 2013], where the liquid exhibits an elastic behavior and can withstand negative pressures. A new cavitation number accounting for the tensile strength of the liquid was defined. An acoustic analogy is also proposed for the description, with the same framework, of an impulsive cavitation phenomenon.</description>

      <title>A fast, matrix-based method to perform omnidirectional pressure integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimentally-measured pressure fields play an important role in understanding many fluid dynamics problems. Unfortunately, pressure fields are difficult to measure directly with non-invasive, spatially resolved diagnostics, and calculations of pressure from velocity have proven sensitive to error in the data. Omnidirectional line integration methods are usually more accurate and robust to these effects as compared to implicit Poisson equations, but have seen slower uptake due to the higher computational and memory costs, particularly in 3D domains. This paper demonstrates how omnidirectional line integration approaches can be converted to a matrix inversion problem. This novel formulation uses an iterative approach so that the boundary conditions are updated each step, preserving the convergence behavior of omnidirectional schemes while also keeping the computational efficiency of Poisson solvers. This method is implemented in Matlab and also as a GPU-accelerated code in CUDA-C++. The behavior of the new method is demonstrated on 2D and 3D synthetic and experimental data. Three-dimensional grid sizes of up to 125 million grid points are tractable with this method, opening exciting opportunities to perform volumetric pressure field estimation from 3D PIV measurements.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Transport Barriers with Swimming Microorganisms in Chaotic Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of bacterial activity on the mixing and transport properties of a passive scalar in time-periodic flows in experiments and in a simple model. We focus on the interactions between swimming E. coli and the Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCSs) of the flow, which are computed from experimentally measured velocity fields. Experiments show that such interactions are non-trivial and can lead to transport barriers through which the scalar flux is significantly reduced. Using the Poincar\'e map, we show that these transport barriers coincide with the outermost members of elliptic LCSs known as Lagrangian vortex boundaries. Numerical simulations further show that elliptic LCSs can repel elongated swimmers and lead to swimmer depletion within Lagrangian coherent vortices. A simple mechanism shows that such depletion is due to the preferential alignment of elongated swimmers with the tangents of elliptic LCSs. Our results provide insights into understanding the transport of microorganisms in complex flows with dynamical topological features from a Lagrangian viewpoint.</description>

      <title>G\"ortler number-based scaling of boundary-layer transition on rotating cones in axial inflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper reports on the efficacy of the G\"ortler number in scaling the laminar-turbulent boundary-layer transition on rotating cones facing axial inflow. Depending on the half-cone angle $\psi$ and axial flow strength, the competing centrifugal and crossflow instabilities dominate the transition. Traditionally, the flow is evaluated by using two parameters: the local meridional Reynolds number $Re_l$ comparing the inertial versus viscous effects and the local rotational speed ratio $S$ accounting for the boundary-layer skew. We focus on the centrifugal effects, and evaluate the flow fields and reported transition points using G\"ortler number based on the azimuthal momentum thickness of the similarity solution and local cone radius. The results show that G\"ortler number alone dominates the late stages of transition (maximum amplification and turbulence onset phases) for a wide range of investigated $S$ and half-cone angle ($15^{\circ} \leq \psi \leq 50^{\circ}$), although the early stage (critical phase) seems to be not determined by the G\"ortler number alone on the broader cones ($\psi=30^{\circ}$ and $50^{\circ}$) where the primary crossflow instability dominates the flow. Overall, this indicates that the centrifugal effects play an important role in the boundary-layer transition on rotating cones in axial inflow.</description>

      <title>High energy dissipation rates from the impingement of free paper-thin sheets of liquids: Determination of the volume of the energy dissipation zone</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The micromixing time of impinging thin liquid sheets depends upon the energy dissipation rate. The kinetic energy released by the impingement has been previously studied and was found to be a function of the coefficient of restitution of the collision. In this work, the volume within which the released kinetic energy is dissipated was investigated. The volume of energy dissipation was determined by measuring the time required for the velocity of the single sheet (prior to the collision) to be reduced to the velocity in the mixed sheet (after the collision). Although different, the velocity in single sheets and the velocity in mixed sheets has been previously shown to be constant. High-speed video was used to measure the velocity of features, generated in the front single sheet, as they passed through the impingement zone and into the mixed sheet. The experimental results showed that the time required for the velocity change was approximately equal to the residence time of liquid in the impingement zone. A new equation for the energy dissipation rate was developed and compared with the energy dissipation rate derived from turbulence energy-cascade theory. This comparison showed that the large-eddy turnover time was approximately equal to the residence time in the impingement zone; a result that is in accordance with the notion from turbulence energy-cascade theory that large, energy-containing eddies lose their energy within approximately one large-eddy turnover time. Within the impingement zone, the large-eddy kinetic energy was found to decay exponentially with time.</description>

      <title>Connecting shear-flow and vortex array instabilities in annular atomic superfluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At the interface between two fluid layers in relative motion, infinitesimal fluctuations can be exponentially amplified, inducing vorticity and the breakdown of the laminar flow. This process, known as the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, is responsible for many familiar phenomena observed in the atmosphere and in the oceans, as well as in astrophysical objects, being known as one of the paradigmatic routes to turbulence in fluid mechanics. While shear-flow instabilities in classical fluids have been extensively observed in various contexts, controlled experiments in the presence of quantized circulation are comparatively very few. Here, we engineer two counter-rotating atomic superflows, a configuration that in classical inviscid fluids is unstable via the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. We observe how the contact interface, i.e. the shear layer, develops into an ordered circular array of quantized vortices, which loses stability and rolls up into vortex clusters. We extract the instability growth rates and find that they obey the same scaling relations across different superfluid regimes, ranging from weakly-interacting bosonic to strongly-correlated fermionic pair condensates. The measured scalings, reproduced by numerical simulations and well described by a microscopic point-vortex model, are consistent with the classical hydrodynamic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability of a finite-width shear layer. Our results establish interesting connections between vortex arrays and shear-flow instabilities, suggesting a possible interpretation of the observed quantized vortex dynamics as a manifestation of the underlying unstable flow. Moreover, they open the way for exploring a wealth of out-of-equilibrium phenomena, from vortex-matter phase transitions to the spontaneous emergence and decay of two-dimensional quantum turbulence.</description>

      <title>Efficient solver of relativistic hydrodynamics with implicit Runge-Kutta method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12696v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method to solve the relativistic hydrodynamic equations based on implicit Runge-Kutta methods with a locally optimized fixed-point iterative solver. For numerical demonstration, we implement our idea for ideal hydrodynamics using the one-stage Gauss-Legendre method as an implicit method. The accuracy and computational cost of our new method are compared with those of explicit ones for the (1+1)-dimensional Riemann problem, as well as the (2+1)-dimensional Gubser flow and event-by-event initial conditions for heavy-ion collisions generated by TrENTo. We demonstrate that the solver converges with only one iteration in most cases, and as a result, the implicit method requires a smaller computational cost than the explicit one at the same accuracy in these cases, while it may not converge with an unrealistically large $\Delta t$. By showing a relationship between the one-stage Gauss-Legendre method with the iterative solver and the two-step Adams-Bashforth method, we argue that our method benefits from both the stability of the former and the efficiency of the latter.</description>

      <title>Universal Murray's law for optimised fluid transport in synthetic structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Materials following Murray's law are of significant interest due to their unique porous structure and optimal mass transfer ability. However, it is challenging to construct such biomimetic hierarchical channels with perfectly cylindrical pores in synthetic systems following the existing theory. Achieving superior mass transport capacity revealed by Murray's law in nanostructured materials has thus far remained out of reach. We propose a Universal Murray's law applicable to a wide range of hierarchical structures, shapes and generalised transfer processes. We experimentally demonstrate optimal flow of various fluids in hierarchically planar and tubular graphene aerogel structures to validate the proposed law. By adjusting the macroscopic pores in such aerogel-based gas sensors, we also show a significantly improved sensor response dynamic. Our work provides a solid framework for designing synthetic Murray materials with arbitrarily shaped channels for superior mass transfer capabilities, with future implications in catalysis, sensing and energy applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a domain-decomposition-based distributed training and inference approach for message-passing neural networks (MPNN). Our objective is to address the challenge of scaling edge-based graph neural networks as the number of nodes increases. Through our distributed training approach, coupled with Nystr\"om-approximation sampling techniques, we present a scalable graph neural network, referred to as DS-MPNN (D and S standing for distributed and sampled, respectively), capable of scaling up to $O(10^5)$ nodes. We validate our sampling and distributed training approach on two cases: (a) a Darcy flow dataset and (b) steady RANS simulations of 2-D airfoils, providing comparisons with both single-GPU implementation and node-based graph convolution networks (GCNs). The DS-MPNN model demonstrates comparable accuracy to single-GPU implementation, can accommodate a significantly larger number of nodes compared to the single-GPU variant (S-MPNN), and significantly outperforms the node-based GCN.</description>

      <title>The solar dynamo begins near the surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sun's magnetic dynamo cycle features a distinct pattern: a propagating region of sunspot emergence appears around 30 degrees latitude and vanishes near the equator every 11 years. Moreover, longitudinal flows called "torsional oscillations" closely shadow sunspot migration, undoubtedly sharing a common cause. Contrary to theories suggesting deep origins for these phenomena, helioseismology pinpoints low-latitude torsional oscillations to the Sun's outer 5-10%, the "Near-Surface Shear Layer". Within this zone, inwardly increasing differential rotation coupled with a poloidal magnetic field strongly implicates the Magneto-Rotational Instability prominent in accretion-disk theory and observed in laboratory experiments. Together, these two facts prompt the general question: Is it possible that the solar dynamo is a near-surface instability? Here, we report strong affirmative evidence in stark contrast to traditional paradigms focusing on the deeper tachocline. Simple analytic estimates show that the near-surface magneto-rotational instability better explains the spatiotemporal scales of the torsional oscillations and inferred subsurface magnetic field amplitudes. State-of-the-art numerical simulations corroborate these estimates and, strikingly, reproduce hemispherical magnetic current helicity laws. The dynamo resulting from a well-understood near-surface phenomenon improves prospects for accurate predictions of full magnetic cycles and space weather, impacting Earth's electromagnetic infrastructure.</description>

Abstract: We present an experiment on forced convection where a previously heated object is cooled under the effect of a controlled stream of air. We consider a square copper plate in which temperature variations can be considered negligible and we measure the cooling rate as a function of the average velocity of the air stream. We use a thermal camera to measure the temperature field and the cooling curves as a function of time for different conditions. An empirical relation between the characteristic cooling time and the mean velocity of the air stream is reported. The results obtained are discussed in the framework of simple dimensional models and their limits of validity.</description>
