      <title>Efficient first principles based modeling via machine learning: from simple representations to high entropy materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-entropy materials (HEMs) have recently emerged as a significant category of materials, offering highly tunable properties. However, the scarcity of HEM data in existing density functional theory (DFT) databases, primarily due to computational expense, hinders the development of effective modeling strategies for computational materials discovery. In this study, we introduce an open DFT dataset of alloys and employ machine learning (ML) methods to investigate the material representations needed for HEM modeling. Utilizing high-throughput DFT calculations, we generate a comprehensive dataset of 84k structures, encompassing both ordered and disordered alloys across a spectrum of up to seven components and the entire compositional range. We apply descriptor-based models and graph neural networks to assess how material information is captured across diverse chemical-structural representations. We first evaluate the in-distribution performance of ML models to confirm their predictive accuracy. Subsequently, we demonstrate the capability of ML models to generalize between ordered and disordered structures, between low-order and high-order alloys, and between equimolar and non-equimolar compositions. Our findings suggest that ML models can generalize from cost-effective calculations of simpler systems to more complex scenarios. Additionally, we discuss the influence of dataset size and reveal that the information loss associated with the use of unrelaxed structures could significantly degrade the generalization performance. Overall, this research sheds light on several critical aspects of HEM modeling and offers insights for data-driven atomistic modeling of HEMs.</description>

      <title>Integrated workflows and interfaces for data-driven semi-empirical electronic structure calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern software engineering of electronic structure codes has seen a paradigm shift from monolithic workflows towards object-based modularity. Software objectivity allows for greater flexibility in the application of electronic structure calculations, with particular benefits when integrated with approaches for data-driven analysis. Here, we discuss different approaches to create "deep" modular interfaces that connect big-data workflows and electronic structure codes, and explore the diversity of use cases that they can enable. We present two such interface approaches for the semi-empirical electronic structure package, DFTB+. In one case, DFTB+ is applied as a library and provides data to an external workflow; and in another, DFTB+ receives data via external bindings and processes the information subsequently within an internal workflow. We provide a general framework to enable data exchange workflows for embedding new machine-learning-based Hamiltonians within DFTB+, or to enabling deep integration of DFTB+ in multiscale embedding workflows. These modular interfaces demonstrate opportunities in emergent software and workflows to accelerate scientific discovery by harnessing existing software capabilities.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Imaging of Phonons and Reconfiguration in Topologically-Engineered, Self-Assembled Nanoparticle Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topologically-engineered mechanical frames are important model constructs for architecture, machine mechanisms, and metamaterials. Despite significant advances in macroscopically fashioned frames, realization and phonon imaging of nanoframes have remained challenging. Here we extend for the first time the principles of topologically-engineered mechanical frames to lattices self-assembled from nanoparticles. Liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy images the vibrations of nanoparticles in self-assembled Maxwell and hexagonal lattices at the nanometer resolution, measuring a series of otherwise inaccessible properties such as phonon spectra and nonlinear lattice deformation paths. These properties are experimentally modulated by ionic strength, captured by our discrete mechanical model considering the complexity of nanoscale interactions and thermal fluctuations. The experiment-theory integration bridges mechanical metamaterials and colloidal self-assembly, opening new opportunities to manufacture phononic devices with solution processibility, transformability, light weight, and emergent functions, at underexplored length, frequency, and energy scales.</description>

      <title>Controllable Freezing Transparency for Water Ice on Scalable Graphene Films on Copper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control of water ice formation on surfaces is of key technological and economic importance, but the fundamental understanding of ice nucleation and growth mechanisms and the design of surfaces for controlling water freezing behaviour remain incomplete. Graphene is a two-dimensional (2D) material that has been extensively studied for its peculiar wetting properties with liquid water incl. a heavily debated wetting transparency. Furthermore, graphene is the parent structure of soot particles that are heavily implicated as nuclei in atmospheric ice formation and consequently graphene is often used as a model surface for computational ice nucleation studies. Despite this, to date experimental reports on ice formation on scalable graphene films remain missing. Towards filling this gap, we here report on the water freezing behaviour on scalably grown chemical vapour deposited (CVD) graphene films on application-relevant polycrystalline copper (Cu). We find that as-grown CVD graphene on Cu can be (as we term it) freezing transparent i.e. the graphene presence does not change the freezing temperature curves of liquid water to solid ice on Cu in our measurements. Such freezing transparency has to date not been considered. We also show that chemical functionalization of the graphene films can result in controllable changes to the freezing behaviour to lower/higher temperatures and that also the observed freezing transparency can be lifted via functionalization. Our work thereby introduces the concept of freezing transparency of graphene on a metal support and also introduces scalable CVD graphene/Cu as an ultimately thin platform towards control of ice nucleation behaviour on a technologically highly relevant metal.</description>

      <title>Magnetic parity violation and parity-time-reversal-symmetric magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parity-time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry), a symmetry for the combined operations of space inversion ($\mathcal{P}$) and time reversal ($\mathcal{T}$), is a fundamental concept of physics and characterizes the functionality of materials as well as $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ symmetries. In particular, the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems can be found in the centrosymmetric crystals undergoing the parity-violating magnetic order which we call the odd-parity magnetic multipole order. While this spontaneous order leaves $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry intact, the simultaneous violation of $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ symmetries gives rise to various emergent responses that are qualitatively different from those allowed by the nonmagnetic $\mathcal{P}$-symmetry breaking or by the ferromagnetic order. In this review, we introduce candidates hosting the intriguing spontaneous order and overview the characteristic physical responses. Various off-diagonal and/or nonreciprocal responses are identified, which are closely related to the unusual electronic structures such as hidden spin-momentum locking and asymmetric band dispersion.</description>

      <title>Customizable wave tailoring materials enabled by coupling nonlinear inverse design at two scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive transformation of waves via nonlinear systems is ubiquitous in settings ranging from acoustics to optics and electromagnetics. Passivity is of particular importance for responding rapidly to stimuli, and nonlinearity enormously expands signal transformability compared to linear systems due to the breaking of superposition. It is well known that different types of nonlinearity yield vastly and qualitatively different effects on propagating signals, which raises the question of what precise nonlinearity is the best for a given wave tailoring application? This question has largely remained in the regime of simulation and theory, as, until recently it has not been possible to freely choose any optimal nonlinearity (instead relying on limited tunability around known nonlinear mechanisms). Herein, we leverage recent advances in mechanics, wherein desired nonlinear constitutive responses can be achieved through shape optimization, and couple this to a larger-scale, reduced-order nonlinear dynamical inverse design step. Using minimization of kinetic energy transmission from impact as a case study, we identify ideal nonlinear constitutive responses and the geometries needed to achieve them within a single design process. As part of this, we show the large sensitivity of this metric to small changes in nonlinearity, and thus the need for high precision, free-form nonlinearity tailoring. We validate our predictions using impact experiments in a chain of nonlinear springs and masses. This work sets the foundation for broader passive nonlinear mechanical wave tailoring material design, including future incorporation of higher-dimensionality, irreversibility, material heterogenity, and coupled physics. Potential applications include mechanical computing, acoustic signal and image processing, impact mitigation, and materials that autonomously respond and do work via rapid shape-change.</description>

      <title>Space Group Informed Transformer for Crystalline Materials Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce CrystalFormer, a transformer-based autoregressive model specifically designed for space group-controlled generation of crystalline materials. The space group symmetry significantly simplifies the crystal space, which is crucial for data and compute efficient generative modeling of crystalline materials. Leveraging the prominent discrete and sequential nature of the Wyckoff positions, CrystalFormer learns to generate crystals by directly predicting the species and locations of symmetry-inequivalent atoms in the unit cell. Our results demonstrate that CrystalFormer matches state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks for both validity, novelty, and stability of the generated crystalline materials. Our analysis also shows that CrystalFormer ingests sensible solid-state chemistry information from data for generative modeling. The CrystalFormer unifies symmetry-based structure search and generative pre-training in the realm of crystalline materials. The simplicity, generality, and flexibility of CrystalFormer position it as a promising architecture to be the foundational model of the entire crystalline materials space, heralding a new era in materials modeling and discovery.</description>

      <title>The role of rare-earth atoms in the anisotropy and antiferromagnetic exchange coupling at a hybrid metal-organic interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic anisotropy and magnetic exchange interactions are crucial parameters that characterize the hybrid metal-organic interface, key component of an organic spintronic device. We show that the incorporation of 4$f$ RE atoms to hybrid metal-organic interfaces of CuPc/REAu$_2$ type (RE= Gd, Ho) constitutes a feasible approach towards on-demand magnetic properties and functionalities. The GdAu$_2$ and HoAu$_2$ substrates differ in their magnetic anisotropy behavior. Remarkably, the HoAu$_2$ surface boosts the inherent out-of-plane anisotropy of CuPc, owing to the match between the anisotropy axis of substrate and molecule. Furthermore, the presence of RE atoms leads to a spontaneous antiferromagnetic (AFM) exchange coupling at the interface, induced by the 3$d$-4$f$ superexchange interaction between the unpaired 3$d$ electron of CuPc and the 4$f$ electrons of the RE atoms. We show that 4$f$ RE atoms with unquenched quantum orbital momentum ($L$), as it is the case of Ho, induce an anisotropic interfacial exchange coupling.</description>

      <title>Combining genetic algorithm and compressed sensing for features and operators selection in symbolic regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbolic-inference methods have recently found a broad application in materials science. In particular, the Sure-Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator (SISSO) performs symbolic regression and classification by adopting compressed sensing for the selection of an optimized subset of features and mathematical operators out of a given set of candidates. However, SISSO becomes computationally unpractical when the set of candidate features and operators exceeds the size of few tens. In the present work, we combine SISSO with a genetic algorithm (GA) for the global search of the optimal subset of features and operators. We demonstrate that GA-SISSO efficiently finds more accurate predictive models than the original SISSO, due to the possibility to access a larger input feature and operator space. GA-SISSO was applied for the search of the model for the prediction of carbon-dioxide adsorption energies on semiconductor oxides. The obtained with GA-SISSO model has much higher accuracy compared to models previously discussed in the literature (based solely on the O 2p-band center). The analysis of features importance shows that, besides the O 2p-band center, the contribution of the electrostatic potential above adsorption sites and the surface formation energies are also important.</description>

      <title>Engineering the electronic and magnetic properties of monolayer TiS$_2$ through systematic transition-metal doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered materials that exhibit magnetic ordering in their pristine form are very rare. Several standard approaches, such as adsorption of atoms, introduction of point defects, and edge engineering, have been developed to induce magnetism in two-dimensional materials. In this way, we investigate the electronic and magnetic properties of monolayer TiS$_2$ doped with 3$d$ transition metals (TMs) atoms in both octahedral 1T and trigonal prismatic 1H structures using first-principles calculations. In its pristine form, TiS$_2$ is a non-magnetic semiconductor. The bands near the Fermi energy primarily exhibit $d$ orbital characters, and due to the presence of ideal octahedral and trigonal arrangements, they are well separated from other bands with $p$ character. Upon substituting 3$d$-TM atoms in both structures, a variety of electronic and magnetic phases emerge, including magnetic semiconductor, magnetic half-metal, non-magnetic metal, and magnetic metal. Chromium exhibits the largest magnetic moment in both the 1T and 1H structures. The 1T structure shows a slightly higher magnetic moment of 3.419 $\mu_B$ compared to the 1H structure 3.138 $\mu_B$, attributed to the distorted octahedral structure of the 1T structure. Unlike pristine TiS$_2$, the deficiency in saturation of neighboring S atoms in the presence of impurities leads to the proximity of energy levels of $d$ and $p$ states, resulting in unexpectedly sizable magnetic moments. Another interesting case is Cobalt, which leads to a magnetic moment of approximately 0.805 $\mu_B$ in the 1H structure, while the Co exhibits a non-magnetic state in the 1H structure. These materials demonstrate a high degree of tunability and can be optimized for various magnetic applications.</description>

      <title>Strongly asymmetric magnetization switching and programmable complete Boolean logic enabled by long-range intralayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical switching of magnetization is central to spintronics. Despite the enormous efforts on the spin torques and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) effects, some fundamental physics for electrical switching of magnetization is still missing as indicated by a number of remarkable long-standing puzzles. Here, we report the discovery of the long-range intralayer DMI effect widely existing in magnetic heterostructure, which is distinct from the yet-known DMI effects as it describes the chiral coupling of two orthogonal magnetic domains within the same magnetic layer via the mediation of an adjacent heavy metal layer. The long-range intralayer DMI generates a strong perpendicular effective magnetic field (H_DMI^z) on the perpendicular magnetization. Characteristically, H_DMI^z varies with the sign/magnitude of the interfacial DMI constant, the applied in-plane magnetic fields, and the distribution of the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The long-range intralayer DMI results in striking consequences including the strongly asymmetric current/field switching of perpendicular magnetization, hysteresis loop shift of perpendicular magnetization in the absence of in-plane direct current, and sharp, complete switching of perpendicular magnetization purely by an in-plane magnetic field. Utilizing the long-range intralayer DMI effect, we demonstrate programable, complete Boolean logic operations (i.e., AND, NAND, NOT, OR, and NOR) within a single spin-orbit torque device. These results will stimulate the investigation of the long-range intralayer DMI effect and its impacts on a variety of spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Acceleration of Fe3+/Fe2+ cycle in garland-like MIL-101(Fe)/MoS2 nanosheets to promote peroxymonosulfate activation for sulfamethoxazole degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iron-based molybdenum disulfide (Fe-MoS2) has emerged as a Fenton-like catalyst for the highly efficient degradation of antibiotics, but the structure-activity relationship remains elusive. Herein, garland-like MIL-101(Fe)/MoS2 nanosheets (MMS) with dual metal active sites (Fe and Mo) and rich sulfur vacancies were fabricated to directly activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for fast degradation of different organic pollutants (phenols, dyes and drugs), even in real water bodies. The MMS exhibited extremely fast catalytic rate constant of 0.289 min-1 in the degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX), which was about 36 and 29 times that of single MoS2 (0.008 min-1) and MIL-101(Fe) (0.01 min-1). Moreover, MMS with good stability and reusability could reach 92% degradation of SMX after 5 cycles. Quenching experiments and electron spin resonance (ESR) tests revealed that hydroxyl radicals (.OH) and singlet oxygen (1O2) were the dominant reactive oxygen species (ROS) for SMX degradation. The integration of experimental works, characterization techniques and density functional theory (DFT) calculations unraveled that the formation of sulfur vacancies in MMS catalyst could expose more Mo sites, improve the charge density and boost the electron transfer, which was conducive to accelerating the Fe3+/Fe2+ cycle for enhancing the activation of PMS. Finally, the C-N, N-O, S-N, C-O and C-S bonds of SMX were easily attacked by ROS to generate the nontoxic intermediates in the MMS/PMS/SMX system. This study offers a new approach to designing high-performance Fe-MoS2 catalysts for the removal of organic pollutants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent theoretical and practical research has focused on multi-component High Entropy Alloys (HEAs), which have superior mechanical and functional properties than standard alloys based on a single major element, thereby establishing a new field. A multi-component HEA contains five or more primary elements at concentrations ranging from 5 to 35 atomic percent. We examined the microstructure and mechanical properties of TiVCoNiMn2 HEA. The mixing enthalpy and other thermodynamic parameters were determined using Meidma's model. TiVCoNiMn2 exhibits a mixing enthalpy of -15.6 kJ/mol and an atomic radius mismatch of approximately 10.03%. HEA is derived from both hydride and non-hydride-producing elements. This could be a useful hydrogen storage material. The hydrogen absorption/desorption capabilities of these HEAs are promising.</description>

      <title>Long-lived, pulse-induced absorption in $\mathrm{LiNb}_{1-x}\mathrm{Ta}_x\mathrm{O}_3$ solid solutions: the case of three intrinsic defect sites for electron localization with strong coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Femto-/nanosecond pulse-induced, red and near-infrared absorption is studied in $\mathrm{LiNb}_{1-x}\mathrm{Ta}_{x}\mathrm{O}_3$ (LNT) solid solutions with the goal to probe the intrinsic defect structure via the formation, transport and recombination of optically generated small bound electron polarons with strong coupling to the lattice. As a result, long-lived transients are uncovered for LNT which exceed lifetimes of LN and LT by a factor of up to 100 over the entire range of investigated compositions. At the same time, the starting amplitude varies in the range of $\alpha_\mathrm{li}^0\approx10-100\,\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ as a function of $x$ and exceed the ones of LN and LT by a factor of up to ten. The results are interpreted in the model of three-dimensional small polaron hopping transport considering the simultaneous presence of three different types of small bound polarons, in particular of small electron $\mathrm{Nb}_\mathrm{Li}^{4+}$ and $\mathrm{Ta}_\mathrm{Li}^{4+}$ antisite polarons, and of small electron $\mathrm{Ta}_\mathrm{V}^{4+}$ interstitial polarons. We conclude that the differences between LNT, LN, and LT may point to model systems that consist of one (LN), two (LT) and three (LNT) intrinsic defect centers for electron localization.</description>

      <title>Anomalous thermal conductivity in 2D silica nanocages of immobilizing noble gas atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noble gas atoms such as Kr and Xe are byproducts of nuclear fission in nuclear plants. How to trap and confine these volatile even radioactive gases is particularly challenging. Recent studies have shown that they can be trapped in nanocages of ultrathin silica. Here, we exhibit with self-consistent phonon theory and four-phonon (4ph) scattering where the adsorption of noble gases results in an anomalous increase in lattice thermal conductivity, while the presence of Cu atoms doping leads to a reduction in lattice thermal conductivity. We trace this behavior in host-guest 2D silica to an interplay of tensile strain, rattling phonon modes, and redistribution of electrons. We also find that 4ph scatterings play indispensable roles in the lattice thermal conductivity of 2D silica. Our work illustrates the microscopic heat transfer mechanism in 2D silica nanocages with the immobilization of noble gas atoms and inspires further exploring materials with the kagome and glasslike lattice thermal conductivity.</description>

      <title>Quantitative study of the pinning effect of the edge dislocation on domain wall motion in Barium Titanate thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dislocation is a very important one-dimensional defect in ferroelectrics. This work introduces an easy and flexible model of implementing the edge dislocation by introducing eigenstrain at the interface, and it could be easily extended to incorporate the surface stress to refine the analysis of ferroelectric thin films. The influence of dislocations on the ferroelectric domain wall motion and hysteresis loop including the remanent polarization and coercive field using phase-field simulations is analyzed. The pinning effect of the dislocation on the domain wall motion is discussed and whether the domain wall is pined is the competition between the external loading and the magnitude of the burgers vector of the dislocation. This work could contribute to the understanding of the pining effect of the dislocation and provide guidance for the fabrication of ferroelectric thin films.</description>

      <title>Detection of spin pumping free of rectification and thermal artefacts in molecular-based ferromagnetic insulator V[TCNE]x~2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The molecular-based ferrimagnetic insulator V(TCNE)x has gained recent interest for efficient spin-wave excitation due to its low Gilbert damping ratio a=4E-5, and narrow ferromagnetic resonance linewidth f=1Oe. Here we report a clean spin pumping signal detected on V(TCNE)x/metal bilayer structures, free from spin rectification or thermal artifacts. On-chip coupling of microwave power is achieved via a coplanar waveguide to measure the in-plane angle-dependence of the inverse spin-Hall effect under ferromagnetic resonance conditions with respect to a constant external magnetic field. A signature of pure spin current from V(TCNE)x is observed in both platinum and permalloy metal layers, demonstrating the utility of V(TCNE)x for magnon spintronics studies in molecule/solid-state heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Orientation-Driven Large Magnetic Hysteresis of Er(III) Cyclooctatetraenide-Based Single-Ion Magnets Adsorbed on Ag(100)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The molecular self-assembly and the magnetic properties of two cyclooctatetraenide (COT) - based single-ion magnets (SIM) adsorbed on Ag(100) in the sub-monolayer range are reported. Our study combines scanning-tunneling microscopy, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy and polarized X-ray absorption spectroscopy to show that Cp*ErCOT (Cp* = 1,2,3,4,5-pentamethylcyclopentadienide anion) SIMs self-assemble as alternating compact parallel rows including standing-up and lying-down conformations, following the main crystallographic directions of the substrate. Conversely, K[Er(COT)$_2$], obtained from subliming the [K(18-c-6)][Er(COT)$_2$]$\cdot$ 2THF salt, forms uniaxially ordered domains with the (COT)$^{2-}$ rings perpendicular to the substrate plane. The polarization-dependent X-ray absorption spectra reproduced by the multiX simulations suggest that the strong in-plane magnetic anisotropy of K[Er(COT)$_2$]/Ag(100) and the weak out-of-plane anisotropy of Cp*ErCOT/Ag(100) can be attributed to the strikingly different surface ordering of these two complexes. Compared to the bulk phase, surface-supported K[Er(COT)$_2$] exhibits a similarly large hysteresis opening, while the Cp*ErCOT shows a rather small opening. This result reveals that despite structural similarities, the two organometallic SMMs have strongly different magnetic properties when adsorbed on the metal substrate, attributed to the different orientations and the resulting interactions of the ligand rings with the surface.</description>

      <title>Giant tunability of magnetoelasticity in Fe$_4$N system: Platform for unveiling correlation between magnetostriction and magnetic damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible spintronics has opened new avenue to promising devices and applications in the field of wearable electronics. Particularly, miniaturized strain sensors exploiting the spintronic function have attracted considerable attention, in which the magnetoelasticity linking magnetism and lattice distortion is a vital property for high-sensitive detection of strain. This paper reports the demonstration that the magnetoelastic properties of Fe$_4$N can be significantly varied by partially replacing Fe with Co or Mn. The high quality Fe$_4$N film exhibits large negative magnetostriction along the [100] direction ($\lambda_{100}$) of -121 ppm while Fe$_{3.2}$Co$_{0.8}$N shows $\lambda_{100}$ of +46 ppm. This wide-range tunability of $\lambda_{100}$ from -121 to +46 across 0 allows us to thoroughly examine the correlation between the magnetoelasticity and other magnetic properties. The strong correlation between $\lambda_{100}$ and magnetic damping ($\alpha$) is found. The enhanced extrinsic term of $\alpha$ is attributable to the large two magnon scattering coming from the large magnetostriction. In addition, the density of states at the Fermi level plays a primal role to determine both $\lambda_{100}$ and the intrinsic term of $\alpha$. Thanks to the giant tunability and the bipolarity of magnetoelasticity, magnetic nitrides are candidate materials for high-sensitive spintronic strain sensors.</description>

      <title>Phase Transformation in Lithium Niobate-Lithium Tantalate Solid Solutions (LiNb$_{1-x}$Ta$_x$O$_3$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation of the structural phase transition in the vicinity of the Curie temperature $T_c$ of LiNb$_{1-x}$Ta$_x$O$_3$ crystals is motivated by the expected combination of advantageous high-temperature properties of LiNbO$_3$ and LiTaO$_3$, including high piezoelectric modules and remarkable high-temperature stability, respectively. $T_c$ marks the ultimate limit for exploiting the piezoelectric properties, however transition related structural modifications might impact this and other properties even below $T_c$. Remarkably, the phase transition from the ferroelectric to the paraelectric phase, whose temperature strongly depends on the composition $x$, shows a significant drop in the activation energy of the electrical conductivity. The magnitude, temperature dependence and underlying mechanisms of this drop are discussed from a microscopic perspective. Molecular dynamics calculations in the framework of the density functional theory show that substantial displacements of the cations occur below $T_c$ for both the end compounds LiNbO$_3$ and LiTaO$_3$, and might thus affect the electrical conductivity. Above $T_c$, the migration of lithium ions is presumably facilitated by a shortened diffusion path for the most favorable jump of the lithium ions. Electronic contributions to the conductivity, which become important above 900 K, are explained within the polaronic picture by the formation and migration of free small polarons.</description>

      <title>Signatures of canted antiferromagnetism in infinite-layer nickelates studied by x-ray magnetic dichroism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an experimental study of the magnetic properties of infinite-layer Nd1-xSrxNiO2 thin films by x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at Ni L3,2 and Nd M5,4 edges. We show that at low temperatures the out-of-plane component of the Ni1+ spin-moment is characterized by a rapid increase for magnetic fields below 1T , followed by a slower linear increase reaching a spin-moment value of 0.25uB/Ni at 9T in the case of superconducting Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2. On the other hand, the Nd M5,4 XMCD shows a clear paramagnetic behaviour, which make both Ni- and Nd-spin-sublattices fully uncorrelated.The magnetic field and temperature dependencies of the Ni L3,2 XMCD data can be explained by assuming an out-of-plane canting of the strongly in-plane anti-ferromagnetic ordered Ni1+ spins. A symmetry lowering of the NiO2 planes observed via four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy, triggering a DMI, can be responsible of the proposed Ni1+ spin-canting at zero-field. The resulting out-of-plane weak-ferromagnetic coupling under magnetic field explains the relatively large spin-moment and its magnetic field and temperature dependence.</description>

      <title>Tunable ultrastrong magnon magnon coupling and spin Hall magnetoresistance in a van der Waals antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic (AFM) magnons and the manipulation of magnetisation via spin currents in van der Waals (vdW) materials offer substantial potential for applications in magnonics and spintronics. In this study, we demonstrate ultrastrong magnon-magnon coupling in the GHz regime within a vdW AFM, achieving a remarkable maximum normalised coupling strength of 0.47. Our investigation unveils the tunability of coupling strength through temperature-dependent magnetic anisotropies. Additionally, we show the prospect for further enhancement to the deep-strong magnon-magnon coupling regime by manipulating the anisotropy. Furthermore, we report spin Hall magnetoresistance in a vdW AFM-based device and study the field and temperature dependence. These findings highlight the transformative potential of vdW AFMs in advancing the field of spin-based technologies.</description>

      <title>Electrically Switchable Circular Photogalvanic Effect in Methylammonium Lead Iodide Microcrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) in single-crystalline methylammonium lead iodide microcrystals under a static electric field. The external electric field can enhance the magnitude of the helicity dependent photocurrent (HDPC) by two orders of magnitude and flip its sign, which we attribute to magnetic shift currents induced by the Rashba-Edelstein effect. This HDPC induced by the static electric field may be viewed as an unusually strong third-order photoresponse, which produces a current two orders of magnitude larger than second-order injection current. Furthermore, the HDPC is highly nonlocal and can be created by photoexcitation out of the device channel, indicating a spin diffusion length up to 50 $\mu$m at 78 K.</description>

      <title>An Anisotropic Constitutive Relationship by a Series of 8 Chain Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperelastic models have been widely used to model polymers and soft tissues. However, most hyperelastic models are phenomenological material models. Based on statistical mechanics and molecular chain configuration, 8 chain model or Arruda-Boyce model is a physical model which can be used to understand how microstructures of chains affect macroscopic mechanical properties of polymers and soft tissues. Mechanical properties of many polymers and soft tissues are directional dependent. Polymer matrix can be reinforced by fibers. For soft tissues, ligaments and tendons will lead to anisotropic properties. Since matrix and reinforcements are composed of similar microstructural molecular chains, they can be modeled by using the same mathematical model. In this paper, a series of 8 chain models is used to understand composite properties. That is, an isotropic 8 chain model will be used to model matrix and anisotropic 8 chain models will be used to model fibers. Replacing I_1 in isotropic 8 chain model with I_4 in anisotropic 8 chain model is physically corresponding to changing representative 8 chain cubic cell to 8 chain slender cell. This treatment not only simplifies exist anisotropic mathematical structures but also keeps microscopic physics of 8 chain model unchanged.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing polymers with high intrinsic thermal conductivity (TC) is critically important for the thermal management of organic electronics and photonics. However, this is a challenging task owing to the diversity of the chemical space and the barriers to advanced synthetic experiments/characterization techniques for polymers. In this Tutorial, the fundamentals and implementation of combining classical molecular dynamics simulation and machine learning (ML) for the development of polymers with high TC are comprehensively introduced. We begin by describing the core components of a universal ML framework, involving polymer datasets, property calculators, feature engineering and informatics algorithms. Then, the process of constructing interpretable regression algorithms for TC prediction is introduced, aiming to extract the underlying relationships between microstructures and TCs for polymers. We also explore the design of sequence-ordered polymers with high TC using lightweight and mainstream active learning algorithms. Lastly, we conclude by addressing the current limitations and suggesting potential avenues for future research on this topic.</description>

      <title>Observation of the dual quantum spin Hall insulator by density-tuned correlations in a van der Waals monolayer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The convergence of topology and correlations represents a highly coveted realm in the pursuit of novel quantum states of matter. Introducing electron correlations to a quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator can lead to the emergence of a fractional topological insulator and other exotic time-reversal-symmetric topological order, not possible in quantum Hall and Chern insulator systems. However, the QSH insulator with quantized edge conductance remains rare, let alone that with significant correlations. In this work, we report a novel dual QSH insulator within the intrinsic monolayer crystal of TaIrTe4, arising from the interplay of its single-particle topology and density-tuned electron correlations. At charge neutrality, monolayer TaIrTe4 demonstrates the QSH insulator that aligns with single-particle band structure calculations, manifesting enhanced nonlocal transport and quantized helical edge conductance. Interestingly, upon introducing electrons from charge neutrality, TaIrTe4 only shows metallic behavior in a small range of charge densities but quickly goes into a new insulating state, entirely unexpected based on TaIrTe4's single-particle band structure. This insulating state could arise from a strong electronic instability near the van Hove singularities (VHS), likely leading to a charge density wave (CDW). Remarkably, within this correlated insulating gap, we observe a resurgence of the QSH state, marked by the revival of nonlocal transport and quantized helical edge conduction. Our observation of helical edge conduction in a CDW gap could bridge spin physics and charge orders. The discovery of a dual QSH insulator introduces a new method for creating topological flat minibands via CDW superlattices, which offer a promising platform for exploring time-reversal-symmetric fractional phases and electromagnetism.</description>

Abstract: In this work we present a new basis set for electronic structures (Density Functional Theory (DFT)) calculations. It extends Soler Williams Linearized Augmented plane Wave (SLAPW) basis sets by allowing variable radii for the different angular momentum channels and wave vectors. This allows to match additional derivatives of the wave function at the Muffin Tin (MT) radius without having to resort to additional higher derivative terms. This should lead to low wave vector basis set and low linearization energy errors. We dub these basis sets SAPWMR and SLAPWMR. Similarly Local orbital (LO and lo) basis wave functions are suggested with a variable radius. Full Potential Hamiltonian calculations (FLAPW) are extended to FSLAPWMR full potential calculations in the appendix.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic resonance methods offer a unique chance for in-depth study of conductive organic material systems, not only accounts for number of charge carriers, but also allows manipulations of spin dynamics of particles. Here we present a study of continuous-wave electrically detected magnetic resonance on a range of organic conjugate polymers under transistor architecture, with tunability in both carrier concentration and drifting electric field. We demonstrate the general existence of bipolaron between mobile and trapped charges at the magnetic resonance condition, then estimates the wavefunction expansion of charge carriers on their hopping sites along conductive pathways. This finding allows direct observation of energetically disordered trap sites under the charge hopping picture, linking-up the microscopic structural properties to the bulk electronic performances.</description>

Abstract: In-plane anisotropic layered materials (ALMs), such as black phosphorus (BP), exhibit unique angle-resolved polarized Raman (ARPR) spectroscopy characteristics, as attributed to birefringence, linear dichroism and complex Raman tensor. Moreover, the ARPR intensity profiles of BP flakes deposited on multilayer dielectrics are notably sensitive to their thickness, owing to interference effects. The intricate anisotropic effects present challenges in accurately predicting the ARPR intensity of BP flakes. In this study, we propose a comprehensive strategy for predicting the ARPR intensity of BP flakes by explicitly considering optical anisotropy, encompassing birefringence, linear dichroism, and anisotropic cavity interference effects within multilayered structures. Through this approach, we have identified the intrinsic complex Raman tensors for phonon modes, independent of the BP flake thickness. By leveraging this methodology, we have elucidated the flake thickness-dependent effective complex Raman tensor elements, allowing for precise prediction of the observed ARPR intensity profile for the BP flake. This work provides a profound understanding of ARPR behaviors for ALM flakes.</description>

      <title>Pressure-tuning topological phase transitions in Kagome superconductor CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the Kagome metal CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ has exhibited several novel quantum properties similar to CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, such as nontrivial topology, double-dome superconductivity, and flat band features. However, CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ lacks the charge-density wave (CDW) present in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, making the study of its emergence of double-dome superconductivity a focus of research. In this work, we have identified an order parameter, the three-band Z$_2$ topological index, that can describe the superconducting phase diagram of CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ under pressure. Its evolution with pressure follows the expected behavior for superconductivity. Furthermore, the results of the Fermi surface under pressure reveal the potential presence of a Lifshitz transition in the vicinity of the vanishing point of the superconducting temperature change with pressure in CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$. These results indicate that the superconducting behavior of CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ under pressure is caused by changes in the electronic structure leading to alterations in the topological properties, provide new insights and approaches for understanding the superconducting phenomenon in Kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Ideal spin-polarized Weyl-half-semimetal with a single pair of Weyl points in half-Heusler compounds XCrTe (X=K, Rb)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing ideal Weyl semimetal state with a single pair of Weyl points has been a long-sought goal in the field of topological semimetals. Here, we reveal such a state in the Cr-based half-Heusler compounds XCrTe (X=K, Rb). We show that these materials have a half metal ground state, with Fermi level crossing only one spin channel. Importantly, the Fermi surface is clean, consisting of the minimal number (i.e., a single pair) of spin-polarized Weyl points, so the state represents an ideal Weyl half semimetal. We show that the locations of the two Weyl points and the associated Chern vector can be flexibly tuned by rotating the magnetization vector. The minimal surface Fermi arc pattern and its contribution to anomalous Hall transport are discussed. Our finding offers an ideal material platform for exploring magnetic Weyl fermions, which will also facilitate the interplay between Weyl physics and spintronics.</description>

Abstract: Impurity $Fe^{3+}$ ion electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy using multiple dielectric modes in a $SrTiO_3$ dielectric resonator has been performed with a tuneable DC magnetic field of up to $1.6~T$. The $Ti^{4+}(d^0)$ ion is substituted by $Fe^{3+}$ ion forming $FeO_6$ octahedral complex with an iron-oxygen-vacancy $(Fe^{3+}-V_O)$. In such a metal-ligand complex, a giant g-factor of $g_{\scriptscriptstyle\parallel F} = 5.51$ was observed in the ferroelectric phase at $20~mK$. The the change of $Fe^{3+}$ ion center-symmetry in the $FeO_6$ complex as a soft-mode characteristics of ferroelectric phase transition and the influences of iron-oxygen-vacancy $(Fe^{3+}-V_O)$, interactively sensitive to asymmetry in the octahedral rotational parameter $\Phi$ in $SrTi0_3$.</description>

      <title>Topological iron silicide with H* intermediate modulated surface for efficient electrocatalytic hydrogenation of nitrobenzene in neutral medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of nitrobenzene (Ph-NO2) reaction (EHNR) has been considered as a potential alternative to the traditional thermocatalytic process in the production of high-value aniline (Ph-NH2). However, due to the absence of robust catalyst and low surface H* coverage, the EHNR faces the challenges of undesired performance and indetermined mechanism. Herein, we construct a type of noble-metal free topological FeSi (M-FeSi) materials through a solvent-free microwave strategy for efficient EHNR in neutral medium. Impressively, benefiting from abundant active H* intermediates on the surface of M-FeSi catalyst, the topological M-FeSi catalyst exhibits 99.7% conversion of Ph-NO2 and 93.8% yield of Ph-NH2 after 200 C in neutral medium, which are superior to previous candidates and FeSi catalyst synthesized via the traditional arc-melting method under same conditions. Besides, theoretical calculations validate that high surface H* coverage over M-FeSi catalyst is conducive to switching the rate-determining step from Ph-NO2* Ph-NO* to Ph-NO* Ph-NHOH*, and thus decreasing the total energy barrier of electrocatalytic Ph-NH2 production.</description>

Abstract: Transition-metal-based layered double hydroxides (TM-LDHs) nanosheets are promising electrocatalysts in the renewable electrochemical energy conversion system, which are regarded as alternatives to noble metal-based materials. In this review, recent advances on effective and facile strategies to rationally design TM-LDHs nanosheets as electrocatalysts, such as increasing the number of active sties, improving the utilization of active sites (atomic-scale catalysts), modulating the electron configurations, and controlling the lattice facets, are summarized and compared. Then, the utilization of these fabricated TM-LDHs nanosheets for oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, urea oxidation reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, small molecule oxidations, and biomass derivatives upgrading is articulated through systematically discussing the corresponding fundamental design principles and reaction mechanism. Finally, the existing challenges in increasing the density of catalytically active sites and future prospects of TM-LDHs nanosheets-based electrocatalysts in each application are also commented.</description>

      <title>Green fabrication of nickel-iron layered double hydroxides nanosheets efficient for the enhanced capacitive performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rational synthesis of robust layered double hydroxides (LDHs) nanosheets for high-energy supercapacitors is full of challenges. Herein, we reported an ultrasonication-assisted strategy to eco-friendly fabricate NiFe-LDHs nanosheets for the enhanced capacitive behavior. The experimental results combined with different advanced characterization tools document that the utilization of ultrasonication has a profound effect on the morphology and thickness of the as-obtained NiFe-LDHs, alternatively affecting the capacitive behavior. It shows that NiFe-LDHs nanosheets prepared with 2-h ultrasonic treatments display the exceptional capacitive performance because of the synergetic effect of ultrathin thickness, large specific surface area, and high mesoporous volume. The maximum specific capacitance of Ni3Fe1-LDHs nanosheets with the thickness of 7.39 nm and the specific surface area of 77.16 m2 g-1 reached 1923 F g-1, which is competitive with most previously reported values. In addition, the maximum specific energy of the assembled NiFe-LDHs//AC asymmetric supercapacitor achieved 49.13 Wh kg-1 at 400 W kg-1. This work provides a green technology to fabricate LDHs nanosheets, and offers deep insights for understanding the relationship between the morphology/structure and capacitive behavior of LDHs nanosheets, which is helpful for achieving high-performance LDHs-based electrode materials.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Dipole Hall effect in tMoTe$_2$ moir\'{e}: magnetoelectricity and contact-free signature of topological transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discover an intrinsic dipole Hall effect in a variety of magnetic insulating states at integer fillings of twisted MoTe$_2$ moir\'e superlattice, including topologically trivial and nontrivial ferro-, antiferro-, and ferri-magnetic configurations. The dipole Hall current, in linear response to in-plane electric field, generates an in-plane orbital magnetization $M_{\parallel}$ along the field, through which an AC field can drive magnetization oscillation up to THz range. Upon the continuous topological phase transitions from trivial to quantum anomalous Hall states in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic configurations, the dipole Hall current and $M_{\parallel}$ have an abrupt sign change, enabling contact free detection of the transitions through the magnetic stray field. In configurations where the linear response is forbidden by symmetry, the dipole Hall current and $M_{\parallel}$ appear as a crossed nonlinear response to both in-plane and out-of-plane electric fields. These magnetoelectric phenomena showcase novel functionalities of insulators from the interplay between magnetism, topology and electrical polarization.</description>

      <title>Electrically tunable, rapid spin-orbit torque induced modulation of colossal magnetoresistance in Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ nanoflakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a quasi-layered ferrimagnetic material, Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ nanoflakes exhibit magnetoresistance behaviour that is fundamentally different from their bulk crystal counterparts. They offer three key properties crucial for spintronics. Firstly, at least 10^6 times faster response comparing to that exhibited by bulk crystals has been observed in current-controlled resistance and magnetoresistance. Secondly, ultra-low current density is required for resistance modulation (~ 5 A/cm$^2$). Thirdly, electrically gate-tunable magnetoresistance has been realized. Theoretical calculations reveal that the unique magnetoresistance behaviour in the Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ nanoflakes arises from a magnetic field induced band gap shift across the Fermi level. The rapid current induced resistance variation is attributed to spin-orbit torque, an intrinsically ultra-fast process (~nanoseconds). This study suggests promising avenues for spintronic applications. In addition, it highlights Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ nanoflakes as a suitable platform for investigating the intriguing physics underlying chiral orbital moments, magnetic field induced band variation and spin torque.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in bioimaging methods and hardware facilities have revolutionised the determination of numerous biological structures at atomic or near-atomic resolution. Among these developments, electron ptychography has recently attracted considerable attention because of its superior resolution, remarkable sensitivity to light elements, and high electron dose efficiency. Here, we introduce an innovative approach called multi-convergence-angle (MCA) ptychography, which can simultaneously enhance both contrast and resolution with continuous information transfer across a wide spectrum of spatial frequency. Our work provides feasibility of future applications of MCA-ptychography in providing high-quality two-dimensional images as input to three-dimensional reconstruction methods, thereby facilitating more accurate determination of biological structures.</description>

      <title>Achieving Optical Refractive Index of 10-Plus by Colloidal Self-Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study demonstrates the developments of self-assembled optical metasurfaces to overcome inherent limitations in polarization density (P) within natural materials, which hinder achieving high refractive indices (n) at optical frequencies. The Maxwellian macroscopic description establishes a link between P and n, revealing a static limit in natural materials, restricting n to approximately 4.0 at optical frequencies. Optical metasurfaces, utilizing metallic colloids on a deep-subwavelength scale, offer a solution by unnaturally enhancing n through electric dipolar (ED) resonances. Self-assembly enables the creation of nanometer-scale metallic gaps between metallic nanoparticles (NPs), paving the way for achieving exceptionally high n at optical frequencies. This study focuses on assembling polyhedral gold (Au) NPs into a closely packed monolayer by rationally designing the polymeric ligand to balance attractive and repulsive forces, in that polymeric brush-mediated self-assembly of the close-packed Au NP monolayer is robustly achieved over a large-area. The resulting monolayer of Au nanospheres (NSs), nanooctahedras (NOs), and nanocubes (NCs) exhibits high macroscopic integrity and crystallinity, sufficiently enough for pushing n to record-high regimes. The study underlies the significance of capacitive coupling in achieving an unnaturally high n and explores fine-tuning Au NC size to optimize this coupling. The achieved n of 10.12 at optical frequencies stands as a benchmark, highlighting the potential of polyhedral Au NPs in advancing optical metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Gas-phase condensation of carbonated silicate grains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reports on the detection of carbonates in planetary nebulae (PNe) and protostars suggested the existence of a mechanism that produce these compounds in stellar winds and outflows. A consecutive laboratory study reported a possible mechanism by observing the non-thermodynamic equilibrium (TE), gas-phase condensation of amorphous silicate grains with amorphous calcium carbonate inclusions. It concluded that water vapor was necessary to the formation of the carbonates. We present a laboratory study with pulsed laser ablation of an MgSi target in O$_2$ and CO$_2$ gases and report, in the absence of water vapor, the non-TE, gas-phase condensation of amorphous carbonated magnesium silicate dust. It consists of amorphous silicate grains with formula MgSiO$_3$ that comprise carbonate groups homogeneously dispersed in their structure. The infrared spectra of the grains show the characteristic bands of amorphous silicates and two bands at $\sim$6.3 and $\sim$7.0 $\mu$m that we assign to the carbonate groups. The silicate bands are not significantly affected at an estimated Si:C ratio of 9:1 to 9:2. Such grains could form in winds and outflows of evolved stars and PNe if C atoms are present during silicate condensation. Additionally, we find that Lyman-$\alpha$ radiation dissociates the carbonate groups at the surface of the carbonated silicate grains and we estimate the corresponding photodissociation cross section of (0.04 $\pm$ 0.02) $\times$ 10$^{-16}$ cm$^2$. Therefore, photodissociation would limit the formation of carbonate groups on grains in winds and outflows of stars emitting VUV photons and the carbonates observed in protostars have not formed by gas-phase condensation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are topologically nontrivial spin configurations that possess particle-like properties. Earlier research was mainly focused on a specific type of skyrmion with topological charge Q = -1. However, theoretical analyses of two-dimensional chiral magnets have predicted the existence of skyrmion bags -- solitons with arbitrary positive or negative topological charge. Although such spin textures are metastable states, recent experimental observations have confirmed the stability of isolated skyrmion bags in a limited range of applied magnetic fields. Here, by utilizing Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, we show the extraordinary stability of skyrmion bags in thin plates of B20-type FeGe. In particular, we show that skyrmion bags embedded within a skyrmion lattice remain stable even in zero or inverted external magnetic fields. A robust protocol for nucleating such embedded skyrmion bags is provided. Our results agree perfectly with micromagnetic simulations and establish thin plates of cubic chiral magnets as a powerful platform for exploring a broad spectrum of topological magnetic solitons.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the moir\'e band structures and possible even denominator fractional quantum Hall state in small angle twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$, using combined large-scale local basis density functional theory calculation and continuum model exact diagonalization. Via large-scale first principles calculations at $\theta=1.89^{\circ}$, we find a sequence of $C=1$ moir\'e Chern bands, in analogy to Landau levels. Constructing the continuum model with multiple Chern bands and uniform Berry curvature in the second moir\'e band, we undertake band-projected exact diagonalization using unscreened Coulomb repulsion to pinpoint possible $\nu=-3/2$ non-Abelian states across a wide range of twist angles below $\theta=2.5^{\circ}$.</description>

Abstract: Complex oxides offer a wide range of functional properties, and recent advances in fabrication of freestanding membranes of these oxides are adding new mechanical degrees of freedom to this already rich functional ecosystem. Here, we demonstrate photoactuation in freestanding thin film resonators of ferroelectric Barium Titanate (BaTiO3) and paraelectric Strontium Titanate (SrTiO3). The free-standing films, transferred onto perforated supports, act as nano-drums, oscillating at their natural resonance frequency when illuminated by a frequency-modulated laser. The light-induced deflections in the ferroelectric BaTiO3 membranes are two orders of magnitude larger than in the paraelectric SrTiO3 ones. Time-resolved X-ray micro-diffraction under illumination and temperature-dependent and holographic interferometry provide combined evidence for the photostrictive strain in BaTiO3 originating from partial screening of ferroelectric polarization by photo-excited carriers, which decreases the tetragonality of the unit cell. These findings showcase the potential of photostrictive freestanding ferroelectric films as wireless actuators operated by light.</description>

      <title>Chiral Quantum well Rashba splitting in Sb monolayer on Au(111)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06814v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present atomic and electronic structure investigations of Single-layer Sb(110) rhombohedral crystal formed on Au(111) substrate. Low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) reveal a pure 2D Sb stripe structure, composed by a pair of Sb(110) unit cell located in a chiral configuration with mirror symmetry broken along the x axis direction. Based on angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurement and Sb-weighted band structure from density functional theory calculations, we report the unambiguous determination of one pair of Rashba-type splitting band from the 2D Sb film, exhibiting a chiral symmetry in the electronic structure with the crossing point located at point and point, respectively. Moreover, From dI/dV spectra and calculated density of states(DOS), the quantum well(QW) Rashba-type states at different energy induced by the in-plane mirror symmetry broken in Sb stripe structure have been identified, and the orbital decomposition of projected band structure indicates hybridization between Sb py state and Au state can modify the spin splitting of QW states due to the intrinsic large SOC of Au state introduced into the QW states.</description>

      <title>The effect of surface oxidation and crystal thickness on magnetic properties and magnetic domain structures of Cr2Ge2Te6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials such as Cr2Ge2Te6 (CGT) show promise for novel memory and logic applications. This is due to their broadly tunable magnetic properties and the presence of topological magnetic features such as skyrmionic bubbles. A systematic study of thickness and oxidation effects on magnetic domain structures is important for designing devices and vdW heterostructures for practical applications. Here, we investigate thickness effects on magnetic properties, magnetic domains, and bubbles in oxidation-controlled CGT crystals. We find that CGT exposed to ambient conditions for 5 days forms an oxide layer approximately 5 nm thick. This oxidation leads to a significant increase in the oxidation state of the Cr ions, indicating a change in local magnetic properties. This is supported by real space magnetic texture imaging through Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. By comparing the thickness dependent saturation field of oxidized and pristine crystals, we find that oxidation leads to a non-magnetic surface layer which is thicker than the oxide layer alone. We also find that the stripe domain width and skyrmionic bubble size are strongly affected by the crystal thickness in pristine crystals. These findings underscore the impact of thickness and surface oxidation on the properties of CGT such as saturation field and domain/skyrmionic bubble size and suggest a pathway for manipulating magnetic properties through a controlled oxidation process.</description>

      <title>Spin-glass states generated in van der Waals magnet Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ by alkali-ion intercalation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tuning magnetic properties in layered van der Waals (vdW) materials has captured a significant attention due to the efficient control of ground-states by heterostructuring and external stimuli. Electron doping by electrostatic gating, interfacial charge transfer and intercalation is particularly effective in manipulating the exchange and spin-orbit properties, resulting in a control of Curie temperature ($T_{\text{C}}$) and magnetic anisotropy. Here, we discover an uncharted role of intercalation to generate magnetic frustration. As a model study, we intercalate Na atoms into the vdW gaps of pristine Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ (CGT) where generated magnetic frustration leads to emerging spin-glass states coexisting with a ferromagnetic order. A series of dynamic magnetic susceptibility measurements/analysis confirms the formation of magnetic clusters representing slow dynamics with a distribution of relaxation times. The intercalation also modifies other macroscopic physical parameters including the significant enhancement of $T_{\text{C}}$ from 66K\, to 240\,K and the switching of magnetic easy-hard axis direction. Our study identifies intercalation as a unique route to generate emerging frustrated spin states in simple vdW crystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05130v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have investigated the laser induced ultrafast dynamics of Gd 4f spins at the surface of CoxGd100-x alloys by means of surface-sensitive and time-resolved dichroic resonant Auger spectroscopy. We have observed that the laser induced quenching of Gd 4f magnetic order at the surface of the CoxGd100-x alloys occur on a much longer time scale than that previously reported in bulk sensitive time-resolved experiments. In parallel, we have characterized the static structural and magnetic properties at the surface and in the bulk of these alloys by combining Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) magnetometry with X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism in absorption spectroscopy (XMCD) and X-Ray Photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The PPMS and XMCD measurements give information regarding the composition in the bulk of the alloys. The XPS measurements show non-homogeneous composition at the surface of the alloys with a strongly increased Gd content within the first layers compared to the nominal bulk values. Such larger Gd concentration results in a reduced indirect Gd 4f spin-lattice coupling. It explains the slower Gd 4f demagnetization we have observed in our surface-sensitive and time-resolved measurements compared to that previously reported by bulk-sensitive measurements.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and Kinetics of Silicate Glasses submitted to Binary Ion Exchange: Equilibrium Conditions and Interdiffusion Kinetics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10916v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ion exchange processes between an ions reservoir and a solid matrix are modeled under the assumption that near interface volumes achieve equilibrium in a much faster time than the overall process time, while in the bulk of the solid matrix, ions are transported by an interdiffusion kinetic process. Ion exchange equilibrium conditions are established within the framework of classical thermodynamics. The result is defined in terms of the chemical potential of exchanging ionic species. The proposed original derivation is performed making use of the thermodynamics of subsystems. This result is fundamental to allow the development of the equilibrium theory for the evaluation of near-surface equilibrium concentrations and ion exchange isotherms. Interaction energies of the exchanging components within the subsystems matrices can be further determined. The kinetics of the ion exchange process in silicate glass is further discussed to find connections with the near-surface equilibrium condition. Within the framework of the proposed model, interdiffusion equations can be derived from having the boundary condition established by the thermodynamic equilibrium at the near interface. It has been found that the thermodynamic factor of the interdiffusion coefficient is related to the interaction energy of the exchanging ions in the glass allowing a new approach to the interpretation of past experimental results.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the origin of antiferromagnetic coupling at YIG/permalloy interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the structural and electronic origin of antiferromagnetic coupling in the Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) and permalloy (Py) bilayer system at the atomic level. Ferromagnetic Resonance (FMR) reveal unique hybrid modes in samples prepared with surface ion milling, indicative of antiferromagnetic exchange coupling at the YIG/Py interface. Using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we highlight significant interfacial differences introduced by ion-milling. The observations suggests that the antiferromagnetic coupling in YIG/Py bilayers is predominantly driven by an oxygen-mediated super-exchange coupling mechanism on the tetrahedral Fe terminated YIG surface, which is supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This research provides critical insight into the fundamental mechanisms governing the efficiency of coupling in magnetic bilayers and underscores the pivotal role of oxide surface termination in modulating magnetic interfacial dynamics.</description>

      <title>Small electron polarons bound to interstitial tantalum defects in lithium tantalate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The absorption features of optically generated, short-lived small bound electron polarons are inspected in congruent lithium tantalate, ${\rm LiTaO}_3$ (LT), in order to address the question whether it is possible to localize electrons at interstitial ${\rm Ta_V}$:${\rm V_{Li}}$ defect pairs by strong, short-range electron-phonon coupling. Solid-state photoabsorption spectroscopy under light exposure and density functional theory are used for an experimental and theoretical access to the spectral features of small bound polaron states and to calculate the binding energies of the small bound ${\rm Ta}_{\rm Li}^{4+}$ (antisite) and ${\rm Ta}_{\rm V}^{4+}$:${\rm V_{Li}}$ (interstitial site) electron polarons. As a result, two energetically well separated ($\Delta E \approx 0.5\,{\rm eV}$) absorption features with a distinct dependence on the probe light polarization and peaking at $1.6\,{\rm eV}$ and $2.1\,{\rm eV}$ are discovered. We contrast our results to the interpretation of a single small bound ${\rm Ta}_{\rm Li}^{4+}$ electron state with strong anisotropy of the lattice distortion and discuss the optical generation of interstitial ${\rm Ta}_{\rm V}^{4+}$:${\rm V_{Li}}$ small polarons in the framework of optical gating of ${\rm Ta}_{\rm V}^{4+}$:${\rm Ta}_{\rm Ta}^{4+}$ bipolarons. We can conclude that the appearance of carrier localization at $\mathrm{Ta_V}$:${\rm V_{Li}}$ must be considered as additional intermediate state for the 3D hopping transport mechanisms at room temperature in addition to ${\rm Ta_{Li}}$, as well, and, thus, impacts a variety of optical, photoelectrical and electrical applications of LT in nonlinear photonics. Furthermore, it is envisaged that LT represents a promising model system for the further examination of the small-polaron based photogalvanic effect in polar oxides with the unique feature of two, energetically well separated small polaron states.</description>

      <title>Charge order induced Dirac pockets in the nonsymmorphic crystal TaTe$_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00425v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between charge order (CO) and nontrivial band topology has spurred tremendous interest in understanding topological excitations beyond the single-particle description. In a quasi-one-dimensional nonsymmorphic crystal TaTe$_4$, the (2a$\times$2b$\times$3c) charge ordered ground state drives the system into a space group where the symmetry indicator features the emergence of Dirac fermions and unconventional double Dirac fermions. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we provide evidence of the CO induced Dirac fermion-related bands near the Fermi level. Furthermore, the band folding at the Fermi level is compatible with the new periodicity dictated by the CO, indicating that the electrons near the Fermi level follow the crystalline symmetries needed to host double Dirac fermions in this system.</description>

      <title>On the temperature dependence of the density of states of liquids at low energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14609v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report neutron-scattering measurements of the density of states (DOS) of water and liquid Fomblin in a wide range of temperatures. In the liquid phase, we confirm the presence of a universal low-energy linear scaling of the experimental DOS as a function of the frequency, $g(\omega)= a(T) \omega$, which persists at all temperatures. The low-frequency scaling of the DOS exhibits a sharp jump at the melting point of water, below which the standard Debye's law, $g(\omega) \propto \omega^2$, is recovered. On the contrary, in Fomblin, we observe a continuous transition between the two exponents reflecting its glassy dynamics, which is confirmed by structure measurements. More importantly, in both systems, we find that the slope $a(T)$ grows with temperature following an exponential Arrhenius-like form, $a(T) \propto \exp(-\langle E \rangle /T)$. We confirm this experimental trend using molecular dynamics simulations and show that the prediction of instantaneous normal mode (INM) theory for $a(T)$ is in qualitative agreement with the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Elevated temperature effects (T &gt; 100 {\deg}C) on the interfacial water and microstructure swelling of Na-montmorillonite</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Montmorillonite-based barriers are key elements of the engineered barrier systems (EBS) in geological disposal facilities (GDF). Their performance at temperatures above 100 {\deg}C is not sufficiently understood to assess the possibility of raising the temperature limits in GDF designs that could reduce construction costs and CO2 footprint. The present work provides new fundamental insights through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Na-montmorillonite's water-clay interactions and swelling pressure at temperatures 298-500 K and basal spacings of 1.5-3.5 nm. At temperatures above 100 {\deg}C, the swelling behaviour is governed by the attractive van der Waals force and the repulsive hydration force instead of the repulsive electrostatic (double layer) force. The swelling pressure reduction with increasing temperature is related to the weakened hydration repulsion and electric double layer repulsion, which result from the deterioration of the interlayer water layer structure and the shrinkage of the electric double layer. The applicability and breakdown of the classic Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory at elevated temperatures are examined. By excluding the osmotic contribution in the DLVO theory, the summation of the van der Waals interaction in DLVO and an additional non-DLVO hydration interaction can predict our MD system's swelling under high temperatures. The findings of this study provide a fundamental understanding of the swelling behaviour and the underlying molecular-level mechanisms of the clay microstructure under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Stringlet Excitation Model of the Boson Peak</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The boson peak (BP), a low-energy excess in the vibrational density of states over the Debye contribution, is often identified as a characteristic of amorphous solid materials. Despite decades of efforts, its microscopic origin still remains a mystery. Recently, it has been proposed, and corroborated with simulations, that the BP might stem from intrinsic localized modes involving one-dimensional (1D) string-like excitations (``stringlets"). We build on a theory originally proposed by Lund that describes the localized modes as 1D vibrating strings, but we specify the stringlet size distribution to be exponential, as observed in simulations. We provide an analytical prediction for the BP frequency $\omega_{BP}$ in the temperature regime well below the observed glass transition temperature $T_g$. The prediction involves no free parameters and accords quantitatively with prior simulation observations in 2D and 3D model glasses based on inverse power law potentials. The comparison of the string model to observations is more uncertain when compared to simulations of an Al-Sm metallic glass material at temperatures well above $T_g$. Nonetheless, our stringlet theory of the BP naturally reproduces the softening of the BP frequency upon heating and offers an analytical explanation for the experimentally observed scaling with the shear modulus in the glass state and changes in this scaling in simulations of glass-forming liquids. Finally, the theoretical analysis highlights the existence of a strong damping for the stringlet modes above $T_g$, which leads to a large low-frequency contribution to the 3D vibrational density of states, observed in both experiments and simulations.</description>

Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelate, specifically La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, has generated significant interest in the exploration of high-temperature superconductivity within this material family. In this study, we present the crystallographic and electrical resistivity properties of two distinct Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates: the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (referred to as 2222-phase) and a previously uncharacterized phase, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (1313-phase). The 2222-phase is characterized by a pseudo $F$-centered orthorhombic lattice, featuring bilayer perovskite [LaNiO$_3$] layers interspaced by rock salt [LaO] layers, forming a repeated ...2222... sequence. Intriguingly, the 1313-phase, which displays semiconducting properties, crystallizes in the $Cmmm$ space group and exhibits a pronounced predilection for a $C$-centered orthorhombic lattice. Within this structure, the perovskite [LaNiO$_3$] layers exhibit a distinctive long-range ordered arrangement, alternating between single- and trilayer configurations, resulting in a ...1313... sequence. This report contributes to novel insights into the crystallography and the structure-property relationship of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates, paving the way for further investigations into their unique physical properties.</description>

Abstract: Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging (CXDI) technique offers unique insights into the nanoscale world, enabling the reconstruction of 3D structures with a nanoscale resolution achieved through computational phase reconstruction from measured scattered intensity maps. Computational demands of 3D CXDI, however, limit its real-time application in experimental settings. This work presents a carousel phase retrieval algorithm (CPRA) that enables the real-time, high-resolution reconstruction of computationally complex 3D objects. CPRA is based on representing the 3D reconstruction problem as a set of 2D reconstructions of projected images corresponding to different experimentally collected angles via the Fourier slice theorem. Consistency between the 2D reconstructed images is based on an iterative procedure, in which each 2D reconstruction accounts for the adjacent 2D reconstructed images in a periodic (carousel) manner. Demonstrations on complex systems, including a lithium-rich layered oxide particle and a Staphylococcus aureus biological cell, demonstrate that CPRA significantly enhances the reconstruction quality and enables the reconstruction process to be completed in real time during experiment.</description>

Abstract: The phase diagram of VO$_2$ strained or doped with several trivalent ions consists of four phases; in order of increasing temperatures, three (M1, T and M2) are insulating while the fourth (R), above ~340 K, is metallic. These phases and the three phase transitions have been thoroughly investigated for about half a century by a wide variety of techniques, including electronic transport. While an upwards jump of the resistance of up to a factor of 2 was observed at the T-M2 transition and a drop of several orders of magnitude was observed at the M2$\to$R one, resistive switching at the M1$\to$T transition remained elusive over all these years. Here we report on the investigation of Ga- and Al-doped VO$_2$ single crystals, following the rather surprising appearance of a small and steep drop of a factor of ~ 0.12 in the resistance of Ga-doped VO$_2$ single crystals detected by pulsed and DC I-V measurements carried out at room temperature, below the T$\to$M2 phase transition. Similar results were obtained also from measurements on Al-doped VO2 single crystals. Raman spectra of Ga-, and Al-doped crystals resolved their structures as function of temperature. The accumulated results of the measurements on Ga-, and Al-doped single crystals provide evidence for identifying the resistive switching at T$_{\rm RS}$&lt;T$_{\rm T\to M2}$ with the M1$\to$T transition.</description>

Abstract: The structural origin of the first sharp diffraction peak (FSDP) in amorphous silica is studied by analyzing chemical and radial ordering of silicon (Si) and oxygen (O) atoms in binary amorphous networks. The study shows that the chemical order involving Si--O and O--O pairs play a major role in the formation of the FSDP in amorphous silica. This is supplemented by small contributions arising from the relatively weak Si--Si correlations in the Fourier space. A shell-by-shell analysis of the radial correlations between Si--Si, Si--O and O--O atoms in the network reveals that the position and the intensity of the FSDP are largely determined by atomic pair correlations originating from the first two/three radial shells on a length scale of about 5--8 {\AA}, whereas the fine structure of the intensity curve in the vicinity of the FSDP is perturbatively modified by atomic correlations arising from the radial shells beyond 8 {\AA}. The study leads to a simple mathematical relationship between the position of the radial peaks ($r_k$) in the partial pair-correlation functions and the diffraction peaks ($Q_k$) that can be used to obtain approximate positions of the FSDP and the principal peak. The results are complemented by numerical calculations and an accurate semi-analytical expression for the diffraction intensity obtained from the partial pair-correlation functions of amorphous silica for a given radial shell.</description>

      <title>$^{13}$C Hyperpolarization with Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Micro- and Nanodiamonds for Sensitive Magnetic Resonance Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear hyperpolarization is a known method to enhance the signal in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) by orders of magnitude. The present work addresses the $^{13}$C hyperpolarization in diamond micro- and nanoparticles, using the optically-pumped nitrogen-vacancy center (NV) to polarize $^{13}$C spins at room temperature. Consequences of the small particle size are mitigated by using a combination of surface treatment improving the $^{13}$C relaxation ($T_1$) time, as well as that of NV, and applying a technique for NV illumination based on a microphotonic structure. Monitoring the light-induced redistribution of the NV spin state populations with electron paramagnetic resonance, a strong polarization enhancement for the NV spin state is observed in a narrow spectral region corresponding to about 4\% of these defect centers. By combining adjustments to the `PulsePol' sequence and slow sample rotation, the NV-$^{13}$C polarization transfer rate is improved further. The hyperpolarized $^{13}$C NMR signal is observed in particles of 2 $\mu$m and 100 nm median sizes, with enhancements over the thermal signal (at 0.29 T magnetic field), of 1500 and 940, respectively. The present demonstration of room-temperature hyperpolarization anticipates the development of agents based on nanoparticles for sensitive magnetic resonance applications.</description>

      <title>NbTi: a nontrivial puzzle for the conventional theory of superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first $ab$-$initio$ study of superconductivity in NbTi, the workhorse for many applications. Despite its apparent simplicity, NbTi turns out to be a major challenge for computational superconductivity. In fact, anharmonic effects are crucial to obtain dynamically stable phonons for the ordered bcc phase, unstable at the harmonic level, and beyond-Morel Anderson effects in the Coulomb interaction reduce the Tc by more than 20%. Lattice disorder causes an additional large discrepancy in $T_c$ compared to experiment. Our results imply that a quantitative description of technologically-relevant superconductors requires methodological developments beyond the current standards.</description>
