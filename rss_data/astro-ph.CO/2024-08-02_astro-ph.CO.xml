      <title>Tip of the Red Giant Branch Distances with JWST. II. I-band Measurements in a Sample of Hosts of 9 SN Ia Match HST Cepheids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubble Tension, a &gt;5 sigma discrepancy between direct and indirect measurements of the Hubble constant (H0), has persisted for a decade and motivated intense scrutiny of the paths used to infer H0. Comparing independently-derived distances for a set of galaxies with different standard candles, such as the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) and Cepheid variables, can test for systematics in the middle rung of the distance ladder. The I band is the preferred filter for measuring the TRGB due to constancy with color, a result of low sensitivity to population differences in age and metallicity supported by stellar models. We use James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations with the maser host NGC 4258 as our geometric anchor to measure I-band (F090W vs F090W-F150W) TRGB distances to 7 hosts of 9 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) within 27 Mpc: NGC 1448, NGC 1559, NGC 2525, NGC 3370, NGC 3447, NGC 5584, and NGC 5643. We compare these with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Cepheid-based relative distance moduli for the same galaxies and anchor. We find no evidence of a difference between their weighted means, 0.01 +/- 0.04 (stat) +/- 0.04 (sys) mag. We produce fourteen variants of the TRGB analysis, altering the smoothing level and color range used to measure the tips to explore their impact. For some hosts, this changes the identification of the strongest peak, but this causes little change to the sample mean difference producing a full range of 0.01 to 0.03 mag, all consistent at 1 sigma with no difference. The result matches past comparisons of I-band TRGB and Cepheids when both use HST. SNe and anchor samples observed with JWST are too small to yield a measure of H0 that is competitive with the HST sample of 42 SNe Ia and 4 anchors; however, they already provide a vital systematic crosscheck to HST measurements of the distance ladder.</description>

      <title>Leveraging protohalos and scale-dependent bias to calibrate the BAO scale in real space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The location of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature in the two-point correlation function (2PCF) of matter produces a standard ruler that is useful for the measurement of the expansion history of the Universe. Inspired by the possibility of reconstructing the positions of protohalos in the initial density field with a novel method rooted in optimal transport theory, we revisit the BAO signal in the protohalo correlation function. Our work examines the performance of a template 2PCF built on a tracer bias relation that includes scale dependence -- a term that can be motivated by peaks theory or a general bias expansion. Working in protohalos, halos, and the linear combination of the protohalo and matter fields that is motivated by the continuity equation, we demonstrate that this model accurately captures the shape of the BAO feature and improves the precision of the BAO scale measurement relative to a model that does not include scale-dependent bias by 47% in protohalos, 15% in halos, and 14% in the linear combination of the protohalo and matter fields. Allowing for scale dependence does not appear to introduce any shift in the BAO feature. The precision of the BAO distance scale estimate is highest with the linear combination of the protohalo and matter fields, which offers a factor of 3.5 improvement over Eulerian-space measurements and a factor of 4-8 improvement over the estimate made with protohalos alone.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Cosmological Research with the FAST Array: 21-cm Intensity Mapping Survey Observation Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise cosmological measurements are essential for understanding the evolution of the universe and the nature of dark energy. The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), the most sensitive single-dish radio telescope, has the potential to provide the precise cosmological measurements through neutral hydrogen 21-cm intensity mapping sky survey. This paper primarily explores the potential of technological upgrades for FAST in cosmology. The most crucial upgrade begins with equipping FAST with a wide-band receiver ($0 &lt; z &lt; 2.5$). This upgrade can enable FAST to achieve higher precision in cosmological parameter estimation than the Square Kilometre Array Phase-1 Mid frequency. On this basis, expanding to a FAST array (FASTA) consisting of six identical FAST would offer significant improvements in precision compared to FAST. Additionally, compared with the current results from the data combination of cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillations (optical galaxy surveys), and type Ia supernovae, FASTA can provide comparable constraints. Specifically, for the dark-energy equation-of-state parameters, FASTA can achieve $\sigma(w_0) = 0.09$ and $\sigma(w_a) = 0.33$.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Speed of Gravity and the Cosmic Expansion with Time Delays between Gravity and Light from Binary Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first observation of a gravitational wave (GW) and a short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) emitted by the same binary neutron star (BNS) merger officially opened the field of GW multi-messenger astronomy. In this paper, we define and address \textit{lagging sirens}, a new class of multi-messenger BNSs for which associated GWs and sGRBs are observed without the identification of their host galaxy. We propose a new methodology to use the observed time delay of these sources to constrain the speed of gravity that is, the propagation speed of gravitational waves, the Hubble constant and the prompt time delay distribution between GWs and sGRBs, even though a direct redshift estimation from the host galaxy is unavailable. Our method exploits the intrinsic relation between GWs and sGRBs observed and prompt time delays to obtain a statistical redshift measure for the cosmological sources. We show that this technique can be used to infer the Hubble constant at the $10\%$~level of precision with future-generation GW detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and only 100 observations of this kind. The novel procedure that we propose has systematics that differ completely from the ones of previous GW methods for cosmology. Additionally, we demonstrate for the first time that the speed of gravity and the distribution of the prompt time-delays between GWs and sGRBs can be inferred conjointly with less than 10 sources even with current GW detector sensitivities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AGORA Cosmorun (arXiv:2106.09738) is a set of hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in simulations carried out within the AGORA High-resolution Galaxy Simulations Comparison Project (arXiv:1308.2669,arXiv:1610.03066). These simulations show the formation and evolution of a Milky Way-sized galaxy using eight of the most widely used numerical codes in the community (Art-I, Enzo, Ramses, Changa, Gadget-3, Gear, Gizmo, and Arepo). In this short report, we describe the public release of the raw output data from all of these simulations at z = 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 (plus at z=1, 0 when available), and several metadata files containing the halo centers, virial quantities, and merger trees. The data from even thinner timesteps will be released as soon as the upcoming collaboration papers (VII-IX) are submitted and accepted.</description>

      <title>Constraints on large-scale polarization in northern hemisphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Present cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations have significantly advanced our understanding of the universe's origin, especially with primordial gravitational waves (PGWs). Currently, ground-based CMB telescopes are mainly located in the southern hemisphere, leaving an untapped potential for observations in the northern hemisphere. In this work, we investigate the perspective of a northern hemisphere CMB polarization telescope (NHT) to detect PGWs and present mock data for such a project. We forecast the detection sensitivity on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r of NHT and compare it with the existed ground-based experiments, also search for optimal experimental configurations that can achieve the best sensitivity of r. Our results indicate that, considering realistic experimental conditions, the first year of NHT observations combined with Planck can achieve a precision of \sigma (r)= 0.015, reaching the level of BICEP2/Keck, with significant potential for improvement with subsequent instrumentation parameter enhancements.</description>

      <title>Neutron Star Collapse From Accretion: a Probe of Massive Dark Matter Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the multi-scatter capturing of the massive dark matter (DM) particle inside the neutron star via a momentum-dependent dark matter-nucleon scattering cross-section. We find that the capturing enhanced for the positive velocity and momentum transfer dependent DM-nucleon scattering in comparison with the constant cross-section case. Further, a large capture of the DM particles can be thermalized and lead to black hole formation and, therefore, destroy the neutron star. Using the observation of the old neutron star in the DM-dominated region, we obtain strong constraints on massive DM parameters.</description>

      <title>Nanohertz gravitational waves from a quasar-based supermassive black hole binary population model as dark sirens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, several pulsar timing array (PTA) projects have detected evidence of the existence of a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in the nanohertz frequency band, providing confidence in detecting individual supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) in the future. Nanohertz GWs emitted by inspiraling SMBHBs encode the luminosity distances of SMBHBs. They can serve as dark sirens to explore the cosmic expansion history via a statistical method to obtain the redshift information of GW sources' host galaxies using galaxy catalogs. The theoretical analysis of the dark siren method relies on the modeling of the population of SMBHBs. Using a population model consistent with the latest SGWB observations is essential, as the SGWB provides significant information about the distribution of SMBHBs. In this work, we employ a quasar-based model, which can self-consistently account for the SGWB amplitude, to estimate the population of SMBHBs. We constrain the Hubble constant using the mock GW data from different detection cases of PTAs in the future. Our results show that a PTA consisting of 100 pulsars with a white noise level of 20 ns could measure the Hubble constant with a precision close to $1\%$ over a 10-year observation period, and a PTA with 200 pulsars may achieve this goal over a 5-year observation period. The results indicate that modeling the SMBHB population significantly influences the analysis of dark sirens, and SMBHB dark sirens have the potential to be developed as a valuable cosmological probe.</description>

      <title>Examining the local Universe isotropy with galaxy cluster velocity dispersion scaling relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In standard cosmology, the late Universe is assumed to be statistically homogeneous and isotropic. However, a recent study based on galaxy clusters by Migkas et al. (2021, arXiv:2103.13904) found an apparent spatial variation of approximately $9\%$ in the Hubble constant, $H_0$, across the sky. The authors utilised galaxy cluster scaling relations between various cosmology-dependent cluster properties and a cosmology-independent property, i.e., the temperature of the intracluster gas $(T)$. A position-dependent systematic bias of $T$ measurements can, in principle, result in an overestimation of apparent $H_0$ variations. In this study, we search for directional $T$ measurement biases by examining the scaling relation between the member galaxy velocity dispersion and the gas temperature $(\sigma_\mathrm{v}-T)$. Additionally, we search for apparent $H_0$ angular variations independently of $T$ by analysing the relations between the X-ray luminosity and Sunyaev-Zeldovich signal with the velocity dispersion, $L_\mathrm{X}-\sigma_\mathrm{v}$ and $Y_\mathrm{SZ}-\sigma_\mathrm{v}$. We utilise Monte Carlo simulations of isotropic cluster samples to quantify the statistical significance of any observed anisotropies. We find no significant directional $T$ measurement biases, and the probability that a directional $T$ bias causes the previously observed $H_0$ anisotropy is only $0.002\%$. On the other hand, from the joint analysis of the $L_\mathrm{X}-\sigma_\mathrm{v}$ and $Y_\mathrm{SZ}-\sigma_\mathrm{v}$ relations, the maximum variation of $H_0$ is found in the direction of $(295^\circ\pm71^\circ, -30^\circ\pm71^\circ)$ with a statistical significance of $3.64\sigma$, fully consistent with arXiv:2103.13904. Our findings strongly corroborate the previously detected spatial anisotropy of galaxy cluster scaling relations using a new independent cluster property, $\sigma_\mathrm{v}$.</description>

      <title>The mass-metallicity relation as a ruler for galaxy evolution: insights from the James Webb Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy evolution emerges from the balance between cosmic gas accretion, fueling star formation, and supernova (SN) feedback, regulating the metal enrichment. Hence, the stellar mass ($M_*$) - gas metallicity relation (MZR) is key to understand the physics of galaxies. High-quality JWST data enable accurate measurements of the MZR up to redshift z=10. Our aims are to understand the observed MZR, its connection with the star formation rate (SFR), the role played by SFR stochasticity, and how it is regulated by SN feedback. We compare the MZR from the JADES, CEERS, and UNCOVER surveys, which comprise about 180 galaxies at $z=3-10$ with $10^6&lt;M_*/M_\odot&lt;10^{10}$, with 200 galaxies from the SERRA cosmological simulations. To interpret the MZR, we develop a minimal model for galaxy evolution that includes: cosmic accretion modulated with an amplitude $A_{100}$ on 100 Myr; a time delay $t_d$ between SFR and SN; SN-driven outflows with a varying mass loading factor $\epsilon_{SN}$. Using our minimal model, we find the observed mean MZR is reproduced by weak outflows ($\epsilon_{SN}=1/4$), in line with findings from JADES. Matching the observed MZR dispersion requires $t_d=20$ Myr and a $A_{100}=1/3$ modulation of the accretion rate. Successful models have low stochasticity ($\sigma_{SFR}=0.2$), yielding a MZR dispersion of $\sigma_{Z}=0.2$. Such values are close but lower than SERRA predictions ($\sigma_{SFR}=0.24$, $\sigma_{Z}=0.3$), clarifying why SERRA show no clear MZR trend and some tension with the observations. As the MZR is very sensitive to SFR stochasticity, models predicting high r.m.s. values ($\sigma_{SFR}=0.5$) result in a ``chemical chaos'' (i.e. $\sigma_{Z}=1.4$), virtually destroying the MZR. As a consequence, invoking a highly stochastic SFR ($\sigma_{SFR}=0.8$) to explain the overabundance of bright, super-early galaxies leads to inconsistencies with the observed MZR.</description>

      <title>An ALMA survey of submillimetre galaxies in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South: an unbiased study of SMG environments measured with narrowband imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) are some of the most extreme star-forming systems in the Universe, whose place in the framework of galaxy evolution is as yet uncertain. It has been hypothesised that SMGs are progenitors of local early-type galaxies, requiring that SMGs generally reside in galaxy cluster progenitors at high redshift. We test this hypothesis and explore SMG environments using a narrowband VLT/HAWK-I+GRAAL study of H$\alpha$ and [OIII] emitters around an unbiased sample of three ALMA-identified and spectroscopically-confirmed SMGs at $z \sim 2.3$ and $z \sim 3.3$, where these SMGs were selected solely on spectroscopic redshift. Comparing with blank-field observations at similar epochs, we find that one of the three SMGs lies in an overdensity of emission-line sources on the $\sim4$ Mpc scale of the HAWK-I field of view, with overdensity parameter $\delta_{g} = 2.6^{+1.4}_{-1.2}$. A second SMG is significantly overdense only on $\lesssim 1.6$ Mpc scales and the final SMG is consistent with residing in a blank field environment. The total masses of the two overdensities are estimated to be $\log(M_{h}/{\rm M}_{\odot}) =$12.1--14.4, leading to present-day masses of $\log(M_{h,z=0}/{\rm M}_{\odot}) =$12.9--15.9. These results imply that SMGs occupy a range of environments, from overdense protoclusters or protogroups to the blank field, suggesting that while some SMGs are strong candidates for the progenitors of massive elliptical galaxies in clusters, this may not be their only possible evolutionary pathway.</description>

      <title>Reverberation mapping of high-mass and high-redshift quasars using gravitational time delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mass estimates of black holes (BHs) in the centers of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) often rely on the radius-luminosity relation. However, this relation, usually probed by reverberation mapping (RM), is poorly constrained in the high-luminosity and high-redshift ends due to the very long expected lag times. Multiply imaged AGN may thus offer a unique opportunity to explore the radius-luminosity relation at these ends. In addition to comprising several magnified images which enable a more efficient light-curve sampling, the time delay between multiple images of strongly lensed quasars can also aid in making such RM measurements feasible on reasonable timescales: If the time delay is, for example, of the order of the expected time lag, changes in the emission lines in the leading image can be observed around the same time as the changes in the continuum in the trailing image. In this work we probe the typical time-delay distribution in galaxy-cluster lenses and estimate the number of both high-mass ($\sim10^9-10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$), and high-redshift ($z\gtrsim4-12$) quasars that are expected to be strongly lensed by clusters. We find that less than one, very massive (and luminous, L$_{UV}&gt;10^{46.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$) multiply imaged quasar is expected across the sky down to 30 AB mag. Nonetheless, up to several dozen thousand M$_{BH}\sim10^{6}$-$10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$ broad-line AGN at $z&gt;4$ should be multiply imaged by galaxy clusters and detectable with JWST, hundreds with $\textit{Euclid}$ and several thousands with the $\textit{Roman}$ Space Telescope, across the whole sky. These could supply an important calibration for the BH mass scaling in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal baryogenesis from MSSM flat direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an inflection point inflation scenario where a flat direction of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) is identified with the inflaton. We focus on the case where the flat direction (inflaton) has non-zero baryon number, and consider a non-thermal baryogenesis scenario where the decay of the inflaton at the reheating directly generates baryon asymmetry of the Universe. Specifically, we consider a udd flat direction that is lifted by a superpotential operator of dimension 6, and show that inflection point inflation with the udd flat direction can be compatible with cosmological observations and can account for the baryon asymmetry of the Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel level crossing in the mass mixing between two QCD axions, one canonical QCD axion and one $Z_{\mathcal N}$ QCD axion. The level crossing can take place at the QCD phase transition critical temperature or slightly before it, depending on the ratio of the axion decay constants $\sim1.69$. The cosmological evolution of the mass eigenvalues in these two cases is similar, however, the transition of axion energy density is completely different. Finally, we estimate the relic density of the QCD axion dark matter. This level crossing may also have some cosmological implications.</description>

      <title>Recalculating Total Number of e-folds in Loop Quantum Cosmology in View of Generalized Reheating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In loop quantum cosmology, the slow-roll inflation is generic, and when the kinetic energy of the scalar field dominates at the bounce, the evolution of the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker universe will go through three distinguishable epochs, bouncing, transition, and finally slow-roll inflation, before the reheating commences. The bouncing dynamics are insensitive of the potential and initial conditions, so that the expansion factor and the scalar field can be described uniquely by a universal solution during this epoch. After about $10^5$ Planck time, the epoch of transition starts and the universe rapidly turns over from the kinetic energy dominated state to the potential energy dominated one, whereby the slow-roll inflationary phase begins. In this paper, we consider the power law plateau potential and study the pre-inflationary cosmology for different sets of initial conditions, so that during the slow-roll inflation epoch enough e-folds will be produced. Considering the generalized reheating and comparing with the recent Planck 2018 data, we are able to constrain the total number of e-folds ($N_T$) from the bounce till today to be consistent with the current observable universe. Depending on the matter driving the reheating (subject to the different dominant equations of states), we report the observationally allowed $N_T$ and reheating temperature and find in particular $N_T \simeq 127$, which is significantly different from the one $N_T \gtrsim 141$ obtained previously without considering the reheating phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new Newtonian limit of general relativity is established for stationary axisymmetric gravitationally bound differentially rotating matter distributions with internal pressure. The self-consistent coupling of quasilocal gravitational energy and angular momentum leads to a modified Poisson equation. The coupled equations of motion of the effective fluid elements are also modified, with quasilocal angular momentum and frame-dragging leading to novel dynamics. The solutions of the full system reproduce the phenonomenology of collisionless dark matter for disc galaxies, offering an explanation for their observed rotation curves. Halos of abundant cold dark matter particles are not required.</description>

      <title>Improved model of large-field inflation with primordial black hole production in Starobinsky-like supergravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11651v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A viable model of large-field (chaotic) inflation with efficient production of primordial black holes is proposed in Starobinsky-like (modified) supergravity leading to the "no-scale-type" K\"ahler potential and the Wess-Zumino-type ("renormalizable") superpotential. The cosmological tilts are in good (within $1\sigma$) agreement with Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation. In addition, the power spectrum of scalar perturbations has a large peak at smaller scales, which leads to a production of primordial black holes from gravitational collapse of large perturbations with the masses about $10^{17}$ g. The masses are beyond the Hawking (black hole) evaporation limit of $10^{15}$ g, so that those primordial black holes may be viewed as viable candidates for part or the whole of the current dark matter. The parameters of the superpotential were fine-tuned for those purposes, while the cubic term in the superpotential is essential whereas the quadratic term should vanish. The vacuum after inflation (relevant to reheating) is Minkowskian. The energy density fraction of the gravitational waves induced by the production of primordial black holes and their frequency were also calculated in the second order with respect to perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main aim of this work is to explore the possibility that cold dark matter (CDM) and early dark energy (EDE) can be described by canonical scalar fields that are coupled at the level of its conservation equations. The formalism covers dynamical aspects at the background and linear perturbation levels for an arbitrary coupling function, followed by an example of it. We emphasize the impact of this model on the Matter Power Spectrum and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectra, with or without direct interaction. Our findings indicate that the presence of a scalar field can partially counteract the known effects of the other, opening the possibility to avoid some undesired aspects, such as the increase in $\Omega_{m}$ that usually is needed in the case of a purely EDE scalar field scenario, in order to fit the CMB spectra. This opens up the possibility to analyzing whether the interaction can help to ameliorate the cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>The Ages of the Oldest Astrophysical Objects in an Ellipsoidal Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: James Webb Space Telescope's (JWST) observations since its launch have shown us that there could be very massive and very large galaxies, as well as massive quasars very early in the history of the universe, conflicting expectations of the $\Lambda$CDM model. This so-called ''impossibly early galaxy problem'' requires too rapid star formation in the earliest galaxies than appears to be permitted by the $\Lambda$CDM model. In fact, this might not be a high masses problem, but a ''time-compression problem'': time too short for the observed large and massive structures to form from the initial seeds. A cosmological model that could allocate more time for the earliest large structures to form would be more conforming to the data than the $\Lambda$CDM model. In this work we are going to discuss how the recently proposed $\gamma\delta$CDM model might ease and perhaps resolve the time-compression problem. In the $\gamma\delta$CDM model, different energy densities contribute to the Hubble parameter with different weights. Additionally, in the formula for the Hubble parameter, energy densities depend on the redshift differently than what their physical nature dictates. This new way of relating universe's energy content to the Hubble parameter leads to a modified relation between cosmic time and redshift. We test the observational relevance of the $\gamma\delta$CDM model to the age problem by constraining its parameters with the ages of the oldest astronomical objects (OAO) together with the cosmic chronometers (CC) Hubble data and the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae data of the late universe at low redshift. We find that, thanks to a modified time-redshift relation, the $\gamma\delta$CDM model has a more plausible time period at high redshift for large and massive galaxies and massive quasars to form, whereas the age of the universe today is not modified significantly.</description>

      <title>Signal-preserving CMB component separation with machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analysis of microwave sky signals, such as the cosmic microwave background, often requires component separation with multi-frequency methods, where different signals are isolated by their frequency behaviors. Many so-called "blind" methods, such as the internal linear combination (ILC), make minimal assumptions about the spatial distribution of the signal or contaminants, and only assume knowledge of the frequency dependence of the signal. The ILC is a minimum-variance linear combination of the measured frequency maps. In the case of Gaussian, statistically isotropic fields, this is the optimal linear combination, as the variance is the only statistic of interest. However, in many cases the signal we wish to isolate, or the foregrounds we wish to remove, are non-Gaussian and/or statistically anisotropic (in particular for Galactic foregrounds). In such cases, it is possible that machine learning (ML) techniques can be used to exploit the non-Gaussian features of the foregrounds and thereby improve component separation. However, many ML techniques require the use of complex, difficult-to-interpret operations on the data. We propose a hybrid method whereby we train an ML model using only combinations of the data that $\textit{do not contain the signal}$, and combine the resulting ML-predicted foreground estimate with the ILC solution to reduce the error from the ILC. We demonstrate our methods on simulations of extragalactic temperature and Galactic polarization foregrounds, and show that our ML model can exploit non-Gaussian features, such as point sources and spatially-varying spectral indices, to produce lower-variance maps than ILC - eg, reducing the variance of the B-mode residual by factors of up to 5 - while preserving the signal of interest in an unbiased manner. Moreover, we often find improved performance when applying our model to foreground models on which it was not trained.</description>

      <title>Constraining modified gravity with weak lensing peaks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well established that maximizing the information extracted from upcoming and ongoing stage-IV weak-lensing surveys requires higher-order summary statistics that complement the standard two-point statistics. In this work, we focus on weak-lensing peak statistics to test two popular modified gravity models, $f(R)$ and nDGP, using the FORGE and BRIDGE weak-lensing simulations, respectively. From these simulations we measure the peak statistics as a function of both cosmological and modified gravity parameters simultaneously. Our findings indicate that the peak abundance is sensitive to the strength of modified gravity, while the peak two-point correlation function is sensitive to the nature of the screening mechanism in a modified gravity model. We combine these simulated statistics with a Gaussian Process Regression emulator and a Gaussian likelihood to generate stage-IV forecast posterior distributions for the modified gravity models. We demonstrate that, assuming small scales can be correctly modelled, peak statistics can be used to distinguish GR from $f(R)$ and nDGP models at the two-sigma level with a stage-IV survey area of $300 \, \rm{deg}^2$ and $1000 \, \rm{deg}^2$, respectively. Finally, we show that peak statistics can constrain $\log_{10}\left(|f_{R0}|\right) = -6$ to 2\% precision, and $\log_{10}(H_0 r_c) = 0.5$ to 25\% precision.</description>

      <title>High-energy neutrinos and gamma rays from winds and tori in active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.02097v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Powerful winds with wide opening angles, likely driven by accretion disks around black holes (BHs), are observed in the majority of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and can play a crucial role in AGN and galaxy evolution. If protons are accelerated in the wind near the BH via diffusive shock acceleration, $pp$ and $p\gamma$ processes generate neutrinos as well as pair cascade emission from the gamma-ray to radio bands. The TeV neutrinos detected by IceCube from the obscured Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 may arise from collisionless shocks in a failed, line-driven wind that is physically well motivated. Although the cascade emission is $\gamma\gamma$-attenuated above a few MeV, it can still contribute significantly to the sub-GeV gamma rays and the sub-millimeter emission observed from NGC 1068. At higher energies, gamma rays can occur via $pp$ processes from a shock where an outgoing wind impacts the obscuring torus, along with some observable GHz-band emission. Tests and implications of this model are discussed. Neutrinos and gamma rays may offer unique probes of AGN wind launching sites, particularly for objects obscured in other forms of radiation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare the dark matter(DM) production processes and its parameters space in the background of reheating obtained from two chief systems in the early Universe: the inflaton $\phi$ and the primordial black holes (PBHs). We concentrated on the mechanism where DMs are universally produced only from the PBH decay and the generation of the standard model plasma from both inflton and PBHs. Whereas the distribution of Primordial Black Holes behaves like dust, the inflaton phenomenology depends strongly on its equation of state after the inflationary phase, which in turn is conditioned by the nature of the potential $V(\phi)$. Depending upon the initial mass and population of PBHs, a large range of DM mass is shown to be viable if reheating is controlled by PBHs itself. Inflaton-dominated reheating is observed to further widen such possibilities depending on the initial population of black holes and its mass as well as the coupling of the inflaton to the standard model sector.</description>

Abstract: We compare the QCD axion phase-space distribution from unitarized next-to-leading order chiral perturbation theory with the one extracted from pion-scattering data. We derive a robust bound by confronting momentum-dependent Boltzmann equations against up-to-date observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background, of the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations and of primordial abundances. These datasets imply $m_{a} \leq \, 0.16 $~eV for the 95% credible interval, i.e. $\sim$30% stronger bound than what previously found. We present forecasts using dedicated likelihoods for future cosmological surveys and the sphaleron rate from unquenched lattice QCD.</description>

Abstract: The pursuit of understanding the mysteries surrounding dark energy has sparked significant interest within the field of cosmology. While conventional approaches, such as the cosmological constant, have been extensively explored, alternative theories incorporating scalar field-based models and modified gravity have emerged as intriguing avenues. Among these, teleparallel theories of gravity, specifically the $f(T,\phi)$ formulation, have gained prominence as a means to comprehend dark energy within the framework of teleparallelism. In this study, we investigate two well-studied models of teleparallel dark energy and examine the presence of cosmological singularities within these scenarios. Using the Goriely-Hyde procedure, we examine the dynamical systems governing the cosmological equations of these models. Our analysis reveals that both models exhibit Type IV singularities, but only for a limited range of initial conditions. These results could indicate a potential edge for teleparallel cosmological models over their other modified gravity counterparts, as the models we examine seem to be only allowing for weak singularities that too under non general conditions.</description>

      <title>Optical modeling of systematic uncertainties in detector polarization angles for the Atacama Cosmology Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an estimate of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) detector polarization angle systematic uncertainty from optics perturbation analysis using polarization-sensitive ray tracing in CODE V optical design software. Uncertainties in polarization angle calibration in CMB measurements can limit constraints on cosmic birefringence and other cosmological parameters sensitive to polarization leakage. Our framework estimates the angle calibration systematic uncertainties from possible displacements in lens positions and orientations, and anti-reflection coating (ARC) thicknesses and refractive indices. With millimeter displacements in lens positions and percent-level perturbations in ARC thicknesses and indices from design, we find the total systematic uncertainty for three ACT detector arrays operating between 90--220 GHz to be at the tenth of degree scale. Reduced lens position and orientation uncertainties from physical measurements could lead to a reduction in the systematic uncertainty estimated with the framework presented here. This optical modeling may inform polarization angle systematic uncertainties for current and future microwave polarimeters, such as the CCAT Observatory, Simons Observatory, and CMB-S4.</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis, primordial gravitational waves, and PBH-induced reheating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of producing the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe uniquely from the evaporation of primordial black holes (PBH) that are formed in an inflaton-dominated background. Considering the inflaton $(\phi)$ to oscillate in a monomial potential $V(\phi)\propto\phi^n$, we show, it is possible to obtain the desired baryon asymmetry via vanilla leptogenesis from evaporating PBHs of initial mass $\lesssim 10$ g. We find that the allowed parameter space is heavily dependent on the shape of the inflaton potential during reheating (determined by the exponent of the potential $n$), the energy density of PBHs (determined by $\beta$), and the nature of the coupling between the inflaton and the Standard Model (SM). To complete the minimal gravitational framework, we also include in our analysis the gravitational leptogenesis set-up through inflaton scattering via exchange of graviton, which opens up an even larger window for PBH mass, depending on the background equation of state. We finally illustrate that such gravitational leptogenesis scenarios can be tested with upcoming gravitational wave (GW) detectors, courtesy of the blue-tilted primordial GW with inflationary origin, thus paving a way to probe a PBH-induced reheating together with leptogenesis.</description>

Abstract: During the fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network, the LIGO Livingston observatory detected a coalescing compact binary, GW230529_181500, with component masses of $2.5-4.5\, M_\odot$ and $1.2-2.0\, M_\odot$ at the $90\%$ credible level. The gravitational-wave data alone is insufficient to determine whether the components are neutron stars or black holes. In this paper, we propose that GW230529_181500 originated from the merger of two primordial black holes (PBHs). We estimate a merger rate of $5.0^{+47.0}_{-4.9} \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ for compact binary coalescences with properties similar to GW230529_181500. Assuming the source is a PBH-PBH merger, GW230529-like events lead to approximately $1.7^{+36.2}_{-1.5} \times 10^{-3}$ of the dark matter in the form of PBHs. The required abundance of PBHs to explain this event is consistent with existing upper limits derived from microlensing, cosmic microwave background observations and the null detection of gravitational wave background by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA.</description>

Abstract: It is often believed that isolated, compact groups of galaxies (CGs) are special systems. But CGs have rarely been compared to regular groups, which are selected very differently. We study the global properties of a subsample of 80 groups of four members (CG4s), as well as their correlations, within the HMCG Hickson-like sample of compact groups, and compare them with those of the regular groups of Lim et al.. The latter are split into three control samples, complete in redshift and magnitude: one with the four brightest members, one with the four closest members to the brightest group galaxy (BGG) with less than three magnitudes in range (Control4Cs), and one with exactly four members (RG4s). The vast majority of CG4s are located within regular groups, and a large preponderance of the BGGs of these CG4s are the same as those of their host groups. CG4s are smaller than the groups of all other samples and more luminous than RG4s, both results as expected from their selection as high surface brightness systems. However, CG4s have similar luminosities as Control4Cs. CG4s also have higher velocity dispersions, probably because of a too permissive redshift accordance criterion. The BGGs of CG4s are not more dominant in luminosity than those of RG4s, but they are significantly more offset relative to the group size, because the Lim groups are built around their BGGs. In summary, compact groups have similar properties to the regular groups of four galaxies and to the cores of regular groups, once selection criteria of CGs are considered. A large fraction of CGs are the cores of regular groups, isolated on the sky by construction, but rarely isolated in real space (from simulations), indicating that they are often plagued by chance alignments of host groups galaxies along the line of sight.</description>
