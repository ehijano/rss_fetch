      <title>Global well-posedness and Asymptotic analysis of a nonlinear heat equation with constraints of finite codimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the global existence and the uniqueness of the $L^p\cap H_0^1-$valued ($2\leq p &lt; \infty$) strong solutions of a nonlinear heat equation with constraints over bounded domains in any dimension $d\geq 1$. Along with the \textit{Faedo-Galerkin} approximation method and the compactness arguments, we utilize the monotonicity and the hemicontinuity properties of the nonlinear operators to establish the well-posedness results. In particular, we show that a Hilbertian manifold $\mathbb{M}$, which is the unit sphere in $L^2$ space, describing the constraint is invariant.
  Finally, in the asymptotic analysis, we generalize the recent work of [P. Antonelli, et. al. \emph{Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations}, 63(4), 2024] to any bounded smooth domain in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\geq1$, when the corresponding nonlinearity is a damping. In particular, we show that, for positive initial datum and any $2\le p &lt; \infty$, the unique positive strong solution of the above mentioned nonlinear heat equation with constraints converges in $L^p\cap H_0^1$ to the unique positive ground state.</description>

      <title>$L^p$ Estimates for Eigenfunctions of a Generalized Landau Magnetic Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine eigenfunctions of a generalized Landau Magnetic Laplacian that models the physics of an electron confined to a plane in a magnetic field orthogonal to the plane. This operator has an infinite dimensional null space and, at least in the model case, has infinite dimensional eigenspaces with eigenvalues which are essentially the same as the eigenvalues of the Hermite operator. We demonstrate that, under fairly general assumptions on the potential function of the magnetic field, the $L^\infty$ norm of these eigenfunctions is bounded by their $L^2$ norm independently of the associated eigenvalue. We furthermore demonstrate an improvement in the $L^6$ norm of these eigenfunctions. The method we use comes from semiclassical analysis and is inspired by the work of Koch, Tataru, and Zworski that applies locally. In our case, we use a new conjugation argument to demonstrate the result over all of $\mathbb{R}^2$.</description>

      <title>Multiple solutions for Schr{\"o}dinger-Poisson-Slater equations with critical growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain multiple solutions for the zero mass Schr{\"o}dinger-Poisson-Slater equation \[ - \Delta u + \left( \frac{1}{4 \pi | x |} \ast u^2 \right) u = \lambda g (x) | u |^{p - 2} u + | u |^{6 - 2} u \text{, \ \ \ \ } u \in \mathcal{D}^{1, 2} (\mathbb{R}^3) \text{} \] for $\lambda \gg 1$, where $p \in (4, 6)$ and $g \in L^{6 / (6 - p)} (\mathbb{R}^3)$. The crucial (PS)$_c$ condition is verified using a simpler method. Similar multiplicity result is also obtained for related equation with an external potential.</description>

      <title>Existence and spectral stability analysis of viscous-dispersive shock profiles for isentropic compressible fluids of Korteweg type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The system describing the dynamics of a compressible isentropic fluid exhibiting viscosity and internal capillarity in one space dimension and in Lagrangian coordinates, is considered. It is assumed that the viscosity and the capillarity coefficients are nonlinear smooth, positive functions of the specific volume, making the system the most general case possible. It is shown, under very general circumstances, that the system admits traveling wave solutions connecting two constant states and traveling with a certain speed that satisfy the classical Rankine-Hugoniot and Lax entropy conditions, and hence called viscous-dispersive shock profiles. These traveling wave solutions are unique up to translations and have arbitrary amplitude. The spectral stability of such viscous-dispersive profiles is also considered. It is shown that the essential spectrum of the linearized operator around the profile (posed on an appropriate energy space) is stable, independently of the shock strength. With the aid of energy estimates, it is also proved that the point spectrum is also stable, provided that the shock amplitude is sufficiently small and a structural condition on the inviscid shock is fulfilled.</description>

      <title>Existence and multiplicity of normalized solutions for the quasi-linear Schr\"{o}dinger equations with mixed nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence and multiplicity of the normalized solutions to the following quasi-linear problem \begin{equation*} -\Delta u-\Delta(|u|^2)u+\lambda u=|u|^{p-2}u+\tau|u|^{q-2}u, \text{ in }\mathbb{R}^N,~ 1\leq N\leq4, \end{equation*} with prescribed mass $$\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|u|^2dx=a ,$$ where $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$ appears as a Lagrange multiplier and the parameters $a,\tau$ are all positive constants. We are concerned about the mass-mixed case $2&lt;q&lt;2+\frac{4}{N}$ and $4+\frac{4}{N}&lt;p&lt;2\cdot2^*$, where $2^*:=\frac{2N}{N-2}$ for $N\geq3$, while $2^*:=\infty$ for $N=1,2$. We show the existence of normalized ground state solution and normalized solution of mountain pass type. Our results can be regarded as a supplement to Lu et al. ( Proc. Edinb. Math. Soc., 2024) and Jeanjean et al. ( arXiv:2501.03845).</description>

      <title>Dynamics of 3D focusing, energy-critical wave equation with radial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we discuss the long-time dynamics of the radial solutions to the energy-critical wave equation in 3-dimensional space. We prove a quantitative version of soliton resolution result for solutions defined for all time $t&gt;0$. The main tool is the radiation theory of wave equations and the major observation of this work is a correspondence between the radiation and the soliton collision behaviour of solutions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the study for standing wave solutions of $abcd$-systems which was started by Chen and Iooss \cite{chen2005standing} for the BBM system via the Lyapunov-Schmidt method. In this paper, we will first discuss the feasibility of the Lyapunov-Schmidt method for bifurcating standing wave solutions of $abcd$-systems. These systems will be characterized into three categories: feasible, infeasible and uncertain feasible ones. In particular, we prove the existence of nontrivial bifurcating standing waves for the Bona-Smith system.</description>

      <title>Inviscid incompressible limit for capillary fluids with density dependent viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00621v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The asymptotic limit of the 2D and 3D Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system for barotropic capillary fluids with density dependent viscosities in the low Mach number and vanishing viscosity regime is established. In the relative energy framework, we prove the convergence of weak solutions of the Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system to the strong solution of the incompressible Euler system. The convergence is obtained through the use of suitable dispersive estimates for an acoustic system altered by the presence of the Korteweg tensor.</description>

      <title>Normalized ground states for NLS equations with mass critical nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study normalized solutions $(\mu,u)\in \mathbb{R} \times H^1(\mathbb{R}^N)$ to nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations $$ -\Delta u + \mu u = g(u)\quad \hbox{in}\ \mathbb{R}^N, \qquad
  \frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathbb{R}^N} u^2 dx = m, $$ where $N\geq 2$ and the mass $m&gt;0$ is given. Here $g$ has an $L^2$-critical growth, both in the origin and at infinity, that is $g(s)\sim |s|^{p-1}s$ as $s\sim 0$ and $s\sim\infty$, where $p=1+\frac{4}{N}$. We continue the analysis started in [Cingolani-Gallo-Ikoma-Tanaka, 2024], where we found two (possibly distinct) minimax values $\underline{b} \leq 0 \leq \overline{b}$ of the Lagrangian functional. In this paper we furnish explicit examples of $g$ satisfying $\underline{b}&lt;0&lt;\overline{b}$, $\underline{b}=0&lt;\overline{b}$ and $\underline{b}&lt;0=\overline{b}$; notice that $\underline{b}=0=\overline{b}$ in the power case $g(t)=|t|^{p-1}t$. Moreover, we deal with the existence and non-existence of a solution with minimal energy. Finally, we discuss the assumptions required on $g$ to obtain existence of a positive solution for perturbations of $g$.</description>

      <title>A convex lifting approach for the Calder\'on problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Calder\'on problem consists in recovering an unknown coefficient of a partial differential equation from boundary measurements of its solution. These measurements give rise to a highly nonlinear forward operator. As a consequence, the development of reconstruction methods for this inverse problem is challenging, as they usually suffer from the problem of local convergence. To circumvent this issue, we propose an alternative approach based on lifting and convex relaxation techniques, that have been successfully developed for solving finite-dimensional quadratic inverse problems. This leads to a convex optimization problem whose solution coincides with the sought-after coefficient, provided that a non-degenerate source condition holds. We demonstrate the validity of our approach on a toy model where the solution of the partial differential equation is known everywhere in the domain. In this simplified setting, we verify that the non-degenerate source condition holds under certain assumptions on the unknown coefficient. We leave the investigation of its validity in the Calder\'on setting for future works.</description>

      <title>Quantitative homogenization of convex Hamilton-Jacobi equations with $u/\varepsilon$-periodic Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we study quantitative homogenization of first-order convex Hamilton-Jacobi equations with $(u/\varepsilon)$-periodic Hamiltonians which typically appear in dislocation dynamics. Firstly, we establish the optimal convergence rate by using the inherent fundamental solution and the implicit variational principle of Hamilton dynamics with their Hamiltonian depending on the unknown. Secondly, under additional growth assumptions on the Hamiltonian, we establish global H\"older regularity for both the solutions and the correctors, serving as a notable application of our quantitative homogenization theory.</description>

      <title>Closed Estimates of Leray Projected Transport Noise and Strong Solutions of the Stochastic Euler Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the incompressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations on the three dimensional torus, in velocity form, perturbed by a transport or transport-stretching Stratonovich noise. Closed control of the noise contributions in energy estimates are demonstrated, for any positive integer ordered Sobolev Space and the equivalent Stokes Space; difficulty arises due to the presence of the Leray Projector disrupting cancellation of the top order derivative. This is particularly pertinent in the case of a transport noise without stretching, where the vorticity form cannot be used. As a consequence we obtain, for the first time, the existence of a local strong solution to the corresponding stochastic Euler equation. Furthermore, smooth solutions are shown to exist until blow-up in $L^1\left([0,T];W^{1,\infty}\right)$.</description>

      <title>Multi-peak solutions for the fractional Schr\"odinger equation with Dirichlet datum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $s\in (0,1)$, $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and let $\Omega$ be a bounded smooth domain. Given the problem $$\varepsilon^{2s}(-\Delta)^{s} u + V(x)u = |u|^{p-1}u \quad \mbox{in }\; \Omega,$$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions and $1&lt;p&lt;(n+2s)/(n-2s)$, we analyze the existence of positive multi-peak solutions concentrating, as $\varepsilon\to 0$, to one or several points of $\Omega$. Under suitable conditions on $V$, we construct positive solutions concentrating at any prescribed set of its non degenerate critical points. Furthermore, we prove existence and non existence of clustering phenomena around local maxima and minima of $V$, respectively. The proofs rely on a Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction where three effects need to be controlled: the potential, the boundary and the interaction among peaks. The slow decay of the associated {\it ground-state} demands very precise asymptotic expansions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the first (positive) Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator \[ L(u)=\Delta u-(\nabla u,x), \] is strongly log-concave if the domain is bounded and convex, which improves the conclusion in [6]. We also provide a characterization of the equality case of the Brunn-Minkowski inequality for the principal frequency of $L(u)$ in the class of convex bodies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model based on Maxwells equations to describe the Talbot effect. After solving the model analytically, we prove that its solution is equivalent to the one amply found in the literature in the asymptotic limit. By considering the paraxial limit, we showcase how the rational Talbot effect arises, and derive an ideal paraxial distribution that would give such effects. We give a proof of $L^2$ convergence to these ideal distributions for any such grating. The universal nature of the Talbot effect makes our findings pertinent for a variety of physical systems and technological applications.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Stabilization of Compressible Flows: Global Existence in 3D Inviscid Non-Isentropic MHD Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solutions to the compressible Euler equations in all dimensions have been shown to develop finite-time singularities from smooth initial data such as shocks and cusps. There is an extraordinary list of results on this subject. When the inviscid compressible flow is coupled with the magnetic field in the 3D inviscid non-isentropic compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations in $\mathbb{T}^3$, this paper rules out finite-time blowup and establishes the global existence of smooth and stable solutions near a suitable background magnetic field. This result rigorously confirms the stabilizing phenomenon observed in physical experiments involving electrically conducting fluids.</description>

We refer to such solutions as Sadovskii vortices, in honor of the contribution of Sadovskii [J. Appl. Math. Mech., 1971]. It is often used to understand how stable flow can arise even in strongly interacting singular configurations. Typical examples include the Sadovskii vortex patches and the Chaplygin-Lamb dipole. Our first result concerns the stability of a nonempty collection of Sadovskii vortex patches with prescribed impulse and unique traveling speed. If the initial vorticity is close to one of these patches, the vorticity travels at a similar speed while staying close to the class up to a shift. As the closest patch and the shift may vary over time due to ignorance of the uniqueness of the Sadovskii patches, we carefully selected the class so that any perturbed solution retains its Sadovskii-like structure uniformly in time and travels nearly at the speed of the patches in the class. This result is obtained via a concentration-compactness argument and several uniform estimates for the associated variational problem, along with a shift function estimate, which is optimal, derived by tracking the horizontal center of mass of the perturbed solution. Our second result establishes the existence of Sadovskii vortices with higher regularity, including compactly supported solutions ranging from vortex patches to functions that are nearly $C^3$. Until now, the best-known regularity for such vortices was merely Lipschitz continuity of the classical Chaplygin-Lamb dipole, and our result goes beyond this. We also establish their corresponding Lyapunov stability. These are achieved by formulating and solving a family of variational problems that extend the recent framework developed for the Chaplygin-Lamb dipole and Sadovskii patches.</description>

      <title>Doubly nonlinear parabolic equation involving a mixed local-nonlocal operator and a convection term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study a doubly degenerate parabolic equation involving a convection term and the operator $\mathcal{A}_\mu u:=-\Delta_p u +\mu (-\Delta)^s_q u$ which is a linear combination of the $p$-Laplacian and the fractional $q$-Laplacian, and results in a mixed local-nonlocal nonlinear operator. The problem we study is the following, \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  \partial_t \beta(u)+ \mathcal{A}_\mu u= div (\overset{\to}{f}(u))+g(t,x,u) \quad \text{in} \;Q_T:=(0,T)\times \Omega,
  u=0 \quad \text{in} \; (0,T)\times (\mathbb{R}^d \backslash \Omega),
  u(0)=u_0 \text{ in } \Omega.
  \end{cases}\ \end{equation*} We discuss existence, uniqueness and qualitative behavior of, what we call {\it weak-mild} solutions, that is weak solutions of this problem that when interpreted as $v=\beta(u)$ they are a mild solutions. In particular, we investigate stabilization to steady state, extinction and blow up in finite time and show how the occurrence of such behaviors depend on specific conditions on the nonlinearities $\beta$ (typically of porous media type), $\overset{\to}{f}$ and the source term $g$, and on their relation, in terms of certain regularity and growth conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce two new classes of functional spaces, namely, Besov mixed-Morrey spaces and Fourier-Besov mixed-Morrey spaces, and then we establish some basic properties for these classes. Moreover, we explore the d-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in this context, by mean of a Bony's paraproduct approach, in order to get the global well-posedness for small initial data. These results provides a new class of initial data with a sort of anisotropy in relation to its spatial variables or frequency variables.</description>

      <title>Stable skeleton integral equations for general coefficient Helmholtz transmission problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel variational formulation of layer potentials and boundary integral operators generalizes their classical construction by Green's functions, which are not explicitly available for Helmholtz problems with variable coefficients. Wavenumber explicit estimates and properties like jump conditions follow directly from their variational definition and enable a non-local (``integral'') formulation of acoustic transmission problems (TP) with piecewise Lipschitz coefficients. We obtain the well-posedness of the integral equations directly from the stability of the underlying TP. The simultaneous analysis for general dimensions and complex wavenumbers (in this paper) imposes an artificial boundary on the external Helmholtz problem and employs recent insights into the associated Dirichlet-to-Neumann map.</description>

      <title>Dissociation limits in Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the {\it Density Functional Theory} (DFT) framework, where a functional of the form $$F_\eps(\rho)=\eps T(\rho)+bC(\rho)-U(\rho)$$ has to be minimized in the class of non-negative measures $\rho$ which have a prescribed total mass $m$ (the total electronic charge). The parameter $\eps$ is small and the terms $T$, $C$, $U$ respectively represent the kinetic energy, the electronic repulsive correlation, the potential interaction term between electrons and nuclei. Several expressions for the above terms have been considered in the literature and our framework is general enough to include most of them.
  It is known that in general, when the positive charge of the nuclei is small, the so-called {\it ionization phenomenon} may occur, consisting in the fact that the minimizers of $F_\eps$ can have a total mass lower than $m$; this physically means that some of the electrons may escape to infinity when the attraction of the nuclei is not strong enough.
  Our main goal, continuing the research we started in \cite{bbcd18}, is to study the asymptotic behavior of the minimizers of $F_\eps$ as $\eps\to0$. We show that the $\Gamma$-limit functional is defined on sums of Dirac masses and has an explicit expression that depends on the terms $T$, $C$, $U$ that the model takes into account.
  Some explicit examples illustrate how the electrons are distributed around the nuclei according to the model used.</description>

      <title>The Fourier spectral approach to the spatial discretization of quasilinear hyperbolic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the rigorous justification of the spatial discretization by means of Fourier spectral methods of quasilinear first-order hyperbolic systems. We provide uniform stability estimates that grant spectral convergence of the (spatially) semi-discretized solutions towards the corresponding continuous solution provided that the underlying system satisfies some suitable structural assumptions. We consider a setting with sharp low-pass filters and a setting with smooth low-pass filters and argue that - at least theoretically - smooth low-pass filters are operable on a larger class of systems. While our theoretical results are supported with numerical evidence, we also pinpoint some behavior of the numerical method that currently has no theoretical explanation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the scalar wave equation with power nonlinearity in n+1 dimensions. Unlike previous numerical studies, we go beyond the radial case and do not assume any symmetries for n=3, and we only impose an SO(n-1) symmetry in higher dimensions. Our method is based on a hyperboloidal foliation of Minkowski spacetime and conformal compactification. We focus on the late-time power-law decay (tails) of the solutions and compute decay exponents for different spherical harmonic modes, for subcritical, critical and supercritical, focusing and defocusing nonlinear wave equations.</description>

Abstract: We develop a new proof of the result of L.-E.~Persson and V.D.~Stepanov \cite[Theorems 1 and 3]{Per:02}, which provides a characterization of a Hardy integral inequality involving two weights, and which can be applied to an effective treatment of the geometric mean operator. Our approach enables us to extend their result to the full range of parameters, in particular involving the critical case $p=1$, which was excluded in the original work. Our proof avoids all duality steps and discretization techniques and uses solely elementary means.</description>

Abstract: We present necessary and sufficient conditions to have global hypoellipticity for a class of complex-valued coefficient first order evolution equations defined on $\mathbb{T}^1 \times G$, where $G$ is a compact Lie group. First, we show that the global hypoellipticity of the constant coefficient operator related to this operator is a necessary condition, but not a sufficient condition. Under certain hypothesis, we show that the global hypoellipticity of this class of operator is completely characterized by Nirenberg-Treves' condition $(\mathcal{P})$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study the degenerate parabolic $p$-Laplacian,$ \partial_t u - v^{-1}{\rm div}(|\sqrt{Q} \nabla u|^{p-2} Q \nabla u)=0$, where the degeneracy is controlled by a matrix $Q$ and a weight $v$. With mild integrability assumptions on $Q$ and $v$, we prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions on any interval $[0,T]$. If we further assume the existence of a degenerate Sobolev inequality with gain, the degeneracy again controlled by $v$ and $Q$, then we can prove both finite time extinction and ultracontractive bounds. Moreover, we show that there is equivalence between the existence of ultracontractive bounds and the weighted Sobolev inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the inverse scattering problem of a random potential associated with the polyharmonic wave equation in two and three dimensions. The random potential is represented as a centered complex-valued generalized microlocally isotropic Gaussian random field, where its covariance and relation operators are characterized as conventional pseudo-differential operators. Regarding the direct scattering problem, the well-posedness is established in the distribution sense for sufficiently large wavenumbers through analysis of the corresponding Lippmann--Schwinger integral equation. Furthermore, in the context of the inverse scattering problem, the uniqueness is attained in recovering the microlocal strengths of both the covariance and relation operators of the random potential. Notably, this is accomplished with only a single realization of the backscattering far-field patterns averaged over the high-frequency band.</description>

Abstract: We justify Prandtl equations and higher order Prandtl expansion from the hydrodynamic limit of the Boltzmann equations. Our fluid data is of the form $\text{shear flow}$, plus $\sqrt\kappa$ order term in analytic spaces in $x_\parallel \in\mathbb T^2$ and Sobolev in $x_3\in\mathbb{R}_+$. This work is the first to rigorously justify the Prandtl equations from the hydrodynamic limits of the Boltzmann equations. The novelty lies in obtaining estimates for the linearized Boltzmann equation with a diffusive boundary condition around a Prandtl layer shear flow in analytic spaces. The key techniques involve delicate commutator estimates and the use of local conservation law.</description>

The study first demonstrates the existence and uniqueness of global strong solutions using the weak compactness approach. Furthermore, the existence and uniqueness of classical solutions, as well as arbitrary smooth solutions, are derived through a bootstrap argument. The proofs for the existence of these three types of global solutions are based on Friedrichs mollifier approximation and energy estimates, with the structure of the LLBar equation playing a crucial role in the derivation of the results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence and numerical computation of traveling wave solutions for a family of nonlinear higher-order Boussinesq evolution systems with a Hamiltonian structure. This general Boussinesq evolution system includes a broad class of homogeneous and non-homogeneous nonlinearities. We establish the existence of traveling wave solutions using the variational structure of the system and the \textit{concentration-compactness} principle by P.-L. Lions, even though the nonlinearity could be non-homogeneous. For the homogeneous case, the traveling wave equations of the Boussinesq system are approximated using a spectral approach based on a Fourier basis, along with an iterative method that includes appropriate stabilizing factors to ensure convergence. In the non-homogeneous case, we apply a collocation Fourier method supplemented by Newton's iteration. Additionally, we present numerical experiments that explore cases in which the wave velocity falls outside the theoretical range of existence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a passive scalar equation on the two-dimensional torus, where the advecting velocity field is given by a cellular flow with a randomly moving center. We prove that the passive scalar undergoes mixing at a deterministic exponential rate, independent of any underlying diffusivity. Furthermore, we show that the velocity field enhances dissipation and we establish sharp decay rates that, for large times, are deterministic and remain uniform in the diffusivity constant. Our approach is purely Eulerian and relies on a suitable modification of Villani's hypocoercivity method, which incorporates a larger set of H\"ormander commutators than Villani's original method.</description>

      <title>Gravity water waves over constant vorticity flows: From laminar flows to touching waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Hur &amp; Wheeler [J. Differential Equations, 338:572-590, 2022] proved the existence of periodic steady water waves over an infinitely deep, two-dimensional and constant vorticity flow under the influence of gravity. These solutions include overhanging wave profiles, some of which exhibit surfaces that touch at a point and thereby enclose a bubble of air. We extend these results by formulating a problem that encompasses both infinitely deep and finitely deep flows, and by proving the existence of a continuous curve of water waves that connects a laminar flow to a touching wave for fixed, nonzero gravity. This implies the existence of a wave profile featuring a vertical tangent at a point, which is not overhanging, and is referred to as a breaking wave. We also study the behaviour of critical layers, which are points where the horizontal velocity vanishes, near the surface. In particular, this result holds for arbitrary vorticity.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we give an elementary proof that sets of zero $p,1$-Sobolev-Lorentz capacity are $\mathcal{H}^{n-p}$-null sets independently of non-linear potential theory. We further show that there exists a set of Sobolev-Lorentz-$(p,1)$ capacity equal zero with Hausdorff dimension equal $n-p$.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity exponential stability for Lions-Feireisl's weak solutions to the three-dimensional Barotropic Compressible Navier-Stokes Equations with large Potential Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the large-time behavior for the barotropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with large external force in 3D bounded domain. By constructing a suitable Lyapunov functional and using the extra integrability of the density, we state the exponentially decay-in-time to the equilibrium state for Lions-Feireisl's finite-energy weak solutions. In addition, some careful discussion on Taylor expansion also plays a crucial role in our analysis. The main difficulty lies in the fact that the equilibrium state of density is not a constant anymore induced by the large external force. It should be noted that our result can be regarded as an extension of \cite{PSW} to large potential forces case.</description>

      <title>On quasi-isospectral potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.06110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we work with quasi-isospectral operators as a generalization of isospectral operators. We begin by reviewing some known results about isospectral potentials on compact manifolds and finite intervals. We then consider the notion of quasi-isospectrality, and deduce several properties of quasi-isospectral potentials. Next, we investigate the BMT method as a systematic approach for constructing quasi-isospectral Sturm-Liouville operators on a finite interval. Its application to various boundary value problems serves to illustrate both the method's distinctive features and its limitations. Finally, we extend classical compactness results of isospectral potentials on manifolds of low dimensions to quasi-isospectral potentials using the heat trace.</description>

      <title>An Unconditional Representation of the Conditional Score in Infinite-Dimensional Linear Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15643v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models (SDMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for sampling from the posterior distribution in Bayesian inverse problems. However, existing methods often require multiple evaluations of the forward mapping to generate a single sample, resulting in significant computational costs for large-scale inverse problems. To address this, we propose an unconditional representation of the conditional score-function (UCoS) tailored to linear inverse problems, which avoids forward model evaluations during sampling by shifting computational effort to an offline training phase. In this phase, a task-dependent score function is learned based on the linear forward operator. Crucially, we show that the conditional score can be derived exactly from a trained (unconditional) score using affine transformations, eliminating the need for conditional score approximations. Our approach is formulated in infinite-dimensional function spaces, making it inherently discretization-invariant. We support this formulation with a rigorous convergence analysis that justifies UCoS beyond any specific discretization. Finally we validate UCoS through high-dimensional computed tomography (CT) and image deblurring experiments, demonstrating both scalability and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Regularized Moment Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the work "Dealing with moment measures via entropy and optimal transport", Santambrogio provided an optimal transport approach to study existence of solutions for the moment measure equation, that is: given $\mu$, find $u$ such that $ (\nabla u)_{\sharp}e^{-u}=\mu$. In particular he proves that $u$ satisfies the previous equation if and only if $e^{-u}$ is the minimizer of an entropy and a transport cost. Here we study a modified minimization problem, in which we add a strongly convex regularization depending on a positive $\alpha$ and we link its solutions to a modified moment measure equation $(\nabla u)_{\sharp}e^{-u-\frac{\alpha}{2} \|x\|^2}= \mu$. Exploiting the regularization term, we study the stability of the minimizers.</description>

      <title>On the zero sets of harmonic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider nonzero harmonic functions vanishing on certain subvarieties. Among other things, we give a positive solution to the Problem 151 from the Scottish Book posed by R. Wavre in 1936. In more detail, we construct a nonzero harmonic function in the whole space that vanishes on the edges of the unit cube. Moreover, using harmonic morphisms we construct certain new nontrivial families of harmonic polynomials that vanish at the same set in the unit ball in n-dimensional space for all n greater than or equal to 4. This extends results of Logunov and Malinnikova. We also present some (presumably) new results on harmonic functions in the space whose nodal sets are unions of (affine) subspaces.</description>
