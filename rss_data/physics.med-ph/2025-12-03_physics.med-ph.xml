      <title>BART Streams: Real-time Reconstruction Using a Modular Framework for Pipeline Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To create modular solutions for interactive real-time MRI using reconstruction algorithms implemented in BART.
  Methods: A new protocol for streaming of multidimensional arrays is presented and integrated into BART. The new functionality is demonstrated using examples for interactive real-time MRI based on radial FLASH, where iterative reconstruction is combined with advanced features such as dynamic coil compression and gradient-delay correction. We analyze the latency of the reconstruction and measure end-to-end latency of the full imaging process.
  Results: Reconstruction pipelines with iterative reconstruction and advanced functionality can be built in a modular way using scripting. Latency measurements demonstrate latency sufficient for interactive real-time MRI.
  Conclusion: With the new streaming capabilities, real-time reconstruction pipelines can be assembled using BART in a flexible way, enabling rapid prototyping of advanced applications such as interactive real-time MRI.</description>

      <title>Alternative winding patterns for twisted solenoid coils with improved characteristics for TRASE MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmit Array Spatial Encoding (TRASE) is an MRI technique in which spatial encoding is achieved using phase gradients of the B1 field. This approach offers potential advantages such as hardware simplicity and reduced acoustic noise. In this study, we present an assessment of various winding patterns for twisted solenoid phase-gradient coils, including the simple twisted solenoid (with and without return wire), a double-wound twisted solenoid, and a discrete-loop twisted solenoid. We analyze the magnetic field uniformity and phase linearity of these configurations using Biot-Savart simulations. Our results show that both the double-wound and discrete loop designs offer similar improvements over the simple twisted solenoid with return wire. The discrete loop pattern requires less wire than the double-wound version, making it the preferred option for practical coil construction and operation in a TRASE MRI system.</description>

      <title>Maintaining SUV Accuracy in Low-Count PET with PETfectior: A Deep Learning Denoising Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Diagnostic PET image quality depends on the administered activity and acquisition time. However, minimizing these variables is desirable to reduce patient radiation exposure and radiopharmaceutical costs. PETfectior is an artificial intelligence-based software that processes PET scans and increases signal-to-noise ratio, obtaining high-quality images from low-count-rate images. We perform an initial clinical validation of PETfectior on images acquired with half of the counting statistics required to meet the most recent EANM quantitative standards for 18F-FDG PET, evaluating lesions detectability, quantitative performance and image quality.
  Materials and methods: 258 patients referred for 18F-FDG PET/CT were prospectively included. The standard-of-care scans (100% scans) were acquired and reconstructed according to EARL standards 2. Half-counting-statistics versions were generated from list-mode data and processed with PETfecftior (50%+PETfectior scans). All oncologic lesions were segmented on both PET/CT versions, manually or automatically, and lesions detectability was evaluated. The SUVmax of the lesions was measured and the quantitative concordance of 50%+PETfectior and 100% images was evaluated. Subjective image quality was visually assessed by two experienced physicians.
  Results: 1649 lesions were detected in a total of 198 studies. The 50%+PETfectior images showed high sensitivity for lesion detection (99.9%) and only 1 false positive was detected. The SUVmax measured in 100% and 50%+PETfectior images agreed within 12.5% (95% limits of agreement), with a bias of -1.01%. Image quality of the 50%+PETfectior images was rated equal to or better than the standard-of-care images.
  Conclusion: PETfectior can safely be used in clinical practice at half counting statistics, with high sensitivity and specificity, low quantitative bias and high subjective image quality.</description>
