      <title>Asymptotic Behaviour of three fractional spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain asymptotically sharp identification of fractional Sobolev spaces $ W^{s}_{p,q}$, extension spaces $E^{s}_{p,q}$, and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces $\dot{F}^s_{p,q}$. In particular we obtain for $W^{s}_{p,q}$ and $E^{s}_{p,q}$ a stability theory a la Bourgain-Brezis-Mironescu as $s \to 1$, answering a question raised by Brazke--Schikorra--Yung. Part of the results are new even for $p=q$.</description>

      <title>Blow-up solutions for mean field equations with Neumann boundary conditions on Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a compact Riemann surface $(\Sigma, g)$ with a smooth boundary $\partial \Sigma$, we consider the following mean field equations with Neumann boundary conditions: $$ -\Delta_g u = \lambda \left(\frac{Ve^u}{\int_{\Sigma} Ve^u \, dv_g} - \frac{1}{|\Sigma|_g}\right) \text{ in } \Sigma \text{ with } \partial_{\nu_g} u = 0 \text{ on } \partial \Sigma, $$ We find conditions on the potential function $V: \Sigma \to \mathbb{R}^+$ such that solutions exist for the parameter $\lambda$ when it is in a small right (or left) neighborhood of a critical value $4\pi(m+k)$ for $k \leq m \in \mathbb{N}_+$ and blow up as $\lambda$ approaches the critical parameter. The blow-up occurs exactly at $k$ points in the interior of $\Sigma$ and $(m-k)$ points on the boundary $\partial \Sigma$.</description>

      <title>Existence and stability of time periodic solutions to nonlinear elastic wave equations with viscoelastic terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existence and stability of time periodic solutions for nonlinear elastic wave equations with viscoelastic terms are established. The existence of the time periodic solution is proved using the spectral decomposition of the linear principal part and the Poincar\'{e} map. On the other hand, the proof of the stability of the time-periodic solutions is generally problematic due to the slow time decay induced by the time periodic solutions. Based on the regularity estimates of the time periodic solution derived from the smoothing effect of the semigroup, sharp decay properties of the perturbation from the time periodic solution are proved, which proves the stability.</description>

      <title>Near soliton evolution for $2$-equivariant Schr\"odinger Maps in two space dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider equivariant solutions for the Schr\"odinger Map equation in $2+1$ dimensions, with values into $\mathbb{S}^2$. Within each equivariance class $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ this admits a lowest energy nontrivial steady state $Q^m$, which extends to a two dimensional family of steady states by scaling and rotation. If $|m| \geq 3$ then these ground states are known to be stable in the energy space $\dot H^1$, whereas instability and even finite time blow-up along the ground state family may occur if $|m| = 1$. In this article we consider the most delicate case $|m| = 2$. Our main result asserts that small $\dot H^1$ perturbations of the ground state $Q^2$ yield global in time solutions, which satisfy global dispersive bounds. Unlike the higher equivariance classes, here we expect solutions to move arbitrarily far along the soliton family; however, we are able to provide a time dependent bound on the growth of the scale modulation parameter. We also show that within the equivariant class the ground state is stable in a slightly stronger topology $X \subset \dot H^1$.</description>

      <title>Existence of solutions semilinear parabolic equations with singular initial data in the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain necessary conditions and sufficient conditions on the initial data for the solvability of fractional semilinear heat equations with power nonlinearities in the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^N$. Using these conditions, we can prove that $1+2/Q$ separates the ranges of exponents of nonlinearities for the global-in-time solvability of the Cauchy problem (so-called the Fujita-exponent), where $Q=2N+2$ is the homogeneous dimension of $\mathbb{H}^N$, and identify the optimal strength of the singularity of the initial data for the local-in-time solvability. Furthermore, our conditions lead sharp estimates of the life span of solutions with nonnegative initial data having a polynomial decay at the space infinity.</description>

      <title>Inverse source problem for the space-time fractional parabolic equation on a metric star graph with an integral overdetermination condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we investigate the initial-boundary value problem for fractional order parabolic equation on a metric star graph in Sobolev spaces. First, we prove the existence and uniqueness results of strong solutions which are proved with the classical functional method based on a priori estimates. Moreover, the inverse source problem with the integral overdetermination condition for space-time fractional derivatives in Sobolev spaces is first considered in the present paper. By transforming the inverse problem to the operator-based equation, we showed that the corresponding resolvent operator is well-defined.</description>

      <title>Normalized solutions of $L^2$-supercritical Kirchhoff equations in bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence of normalized solutions for the following nonlinear Kirchhoff type problem \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} -(a+b\int_{\Omega}\vert\nabla u\vert^2dx)\Delta u+\lambda u=\vert u\vert^{p-2}u &amp; \text{ in }\Omega,\\ u=0 &amp; \text{ on }\partial\Omega \end{cases} \end{equation*} subject to the constraint $\int_{\Omega}\vert u\vert^2dx=c$. Here, $a$ and $b$ are positive constants, $\Omega$ is a smooth bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^N$ with $1\leq N\leq3$, $c&gt;0$ is a prescribed value, and $\lambda\in \mathbb{R}$ is a Lagrange multiplier. In the $L^2$-supercritical regime $2+\frac{8}{N}&lt;p&lt;2^*$, we establish the existence of mountain pass-type normalized solutions. Our approach relies on utilizing a parameterized version of the minimax theorem with Morse index information for constraint functionals, and developing a blow-up analysis for the nonlinear Kirchhoff equations. Furthermore, we explore the asymptotic behavior of these solutions as $b\rightarrow0$.</description>

      <title>A Runge-type approximation theorem for the 3D unsteady Stokes system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Runge-type approximation theorems for solutions to the 3D unsteady Stokes system. More precisely, we establish that on any compact set with connected complement, local smooth solutions to the 3D unsteady Stokes system can be approximated with an arbitrary small positive error in $L^\infty$ norm by a global solution of the 3D unsteady Stokes system, where the velocity grows at most exponentially at spatial infinity and the pressure grows polynomially. Additionally, by considering a parasitic solution to the Stokes system, we establish that some growths at infinity are indeed necessary.</description>

      <title>A nonlinear elasticity model in computer vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to analyze a nonlinear elasticity model previously introduced by the authors for comparing two images, regarded as bounded open subsets of $\R^n$ together with associated vector-valued intensity maps. Optimal transformations between the images are sought as minimisers of an integral functional among orientation-preserving homeomorphisms. The existence of minimisers is proved under natural coercivity and polyconvexity conditions, assuming only that the intensity functions are bounded measurable. Variants of the existence theorem are also proved, first under the constraint that finite sets of landmark points in the two images are mapped one to the other, and second when one image is to be compared to an unknown part of another.
  The question is studied as to whether for images related by a linear mapping the unique minimizer is given by that linear mapping. For a natural class of functional integrands an example is given guaranteeing that this property holds for pairs of images in which the second is a scaling of the first by a constant factor. However for the property to hold for arbitrary pairs of linearly related images it is shown that the integrand has to depend on the gradient of the transformation as a convex function of its determinant alone. This suggests a new model in which the integrand depends also on second derivatives of the transformation, and an example is given for which both existence of minimizers is assured and the above property holds for all pairs of linearly related images.</description>

      <title>A kinetic chemotaxis model and its diffusion limit in slab geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemotaxis describes the intricate interplay of cellular motion in response to a chemical signal. We here consider the case of slab geometry which models chemotactic motion between two infinite membranes. Like previous works, we are particularly interested in the asymptotic regime of high tumbling rates. We establish local existence and uniqueness of solutions to the kinetic equation and show their convergence towards solutions of a parabolic Keller-Segel model in the asymptotic limit. In addition, we prove convergence rates with respect to the asymptotic parameter under additional regularity assumptions on the problem data. Particular difficulties in our analysis are caused by vanishing velocities in the kinetic model as well as the occurrence of boundary terms.</description>

      <title>Remainder terms of $L^p$-Hardy inequalities with magnetic fields: the case $1&lt;p&lt;2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on remainder estimates of the magnetic $L^p$-Hardy inequalities for $1&lt;p&lt;2$. \emph{Firstly}, we establish a family of remainder terms involving magnetic gradients of the magnetic $L^p$-Hardy inequalities, which are also new even for the classical $L^p$-Hardy inequalities. \emph{Secondly}, we study another family of remainder terms involving logarithmic terms of the magnetic $L^p$-Hardy inequalities. \emph{Lastly}, as a byproduct, we further obtain remainder terms of some other $L^p$-Hardy-type inequalities by using similar proof of our main results.
  Furthermore, this paper answers the open question proposed by Cazacu \emph{et al.} in [\emph{Nonlinearity} \textbf{37} (2024), Paper No. 035004] and can be viewed as a supplementary work of it.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic stability of composite waves of two viscous shocks for relaxed compressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the time asymptotic stability of composite waves formed by two shock waves within the context of one-dimensional relaxed compressible Navier-Stokes equations. We demonstrate that the composite waves consisting of two viscous shocks achieve asymptotic nonlinear stability under the condition of having two small, independent wave strengths and the presence of minor initial perturbations. Furthermore, the solutions of the relaxed system are observed to globally converge over time to those of the classical system as the relaxation parameter approaches zero. The methodologies are grounded in relative entropy, the $a$-contraction with shifts theory and fundamental energy estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider nonstationary Stokes equations in nondivergence form with variable viscosity coefficients and Navier slip boundary conditions with slip coefficient $\alpha$ in a domain $\Omega$. On the one hand, if $\alpha$ is sufficiently smooth, then we obtain a priori local regularity estimates for solutions near a curved portion of the boundary of the domain. On the other hand, if $\alpha$ depends on the curvature of the boundary of the domain, then we obtain local boundary estimates of Hessians of solutions where the right-hand side does not contain the pressure. Our results are new even if the viscosity coefficients are constant.</description>

      <title>Partial Blow-up Phenomena in the $SU(3)$ Toda System on Riemann Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the partial blow-up phenomena for the $SU(3)$ Toda system on compact Riemann surfaces with smooth boundary. We consider the following coupled Liouville system with Neumann boundary conditions:
  $$
  -\Delta_g u_1 = 2\rho_1\left( \frac{V_1 e^{u_1}}{\int_{\Sigma} V_1 e^{u_1} \, dv_g} - \frac 1 {|\Sigma|_g}\right) - \rho_2\left( \frac{V_2 e^{u_2}}{\int_{\Sigma} V_2 e^{u_2} \, dv_g} - \frac{1}{|\Sigma|_g}\right) \text{in} \,\mathring\Sigma$$ and $$
  -\Delta_g u_2 = 2\rho_2\left( \frac{V_2 e^{u_2}}{\int_{\Sigma} V_2 e^{u_2} \, dv_g} - \frac{1}{|\Sigma|_g}\right) - \rho_1\left( \frac{V_1 e^{u_1}}{\int_{\Sigma} V_1 e^{u_1} \, dv_g} - \frac{1}{|\Sigma|_g}\right) \text{in} \,\mathring\Sigma$$ with boundary conditions $
  \partial_{\nu_g} u_1 = \partial_{\nu_g} u_2 = 0 \text{ on} \, \partial \Sigma,$ where $(\Sigma, g)$ is a compact Riemann surface with the interior $\mathring\Sigma$ and smooth boundary $\partial\Sigma$, $\rho_i$ is a non-negative parameter and $V_i$ is a smooth positive function for $i=1,2$.
  We construct a family of blow-up solutions via the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction and variational methods, wherein one component remains uniformly bounded from above, while the other exhibits partial blow-ups at a prescribed number of points, both in the interior and on the boundary. This construction is based on the existence of a non-degeneracy solution of a so-called shadow system. Moreover, we establish the existence of partial blow-up solutions in three cases: (i) for any $\rho_2&gt;0$ sufficiently small; (ii) for generic $V_1, V_2$ and any $\rho_2\in (0,2\pi)$; (iii) for generic $V_1, V_2$, the Euler characteristic $\chi(\Sigma)&lt;1$ and any $\rho_2\in (2\pi,+\infty)\setminus 2\pi \mathbb{N}_+$.</description>

      <title>Positivity and Green's operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that positive Green's operators are not necessarily positivity preserving. In this paper we investigate the matter of just how far from being positivity preserving a positive Green's operator can be. We will also identify a broad class of Green's operators that are not necessarily positivity preserving but have properties related to positivity preservation that one expects from positivity preserving Green's operators.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Surfaces of Framed Curvature Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces the framed curvature flow, a generalization of both the curve shortening flow and the vortex filament equation. Here, the magnitude of the velocity vector is still determined by the curvature, but its direction is given by an associated time-dependent moving frame. After establishing local existence and global estimates, we analyze the trajectory surfaces generated by different variations of this flow, specifically those leading to surfaces of constant mean or Gaussian curvature.</description>

      <title>Algebraic method of group classification for semi-normalized classes of differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the notion of semi-normalized classes of systems of differential equations, study properties of such classes and extend the algebraic method of group classification to them. In particular, we prove the important theorems on factoring out symmetry groups and invariance algebras of systems from semi-normalized classes and on splitting such groups and algebras within disjointedly semi-normalized classes. Nontrivial particular examples of classes that arise in real-world applications and showcase the relevance of the developed theory are provided. To convincingly illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method, we apply it to the group classification problem for the class of linear Schr\"odinger equations with complex-valued potentials and the general value of the space dimension. We compute the equivalence groupoid of the class by the direct method and thus show that this class is uniformly semi-normalized with respect to the linear superposition of solutions. This is why the group classification problem reduces to the classification of specific low-dimensional subalgebras of the associated equivalence algebra, which is completely realized for the case of space dimension two. Splitting into different classification cases is based on three integer parameters that are invariant with respect to equivalence transformations. We also single out those of the obtained results that are relevant to linear Schr\"odinger equations with real-valued potentials.</description>

      <title>Long time quantum-classical correspondence for open systems in trace norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a frictionless system coupled to an external Markovian environment. The quantum and classical evolution of such systems are described by the Lindblad and the Fokker-Planck equation respectively. We show that when such a system is given by an at most quadratically growing Hamiltonian and at most linearly growing real jump functions, the quantum and classical evolutions remain close on time scales much longer than Ehrenfest time. In particular, we show that the evolution of a density matrix by the Lindblad equation is close in trace norm to the quantization of the corresponding evolution by the Fokker-Planck equation. Such agreement improves upon recent results [arXiv:2403.09345, arXiv:2306.13717, arXiv:2307.05326], which proved long time agreement in weaker norms.</description>

      <title>Subspace Diffusion Posterior Sampling for Travel-Time Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have been widely studied as effective generative tools for solving inverse problems. The main ideas focus on performing the reverse sampling process conditioned on noisy measurements, using well-established numerical solvers for gradient updates. Although diffusion-based sampling methods can produce high-quality reconstructions, challenges persist in nonlinear PDE-based inverse problems and sampling speed. In this work, we explore solving PDE-based travel-time tomography based on subspace diffusion generative models. Our main contributions are twofold: First, we propose a posterior sampling process for PDE-based inverse problems by solving the associated adjoint-state equation. Second, we resorted to the subspace-based dimension reduction technique for conditional sampling acceleration, enabling solving the PDE-based inverse problems from coarse to refined grids. Our numerical experiments showed satisfactory advancements in improving the travel-time imaging quality and reducing the sampling time for reconstruction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.06908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence of normalized solutions to the following nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{aligned} &amp;-\Delta u=f(u)+ \lambda u\quad \mbox{in}\ \mathbb{R}^{N},\\ &amp;u\in H^1(\mathbb{R}^N), ~~~\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|u|^2dx=c, \end{aligned} \right. \end{equation*} where $N\ge3$, $c&gt;0$, $\lambda\in \mathbb{R}$ and $f$ has a Sobolev critical growth at infinity but does not satisfies the Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz condition. By analysing the monotonicity of the ground state energy with respect to $c$, we develop a constrained minimization approach to establish the existence of normalized ground state solutions for all $c&gt;0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05374v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Very little is yet known regarding the Willmore flow of surfaces with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We consider surfaces with a rotational symmetry as initial data and prove a global existence and convergence result for solutions of the Willmore flow with initial data below an explicit, sharp energy threshold. Strikingly, this threshold depends on the prescribed boundary conditions - it can even be made to be $0$. We show sharpness for some critical boundary data by constructing surfaces above this energy threshold so that the corresponding Willmore flow develops a singularity. Finally, a Li-Yau inequality for open curves in $\mathbb{H}^2$ is proved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review some recent developments in mathematical aspects of relativistic fluids. The goal is to provide a quick entry point to some research topics of current interest that is accessible to graduate students and researchers from adjacent fields, as well as to researches working on broader aspects of relativistic fluid dynamics interested in its mathematical formalism. Instead of complete proofs, which can be found in the published literature, here we focus on the proofs' main ideas and key concepts. After an introduction to the relativistic Euler equations, we cover the following topics: a new wave-transport formulation of the relativistic Euler equations tailored to applications; the problem of shock formation for relativistic Euler; rough (i.e., low-regularity) solutions to the relativistic Euler equations; the relativistic Euler equations with a physical vacuum boundary; relativistic fluids with viscosity. We finish with a discussion of open problems and future directions of research.</description>

      <title>On the visco-plastic approximation of a rate-independent coupled elastoplastic damage model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study a rate-independent system for the propagation of damage and plasticity. To construct solutions we resort to approximation in terms of viscous evolutions, where viscosity affects both damage and plasticity with the same rate. The main difficulty arises from the fact that the available estimates do not provide sufficient regularity on the limiting evolutions to guarantee that forces and velocities are in a duality pairing, hence we cannot use a chain rule for the driving energy. Nonetheless, via careful techniques we can characterize the limiting rate-independent evolution by means of an energy-dissipation balance, which encodes the onset of viscous effects in the behavior of the system at jumps.</description>

      <title>Time-periodic solutions to the Navier--Stokes equations on the whole space including the two-dimensional case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let us consider the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations with the time-periodic external forces in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^n$ with $n\geq 2$ and investigate the existence and non-existence of time-periodic solutions. In the higher dimensional case $n \geq 3$, we construct a unique small solution for given small time-periodic force in the scaling critical spaces of Besov type and prove its stability under small perturbations. In contrast, for the two-dimensional case $n=2$, the time-periodic solvability of the Navier--Stokes equations has been long standing open. It is the central work of this paper that we have now succeeded in solving this issue negatively by providing examples of small external forces such that each of them does not generate time-periodic solutions.</description>

For cases where $p=k-l+1$ and $p&gt; k-l+1$, we obtain an admissible solution without any additional conditions, which is strictly spherically convex under a convexity condition. Under the same convexity condition, we establish the existence of a strictly spherically convex solution for the case $p&lt;k-l+1$, provided that the prescribed function is even, a condition known to be necessary.</description>

      <title>Criterion of singularity formation for radial solutions of the pressureless Euler-Poisson equations in exceptional dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13794v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spatial dimensions 1 and 4 play an exceptional role for radial solutions of the pressureless repulsive Euler-Poisson equations. Namely, for any spatial dimension except 1 and 4, any nontrivial solution of the Cauchy problem blows up in a finite time (except in special cases), whereas for dimensions 1 and 4 there exists a neighborhood of trivial initial data in the $C^1$ - norm such that the respective solution preserves the initial smoothness globally. For dimension 1, the criterion of the singularity formation in terms of initial data was known, i.e. this neighborhood can be found exactly.
  For the case of dimension 4, there was no similar result. In this paper, we close this gap and obtain such a criterion for the case of a more technically complicated case of dimension 4.</description>

By introducing a suitable spectral localization, we prove low regularity error estimates for the time discretization corresponding to an adapted Lie-Trotter splitting scheme. The proof is based on tools from spectral theory and pseudodifferential calculus in order to obtain various estimates on the spectral localization, including discrete Strichartz estimates which support the nonlinear analysis.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Analysis of Harmonic Maps With Prescribed Singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the first in a series of two papers to establish the mass-angular momentum inequality for multiple black holes. We study singular harmonic maps from domains of 3-dimensional Euclidean space to the hyperbolic plane having bounded hyperbolic distance to extreme Kerr harmonic maps. We prove that every such harmonic map admits a unique tangent harmonic map at the extreme black hole horizon. The possible tangent maps are classified and shown to be shifted `extreme Kerr' geodesics in the hyperbolic plane that depend on two parameters, one determined by angular momentum and another by conical singularities. In addition, rates of convergence to the tangent map are established. Similarly, expansions in the asymptotically flat end are presented. These results, together with those of Li-Tian [24, 25] and Weinstein [35,36], provide a complete regularity theory for harmonic maps from $\mathbb R^3\setminus z\text{-axis}$ to $\mathbb H^2$ with these prescribed singularities. The analysis is additionally utilized to prove existence of the so called near horizon limit, and to compute the associated near horizon geometries of extreme black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on the regularization by nonlinear noise for a class of partial differential equations that may only have local solutions. In particular, we obtain the global existence, uniqueness and the Feller property for stochastic 3D Navier-Stokes equations, which provide positive answers to some longstanding open problems in this field.
  Moreover, we discover a new phenomenon that for a potentially explosive deterministic system, an appropriate intervention of nonlinear noise can not only prevent blow-up but also lead to the finite time extinction of the associated stochastic system. Our main results have broad applications, including stochastic $p$-Laplace equations with heat sources, stochastic surface growth models and stochastic quasi-geostrophic equations.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Physics-informed neural networks for multiscale heat conduction via phonon Boltzmann transport equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10965v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) is widely used for describing multiscale heat conduction (from nm to $\mu$m or mm) in solid materials. Developing numerical approaches to solve this equation is challenging since it is a 7-dimensional integral-differential equation. In this work, we propose Monte Carlo physics-informed neural networks (MC-PINNs), which do not suffer from the "curse of dimensionality", to solve the phonon BTE to model the multiscale heat conduction in solid materials. MC-PINNs use a deep neural network to approximate the solution to the BTE, and encode the BTE as well as the corresponding boundary/initial conditions using the automatic differentiation. In addition, we propose a novel two-step sampling approach to address inefficiency and inaccuracy issues in the widely used sampling methods in PINNs. In particular, we first randomly sample a certain number of points in the temporal-spatial space (Step I), and then draw another number of points randomly in the solid angular space (Step II). The training points are constructed using the tensor product of the data drawn from the above two steps. The two-step sampling strategy enables MC-PINNs (1) to model the heat conduction from ballistic to diffusive regimes, and (2) is more memory-efficient compared to conventional numerical solvers or existing PINNs for BTE. A series of numerical examples including quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) steady/unsteady heat conduction in a film, and the heat conduction in a quasi-two- and three-dimensional square domain, are conducted to justify the effectiveness of the MC-PINN for heat conduction spanning diffusive and ballistic regimes. Finally, we compare the computational time and memory usage of the MC-PINN and a state-of-art numerical methods to demonstrate the potential of the MC-PINN for large scale problems in real-world applications.</description>
