      <title>Complementary bodies in sphere packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbolic and graphical tools, such as Mathematica, enable precise visualization and analysis of void spaces in sphere packings. In the cubic close packing (CCP, or face-centred cubic packing; FCC) arrangement these voids can be partitioned into repeating geometric units we term spherically truncated polyhedra - bodies analogous to plane-truncated polyhedra but bounded by both planar and spherical surfaces. These structures are relevant in geometric studies and applications such as modelling diffusion in porous media and biological tissues. This work examines the properties of these complementary bodies, deriving their surface area-to-volume ratios, which are significant in physical contexts; and we establish a result concerning the packing density of truncated tetrahedra and octahedra, demonstrating how they tile the interstitial space surrounding packed spheres. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of classical packing problems and their geometrical complements.</description>

      <title>Tightening the mixed integer linear formulation for the piecewise linear approximation in general dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09395v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of tightening the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) approximations of data sets in arbitrary dimensions. The MILP formulation leverages the difference-of-convex (DC) representation of CPWL functions. We introduce the concept of well-behaved CPWL interpolations and demonstrate that any CPWL interpolation of a data set has a well-behaved version. This result is critical to tighten the MILP problem. We present six different strategies to tighten the problem, which include fixing the values of some variables, introducing additional constraints, identifying small big-M parameter values and applying tighter variable bounds. These methods leverage key aspects of the DC representation and the inherent structure of well-behaved CPWL interpolations. Experimental results demonstrate that specific combinations of these tightening strategies lead to significant improvement in solution times, especially for tightening strategies that consider well-behaved CPWL solutions.</description>

      <title>On saturated triangulation-free convex geometric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A convex geometric graph is a graph whose vertices are the corners of a convex polygon P in the plane and whose edges are boundary edges and diagonals of the polygon. It is called triangulation-free if its non-boundary edges do not contain the set of diagonals of some triangulation of P. Aichholzer et al. (2010) showed that the maximum number of edges in a triangulation-free convex geometric graph on n vertices is ${{n}\choose{2}}-(n-2)$, and subsequently, Keller and Stein (2020) and (independently) Ali et al. (2022) characterized the triangulation-free graphs with this maximum number of edges.
  We initiate the study of the saturation version of the problem, namely, characterizing the triangulation-free convex geometric graphs which are not of the maximum possible size, but yet the addition of any edge to them results in containing a triangulation. We show that, surprisingly, there exist saturated graphs with only g(n) = O(n log n) edges. Furthermore, we prove that for any $n &gt; n_0$ and any $g(n)\leq t \leq {{n}\choose{2}}-(n-2)$, there exists a saturated graph with n vertices and t edges. In addition, we obtain a complete characterization of all saturated graphs whose number of edges is ${{n}\choose{2}}-(n-1)$, which is 1 less than the maximum.</description>

      <title>A Purely Geometric Variant of the Gale-Berlekamp Switching Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16305v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the following variant of the Gale-Berlekamp switching game. Let $P$ be a set of n noncollinear points in the plane, each of them having weight $+1$ or $-1$. At each step, we pick a line $\ell$ passing through at least two points of $P$, and switch the sign of every point $p \in P\cap\ell$. The objective is to maximize the total weight of the elements of $P$. We show that one can always achieve that this quantity is at least $n - o(n)$, as $n\rightarrow\infty$, and at least $n/3$, for every $n$. Moreover, these can be attained by a polynomial time algorithm.</description>
