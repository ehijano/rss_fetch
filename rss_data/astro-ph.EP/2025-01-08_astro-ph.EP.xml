      <title>Decameter-sized Earth impactors -- I: Orbital properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous decameter-sized asteroids have been observed impacting Earth as fireballs. These objects can have impact energies equivalent to hundreds of kilotons of TNT, posing a hazard if they impact populated areas. Previous estimates of meteoroid flux using fireball observations have shown an Earth impact rate for decameter-size objects of about once every $2$-$3$ years. In contrast, telescopic estimates of the near-Earth asteroid population predict the impact rate of such objects to be of order $20$-$40$ years, an order-of-magnitude difference. While the cause of this discrepancy remains unclear, tidal disruption of a larger near-Earth body has been proposed as an explanation for these excess decameter-sized impactors. The release in 2022 of previously classified United States Government (USG) satellite sensor data for fireball events has provided a wealth of new information on many of these impacts. Using this newly available USG sensor data, we present the first population-level study characterizing the orbital and dynamical properties of 14 decameter-sized Earth impactors detected by USG sensors since 1994, with a particular focus on searching for evidence of tidal disruption as the cause of the impact rate discrepancy. We find there is no evidence for recent ($\lesssim 10^4$ years) tidal disruption and weak evidence for longer-term tidal disruption in the decameter impactor population, but that the latter conclusion is limited by small number statistics. We also investigate the origins of both the impactor and near-Earth asteroid populations of decameter-sized objects from the main asteroid belt. We find that both populations generally originate from the same source regions: primarily from the $\nu_6$ secular resonance ($\sim70$%) with small contributions from the Hungaria group ($\sim20$%) and the 3:1 Jupiter mean-motion resonance ($\sim10$%).</description>

      <title>Formation of super-Earths and mini-Neptunes from rings of planetesimals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar system planetary architecture has been proposed to be consistent with the terrestrial and giant planets forming from material rings at ~1 au and ~5 au, respectively. Here, we show that super-Earths and mini-Neptunes may share a similar formation pathway. In our simulations conducted with a disk alpha-viscosity of 4e-3, super-Earths accrete from rings of rocky material in the inner disk, growing predominantly via planetesimal accretion. Mini-Neptunes primarily originate from rings located beyond the water snowline, forming via pebble accretion. Our simulations broadly match the period-ratio distribution, the intra-system size uniformity, and the planet multiplicity distribution of exoplanets. The radius valley constrains the typical total mass available for rocky planet formation to be less than 3-6 Earth masses. Our results predict that planets at ~1 au in systems with close-in super-Earths and mini-Neptunes are predominantly water-rich. Though relatively uncommon, at ~1% level, such systems might also host rocky Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone that underwent late giant impacts, akin to the Moon-forming event.</description>

      <title>Characterizing WASP-43b's interior structure: unveiling tidal decay and apsidal motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Recent developments in exoplanetary research highlight the importance of Love numbers in understanding their internal dynamics, formation, migration history and their potential habitability. Love numbers represent crucial parameters that gauge how exoplanets respond to external forces such as tidal interactions and rotational effects. By measuring these responses, we can gain insights into the internal structure, composition, and density distribution of exoplanets. The rate of apsidal precession of a planetary orbit is directly linked to the second-order fluid Love number, thus we can gain valuable insights into the mass distribution of the planet. Aims. In this context, we aim to re-determine the orbital parameters of WASP-43b-in particular, orbital period, eccentricity, and argument of the periastron-and its orbital evolution. We study the outcomes of the tidal interaction with the host star:whether tidal decay and periastron precession are occurring in the system. Method. We observed the system with HARPS, whose data we present for the first time, and we also analyse the newly acquired JWST full-phase light curve. We fit jointly archival and new radial velocity and transit and occultation mid-times, including tidal decay, periastron precession and long-term acceleration in the system. Results. We detected a tidal decay rate of \dotP_a=(-1.99pm0.50) and a periastron precession rate of \dotomega=(0.1851+0.0070-0.0077)=(0.1727+0.0083-0.0089)deg/d=(621.72+29.88-32.04)arcsec/d. This is the first time that both periastron precession and tidal decay are simultaneously detected in an exoplanetary system. The observed tidal interactions can neither be explained by the tidal contribution to apsidal motion of a non-aligned stellar or planetary rotation axis nor by assuming non-synchronous rotation for the planet, and a value for the planetary Love number cannot be derived.

      <title>Connection between planetary He I $\lambda$10830 \AA\ absorption and extreme-ultraviolet emission of planet-host stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The detection of the He I 10830 A triplet in exoplanet atmospheres has opened a new window for probing planetary properties, including atmospheric escape. Unlike Lyman alpha, the triplet is less affected by ISM absorption. Sufficient XUV stellar irradiation may trigger the formation of the He I triplet via photoionization and posterior recombination processes in the planet atmospheres. Only a weak trend between stellar XUV and the planetary He I strength has been observed so far. Aims. We aim to confirm this mechanism for producing the He I absorption in exoplanetary atmospheres by examining a sample of planetary systems. Methods. We obtained homogeneous measurements of the planetary He I line EW and consistently computed the stellar XUV ionizing irradiation. We first derived new coronal models for the planet-host stars. We used updated data from the X-exoplanets database, archival X-ray spectra of M-type stars (including AU Mic and Proxima Cen), and new XMM-Newton X-ray data obtained for the CARMENES project. These data were complemented at longer wavelengths with publicly available HST, FUSE, and EUVE spectra. A total of 75 stars are carefully analyzed to obtain a new calibration between X-ray and EUV emission. Results. Two distinct relationships between stellar X-ray emission (5-100 A) and EUV_H (100-920 A) or EUV_He (100-504 A) radiation are obtained to scale the emission from late-type stellar coronae. A total of 48 systems with reported planetary He I 10830 A studies, exhibit a robust relationship between the planetary He I feature and the ionizing XUV_He received by the planet, corrected by stellar and planetary radii, and the planet's gravitational potential. Some outliers could be explained by a different atmospheric composition or the lack of planetary gaseous atmospheres. This relation may be used to predict the He I 10830 A absorption in exoplanet atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Conditions for radiative zones in the molecular hydrogen envelope of Jupiter and Saturn: The role of alkali metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interior models of gas giants in the Solar System traditionally assume a fully convective molecular hydrogen envelope. However, recent observations from the Juno mission suggest a possible depletion of alkali metals in Jupiter's molecular hydrogen envelope, indicating that a stable radiative layer could exist at the kilobar level. Recent studies propose that deep stable layers help reconcile various Jupiter observations, including its atmospheric water and CO abundances and the depth of its zonal winds. However, opacity tables used to infer stable layers are often outdated and incomplete, leaving the precise molecular hydrogen envelope composition required for a deep radiative zone uncertain. In this paper, we determine atmospheric compositions that can lead to the formation of a radiative zone at the kilobar level in Jupiter and Saturn today. We computed radiative opacity tables covering pressures up to $10^5$ bar, including the most abundant molecules present in the gas giants of the Solar System, as well as contributions from free electrons, metal hydrides, oxides, and atomic species, using the most up-to-date line lists published in the literature. These tables were used to calculate Rosseland-mean opacities for the molecular hydrogen envelopes of Jupiter and Saturn, which were then compared to the critical mean opacity required to maintain convection. We find that the presence of a radiative zone is controlled by the existence of K, Na, and NaH in the atmosphere of Jupiter and Saturn. For Jupiter, the elemental abundance of K and Na must be less than $\sim 10^{-3}$ times solar to form a radiative zone. In contrast, for Saturn, the required abundance for K and Na is below $\sim 10^{-4}$ times solar.</description>

      <title>TOI-5108 b and TOI 5786 b: Two transiting sub-Saturns detected and characterized with TESS, MaHPS and SOPHIE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery and characterization of two sub-Saturns from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (\textit{TESS}) using high-resolution spectroscopic observations from the MaHPS spectrograph at the Wendelstein Observatory and the SOPHIE spectrograph at the Haute-Provence Observatory. Combining photometry from TESS, KeplerCam, LCOGT, and MuSCAT2 with the radial velocity measurements from MaHPS and SOPHIE we measure precise radii and masses for both planets. TOI-5108 b is a sub-Saturn with a radius of $6.6 \pm 0.1$ $R_\oplus$ and a mass of $32 \pm 5$ $M_\oplus$. TOI-5786 b is similar to Saturn with a radius of $8.54 \pm 0.13$ $R_\oplus$ and a mass of $73 \pm 9$ $M_\oplus$. The host star for TOI-5108 b is a moderately bright (Vmag 9.75) G-type star. TOI-5786 is a slightly dimmer (Vmag 10.2) F-type star. Both planets are close to their host stars with periods of 6.75 days and 12.78 days respectively. This puts TOI-5108 b just inside the bounds of the Neptune desert while TOI-5786 b is right above the upper edge. We estimate hydrogen-helium envelope mass fractions of $38 \%$ for TOI-5108 b and $74 \% $ for TOI-5786 b. However, using a model for the interior structure that includes tidal effects the envelope fraction of TOI-5108 b could be much lower ($\sim 20\,\%$) depending on the obliquity. We estimate mass-loss rates between 1.0 * $10^9$ g/s and 9.8 * $10^9$ g/s for TOI-5108 b and between 3.6 * $10^8$ g/s and 3.5 * $10^9$ g/s for TOI-5786 b. Given their masses, this means that both planets are stable against photoevaporation. We also detect a transit signal for a second planet candidate in the TESS data of TOI-5786 with a period of 6.998 days and a radius of $3.83 \pm 0.16$ $R_\oplus$. Using our RV data and photodynamical modeling, we are able to provide a 3-$\sigma$ upper limit of 26.5 $M_\oplus$ for the mass of the potential inner companion to TOI-5786 b.</description>

      <title>An absolute mass, precise age, and hints of planetary winds for WASP-121 A and b from a JWST NIRSpec phase curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have conducted a planetary radial velocity measurement of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b using JWST NIRSpec phase curve data. Our analysis reveals the Doppler shift of the planetary spectral lines across the full orbit, which shifts considerably across the detector ($\sim$ 10 pixels). Using cross-correlation techniques, we have determined an overall planetary velocity amplitude of $K_{\rm p}=215.7\pm1.1$ km/s, which is in good agreement with the expected value. We have also calculated the dynamical mass for both components of the system by treating it as an eclipsing double-line spectroscopic binary, with WASP-121A having a mass of M$_{\star}$=1.330 $\pm$ 0.019 M$_{\odot}$, while WASP-121b has a mass of M$_{\rm p}$= 1.170 $\pm$ 0.043 M$_{\rm Jup}$. These dynamical measurements are $\sim3\times$ more precise than previous estimates and do not rely on any stellar modeling assumptions which have a $\sim$5\% systematic floor mass uncertainty. Additionally, we used stellar evolution modeling constrained with a stellar density and parallax measurement to determine a precise age for the system, found to be 1.11 $\pm$ 0.14 Gyr. Finally, we observed potential velocity differences between the two NIRSpec detectors, with NRS1 lower by 5.5$\pm$2.2 km/s. We suggest that differences can arise from day/night asymmetries in the thermal emission, which can lead to a sensitivity bias favoring the illuminated side of the planet, with planetary rotation and winds both acting to lower a measured $K_{\rm P}$. The planet's rotation can account for 1 km/s of the observed velocity difference, with 4.5$\pm$2.2 km/s potentially attributable to vertical differences in wind speeds.</description>

      <title>Tracing the Winds: A Uniform Interpretation of Helium Escape in Exoplanets from Archival Spectroscopic Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, observations of evaporating exoplanets have become increasingly common, driven by the discovery of the near-infrared helium-triplet line as a powerful probe of atmospheric escape. This process significantly influences the evolution of exoplanets, particularly those smaller than Jupiter. Both theoretical and observational studies have aimed to determine how efficiently exoplanets convert their host star's X-ray and ultraviolet (XUV) radiation into atmospheric mass loss. In this study, we employ the open-source atmospheric escape model p-winds to systematically analyze all publicly available helium triplet spectroscopic detections related to exoplanetary atmospheric escape. Our findings indicate that the retrieved outflows strongly depend on the ratio of XUV flux to planetary density ($F_{\text{XUV}}/\rho_p$), supporting the theoretical framework of energy-limited mass loss. We constrain population-level photoevaporative efficiencies to $0.34 \pm 0.13$ and $0.75 \pm 0.21$ for hydrogen-helium fractions of $0.90$ and $0.99$, respectively. These results offer new insights into exoplanetary atmospheric evolution and will aid future studies on exoplanet population demographics.</description>

      <title>On stellar hotspots due to star-planet magnetic interactions: How much power can actually be transmitted to the chromosphere?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Star-Planet Magnetic Interactions (SPMI) have been proposed as a mechanism for generating stellar hot-spots with energy outputs on the order of $10^{19-21}$ watts. This interaction is primarily believed to be mediated by Alfv\'en waves propagating towards the star. The stellar atmosphere dictates where and how much of this incoming energy can actually be deposited as heat. The stellar transition region separating the chromosphere from the corona of cool stars gives rise to a significant variation of the Alfv\'en speed over a short distance, and therefore a reflection of the Alfv\'en waves at the transition region is naturally expected. We aim to characterize the efficiency of energy transfer due to SPMI by quantifying a frequency dependent reflection of the wave energy at the stellar transition region and its transmission to the stellar chromosphere. Magnetohydrodynamic simulations are employed to model the frequency-dependent propagation of Alfv\'en waves through a realistic background stellar wind profile. The transmission efficiency as a function of the wave frequency is quantified, and further analysis is conducted to characterize the overall energy transfer efficiency of SPMI in several candidate systems where chromospheric hotspots have been tentatively detected. Low-frequency waves experience greater reflection compared to high-frequency waves, resulting in reduced energy transfer efficiency for lower frequencies. Conversely, the parametric decay instability of Alfv\'en waves substantially diminishes the energy transfer efficiency at higher frequencies. As a result, there exists a frequency range where energy transfer is most efficient. A significant fraction of the Alfv\'en wave energy is reflected at the stellar transition region, and in most realistic scenarios, the transmission efficiency to the chromosphere is found to be approximately 10 percent.</description>

      <title>Twinkle: A GPU-based binary-lens microlensing code with contour integration method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapidly increasing rate of microlensing planet detections, microlensing modeling software faces significant challenges in computation efficiency. Here, we develop the Twinkle code, an efficient and robust binary-lens modeling software suite optimized for heterogeneous computing devices, especially GPUs. Existing microlensing codes have the issue of catastrophic cancellation that undermines the numerical stability and precision, and Twinkle resolves them by refining the coefficients of the binary-lens equation. We also devise an improved method for robustly identifying ghost images, thereby enhancing computational reliability. We have advanced the state of the art by optimizing Twinkle specifically for heterogeneous computing devices by taking into account the unique task and cache memory dispatching patterns of GPUs, while the compatibility with the traditional computing architectures of CPUs is still maintained. Twinkle has demonstrated an acceleration of approximately 2 orders of magnitude (&gt;~100 times) on contemporary GPUs. The enhancement in computational speed of Twinkle will translate to the delivery of accurate and highly efficient data analysis for ongoing and upcoming microlensing projects. Both GPU and CPU versions of Twinkle are open-source and publicly available.</description>

Abstract: The transport of energetic particles is intimately related to the properties of plasma turbulence, a ubiquitous dynamic process that transfers energy across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales. However, the mechanisms governing the interactions between plasma turbulence and energetic particles remain incompletely understood. Here we present comprehensive observations from the upstream region of a quasi-perpendicular interplanetary (IP) shock on 2004 January 22, using data from four Cluster spacecraft to investigate the interplay between turbulence dynamics and energetic particle transport. Our observations reveal a transition in energetic proton fluxes from exponential to power-law decay with increasing distance from the IP shock. This result provides possible observational evidence of a shift in transport behavior from normal diffusion to superdiffusion. This transition correlates with an increase in the time ratio from $\tau_s/\tau_{c}&lt;1$ to $\tau_s/\tau_{c}\gg1$, where $\tau_s$ is the proton isotropization time, and $\tau_{c}$ is the turbulence correlation time. Additionally, the frequency-wavenumber distributions of magnetic energy in the power-law decay zone indicate that energetic particles excite linear Alfv\'en-like harmonic waves through gyroresonance, thereby modulating the original turbulence structure. These findings provide valuable insights for future studies on the propagation and acceleration of energetic particles in turbulent astrophysical and space plasma systems.</description>

      <title>Effects of energetic particles produced by magnetic reconnection on discs of young stars</title>

Abstract: T Tauri stars and their discs are crucial for understanding stellar evolution and the formation of planets in low-mass systems. These stars exhibit significant variability, notably emitting intense X-ray flares due to magnetic reconnection events. During these events, magnetic energy is converted into kinetic energy of particles. Some of these particles then heat the plasma of the underlying chromosphere, emitting the observed X-rays. A portion of particles are thought to escape the chromosphere to interact with the surrounding circumstellar environment. The question is what impact do particles produced by magnetic reconnection events have on the discs of young stars.
  The complex characteristics of protoplanetary discs around T Tauri stars require an interdisciplinary strategy to enhance our understanding of these objects. This thesis contribute to establish a framework combining observational methodologies, chemical and dynamic models of protoplanetary discs, and the mechanics of acceleration and transport of energetic particles.
  We indroduce the role of ionisation in disc dynamics, including its sources. Not only from standard sources like stellar radiation and galactic cosmic rays but also from non-thermal ionisation due to magnetic reconnection events. We then examine energetic particles accelerated during magnetic reconnection events in T Tauri flares as an alternative source of ionisation, requiring the construction of a theoretical model based on solar flares. Then, we present a study revealing that particles from magnetic reconnection events could significantly contribute to the ionisation of the inner disc. Finally, we present a complementary study accounting for temporal effects, showing that considering these particles could increase the ionisation rate as well as viscosity, accretion rate, volumetric heating rate, and chemical complexity of inner protoplanetary discs.</description>

      <title>Blowin' in the non-isothermal wind: core-powered mass loss with hydrodynamic radiative transfer</title>

Abstract: The mass loss rates of planets undergoing core-powered escape are usually modeled using an isothermal Parker-type wind at the equilibrium temperature, $T_\mathrm{eq}$. However, the upper atmospheres of sub-Neptunes may not be isothermal if there are significant differences between the opacity to incident visible and outgoing infrared radiation. We model bolometrically-driven escape using aiolos, a hydrodynamic radiative-transfer code that incorporates double-gray opacities, to investigate the process's dependence on the visible-to-infrared opacity ratio, $\gamma$. For a value of $\gamma \approx 1$, we find that the resulting mass loss rates are well-approximated by a Parker-type wind with an isothermal temperature $T = T_\mathrm{eq}/2^{1/4}$. However, we show that over a range of physically plausible values of $\gamma$, the mass loss rates can vary by orders of magnitude, ranging from $10^{-5} \times$ the isothermal rate for low $\gamma$ to $10^5 \times$ the isothermal rate for high $\gamma$. The differences in mass loss rates are largest for small planet radii, while for large planet radii, mass loss rates become nearly independent of $\gamma$ and approach the isothermal approximation. We incorporate these opacity-dependent mass loss rates into a self-consistent planetary mass and energy evolution model and show that lower/higher $\gamma$ values lead to more/less hydrogen being retained after core-powered mass loss. In some cases, the choice of opacities determines whether or not a planet can retain a significant primordial hydrogen atmosphere. The dependence of escape rate on the opacity ratio may allow atmospheric escape observations to directly constrain a planet's opacities and therefore its atmospheric composition.</description>
