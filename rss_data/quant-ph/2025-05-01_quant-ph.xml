      <title>A pseudo-random and non-point Nelson-style process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We take up the idea of Nelson's stochastic processes, the aim of which was to deduce Schr\"odinger's equation. We make two major changes here. The first one is to consider deterministic processes which are pseudo-random but which have the same characteristics as Nelson's stochastic processes. The second is to consider an extended particle and to represent it by a set of interacting vibrating points.
  In a first step, we represent the particle and its evolution by four points that define the structure of a small elastic string that vibrates, alternating at each period a creative process followed by a process of annihilation. We then show how Heisenberg's spin and relations of uncertainty emerge from this extended particle.
  In a second step, we show how a complex action associated with this extended particle verifies, from a generalized least action principle, a complex second-order Hamilton-Jacobi equation. We then deduce that the wave function, accepting this complex action as a phase, is the solution to a Schr\"odinger equation and that the center of gravity of this extended particle follows the trajectories of de Broglie-Bohm's interpretation.
  This extended particle model is built on two new mathematical concepts that we have introduced: complex analytical mechanics on functions with complex values [8, 7, 12] and periodic deterministic processes [8, 9].
  In conclusion, we show that this particle model and its associated wave function are compatible with the quantum mechanical interpretation of the double-scale theory we recently proposed [11].</description>

      <title>Detecting genuine multipartite entanglement in multi-qubit devices with restricted measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) is a state-characterization task that can be viewed as a benchmark in that it confirms appropriate levels of coherence and the ability to control the system in the laboratory. However, many GME tests require joint measurements on all or the majority of the involved quantum systems, posing experimental challenges for platforms with restricted qubit connectivity such as typical setups for time-bin encoded qubits. Here we construct a family of versatile GME criteria that only require measurements of a small subset, i.e., $O(n^2)$ out of $2^n$, of (at most) $m$-body stabilizers of $n$-qubit target graph states, with $m$ bounded from above by twice the maximum degree of the underlying graph. We present analytical results for white-noise-added graph states and numerical simulations for graph states produced in microwave photonic qubits that demonstrate the versatility and performance of our GME criteria under realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Is Entanglement Necessary for the Typicality Argument in Statistical Mechanics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typicality arguments replace the postulated mixed state ensembles of statistical mechanics with pure states sampled uniformly at random, explaining why most microstates of large systems exhibit thermal behavior. This paradigm has been revived in quantum contexts, where entanglement is deemed essential, but no clear quantitative link between entanglement structure and typicality has been established. Here, we study pure quantum states with controlled multipartite entanglement and show that when entanglement grows with system size $N$, fluctuations in macroscopic observables decay exponentially with $N$, whereas if entanglement remains finite, one recovers only the classical $1/\sqrt{N}$ suppression. Our work thus provides a quantitative connection between entanglement structure and the emergence of typicality, demonstrating that entanglement is crucial for thermalization in small quantum systems but unnecessary to justify equilibrium in macroscopic ensembles. This unifies classical and quantum foundations of statistical mechanics by pinpointing exactly when and why entanglement matters.</description>

      <title>Confluent supersymmetric algorithm for bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: External magnetic field profiles leading to equidistant and partially equidistant bilayer graphene spectra within the tight-binding model are obtained. This is achieved by implementing the integral and differential versions of the second-order confluent algorithm to the harmonic oscillator for arbitrary real factorization energies. Additionally, new Barut-Girardello and Gilmore-Perelomov coherent states for bilayer graphene are derived, for both diagonal and non-diagonal ladder operators. Their time evolution is analyzed, finding temporal stability and cyclic evolution in some cases. This fact is contrasted with the non-cyclic evolution of bilayer graphene coherent states obtained when using two different factorization energies. Likewise, the geometric phase and uncertainty product of the quadratures for the previously obtained coherent states are studied.</description>

      <title>Optimized Quantum Embedding: A Universal Minor-Embedding Framework for Large Complete Bipartite Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minor embedding is essential for mapping largescale combinatorial problems onto quantum annealers, particularly in quantum machine learning and optimization. This work presents an optimized, universal minor-embedding framework that efficiently accommodates complete bipartite graphs onto the hardware topology of quantum annealers. By leveraging the inherent topographical periodicity of the physical quantum adiabatic annealer processor, our method systematically reduces qubit chain lengths, resulting in enhanced stability, computational efficiency, and scalability of quantum annealing. We benchmark our embedding framework against Minorminer, the default heuristic embedding algorithm, for the Pegasus topology, demonstrating that our approach significantly improves embedding quality. Our empirical results show a 99.98% reduction in embedding time for a 120 x 120 complete bipartite graphs. Additionally, our method eliminates long qubit chains, which primarily cause decoherence and computational errors in quantum annealing. These findings advance the scalability of quantum embeddings, particularly for quantum generative models, anomaly detection, and large-scale optimization tasks. Our results establish a foundation for integrating efficient quantum-classical hybrid solutions, paving the way for practical applications in quantum-enhanced machine learning and optimization.</description>

      <title>QAOA Parameter Transferability for Maximum Independent Set using Graph Attention Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is one of the promising variational approaches of quantum computing to solve combinatorial optimization problems. In QAOA, variational parameters need to be optimized by solving a series of nonlinear, nonconvex optimization programs. In this work, we propose a QAOA parameter transfer scheme using Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to solve Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problems. We prepare optimized parameters for graphs of 12 and 14 vertices and use GATs to transfer their parameters to larger graphs. Additionally, we design a hybrid distributed resource-aware algorithm for MIS (HyDRA-MIS), which decomposes large problems into smaller ones that can fit onto noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. We integrate our GAT-based parameter transfer approach to HyDRA-MIS and demonstrate competitive results compared to KaMIS, a state-of-the-art classical MIS solver, on graphs with several thousands vertices.</description>

      <title>Iceberg Beyond the Tip: Co-Compilation of a Quantum Error Detection Code and a Quantum Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid progress in quantum hardware is expected to make them viable tools for the study of quantum algorithms in the near term. The timeline to useful algorithmic experimentation can be accelerated by techniques that use many noisy shots to produce an accurate estimate of the observable of interest. One such technique is to encode the quantum circuit using an error detection code and discard the samples for which an error has been detected. An underexplored property of error-detecting codes is the flexibility in the circuit encoding and fault-tolerant gadgets, which enables their co-optimization with the algorthmic circuit. However, standard circuit optimization tools cannot be used to exploit this flexibility as optimization must preserve the fault-tolerance of the gadget. In this work, we focus on the $[[k+2, k, 2]]$ Iceberg quantum error detection code, which is tailored to trapped-ion quantum processors. We design new flexible fault-tolerant gadgets for the Iceberg code, which we then co-optimize with the algorithmic circuit for the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) using tree search. By co-optimizing the QAOA circuit and the Iceberg gadgets, we achieve an improvement in QAOA success probability from $44\%$ to $65\%$ and an increase in post-selection rate from $4\%$ to $33\%$ at 22 algorithmic qubits, utilizing 330 algorithmic two-qubit gates and 744 physical two-qubit gates on the Quantinuum H2-1 quantum computer, compared to the previous state-of-the-art hardware demonstration. Furthermore, we demonstrate better-than-unencoded performance for up to 34 algorithmic qubits, employing 510 algorithmic two-qubit gates and 1140 physical two-qubit gates.</description>

      <title>How Anomalous is the Electron's Magnetic Moment?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electron's spin magnetic moment is ordinarily described as anomalous in comparison to what one would expect from the Dirac equation. But, what exactly should one expect from the Dirac equation? The standard answer would be the Bohr magneton, which is a simple estimate of the electron's spin magnetic moment that can be derived from the Dirac equation either by taking the non-relativistic limit to arrive at the Pauli equation or by examining the Gordon decomposition of the electron's current density. However, these derivations ignore two effects that are central to quantum field theoretic calculations of the electron's magnetic moment: self-interaction and mass renormalization. Those two effects can and should be incorporated when analyzing the Dirac equation, to better isolate the distinctive improvements of quantum field theory. Either of the two aforementioned derivations can be modified accordingly. Doing so yields a magnetic moment that depends on the electron's state (even among $z$-spin up states). This poses a puzzle for future research: How does the move to quantum field theory take you from a state-dependent magnetic moment to a fixed magnetic moment?</description>

      <title>Turbo-Annihilation of Hook Errors in Stabilizer Measurement Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scalable decoding framework for correcting correlated hook errors in stabilizer measurement circuits. Traditional circuit-level decoding attempts to estimate the precise location of faults by constructing an extended Tanner graph that includes every possible source of noise. However, this results in a highly irregular graph with many short cycles, leading to poor performance of message-passing algorithms. To compensate, ordered statistics decoding is typically employed, but its cubic complexity renders it impractical for large codes or repeated stabilizer measurements. Our approach instead focuses on estimating the effective data errors caused by hook faults, modeling them as memory channels. We integrate trellis-based soft-input soft-output equalizers into the Tanner graph of the code, and show that the resulting decoding graph preserves the structural properties of the original Tanner graph such as node degree and girth, enabling efficient message passing. Applied to bivariate bicycle quantum LDPC codes, our decoder outperforms standard belief propagation on the circuit-level graph and closely approaches OSD0 performance, all while maintaining linear complexity and scalability.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption for Quantum Computer Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a lattice-based scheme for homomorphic evaluation of quantum programs and proofs that remains secure against quantum adversaries. Classical homomorphic encryption is lifted to the quantum setting by replacing composite-order groups with Module Learning-With-Errors (MLWE) lattices and by generalizing polynomial functors to bounded natural super functors (BNSFs). A secret depolarizing BNSF mask hides amplitudes, while each quantum state is stored as an MLWE ciphertext pair. We formalize security with the qIND-CPA game that allows coherent access to the encryption oracle and give a four-hybrid reduction to decisional MLWE.
  The design also covers practical issues usually left open. A typed QC-bridge keeps classical bits produced by measurements encrypted yet still usable as controls, with weak-measurement semantics for expectation-value workloads. Encrypted Pauli twirls add circuit privacy. If a fixed knowledge base is needed, its axioms are shipped as MLWE "capsules"; the evaluator can use them but cannot read them. A rho-calculus driver schedules encrypted tasks across several QPUs and records an auditable trace on an RChain-style ledger.
  Performance analysis shows that the extra lattice arithmetic fits inside today's QPU idle windows: a 100-qubit, depth-10^3 teleportation-based proof runs in about 10 ms, the public key (seed only) is 32 bytes, and even a CCA-level key stays below 300 kB. A photonic Dirac-3 prototype that executes homomorphic teleportation plus knowledge-base-relative amplitude checks appears feasible with current hardware. These results indicate that fully homomorphic, knowledge-base-aware quantum reasoning is compatible with near-term quantum clouds and standard post-quantum security assumptions.</description>

      <title>Capturing Quantum Snapshots from a Single Copy via Mid-Circuit Measurement and Dynamic Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Quantum Snapshot with Dynamic Circuit (QSDC), a hardware-agnostic, learning-driven framework for capturing quantum snapshots: non-destructive estimates of quantum states at arbitrary points within a quantum circuit, which can then be classically stored and later reconstructed. This functionality is vital for introspection, debugging, and memory in quantum systems, yet remains fundamentally constrained by the no-cloning theorem and the destructive nature of measurement. QSDC introduces a guess-and-check methodology in which a classical model, powered by either gradient-based neural networks or gradient-free evolutionary strategie, is trained to reconstruct an unknown quantum state using fidelity from the SWAP test as the sole feedback signal. Our approach supports single-copy, mid-circuit state reconstruction, assuming hardware with dynamic circuit support and sufficient coherence time. We validate core components of QSDC both in simulation and on IBM quantum hardware. In noiseless settings, our models achieve average fidelity up to 0.999 across 100 random quantum states; on real devices, we accurately reconstruct known single-qubit states (e.g., Hadamard) within three optimization steps.</description>

      <title>On-chip Frequency divider in superconducting quantum circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the physical process of two-atom simultaneous excitation by single photon,
  we proposed a frequency dividing scheme in superconducting quantum circuit. The frequency division for a microwave photon consists of two quantum processes: firstly, two qubits share the energy of single photon in high-frequency resonator
  through the three-body interaction (two qubits and one photon); secondly, part energies of excited state qubits are
  transferred to corresponding low frequency resonators through two-body interactions (one qubit and one photon). By changing the parameters of pumping pulses, controllable output pulses can be realized through the superconducting frequency divider. The microwave and pulse signals created by the superconducting frequency divider can be used to pump or readout the superconducting qubits, which can greatly reduce the occupation amount of high-frequency cables in dilution refrigerator during the measurement of large scale superconducting quantum chip.</description>

      <title>Preparation Circuits for Matrix Product States by Classical Variational Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the classical compilation of quantum circuits for the preparation of matrix product states (MPS), which are quantum states of low entanglement with an efficient classical description. Our algorithm represents a near-term alternative to previous sequential approaches by reverse application of a disentangler, which can be found by minimizing bipartite entanglement measures after the application of a layer of parameterized disentangling gates. Since a successful disentangler is expected to decrease the bond dimension on average, such a layer-by-layer optimization remains classically efficient even for deep circuits. Additionally, as the Schmidt coefficients of all bonds are locally accessible through the canonical $\Gamma$-$\Lambda$ form of an MPS, the optimization algorithm can be heavily parallelized. We discuss guarantees and limitations to trainability and show numerical results for ground states of one-dimensional, local Hamiltonians as well as artificially spread out entanglement among multiple qubits using error correcting codes.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Approach to Quantum Fisher Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensors driven into the quantum chaotic regime can have dramatically enhanced sensitivity, which, however, depends intricately on the details of the underlying classical phase space. Here, we develop an accurate semiclassical approach that provides direct and efficient access to the phase-space-resolved quantum Fisher information (QFI), the central quantity that quantifies the ultimate achievable sensitivity. This approximation reveals, in very concrete terms, that the QFI is large whenever a specific dynamical quantity tied to the sensing parameter displays a large variance over the course of the corresponding classical time evolution. Applied to a paradigmatic system of quantum chaos, the kicked top, we show that the semiclassical description is accurate already for modest quantum numbers, i.e. deep in the quantum regime, and extends seamlessly to very high quantum numbers that are beyond the reach of other methods.</description>

      <title>Efficient hybrid variational quantum algorithm for solving graph coloring problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computing, available quantum resources are limited. Many NP-hard problems can be efficiently addressed using hybrid classical and quantum computational methods. This paper proposes a hybrid variational quantum algorithm designed to solve the $k$-coloring problem of graph vertices. The hybrid classical and quantum algorithms primarily partition the graph into multiple subgraphs through hierarchical techniques. The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is employed to determine the coloring within the subgraphs, while a classical greedy algorithm is utilized to find the coloring of the interaction graph. Fixed coloring is applied to the interaction graph, and feedback is provided to correct any conflicting colorings within the subgraphs. The merging process into the original graph is iteratively optimized to resolve any arising conflicts. We employ a hierarchical framework that integrates feedback correction and conflict resolution to achieve $k$-coloring of arbitrary graph vertices. Through experimental analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm, highlighting the rapid convergence of conflict evolution and the fact that iterative optimization allows the classical algorithm to approximate the number of colorings. Finally, we apply the proposed algorithm to optimize the scheduling of a subway transportation network, demonstrating a high degree of fairness.</description>

      <title>A microwave-activated high-fidelity three-qubit gate scheme for fixed-frequency superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalable superconducting quantum processors require balancing critical constraints in coherence, control complexity, and spectral crowding. Fixed-frequency architectures suppress flux noise and simplify control via all-microwave operations but remain limited by residual ZZ crosstalk. Here we propose a microwave-activated three-qubit gate protocol for fixed-frequency transmon qubits in the large-detuning regime ($|\Delta| \gg g$), leveraging the third-order nonlinear interaction to coherently exchange $|001\rangle \leftrightarrow |110\rangle$ states. By incorporating a phase-compensated optimization protocol, numerical simulations demonstrate a high average gate fidelity exceeding $99.9\%$. Systematic error analysis identifies static long-range ZZ coupling as the dominant error source in multi-qubit systems, which can be suppressed via operations in the large-detuning regime ($\sim 1$ GHz). This approach simultaneously enhances gate fidelity while preserving spectral isolation, ensuring compatibility with existing all-microwave controlled-Z gate frameworks. The protocol exhibits intrinsic robustness to fabrication-induced qubit parameter variations. This hardware-efficient strategy advances scalable quantum computing systems by improving coherence properties, reducing spectral congestion, and expanding the experimental toolkit for error-resilient quantum operations in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.</description>

      <title>A Unified Variational Framework for Quantum Excited States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining quantum excited states is crucial across physics and chemistry but presents significant challenges for variational methods, primarily due to the need to enforce orthogonality to lower-energy states, often requiring state-specific optimization, penalty terms, or specialized ansatz constructions. We introduce a novel variational principle that overcomes these limitations, enabling the \textit{simultaneous} determination of multiple low-energy excited states. The principle is based on minimizing the trace of the inverse overlap matrix multiplied by the Hamiltonian matrix, $\mathrm{Tr}(\mathbf{S}^{-1}\mathbf{H})$, constructed from a set of \textit{non-orthogonal} variational states $\{|\psi_i\rangle\}$. Here, $\mathbf{H}_{ij} = \langle\psi_i | H | \psi_j\rangle$ and $\mathbf{S}_{ij} = \langle\psi_i | \psi_j\rangle$ are the elements of the Hamiltonian and overlap matrices, respectively. This approach variationally optimizes the entire low-energy subspace spanned by $\{|\psi_i\rangle\}$ without explicit orthogonality constraints or penalty functions. We demonstrate the power and generality of this method across diverse physical systems and variational ansatzes: calculating the low-energy spectrum of 1D Heisenberg spin chains using matrix product states, finding vibrational spectrum of Morse potential using quantics tensor trains for real-space wavefunctions, and determining excited states for 2D fermionic Hubbard model with variational quantum circuits. In all applications, the method accurately and simultaneously obtains multiple lowest-lying energy levels and their corresponding states, showcasing its potential as a unified and flexible framework for calculating excited states on both classical and quantum computational platforms.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum collision models with Hamiltonian simulations using early fault-tolerant quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop randomized quantum algorithms to simulate quantum collision models, also known as repeated interaction schemes, which provide a rich framework to model various open-system dynamics. The underlying technique involves composing time evolutions of the total (system, bath, and interaction) Hamiltonian and intermittent tracing out of the environment degrees of freedom. This results in a unified framework where any near-term Hamiltonian simulation algorithm can be incorporated to implement an arbitrary number of such collisions on early fault-tolerant quantum computers: we do not assume access to specialized oracles such as block encodings and minimize the number of ancilla qubits needed. In particular, using the correspondence between Lindbladian evolution and completely positive trace-preserving maps arising out of memoryless collisions, we provide an end-to-end quantum algorithm for simulating Lindbladian dynamics. For a system of $n$-qubits, we exhaustively compare the circuit depth needed to estimate the expectation value of an observable with respect to the reduced state of the system after time $t$ while employing different near-term Hamiltonian simulation techniques, requiring at most $n+2$ qubits in all. We compare the CNOT gate counts of the various approaches for estimating the Transverse Field Magnetization of a $10$-qubit XX-Heisenberg spin chain under amplitude damping. Finally, we also develop a framework to efficiently simulate an arbitrary number of memory-retaining collisions, i.e., where environments interact, leading to non-Markovian dynamics. Overall, our methods can leverage quantum collision models for both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics on early fault-tolerant quantum computers, shedding light on the advantages and limitations of simulating open systems dynamics using this framework.</description>

      <title>PolyQROM: Orthogonal-Polynomial-Based Quantum Reduced-Order Model for Flow Field Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises exponential acceleration for fluid flow simulations, yet the measurement overhead required to extract flow features from quantum-encoded flow field data fundamentally undermines this advantage--a critical challenge termed the ``output problem''. To address this, we propose an orthogonal-polynomial-based quantum reduced-order model (PolyQROM) that integrates orthogonal polynomial basis transformations with variational quantum circuits (VQCs). PolyQROM employs optimized polynomial-based quantum operations to compress flow field data into low-dimensional representations while preserving essential features, enabling efficient quantum or classical post-processing for tasks like reconstruction and classification. By leveraging the mathematical properties of orthogonal polynomials, the framework enhances circuit expressivity and stabilizes training compared to conventional hardware-efficient VQCs. Numerical experiments demonstrate PolyQROM's effectiveness in reconstructing flow fields with high fidelity and classifying flow patterns with accuracy surpassing classical methods and quantum benchmarks, all while reducing computational complexity and parameter counts. The work bridges quantum simulation outputs with practical fluid analysis, addressing the ``output problem'' through efficient reduced-order modeling tailored for quantum-encoded flow data, offering a scalable pathway to exploit quantum advantages in computational fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum adaptive imaging by position-correlated biphoton wavefront sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum imaging with spatially entangled photons offers advantages such as enhanced spatial resolution, robustness against noise, and counter-intuitive phenomena. In quantum adaptive optics, biphoton aberration correction has been achieved by using classical beams to detect the aberration source or scanning the correction phase on biphotons if the source is unreachable. Here, we introduce position-correlated biphoton Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensing, where the phase pattern added on photon pairs with a strong position correlation is reconstructed from their position centroid distribution at the focal plane of a microlens array. We experimentally demonstrate this method by performing phase measurement and adaptive imaging against the disturbance of a plastic film. Our method involves only one measurement step, so it is a more direct approach to biphoton phase measurement with a greatly improved efficiency, suitable for integration into quantum microscopy and communication.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Local Tadpole-Improvement in Quantum Simulations of Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a new element in quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories, arising from spacetime-dependent quantum corrections in the relation between the link variables defined on the lattice and their continuum counterparts. While in Euclidean spacetime simulations, based on Monte Carlo sampling, the corresponding tadpole improvement leads to a constant rescaled value per gauge configuration, in Minkowski spacetime simulations it requires a state- and time-dependent update of the coefficients of operators involving link variables in the Hamiltonian. To demonstrate this effect, we present the results of numerical simulations of the time evolution of truncated SU(2) plaquette chains and honeycomb lattices in 2+1D, starting from excited states with regions of high energy density, and with and without entanglement.</description>

      <title>Skin Effect Induced Anomalous Dynamics from Charge-Fluctuating Initial States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium dynamics in non-Hermitian systems has attracted significant interest, particularly due to the skin effect and its associated anomalous phenomena. Previous studies have primarily focused on initial states with a definite particle number. Here, we present a systematic study of non-reciprocal quench dynamics in the pairing states with indefinite particle number. Our study uncovers a range of novel behaviors. Firstly, we demonstrate a universal tendency towards half-filling of particle density at late times. At early times for certain initial states, we observe a chiral wavefront in both particle number distribution and charge inflow, associated with a sharp decrease in particle number. Furthermore, we find that non-Hermiticity could enhance the growth of entanglement in the initial stages of evolution. In the intermediate time regime, the characteristic skin effect leads to particle accumulation on one side, leading to a pronounced reduction in entanglement entropy. Moreover, our results reveal the presence of the quantum Mpemba effect during the restoration of U(1) symmetry. Our findings open new avenues for exploring exotic dynamic phenomena in quantum many-body systems arising from the interplay of symmetry breaking and non-Hermiticity.</description>

      <title>Optimal fermion-qubit mappings via quadratic assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation of fermionic systems is one of the most promising applications of quantum computers. It spans problems in quantum chemistry, high-energy physics and condensed matter. Underpinning the core steps of any quantum simulation algorithm, fermion-qubit mappings translate the fermionic interactions to the operators and states of quantum computers. This translation is highly non-trivial: a burgeoning supply of fermion-qubit mappings has arisen over the past twenty years to address the limited resources of early quantum technology. Previous literature has presented a dichotomy between ancilla-free fermion-qubit mappings, which minimise qubit count, and local encodings, which minimise gate complexity.
  We present two computational approaches to the construction of general mappings while working with a limited number of qubits, striking a balance between the low-qubit and low-gate demands of present quantum technology. The first method frames the order of fermionic labels as an instance of the quadratic assignment problem to minimize the total and maximum Pauli weights in a problem Hamiltonian. We compare the order-optimized performance of several common ancilla-free mappings on systems of size up to 225 fermionic modes. The second method is a computational approach to incrementally add ancilla qubits to Jordan--Wigner transformations and further reduce the Pauli weights. By adding up to 10 ancilla qubits, we were able to reduce the total Pauli weight by as much as 67% in Jordan--Wigner transformations of fermionic systems with up to 64 modes, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art ancilla-free mappings.

      <title>A note on the quantum Wielandt inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we show how to extend operator algebraic methods introduced by Rahaman to prove that the index of primitivity of any primitive Schwarz map is at most $2(D-1)^2$, where $D$ is the dimension of the underlying matrix algebra. This inequality was first proved by Rahaman for Schwarz maps which were both unital and trace preserving. We show here that the assumption of unitality is automatic (up to normalization) for primitive Schwarz maps, but, in general, not all primitive unital Schwarz maps are trace preserving. Therefore, the precise purpose of this note is to showcase how to apply the proof of Rahaman to arbitrary primitive Schwarz maps. As a corollary of this theorem, we show that the index of primitivity of any primitive 2-positive map is at most $2(D-1)^2$, so in particular this bound holds for arbitrary primitive completely positive maps. We briefly discuss of how this relates to a conjecture of Perez-Garcia, Verstraete, Wolf and Cirac concerning properties of parent Hamiltonians of matrix product states.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing Algorithms for Estimating Ising Partition Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating partition functions of Ising spin glasses is crucial in statistical physics, optimization, and machine learning, yet remains classically intractable due to its #P-hard complexity. While Jarzynski's equality offers a theoretical approach, it becomes unreliable at low temperatures due to rare divergent statistical fluctuations. Here, we present a protocol that overcomes this limitation by synergizing reverse quantum annealing with tailored nonequilibrium initial distributions. Our method can dramatically suppress the estimator variance, achieving saturation in the low-temperature regime. Numerical benchmarks on the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass and the 3-SAT problem demonstrate that our protocol reduces scaling exponents by over an order of magnitude (e.g., from ~8.5 to ~0.5), despite retaining exponential system-size dependences. Crucially, our protocol circumvents stringent adiabatic constraints, making it feasible for near-term quantum devices like superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and Rydberg atom arrays. This work bridges quantum dynamics with computational complexity, offering a practical pathway to quantum advantage in spin glass thermodynamics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneously error-corrected QRAMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Random Access Memories (QRAM) could prove essential for scalable quantum computing, for everything from accessing classical databases for unordered search to creating arbitrary superpositions of states. However, like most applications of quantum computing, QRAMs suffer from qubit error and decoherence. Quantum Error Correction (QEC) provides a potential solution, but unfortunately, most QEC proposals that uniformly correct all qubits of the QRAM incur major overheads, making the QRAM infeasible. In this work, we propose a surface code error-corrected QRAM made of heterogeneous code distance logical qubits. Our QRAM can produce higher fidelity queries, while keeping qubit overheads smaller than the uniformly error-corrected QRAMs. Comparisons between our novel QRAM architectures and a uniformly error corrected baseline are presented, showing that our designs can achieve up to polylogarithmic reduction in query infidelity, producing constant query infidelity scaling, while simultaneously reducing qubit overhead.</description>

      <title>Bounds in Sequential Unambiguous Discrimination of Multiple Pure Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential methods for quantum hypothesis testing offer significant advantages over fixed-length approaches, which rely on a predefined number of state copies. Despite their potential, these methods remain underexplored for unambiguous discrimination. In this work, we derive performance bounds for such methods when applied to the discrimination of a set of pure states. The performance is evaluated based on the expected number of copies required. We establish a lower bound applicable to any sequential method and an upper bound on the optimal sequential method. The upper bound is derived using a novel and simple non-adaptive method. Importantly, the gap between these bounds is minimal, scaling logarithmically with the number of distinct states.</description>

Abstract: Detecting individual spins--including stable and metastable states--represents a fundamental challenge in quantum sensing with broad applications across condensed matter physics, quantum chemistry, and single-molecule magnetic resonance imaging. While nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have emerged as powerful nanoscale sensors, their performance for single-spin detection remains constrained by substantial environmental noise and restricted sensing volume. Here, we propose and demonstrate an entanglement-enhanced sensing protocol that overcomes these limitations through the strategic use of entangled NV pairs. Our approach achieves a 3.4-fold enhancement in sensitivity and a 1.6-fold reduction in spatial resolution relative to single NV centers under ambient conditions. The protocol employs carefully engineered entangled states that amplify target spin signals through quantum interference while suppressing environmental noise. Crucially, we extend these capabilities to resolve metastable single-spin dynamics, directly observing stochastic transitions between different spin states by identifying state-dependent coupling strengths. This dual functionality enables simultaneous detection of static and dynamic spin species for studying complex quantum systems. The achieved performance establishes entanglement-enhanced sensing as a viable pathway toward atomic-scale characterization of quantum materials and interface.</description>

      <title>Exponential advantage in quantum sensing of correlated parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventionally in quantum sensing, the goal is to estimate one or more unknown parameters that are assumed to be deterministic - that is, they do not change between shots of the quantum-sensing protocol. We instead consider the setting where the parameters are stochastic: each shot of the quantum-sensing protocol senses parameter values that come from independent random draws. In this work, we explore three examples where the stochastic parameters are correlated and show how using entanglement provides a benefit in classification or estimation tasks: (1) a two-parameter classification task, for which there is an advantage in the low-shot regime; (2) an $N$-parameter estimation task and a classification variant of it, for which an entangled sensor requires just a constant number (independent of $N$) shots to achieve the same accuracy as an unentangled sensor using exponentially many (${\sim}2^N$) shots; (3) classifying the magnetization of a spin chain in thermal equilibrium, where the individual spins fluctuate but the total spin in one direction is conserved - this gives a practical setting in which stochastic parameters are correlated in a way that an entangled sensor can be designed to exploit. We also present a theoretical framework for assessing, for a given choice of entangled sensing protocol and distributions to discriminate between, how much advantage the entangled sensor would have over an unentangled sensor. Our work motivates the further study of sensing correlated stochastic parameters using entangled quantum sensors - and since classical sensors by definition cannot be entangled, our work shows the possibility for entangled quantum sensors to achieve an exponential advantage over classical sensors, in contrast to the typical quadratic advantage.</description>

      <title>Classical capacities under physical constraints: More capacity with less entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current advancements in communication equipment demand the investigation of classical information transfer over quantum channels, by encompassing realistic scenarios in finite dimensions. To address this issue, we develop a framework for analyzing classical capacities of quantum channels where the set of states used for encoding information is restricted based on various physical properties. Specifically, we provide expressions for the classical capacities of noiseless and noisy quantum channels when the average energy of the encoded ensemble or the energy of each of the constituent states in the ensemble is bounded. In the case of qubit energy-preserving dephasing channels, we demonstrate that a nonuniform probability distribution based on the energy constraint maximizes capacity, while we derive the compact form of the capacity for equiprobable messages. We suggest an energy-constrained dense coding (DC) protocol that we prove to be optimal in the two-qubit situation and obtain a closed-form expression for the DC capacity. Additionally, we demonstrate a no-go result, which states that when the dimension of the sender and the receiver is two, no energy-preserving operation can offer any quantum advantage for energy-constrained entanglement-assisted capacity. We exhibit that, in the energy-constrained situation, classical-quantum noisy channels can show improved capabilities under entanglement assistance, a phenomenon that is unattainable in the unrestricted scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In waveguide quantum electrodynamics systems, atomic radiation emission is shaped by the photonic environment and collective atom interactions, offering promising applications in quantum technologies. In particular, atom-photon bound states, inhibiting complete spontaneous decay of the atom, can be realized through waveguide dispersion engineering or by utilizing giant atoms. While steady-state bound states are well understood, transient or virtual bound states remain less explored. Here we investigate transient atom-photon bound states, arising from initial atom-photon entanglement, and propose methods to slow down spontaneous atomic decay.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mpemba effect from initial system-reservoir entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect -- where hot systems cool faster than colder ones -- has intrigued both classical and quantum thermodynamics. As compared to classical systems, quantum systems add complexity due to quantum correlations. Recent works have explored anomalous relaxation and Mpemba-like effects in several quantum systems, considering isolated systems at zero temperature or open systems in contact with reservoirs under Markovian or non-Markovian dynamics. However, these models typically assume an initial unentangled system-bath state, overlooking the role of initial system-environment correlations. Here we propose a type of quantum Mpemba effect, distinct from the strong Mpemba effect, originating from initial system-bath entanglement solely. It is shown that the degree of initial entanglement significantly influences the early relaxation dynamics, with certain conditions causing backflow and retarded thermalization. As an example, we investigate the spontaneous emission of a two-level atom in a photonic waveguide at zero temperature, where an initial atom-photon entangled state results in delayed relaxation and pronounced Mpemba effect. These findings highlight the crucial role of quantum correlations in thermalization processes and open new avenues for identifying and engineering quantum Mpemba phenomena. Controlling relaxation dynamics through system-environment entanglement may have potential applications in quantum thermal machines, state initialization protocols, and quantum information processing, where precise control over thermalization is essential.</description>

      <title>Non-standard quantum algebras and infinite-dimensional PT-symmetric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a PT-symmetric infinite-dimensional representation of the Uz(sl(2,R)) Hopf algebra, and we analyse a multiparametric family of Hamiltonians constructed from such representation of the generators of this non-standard quantum algebra. It is shown that all these Hamiltonians can be mapped to equivalent systems endowed with a position-dependent mass. From the latter presentation, it is shown how appropriate point canonical transformations can be further defined in order to transform them into Hamiltonians with constant mass over suitable domains. By following this approach, the bound-state spectrum and the corresponding eigenfunctions of the initial PT-symmetric Hamiltonians can be determined. It is worth stressing that a relevant feature of some of the new Uz(sl(2,R)) systems here presented is found to be their connection with double-well and P\"oschl-Teller potentials. In fact, as an application we present a particular Hamiltonian that can be expressed as an effective double-well trigonometric potential, which is commonly used to model several relevant systems in molecular physics.</description>

      <title>Cryptography without Long-Term Quantum Memory and Global Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how oracles which only allow for classical query access can be used to construct a variety of quantum cryptographic primitives which do not require long-term quantum memory or global entanglement. Specifically, if a quantum party can execute a semi-quantum token scheme (Shmueli 2022) with probability of success $1/2 + \delta$, we can build powerful cryptographic primitives with a multiplicative logarithmic overhead for the desired correctness error. Our scheme makes no assumptions about the quantum party's noise model except for a simple independence requirement: noise on two sets of non-entangled hardware must be independent.
  Using semi-quantum tokens and oracles which can only be queried classically, we first show how to construct a "short-lived" semi-quantum one-time program (OTP) which allows a classical sending party to prepare a one-time program on the receiving party's quantum computer. We then show how to use this semi-quantum OTP to construct a semi-quantum "stateful obfuscation" scheme (which we term "RAM obfuscation"). Importantly, the RAM obfuscation scheme does not require long-term quantum memory or global entanglement. Finally, we show how RAM obfuscation can be used to build long-lived one-time programs and copy-protection schemes.</description>

      <title>On the Efficacy of the Peeling Decoder for the Quantum Expander Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of recovering from qubit erasures has recently gained attention as erasures occur in many physical systems such as photonic systems, trapped ions, superconducting qubits and circuit quantum electrodynamics. While several linear-time decoders for error correction are known, their error-correcting capability is limited to half the minimum distance of the code, whereas erasure correction allows one to go beyond this limit. As in the classical case, stopping sets pose a major challenge in designing efficient erasure decoders for quantum LDPC codes. In this paper, we show through simulation, that an attractive alternative here, is the use of quantum expander codes in conjunction with the peeling decoder that has linear complexity. We also discuss additional techniques including small-set-flip decoding, that can be applied following the peeling operation, to improve decoding performance and their associated complexity.</description>

      <title>SPARO: Surface-code Pauli-based Architectural Resource Optimization for Fault-tolerant Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21854v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface codes represent a leading approach for quantum error correction (QEC), offering a path towards universal fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). However, efficiently implementing algorithms, particularly using Pauli-based computation (PBC) with lattice surgery, necessitates careful resource optimization. Prior work often employs static layouts and simplified error models. These typically fail to capture the full costs and dynamic nature of active computation, leading to resource bottlenecks and suboptimal architectural designs. To address this, we introduce SPARO. SPARO features a comprehensive logical error model based on a large corpus of numerical simulations encompassing active Pauli-based computation (PBC) operations-including Pauli product measurements (PPMs), idling qubits, and patch rotations. Our numerical models are integrated within an end-to-end compilation pipeline. SPARO analyzes algorithm-specific bottlenecks arising from constraints such as limited routing areas or magic-state factory throughput. SPARO then dynamically allocates available hardware resources, balancing compute, routing, and magic-state distillation, to minimize space-time overhead and logical error rates for specific workloads. Our simulations demonstrate that SPARO effectively identifies critical resource trade-offs. When evaluated on benchmark circuits, SPARO identifies resource configurations achieving up to 51.11% logical error rate reductions for 433-qubit ADDER circuits when compared to state-of-the-art static layouts using an identical total resource budget. This dynamic approach enables effective co-optimization of PBC execution and surface-code architectures, significantly improving overall resource efficiency. SPARO will be open sourced.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hypothesis Testing Lemma for Deterministic Identification over Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our previous work, we presented the Hypothesis Testing Lemma, a key tool that establishes sufficient conditions for the existence of good deterministic identification (DI) codes for memoryless channels with finite output, but arbitrary input alphabets. In this work, we provide a full quantum analogue of this lemma, which shows that the existence of a DI code in the quantum setting follows from a suitable packing in a modified space of output quantum states. Specifically, we demonstrate that such a code can be constructed using product states derived from this packing. This result enables us to tighten the capacity lower bound for DI over quantum channels beyond the simultaneous decoding approach. In particular, we can now express these bounds solely in terms of the Minkowski dimension of a certain state space, giving us new insights to better understand the nature of the protocol, and the separation between simultaneous and non-simultaneous codes. We extend the discussion with a particular channel example for which we can construct an optimum code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework connecting global symmetries to the relativistic $S$-matrix through the lens of quantum information theory. Analyzing the 2-to-2 scattering of particles of any helicity, we systematically characterize relativistic scattering amplitudes as quantum gates in the bipartite space of states with a discrete quantum number. This formalism naturally recovers and significantly extends previous results on entanglement suppression of the $S$-matrix, providing a comprehensive approach for studying the emergence of symmetries from an information-theoretic perspective. As a central result, we show that constraining the $S$-matrix to the span of minimally entangling operators is equivalent to realizing an emergent $SU(N)$ global symmetry.</description>

      <title>A genetic algorithm to generate maximally orthogonal frames in complex space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A frame is a generalization of a basis of a vector space to a redundant overspanning set whose vectors are linearly dependent. Frames find applications in signal processing and quantum information theory. We present a genetic algorithm that can generate maximally orthogonal frames of arbitrary size $n$ in $d$-dimensional complex space. First, we formalize the concept of maximally orthogonal frame and demonstrate that it depends on the choice of an energy function to weigh the different pairwise overlaps between vectors. Then, we discuss the relation between different energy functions and well-known frame varieties such as tight and Grassmannian frames and complex projective $p$-designs. Obtaining maximally orthogonal frames poses a global non-convex minimization problem. We discuss the relation with established numerical problems such as the Thomson problem and the problem of finding optimal packings in complex projective space. To tackle the minimization, we design a hybrid genetic algorithm that features local optimization of the parents. To assess the performance of the algorithm, we propose two visualization techniques that allow us to analyze the coherence and uniformity of high-dimensional frames. The genetic algorithm is able to produce highly-symmetric universal frames, such as equiangular tight frames, symmetric, informationally complete, positive operator-valued measurements (SIC-POVMs) and maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases, for configurations of up to $d=6$ and $n=36$, with runtimes of the order of several minutes on a regular desktop computer for the largest configurations.</description>

      <title>Electron beam characterization via fluorescence imaging of Rydberg states in atomic vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate an all-optical, minimally invasive method for electron beam (e-beam) characterization using Rydberg electrometry. The e-beam passes through a dilute Rb vapor prepared in a quantum superposition of ground and Rydberg states that reduces resonant absorption in a narrow spectral region. Imaging the modifications of Rb fluorescence due to shifts in the Rydberg state from the e-beam electric field allows us to reconstruct e-beam width, centroid position, and current. We experimentally demonstrate this technique using a 20 keV e-beam in the range of currents down to 20 $\mu$A, and discuss technical challenges produced by environmental electric potentials in the detection chamber. Overall, we demonstrate the promising potential of such an approach as a minimally invasive diagnostic for charged particle beams.</description>

      <title>Anyonization of bosons in one dimension: an effective swap model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anyons emerge as elementary excitations in low-dimensional quantum systems and exhibit behavior distinct from bosons or fermions. Previous models of anyons in one dimension (1D) are mainly categorized into two types: those that rely on nontrivial scattering behavior, and those based on density-dependent hopping processes in discrete lattices. Here, we introduce a novel framework for realizing anyonic correlations using the internal degrees of freedom of a spinor quantum gas. We propose a "swap" model, which assigns a complex phase factor to the swapping processes between two different species, referred to as "host particles" and "impurities". The anyonic characteristics are demonstrated through the one-body correlator of the impurity, using a spin-charge separation analysis. For a single impurity, our swap model can be effectively implemented by applying tilt potentials in a strongly interacting quantum gas [Dhar et al., arXiv:2412.21131]. We further explore the dynamical properties of anyonic correlations and extend our analysis to the case of multiple impurities. Our work provides new avenues for engineering many-body anyonic behavior in quantum simulation platforms.</description>

Abstract: We are using optical- and microwave-fields to excite Rydberg states in trapped cold 40Ca+ ions. We employ a single ion and observe spectroscopically in the manifold of a principal quantum number n=49 the dressing of Rydberg states of angular momentum states S and P. We compare our experimental spectra with a multi-level calculation of dressed states and find good agreement. The results are important for controlling the interaction of single ions in Rydberg states with electric fields of the ion trap, and for tailoring the interactions in an ion crystal in Rydberg states.</description>

      <title>From expNN to sinNN: automatic generation of sum-of-products models for potential energy surfaces in internal coordinates using neural networks and sparse grid sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Potential Energy Surfaces are generally required for simulating quantum dynamics. Specifically, having an analytical expression of the PES enables a more efficient dynamics workflow compared to the currently popular direct dynamics approaches. When using the MCTDH method, there is also a strong advantage to express the PES in sum-of-products form for solving the time-dependent nuclear Schr\"odinger equation. Nevertheless, obtaining an accurate expression for the PES of molecular systems that contain more than a few atoms presents challenges. The objectives of this work are twofold. First, the practicality of a single-layer artificial neural network with sinusoidal activation functions for representing potential energy surfaces in sum-of-products form will be evaluated. Second, the efficiency and ability of a homogeneous sampling strategy based on sparse grids to provide unbiased coverage of configuration space for generating training data will be assessed. The fitting approach, named sinNN, is applied to modeling the PES of HONO, covering both the trans and cis isomers. Refitting is first explored with comparison to the expNN fitting method. Second, fitting from potential energies obtained from the machine learning model MLatom/AIQM2 is considered. The sinNN PES model obtained from MLatom/AIQM2 energies was able to reproduce available experimental fundamental vibrational transition energies with a root mean square error of about 17 cm-1. sinNN combined with sparse grids sampling approach proves to be of practical use for the chosen system, both at refitting and direct fitting tasks. The ability of MLatom/AIQM models to accurately reproduce global PESs beyond equilibrium geometries is of particular interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a boundary condition twisted by time translation as a novel probe to characterize dynamical phases in periodically driven (Floquet) quantum systems. Inspired by twisted boundary conditions in equilibrium systems, this approach modifies the temporal evolution of the system upon completing a spatial loop, enabling the identification of distinct Floquet phases, including discrete time crystals (DTCs). By studying the spectral form factor (SFF) and its response to the twist, we uncover signatures of time-crystalline order, which exhibits periodic dependence on the twist parameter analogous to the Little-Parks effect in superconductors. We apply this framework to the kicked Ising model, demonstrating that our twist can distinguish time-crystalline phases.</description>

      <title>Towards a $\cos(2\varphi)$ Josephson element using aluminum junctions with well-transmitted channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for fabricating all-aluminum Josephson junctions with highly transmitted conduction channels. Such properties are typically associated with structures requiring intricate fabrication processes, such as atomic contacts or hybrid junctions based on semiconducting nanowires and 2D materials. In contrast, our approach relies solely on standard nanofabrication techniques. The resulting devices exhibit a key signature of high-transmission junctions - Multiple Andreev Reflections (MAR) - in their current-voltage characteristics. Furthermore, we propose a straightforward superconducting circuit design based on these junctions, enabling the implementation of a parity-protected qubit.</description>

      <title>Topological classification and edge states of magnons in honeycomb ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the topological classification and related edge states of magnons in ferromagnets on honeycomb that can be described by a class of single-particle bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) models. Both single layer and bilayer situations are considered. The calculations show that the existence and related topologies of these edge states are well captured by a class of non-Hermitian single or coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains models H(ky) parameterized by momentum ky, where the edge states can appear as the ground state for some cases. Interestingly, although the eigenproblem of bosonic BdG models is equivalent to the one of non-Hermitian systems, the conventional bulkedge correspondence for Hermitian systems is partially valid. The influence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions between next nearest-neighbor spins are also discussed, which break the time-reversal symmetry and lead to a straight connection between edge states for magnonic systems and non-zero Chern number of non-Hermitian bulk two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the future and left Rindler wedges of Minkowski spacetime are entangled, leading to the Unruh effect. Similarly, the past and right Rindler wedges are also entangled. We propose a protocol to extract this entanglement using two two-state detectors located in the past and right Rindler wedges. By scaling the detector transition frequencies inversely with Minkowski time, entanglement from the quantum field is transferred to the detectors, suggesting they may support quantum teleportation via the vacuum. Our protocol can be implemented with current quantum systems, such as flux-tunable transmon qubits. This research provides new insights into the entanglement properties of spacetime and hints at practical applications for secure quantum information transfer using the vacuum state of a quantum field.</description>

      <title>Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg spectroscopy of a fluxonium quantum circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the time-averaged populations obtained for a fluxonium circuit under a large amplitude nonresonant periodic drive. We present numerical simulations of the time evolution which consider the multi-level structure of the driven quantum circuit, looking for a realistic modeling closer to experimental implementations. The Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg spectra show resonances that can be understood as originated from constructive interference favoring transitions to higher levels. For a truncated two-level system (TLS) the resonance patterns can be interpreted using a simplified description of the avoided crossing that takes into account the dynamic phase accumulated at each operation point. For the multilevel case, we derive an effective two-level Hamiltonian using a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation starting from the Floquet Hamiltonian in the Sambe space. Our study provides predictive insight into experimental outcomes, offering an intuitive interpretation that could also support the implementation of fast-non-adiabatic single-qubit gates and entangling protocols.</description>

      <title>Boundary effects in classical liquid density fluctuations at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate thermal effects on density fluctuations in confined classical liquids using phonon quantization. The system is modeled via a massless scalar field between perfectly reflecting parallel planes with Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions. Exact closed-form expressions are derived for the mean square mass density, total energy density, and thermodynamic quantities including Helmholtz free energy and entropy densities. Our analysis identifies distinct regimes, namely, a low-temperature quantum regime exhibiting characteristic power-law behavior for each boundary condition, and a high-temperature classical regime where $\hbar$-independent behavior emerges as expected. A particularly interesting finding shows that while most quantities transition naturally to classical behavior, the mean square density fluctuation requires explicit consideration of the $\hbar\to 0$ limit. The entropy density vanishes at zero temperature, in agreement with the Nernst heat theorem. Numerical analysis confirms our analytical results, particularly the asymptotic temperature behaviors and the intermediate crossover region, in which quantum and classical effects compete. This regime is governed by the energy scale $k_B T \sim \hbar u / a$, where $a$ is the distance between the planes and $u$ is the sound velocity.</description>

      <title>Improved Lanczos Algorithm using Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We improve the Lanczos algorithm using the matrix product state representation proposed in Phys. Rev. B 85, 205119 (2012). As an alternative to the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), the Lanczos algorithm avoids local minima and can directly find multiple low-lying eigenstates. However, its performance and accuracy are affected by the truncation required to maintain the efficiency of the tensor network representation. In this work, we enhance its convergence by restarting with multiple states. We benchmark our method on one-dimensional instances of the Fermi-Hubbard model with 8 sites and the Heisenberg model with 16 sites in an external field, using numerical experiments targeting the first five lowest eigenstates. Across these tests, our approach obtains accuracy improvements of three to seven orders of magnitude. Finally, we extend the Heisenberg model simulation to a lattice with 30 sites to highlight its scalability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pekeris coordinates provide a permutationally invariant set of coordinates for H$_3^+$. They are defined as the linear combination of the three internuclear distances that automatically fulfils the triangle inequality for all non-negative coordinate values. In this work, we test three discrete variable representations (DVR) for tightly converging the rovibrational energies up to and beyond the barrier to linearity using the Pekeris coordinates. The best performing representation is a cot-DVR-type approach adapted to the Pekeris problem. The two- and three-proton near coalescence region, which is also part of the direct product Pekeris grid but dynamically not relevant, is avoided by coordinate mapping.</description>

      <title>A Path to Quantum Simulations of Topological Phases: (2+1)D Wilson Fermions Coupled To U(1) Background Gauge Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation offers a powerful approach to studying quantum field theories, particularly (2+1)D quantum electrodynamics (QED$_3$), which hosts a rich landscape of physical phenomena. A key challenge in lattice formulations is the proper realization of topological phases and the Chern-Simons terms, where fermion discretization plays a crucial role. In this work, we analyze staggered and Wilson fermions coupled to $\text{U}(1)$ background gauge fields in the Hamiltonian formulation and demonstrate that staggered fermions fail to induce (2+1)D topological phases, while Wilson fermions admit a variety of topological phases including Chern insulator and quantum spin Hall phases. We additionally uncover a rich phase diagram for the two-flavor Wilson fermion model in the presence of a chemical potential. Our findings resolve existing ambiguities in Hamiltonian formulations and provide a theoretical foundation for future quantum simulations of gauge theories with topological phases. We further outline connections to experimental platforms, offering guidance for implementations on near-term quantum computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Hypercontractivity for Quantum Erasure Channels via Variable Multipartite Log-Sobolev Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an almost optimal hypercontractive inequality for products of quantum erasure channels, generalizing the hypercontractivity for classical binary erasure channels. To our knowledge, this is the first tensorization-type hypercontractivity bound for quantum channels with no fixed states. The traditional inductive arguments for classical hypercontractivity cannot be generalized to the quantum setting due to the nature of the non-commutativity of matrices. To overcome the difficulty, we establish a novel quantum log-Sobolev inequality for Bernoulli entropy, which includes the classical log-Sobolev inequality and the quantum log-Sobolev inequality as one-partite cases. To our knowledge, its classical counterpart is also unknown prior to this work. We establish a connection between our quantum log-Sobolev inequality and the hypercontractivity bound for quantum erasure channels via a refined quantum Gross' lemma, extending the analogous connection between the quantum log-Sobolev inequality and the hypercontractivity for qubit unital channels. As an application, we prove an almost tight bound (up to a constant factor) on the classical communication complexity of two-party common randomness generation assisted with erased-noisy EPR states, generalizing the tight bound on the same task assisted with erased-noisy random strings due to Guruswami and Radhakrishnan.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of State Spaces into Subobjects in Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive formalism for decomposing the state space of a quantum field into several entangled subobjects, i.e., fields generating a subspace of states. Projecting some of the subobjects onto degenerate background states reduces the system to an effective field theory depending on parameters representing the degeneracies. Notably, these parameters are not exogenous. The entanglement among subobjects in the initial system manifests as an interrelation between parameters and non-projected subobjects. Untangling this dependency necessitates imposing linear first-order equations on the effective field. The geometric characteristics of the parameter spaces depend on both the effective field and the background of the projected subobjects. The system, governed by arbitrary variables, has no dynamics, but the projection of some subobjects can be interpreted as slicing the original state space according to the lowest eigenvalues of a parameter-dependent family of operators. The slices can be endowed with amplitudes similar to some transitions between each other, contingent upon these eigenvalues. Averaging over all possible transitions shows that the amplitudes are higher for maps with increased eigenvalue than for maps with decreasing eigenvalue.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting resonators play a crucial role in the development of quantum technologies such as quantum computing or high performance detectors. Yet, one of their main limitations regarding to noise and sensitivity is the interaction with two-level systems present in oxide layers in the device. Focused on mitigating this problem, we study a superconducting device combining a 100 nm niobium (Nb) circuit with a 10 nm gold (Au) capping layer. Our investigation covers a wide range of temperatures and driving powers, revealing that adding the Au layer reduces the density of two-level system defects while maintaining a very high quality factor. Moreover, an increase in the non-linearity response is also observed. Our findings suggest the potential of Nb/Au lumped element resonators as versatile and promising tools for advancing superconducting quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Maximum and minimum causal effects of physical processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07683v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce two quantitative measures of the strength of causal relations in quantum theory and more general physical theories. These two measures, called the maximum and minimum causal effect, quantify the maximum and minimum changes in the output of a quantum process induced by changes in its input. The maximum and minimum causal effects possess useful properties, such as continuity and data-processing inequality. In quantum theory, they have close connections with quantum information tasks. The maximum quantum causal effect can be used to detect quantum channels with nonzero capacity for transmitting classical information. The minimum causal effect can be used to guarantee the recoverability of quantum information: every quantum process with a high value of the minimum quantum causal effect can be approximately inverted. Moreover, we show that the quantum causal effects satisfy a duality relation: if the minimum causal effect of a quantum system $A$ on another quantum system $B$ is high, then $A$ must have a low value of the maximum causal effect on any other quantum system $B'$ that is spacelike separated with $B$. This duality implies a monogamy relation for quantum causal effects and represents a fundamental difference between quantum and classical causal relations. We illustrate the application of the maximum causal effect to the analysis of two paradigmatic examples, the first involving a coherent superposition of direct cause and common cause, and the second involving a coherent superposition of multiple quantum processes.</description>

      <title>High coherence fluxonium manufactured with a wafer-scale uniformity process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluxonium qubits are recognized for their high coherence times and high operation fidelities, attributed to their unique design incorporating a superinductor, which is typically implemented using an array of over 100 Josephson junctions. However, this complexity poses significant fabrication challenges, particularly in achieving high yield and junction uniformity with traditional methods. Here, we introduce an overlap process for Josephson junction fabrication that achieves nearly 100% yield and maintains uniformity across a 2-inch wafer with less than 5% variation for the phase slip junction and less than 2% for the entire junction array. We use a compact junction array design that achieves state-of-the-art dielectric loss tangents and flux noise levels, as confirmed by multiple devices. This enables fluxonium qubits to reach energy relaxation times exceeding 1 millisecond at the flux frustration point. This work paves the way for scalable high coherence fluxonium processors using CMOS-compatible processes, marking a significant step towards practical quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of spontaneous symmetry breaking with emergent multi-qubit entanglement</title>

Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) is crucial to the occurrence of phase transitions. Once a phase transition occurs, a quantum system presents degenerate eigenstates that lack the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. After crossing the critical point, the system is essentially evolved to a quantum superposition of these eigenstates until decoherence sets in. Despite the fundamental importance and potential applications in quantum technologies, such quantum-mechanical SSB phenomena have not been experimentally explored in many-body systems. We here present an experimental demonstration of the SSB process in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, governed by the competition between the individual driving and intra-qubit interaction. The model is realized in a circuit quantum electrodynamics system, where 6 Xmon qubits are coupled in an all-to-all manner through virtual photon exchange mediated by a resonator. The observed nonclassical correlations among these qubits in the symmetry-breaking region go beyond the conventional description of SSB, shedding new light on phase transitions for quantum many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: Designing an operational architecture for the Quantum Internet is challenging in light of both fundamental limits imposed by physics laws and technological constraints. Here, we propose a method to abstract away most of the quantum-specific elements and formulate a best-effort quantum network architecture based on packet switching, akin to that of the classical Internet. This reframing provides an opportunity to exploit the many available and well-understood protocols within the Internet context. As an illustration, we tailor and adapt classical congestion control and active queue management protocols to quantum networks, employing an architecture wherein quantum end and intermediate nodes effectively regulate demand and resource utilization, respectively. Results show that these classical networking tools can be effective in managing quantum memory decoherence and maintaining end-to-end fidelity around a target value.</description>

Abstract: The existence of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) -- efficient quantum circuits that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar-random unitaries -- has been a central open question, with significant implications for cryptography, complexity theory, and fundamental physics. In this work, we close this question by proving that PRUs exist, assuming that any quantum-secure one-way function exists. We establish this result for both (1) the standard notion of PRUs, which are secure against any efficient adversary that makes queries to the unitary $U$, and (2) a stronger notion of PRUs, which are secure even against adversaries that can query both the unitary $U$ and its inverse $U^\dagger$. In the process, we prove that any algorithm that makes queries to a Haar-random unitary can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer, up to inverse-exponential trace distance.</description>

Abstract: This study explores robust entangled states described using the framework of discrete Wigner functions. Notably, these states are known to outperform the Bell state in measures of entanglement in the presence of non-Markovian noise. Our study focuses on methods for preparing these states using quantum circuits that can be implemented on superconducting hardware and testing the efficacy of these methods on IBM's quantum device. We present quantum circuits for state preparation and validate them through tomographic reconstruction on the IBM \emph{ibm\_brisbane} device. We propose a teleportation scheme that leverages these entangled states as a resource. We believe that these entangled states have the potential to be used in place of the traditional Bell state in scenarios where non-Markovian errors are prevalent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08230v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The description of a closed quantum system is extended with the identification of an underlying substructure in which an expanded formulation of dynamics in the Heisenberg picture is given. Between measurements a ``state point" moves in an underlying multi-dimensional complex, projective space with constant velocity determined by the quantum state vector. Following a measurement, the point changes direction and moves with new constant velocity along one of several possible new orthogonal paths, with probabilities determined by Born's Rule. A possible generalization to a Riemannian substructure is speculated upon, suggesting an unexpected interaction with the background gravitational field.</description>

      <title>Limits of the Lindblad and non-Hermitian description of open systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While it is well established that the dynamics of an open system is described accurately by the Lindblad master equation if the coupling to the bath is either in the weak or in the singular limit, it is not known whether this also extends to other coupling strengths. Here we use the exact solution of a microscopic system coupled to baths to gauge the validity of the Lindblad dynamics during a finite time evolution, and show that for a pure decay system, Lindbladian dynamics generally only holds in the weak and singular coupling limits. We also prove that Lindblad and non-Hermitian dynamics are equivalent in the highest particle subspace of such systems with pure decay. Using this equivalence, we rule out the possibility of obtaining non-Hermitian dynamics for any other couplings. Furthermore, we argue that exceptional points of the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian can only occur in the singular coupling limit, never in the weak coupling limit. Physically, this means that exceptional points can occur when the intrinsic time evolution of the isolated system is comparable to the relaxation time scale.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Neural Galerkin Method for Quantum Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a classical computational method for quantum dynamics that relies on a global-in-time variational principle. Unlike conventional time-stepping approaches, our scheme computes the entire state trajectory over a finite time window by minimizing a loss function that enforces the Schr\"odinger's equation. The variational state is parametrized with a Galerkin-inspired ansatz based on a time-dependent linear combination of time-independent Neural Quantum States. This structure is particularly well-suited for exploring long-time dynamics and enables bounding the error with the exact evolution via the global loss function. We showcase the method by simulating global quantum quenches in the paradigmatic Transverse-Field Ising model in both 1D and 2D, uncovering signatures of ergodicity breaking and absence of thermalization in two dimensions. Overall, our method is competitive compared to state-of-the-art time-dependent variational approaches, while unlocking previously inaccessible dynamical regimes of strongly interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Error analysis of quantum operators written as a linear combination of permutations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12762v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider matrices given as a linear combination of permutations and analyze the impact of bit and phase-flips on the perturbation of the eigenvalues. When the coefficients in the linear combination are positive, we observe that the eigenvalues of the resulting matrices exhibit resilience to quantum bit-flip errors. In addition, we analyze the bit-flips in combination with positive and negative coefficients and the phase-flips. Although matrices with mixed-sign coefficients show less resilience to the bit-flip and phase-flip errors, the numerical evidence shows that the perturbation of the eigenspectrum is very small when the rate of these errors is small. We also discuss the situation when this matrix is implemented through block encoding and there is a control register. Since any square matrix can be expressed as a linear combination of permutations multiplied by two scaling matrices from the left and right (via Sinkhorn's theorem), this paper gives a framework to study matrix computations in quantum algorithms related to numerical linear algebra. In addition, it can give ideas to design more error-resilient algorithms that may involve quantum registers with different error characteristics.</description>

Abstract: Satellite and CubeSat-based quantum key distribution (QKD) presents a promising solution for secure long-distance communication by transmitting quantum keys through free space, with CubeSats offering a compact, cost-effective, and scalable platform for deployment. This study investigates the performance of statistical techniques used to compute the finite-block and single-pass secret key lengths (SKL) for weak coherent pulse (WCP)-based efficient BB84 and standard decoy-state BB84 protocols in CubeSat-based systems. An asymptotic key rate analysis is also conducted for both protocols, providing deeper insights into their theoretical performance within the CubeSat context. The channel transmittance is modeled using an elliptical beam approximation, and the key rate performance is evaluated under varying weather conditions for the downlink scenario. The results demonstrate that the efficient BB84 protocol consistently outperforms the standard version across different atmospheric conditions. Furthermore, the probability distribution of key rates (PDR) for both implementations is analyzed, offering a comprehensive evaluation of their practical effectiveness in CubeSat-based QKD applications.</description>

      <title>Practical classical error correction for parity-encoded spin systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07170v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum annealing (QA) has emerged as a promising candidate for fast solvers for combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) and has attracted the interest of many researchers. Since COP is logically encoded in the Ising interaction among spins, its realization necessitates a spin system with all-to-all connectivity, presenting technical challenges in the physical implementation of large-scale QA devices. W. Lechner, P. Hauke, and P. Zoller proposed a parity-encoding (PE) architecture consisting of an expanded spin system with only local connectivity among them to circumvent this difficulty in developing near-future QA devices. They suggested that this architecture not only alleviates implementation challenges and enhances scalability but also possesses intrinsic fault tolerance. This paper proposes a practical decoding method tailored to correlated spin-flip errors in spin readout of PE architecture. Our work is based on the close connection between PE architecture and classical low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. We show that the bit-flip (BF) decoding algorithm can correct independent and identically distributed errors in the readout of the SLHZ system with comparable performance to the belief propagation (BP) decoding algorithm. Then, we show evidence that the proposed BF decoding algorithm can efficiently correct correlated spinflip errors by simulation. The result suggests that introducing post-readout BF decoding reduces the computational cost of QA using the PE architecture and improves the performance of global optimal solution search. Our results emphasize the importance of the proper selection of decoding algorithms to exploit the inherent fault tolerance potential of the PE architecture.</description>

Abstract: Hybrid quantum systems with different particle species are fundamental in quantum materials and quantum information science. In this work, we establish a rigorous theoretical framework proving that, given access to an unknown spin-boson type Hamiltonian, our algorithm achieves Heisenberg-limited estimation for all coupling parameters up to error $\epsilon$ with a total evolution time ${O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ using only ${O}({\rm polylog}(\epsilon^{-1}))$ measurements. It is also robust against small state preparation and measurement errors. In addition, we provide an alternative algorithm based on distributed quantum sensing, which significantly reduces the evolution time per measurement. To validate our method, we demonstrate its efficiency in hybrid Hamiltonian learning and spectrum learning, with broad applications in AMO, condensed matter and high energy physics. Our results provide a scalable and robust framework for precision Hamiltonian characterization in hybrid quantum platforms.</description>

Abstract: The measurement of tunneling times in strong-field ionization has been the topic of much controversy in recent years, with the attoclock and Larmor clock being two of the main contenders for correctly reproducing these times. By expressing the attoclock as the weak value of temporal delay, we extend its meaning beyond the traditional setup. This allows us to calculate the attoclock time for a static one-dimensional tunneling model consisting of a binding delta potential and a constant electric field. We apply the Steinberg weak-value interpretation of the Larmor clock. Using this definition, we obtain the position-resolved time density during tunnel ionization, yielding a non-zero Larmor tunneling time. Our model allows us to derive the analogue of the position-resolved attoclock tunneling time. While non-zero at the tunnel exit, it vanishes at the detector, far away from the atom. Formally, this means that the attoclock does not measure the "local" Larmor time, but instead a "non-local" time closely related to the phase time.</description>

      <title>On the dual structure of the Schr\"{o}dinger dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper elucidates the dual structure of the Schr\"{o}dinger dynamics in two correlated stages: (1) We first derive the real-valued Schr\"{o}dinger equation from scratch without referring to classical mechanics, wave mechanics, nor optics, and thereby attain a concrete and clear interpretation of the Schr\"{o}dinger (wave) function. Beginning with a factorization of the density distribution function of the particles to two component vectors in configuration space, we impose very simple conditions on them such as translational invariance of space-time and the conservation of flux under a given potential function. A real-valued path-integral is formulated as a Green function for the real-valued Schr\"{o}dinger equation. (2) We then study a quantum stochastic path dynamics in a manner compatible with the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. The relation between them is like the Langevin dynamics with the diffusion equation. Each quantum path describes a \textquotedblleft trajectory\textquotedblright\ in configuration space representing, for instance, a singly launched electron in the double-slit experiment that leaves a spot one by one at the measurement board, while accumulated spots give rise to the fringe pattern as predicted by the absolute square of the Schr\"{o}dinger function. We start from the relationship between the Ito stochastic differential equation, the Feynman-Kac formula, and the associated parabolic partial differential equations, to one of which\ the Schr\"{o}dinger equation is transformed. The physical significance of the quantum intrinsic stochasticity and the indirect correlation among the quantum paths and so on are discussed. The self-referential nonlinear interrelationship between the Schr\"{o}dinger functions (regarded as a whole) and the quantum paths (as its parts) is identified as the ultimate mystery in quantum dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The initial state creation is a starting point of many quantum algorithms and usually is considered as a separate subroutine not included into the algorithm itself. There are many algorithms aimed on creation of special class of states. Our algorithm allows creating an arbitrary $n$-qubit pure quantum superposition state with precision of $m$-decimals (binary representation) for each probability amplitude. The algorithm uses one-qubit rotations, Hadamard transformations and C-NOT operations with multi-qubit controls. However, the crucial operation is the final controlled measurement of the ancilla state that removes the garbage part of the superposition state and allows to avoid the problem of small success probability in that measurement. We emphasize that rotation angles are predicted in advance by the required precision and therefore there is no classical calculation supplementing quantum algorithm. The depth and space of the algorithm growth with $n$ as, respectively, $O(2^n n)$ and $O(n)$. This algorithm can be a subroutine generating the required input state in various algorithms, in particular, in matrix-manipulation algorithms developed earlier.</description>

      <title>Quantum Measurement Without Collapse or Many Worlds: The Branched Hilbert Subspace Interpretation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interpretation of quantum measurements presents a fundamental challenge in quantum mechanics, with concepts such as the Copenhagen Interpretation (CI), Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI), and Bohmian Mechanics (BM) offering distinct perspectives. We propose the Branched Hilbert Subspace Interpretation (BHSI), which describes measurement as branching the local Hilbert space of a system into decoherent subspaces. We formalize the mathematical framework of BHSI using branching and the engaging and disengaging unitary operators to relationally and causally update the states of observers. Unlike the MWI, BHSI avoids the ontological proliferation of worlds and copies of observers, realizing the Born rule based on branch weights. Unlike the CI, BHSI retains the essential features of the MWI: unitary evolution and no wavefunction collapse. Unlike the BM, BHSI does not depend on a nonlocal structure, which may conflict with relativity. We compare CI, MWI, and BHSI in the double-slit experiment, Bell tests, Wigner and his friend, the black hole information paradox, and the delayed choice quantum eraser. Additionally, we examine the environmental scale of branching in MWI versus BHSI (maximal vs. minimal) and investigate whether recohering branches can be realized. Overall, BHSI offers a minimalist, unitarity-preserving, collapse-free, and probabilistically inherent alternative interpretation of quantum measurements.</description>

      <title>Scalable and modular generation of multipartite entangled states through memory-enhanced fusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient generation of large-scale multipartite entangled states is a critical but challenging task in quantum information processing. Although generation of multipartite entanglement within a small set of individual qubits has been demonstrated, further scale-up in system size requires the connection of smaller entangled states into a larger state in a scalable and modular manner. Here we achieve this goal by implementing memory-enhanced fusion of two multipartite entangled states via photonic interconnects. Through asynchronous preparation of two tripartite W-state entanglements in two spatially-separated modules of atomic quantum memories and on-demand fusion via single-photon interference, we demonstrate the creation of a four-partite W-state entanglement shared by two remote quantum memory modules in a heralded way. We further transfer the W state from the memory qubits to the photonic qubits, and confirm the genuine four-partite entanglement through witness measurements. We then demonstrate memory-enhanced scaling in efficiencies in the entanglement fusion. The demonstrated scalable generation and fusion of multipartite entangled states pave the way towards realization of large-scale distributed quantum information processing in the future.</description>

      <title>Simulating Quantum Circuits with Tree Tensor Networks using Density-Matrix Renormalization Group Algorithm</title>

Abstract: Quantum computing offers the potential for computational abilities that can go beyond classical machines. However, they are still limited by several challenges such as noise, decoherence, and gate errors. As a result, efficient classical simulation of quantum circuits is vital not only for validating and benchmarking quantum hardware but also for gaining deeper insights into the behavior of quantum algorithms. A promising framework for classical simulation is provided by tensor networks. Recently, the Density-Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm was developed for simulating quantum circuits using matrix product states (MPS). Although MPS is efficient for representing quantum states with one-dimensional correlation structures, the fixed linear geometry restricts the expressive power of the MPS. In this work, we extend the DMRG algorithm for simulating quantum circuits to tree tensor networks (TTNs). The framework allows us to preserve the TTN structure upon application of gates. To benchmark the method, we simulate random and QAOA circuits with various two-qubit gate connectivities. For the random circuits, we devise tree-like gate layouts that are suitable for TTN and show that TTN requires less memory than MPS for the simulations. For the QAOA circuits, a TTN construction that exploits graph structure significantly improves the simulation fidelities. Our findings show that TTNs provide a promising framework for simulating quantum circuits, particularly when gate connectivities exhibit clustering or a hierarchical structure.</description>

      <title>A Preliminary Investigation on the Usage of Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms for Test Case Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regression testing is key in verifying that software works correctly after changes. However, running the entire regression test suite can be impractical and expensive, especially for large-scale systems. Test suite optimization methods are highly effective but often become infeasible due to their high computational demands. In previous work, Trovato et al. proposed SelectQA, an approach based on quantum annealing that outperforms the traditional state-of-the-art methods, i.e., Additional Greedy and DIV-GA, in efficiency. This work envisions the usage of Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms (QAOAs) for test case selection by proposing QAOA-TCS. QAOAs merge the potential of gate-based quantum machines with the optimization capabilities of the adiabatic evolution. To prove the effectiveness of QAOAs for test case selection, we preliminarily investigate QAOA-TCS leveraging an ideal environment simulation before evaluating it on real quantum machines. Our results show that QAOAs perform better than the baseline algorithms in effectiveness while being comparable to SelectQA in terms of efficiency. These results encourage us to continue our experimentation with noisy environment simulations and real quantum machines.</description>

      <title>Towards Non-Abelian Quantum Signal Processing: Efficient Control of Hybrid Continuous- and Discrete-Variable Architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust quantum control is crucial for achieving operations below the quantum error correction threshold. Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) transforms a unitary parameterized by $\theta$ into one governed by a polynomial function $f(\theta)$, a feature that underpins key quantum algorithms. Originating from composite pulse techniques in NMR, QSP enhances robustness against systematic control errors. We extend QSP to a new class, non-abelian QSP, which utilizes non-commuting control parameters, $\hat\theta_1, \hat\theta_2, \dots$, representing quantum harmonic oscillator positions and momenta. We introduce a fundamental non-abelian composite pulse sequence, the Gaussian-Controlled-Rotation (GCR), for entangling and disentangling a qubit from an oscillator. This sequence achieves at least a $4.5\times$ speedup compared to the state-of-the-art abelian QSP pulse BB1, while maintaining performance. Though quantum fluctuations in the control parameters are unavoidable, the richer commutator algebra of non-abelian QSP enhances its power and efficiency. Non-abelian QSP represents the highest tier of QSP variants tailored for hybrid oscillator-qubit architectures, unlocking new possibilities for such systems. We demonstrate the utility of GCR in high-fidelity preparation of continuous-variable oscillator states, including squeezed, Fock, cat, and GKP states, using fully analytical schemes that match numerically optimized methods in fidelity and depth while enabling mid-circuit error detection. Furthermore, we propose a high-fidelity QSP-based end-of-the-line GKP readout and a measurement-free, error-corrected gate teleportation protocol for logical operations on GKP bosonic qudits, bridging the gap between idealized theoretical and experimentally realistic versions of the GKP code. Finally, we showcase a GCR-based phase estimation algorithm for oscillator-based quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Beyond Robertson-Schr\"odinger: A General Uncertainty Relation Unveiling Hidden Noncommutative Trade-offs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a universal strengthening of the Robertson-Schr\''odinger uncertainty relation, revealing a previously overlooked trade-off of genuinely quantum origin, particularly as the state becomes more mixed. Remarkably, this generalized bound supplements the standard commutator term and the covariance term with an additional positive contribution that depends on the commutator of observables. The relation also rigorously proves and extends a conjectured uncertainty relation previously proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 062215 (2024)]. For two-level quantum systems, the inequality becomes an exact equality for any state and any pair of observables, establishing that the bound is tight in the strongest possible sense.</description>

      <title>Avoided-crossings, degeneracies and Berry phases in the spectrum of quantum noise through analytic Bloch-Messiah decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bloch-Messiah decomposition (BMD) is a fundamental tool in quantum optics, enabling the analysis and tailoring of multimode Gaussian states by decomposing linear optical transformations into passive interferometers and single-mode squeezers. Its extension to frequency-dependent matrix-valued functions, recently introduced as the "analytic Bloch-Messiah decomposition" (ABMD), provides the most general approach for characterizing the driven-dissipative dynamics of quantum optical systems governed by quadratic Hamiltonians. In this work, we present a detailed study of the ABMD, focusing on the typical behavior of parameter-dependent singular values and of their corresponding singular vectors. In particular, we analyze the hitherto unexplored occurrence of avoided and genuine crossings in the spectrum of quantum noise, the latter being manifested by nontrivial topological Berry phases of the singular vectors. We demonstrate that avoided crossings arise naturally when a single parameter is varied, leading to hypersensitivity of the singular vectors and suggesting the presence of genuine crossings in nearby systems. We highlight the possibility of programming the spectral response of photonic systems through the deliberate design of avoided crossings. As a notable example, we show that such control can be exploited to generate broad, flat-band squeezing spectra -- a desirable feature for enhancing degaussification protocols. This study provides new insights into the structure of multimode quantum correlations and offers a theoretical framework for experimental exploitation of complex quantum optical systems.</description>

      <title>Universal contributions to charge fluctuations in spin chains at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At finite temperature, conserved charges undergo thermal fluctuations in a quantum many-body system in the grand canonical ensemble. The full structure of the fluctuations of the total U(1) charge $Q$ can be succinctly captured by the generating function $G(\theta)=\left\langle e^{i \theta Q}\right\rangle$. For a 1D translation-invariant spin chain, in the thermodynamic limit the magnitude $|G(\theta)|$ scales with the system size $L$ as $\ln |G(\theta)|=-\alpha(\theta)L+\gamma(\theta)$, where $\gamma(\theta)$ is the scale-invariant contribution and may encode universal information about the underlying system. In this work we investigate the behavior and physical meaning of $\gamma(\theta)$ when the system is periodic. We find that $\gamma(\theta)$ only takes nonzero values at isolated points of $\theta$, which is $\theta=\pi$ for all our examples. In two exemplary lattice systems we show that $\gamma(\pi)$ takes quantized values when the U(1) symmetry exhibits a specific type of 't Hooft anomaly with other symmetries. In other cases, we investigate how $\gamma(\theta)$ depends on microscopic conditions (such as the filling factor) in field theory and exactly solvable lattice models.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional fracton topological orders with boundary Toeplitz braiding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02482v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically study a class of 3D non-liquid states that show exotic boundary phenomena in the thermodynamical limit. More concretely, we focus on a class of 3D fracton topological orders formed via stacking 2D twisted \(\mathbb{Z}_N\) topologically ordered layers along \(z\)-direction. Nearby layers are coupled while maintaining translation symmetry along \(z\) direction. The effective field theory is given by the infinite-component Chern-Simons (iCS) field theory, with an integer-valued symmetric block-tridiagonal Toeplitz \(K\)-matrix whose size is thermodynamically large. With open boundary conditions (OBC) along \(z\), certain choice of \(K\)-matrices exhibits exotic boundary ``Toeplitz braiding'', where the mutual braiding phase angle between two anyons at opposite boundaries oscillates and remains non-zero in the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, in trivial case, the mutual braiding phase angle decays exponentially to zero in the thermodynamical limit. As a necessary condition, this phenomenon requires the existence of boundary zero modes in the \(K\)-matrix spectrum under OBC. We categorize nontrivial \(K\)-matrices into two distinct types. Each type-I possesses two boundary zero modes, whereas each type-II possesses only one boundary zero mode. Interestingly, the integer-valued Hamiltonian matrix of the familiar 1D ``Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model'' can be used as a non-trivial $K$ matrix. Importantly, since large-gauge-invariance ensures integer quantized \(K\)-matrix entries, global symmetries are not needed to protect these zero modes. We also present numerical simulation as well as finite size scaling, further confirming the above analytical results. Symmetry fractionalization in iCS field theory is also briefly discussed. Motivated by the present field-theoretical work, it will be interesting to ... ....</description>

      <title>Nuclear Spin Metrology with Nitrogen Vacancy Center in Diamond for Axion Dark Matter Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method to directly detect the axion dark matter using nitrogen vacancy centers in diamonds. In particular, we use metrology leveraging the nuclear spin of nitrogen to detect axion-nucleus couplings. This is achieved through protocols designed for dark matter searches, which introduce a novel approach of quantum sensing techniques based on the nitrogen vacancy center. Although the coupling strength of the magnetic fields with nuclear spins is three orders of magnitude smaller than that with electron spins for conventional magnetometry, the axion interaction strength with nuclear spins is the same order of magnitude as that with electron spins. Furthermore, we can take advantage of the long coherence time by using the nuclear spins for the axion dark matter detection. We show that our method is sensitive to a broad frequency range $\lesssim 100\,\mathrm{Hz}$ corresponding to the axion mass $m_a \lesssim 4\times 10^{-13}\,\mathrm{eV}$. We present the detection limit of our method for both the axion-neutron and the axion-proton couplings and discuss its significance in comparison with other proposed ideas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have unveiled new possibilities for discovering intrinsic quantum phases that are unique to open systems, including phases with average symmetry-protected topological (ASPT) order and strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) order in systems with global symmetry. In this work, we propose a new class of phases, termed the double ASPT phase, which emerges from a nontrivial extension of these two orders. This new phase is absent from prior studies and cannot exist in conventional closed systems. Using the recently developed imaginary-Lindbladian formalism, we explore the phase diagram of a one-dimensional open system with $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\sigma}\times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\tau}$ symmetry. We identify universal critical behaviors along each critical line and observe the emergence of an intermediate phase that completely breaks the $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\sigma}$ symmetry, leading to the formation of two triple points in the phase diagram. These two triple points are topologically distinct and connected by a domain-wall decoration duality map. Our results promote the establishment of a complete classification for quantum phases in open systems with various symmetry conditions.</description>

      <title>Out-of-time-order correlator computation based on discrete truncated Wigner approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method based on the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DTWA) for computing out-of-time-order correlators. This method is applied to long-range interacting quantum spin systems where the interactions decay as a power law with distance. As a demonstration, we use a squared commutator of local operators and its higher-order extensions that describe quantum information scrambling under Hamilton dynamics. Our results reveal that the DTWA method accurately reproduces the exact dynamics of the average spreading of quantum information (i.e., the squared commutator) across all time regimes in strongly long-range interacting systems. We also identify limitations in the DTWA method when capturing dynamics in weakly long-range interacting systems and the fastest spreading of quantum information. Then we apply the DTWA method to investigate the system-size dependence of the scrambling time in strongly long-range interacting systems. We reveal that the scaling behavior of the scrambling time for large system sizes qualitatively changes depending on the interaction range. This work provides and demonstrates a new technique to study scrambling dynamics in long-range interacting quantum spin systems</description>

Abstract: Quantum scars have recently been directly visualized in graphene quantum dots (Nature 635, 841 (2024)), revealing their resilience and influence on electron dynamics in mesoscopic systems. Here, we examine variational scarring in two-dimensional quantum dots and demonstrate that these states remain robust even in an open system. We show that controlled perturbations enable modulation of electronic transmission via scarred states, presenting a viable approach to tuning quantum transport. These findings provide insights into the role of scarring in mesoscopic transport and open pathways for experimental realization in quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24380v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The disordered quantum systems host three types of quantum states, the extended, localized, and critical, which bring up various distinct fundamental phases, including the pure phases and coexisting ones with mobility edges. The quantum phases involving critical states are of particular importance, but are less understood compared with the other ones, and the different phases have been separately studied in different quasiperiodic models. Here we propose a unified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic system which unifies the realizations of all the fundamental Anderson phases, with the exact and universal results being obtained for these distinct phases. Through the duality transformation and renormalization group method, we show that the pure phases are obtained when the chiral symmetry preserves in the proposed spin-1/2 quasiperiodic model, which provides a criterion for the emergence of the pure phases or the coexisting ones with mobility edges. Further, we uncover a new universal mechanism for the critical states that the emergence of such states is protected by the generalized incommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful quasiperiodic model, as a nontrivial generalization of the mechanism in the spinless systems. We also show with the Avila's global theory the criteria of exact solvability for the present unified quasiperiodic system, with which we identify several new quasiperiodic models hosting exactly solvable Anderson phases. We particularly reach two novel models, with one hosting all basic types of mobility edges and the other hosting all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization. Finally, an experimental scheme is proposed to realize these models using quasiperiodic optical Raman lattices.</description>

Abstract: We present a method for probing the quantum capacitance associated with the Rydberg transition of surface electrons on liquid helium using radio-frequency (RF) reflectometry. Resonant microwave excitation of the Rydberg transition induces a redistribution of image charges on capacitively coupled electrodes, giving rise to a quantum capacitance originating from adiabatic state transitions and the finite curvature of the energy bands. By applying frequency-modulated resonant microwaves to drive the Rydberg transition, we systematically measured a capacitance sensitivity of 0.34~aF/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ for our RF reflectometry scheme. This sensitivity is sufficient to detect the Rydberg transition of a single electron, offering a scalable pathway toward qubit readout schemes based on surface electrons on helium.</description>
