      <title>Mathematically established chaos in fluid dynamics: recurrent patterns forecast statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse in the Taylor-Couette system, a canonical flow that has been studied extensively for over a century, a parameter regime exhibiting dynamics that can be approximated by a simple discrete map. The map has exceptionally neat mathematical properties, allowing to prove its chaotic nature as well as the existence of infinitely many unstable periodic orbits. Remarkably, the fluid system and the discrete map share a common catalog of unstable periodic solutions with the tent map, a clear indication of topological conjugacy. A sufficient number of these solutions enables the construction of a conjugacy homeomorphism, which can be used to predict the probability density function of direct numerical simulations. These results rekindle Hopf's aspiration of elucidating turbulence through the study of recurrent patterns.</description>

      <title>Localization-delocalization transition for light particles in turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Small bubbles in fluids raise to the surface due to Archimede's force. Remarkably, in turbulent flows this process is severely hindered by the presence of vortex filaments, which act as moving potential wells, dynamically trapping light particles and bubbles. Quantifying the statistical weights and roles of vortex filaments in turbulence is, however, still an outstanding experimental and computational challenge due to their small scale, fast chaotic motion, and transient nature. Here we show that, under the influence of a modulated oscillatory forcing, the collective bubble behaviour switches from a dynamically localized (insulator) to a delocalized (conductor) state. Additionally, we find that by varying the forcing frequency and amplitude, a remarkable resonant phenomenon between light particles and small-scale vortex filamenents emerges, likening particle behavior to a forced damped oscillator. We discuss how these externally actuated bubbles can be used as a new type of microscopic probes to investigate the space-time statistical properties of the smallest turbulence scales, allowing to quantitatively measure physical characteristics of vortex filaments. We develop a superposition model that is in excellent agreement with the simulation data of the particle dynamics which reveals the fraction of localized/delocalized particles as well as characteristics of the potential landscape induced by vortices in turbulence. Our approach paves the way to innovative ways to accurately measure turbulent properties and to the possibility to control light particles and bubble motions in turbulence with potential applications to wave breaking, medical imaging, drug/gene delivery, chemical reactions, wastewater treatment, and industrial mixing.</description>

      <title>Bipartite OTOC in open quantum systems: information scrambling and irreversibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of information scrambling has seen significant growth over the last decade, where the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) has emerged as a prominent tool to probe it. In this work, we use bipartite OTOC, a particular form of OTOC, to study information scrambling in the atom-field interaction models and the model of the Ising spin chain interacting with a tilted magnetic field. This is done considering the effects of open quantum systems. A relationship between information scrambling, using bipartite OTOC, and irreversibility, using entropy production, is probed under unitary dynamics. The equivalence of bipartite OTOC with operator entanglement is explicitly shown for the Ising model.</description>

      <title>On the shifts of orbits and periodic orbits under perturbation and the change of Poincar\'e map Jacobian of periodic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodic orbits and cycles resp. play a significant role in discrete- and continuous-time dynamical systems (i.e. maps and flows). To succinctly describe their shifts when the system is applied perturbation, the notions of functional and functional derivative are borrowed from functional analysis to consider the whole system as an argument of the geometric representation of the periodic orbit or cycle. The shifts of an orbit/trajectory and periodic orbit/cycle are analyzed and concluded as formulae for maps/flows, respectively. The theory shall be beneficial to the sensitivity to perturbation analysis, control and optimization of various systems.</description>
