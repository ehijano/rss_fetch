      <title>Star-shaped Curves under Gage's Area-preserving Flow and the CSF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mayer asks a question what closed, embedded and nonconvex initial curves guarantee that Gage's area-preserving flow (GAPF) exists globally. A folklore conjecture since 2012 says that GAPF evolves smooth, embedded and star-shaped initial curves globally. In this paper, we prove this conjecture by using Dittberner's singularity analysis theory. A star-shaped ``flying wing" curve is constructed to show that GAPF may not always preserve the star-shapedness of evolving curves. This example is also a negative answer to Mantegazza's open problem whether the curve shortening flow (CSF) always preserves the star shape of the evolving curves.</description>

      <title>Loxodromes and geodesics on rotational surfaces in pseudo-isotropic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Special curves and surfaces have an important place in mathematics, engineering and other fields of science. Loxodromes are special curves which cut all meridians on the Earth's surface at a constant angle and they are very popular in engineering. Ships sailing and airplanes flying along a fixed magnetic compass course move along this curve. The Mercator projections of the loxodromes on the sphere correspond to the lines and their stereographic projections to the logarithmic spirals. In general, loxodromes are not great circle arcs (geodesics). Geodesics correspond to the shortest distance between two points on the Earth's surface. Since loxodromes do not need to change course, they are important in navigation. Up till now, there have been many important studies of loxodromes on different surfaces (sphere, ellipsoid, rotational, helicoidal, canal, twisted, etc.) and in different ambient spaces (Euclidean, Minkowski, simply isotropic, etc.). However, there is no study on loxodromes in pseudo-isotropic space I_p^3. In I_p^3, different pseudo-isotropic angles can be defined depending on whether the vectors are space-like or time-like as in Minkowski space. In this study, we will first define these angles in I_p^3. Then, the equations of space-like and time-like loxodromes and geodesics on rotational surfaces will be obtained. Some examples will also be provided.</description>

      <title>Toeplitz algebras and the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show an isomorphism between an algebra which is naturally constructed from the Toeplitz algebra generated by d-shifts, and an ideal of the C * -algebra of the (2d + 1)-dimensional Heisenberg group. This is a particular case of a more general result for graded nilpotent Lie groups involving symbols in the filtered calculus. The proof presented here however only involves basic functional analysis while still showcasing the ideas of the proof in the general setting.</description>

      <title>On a generalized Monge-Amp\`ere equation on closed almost K\"ahler surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the existence and uniqueness of solutions to a generalized Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation on closed almost K\"ahler surfaces, where the equation depends only on the underlying almost K\"ahler structure. As an application, we prove Donaldson's conjecture for tamed almost complex 4-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Subspaces with or without a common complement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let H be a separable complex Hilbert space. Denote by Gr(H) the Grassmann manifold of H. We study the following sets of pairs of elements in Gr(H):
  Delta={(S,T) in Gr(H) x Gr(H): there exists Z in Gr(H) such that S\dot{+} Z=T \dot{+} Z=H },
  which are pairs of subspaces that have a common complement, and
  Gamma={(S,T) in Gr(H) x Gr(H): (S,T) does not belong to Delta}, Gamma=Gr(H) x Gr(H) - Delta,
  which are pairs of subspaces that do not admit a common complement. We identify S withP_S, the subspace S with the orthogonal projection P_S onto S. Thus we may regard Delta and Gamma as subsets of B(H) x B(H) (here B(H) denotes the algebra of bounded linear operators in H. We show that Delta is open, and its connected components are parametrized by the dimension and codimension of the subspaces. The connected component of Delta having both infinite dimensional and co-dimensional subspaces is dense in the corresponding component of Gr(H) x Gr(H). On the other hand, Gamma is a (closed) C^\infty submanifold of B(H) x B(H), and we characterize the connected components of Gamma in terms of dimensions and semi-Fredholm indices. We study the role played by the geodesic structure of the Grassmann geometry of H in the geometry of both Delta and Gamma. Several examples of pairs in Delta and the connected components of Gamma are given in Hilbert spaces of functions.</description>

      <title>A proof of Gromov's non-squeezing theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The original proof of the Gromov's non-squeezing theorem [Gro85] is based on pseudo-holomorphic curves. The central ingredient is the compactness of the moduli space of pseudo-holomorphic spheres in the symplectic manifold $(\mathbb{CP}^1\times T^{2n-2}, \omega_{\mathrm{FS}}\oplus \omega_{\mathrm{std}})$ representing the homology class $[\mathbb{CP}^1\times\{\operatorname{pt}\}]$. In this article, we give two proofs of this compactness. The fact that the moduli space carries the minimal positive symplectic area is essential to our proofs. The main idea is to reparametrize the curves to distribute the symplectic area evenly and then apply either the mean value inequality for pseudo-holomorphic curves or the Gromov-Schwarz lemma to obtain a uniform bound on the gradient. Our arguments avoid bubbling analysis and Gromov's removable singularity theorem, which makes our proof of Gromov's non-squeezing theorem more elementary.</description>

      <title>A geometric description of some thermodynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show how almost cosymplectic structures are a natural framework to study thermodynamical systems. Indeed, we are able to obtain the same evolution equations obtained previously by Gay-Balmaz and Yoshimura (see Entropy, 21(8):39, 2019) using variational arguments. The proposed geometric description allows us to apply geometrical tools to discuss reduction by symmetries, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation or discretization of these systems.</description>

      <title>Three-manifolds with non-negatively pinched Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.00504v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that every complete non-compact three-manifold with non-negatively pinched Ricci curvature admits a complete Ricci flow solution for all positive time, with scale-invariant curvature decay and preservation of pinching. Combining with recent work of Lott and Deruelle-Schulze-Simon gives a proof of Hamilton's pinching conjecture without additional hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Non-Shrinking Ricci Solitons of cohomogeneity one from quaternionic Hopf fibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00581v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the existence of two 3-parameter families of non-Einstein, non-shrinking Ricci solitons: one on $\mathbb{H}^{m+1}$ and one on $\mathbb{HP}^{m+1}\backslash\{*\}$. Each family includes a continuous 1-parameter subfamily of asymptotically paraboloidal (non-collapsed) steady Ricci solitons, with the Jensen sphere as the base. Additionally, we extend this result by proving the existence of a 2-parameter family on $\mathbb{O}^2$, which contains a 1-parameter subfamily of asymptotically paraboloidal steady Ricci solitons based on the Bourguignon--Karcher sphere.</description>
