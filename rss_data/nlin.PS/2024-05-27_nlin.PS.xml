      <title>Solitons with Self-induced Topological Nonreciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear Schrodinger equation can support solitons, self-interacting states that remain sharply localized and behave as nearly independent objects. Here, we demonstrate the existence of solitons with self-induced nonreciprocal dynamics in a discrete version of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation. This nonreciprocal behavior depends on the soliton's power, indicating an interplay between linear and nonlinear terms in the Hamiltonian. Starting from static stable solitons at high power, the nonreciprocal behavior manifests as the power is lowered first by the appearance of nonreciprocal linear instabilities on static solitons and then by a full self-induced nonreciprocal regime, in which the solitons propagate with unidirectional acceleration and amplification. We show this behavior to be topologically protected by winding numbers on the solitons' mean-field Hamiltonian and their linear stability matrix, revealing an intimate connection between nonlinear, nonreciprocal dynamics and point gap topology in non-Hermitian linear Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>On the Existence of Generalized Breathers and Transition Fronts in Time-Periodic Nonlinear Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of a class of time-localized and space-periodic breathers (called q-gap breathers) in nonlinear lattices with time-periodic coefficients. These q-gap breathers are the counterparts to the classical space-localized and time-periodic breathers found in space-periodic systems. Using normal form transformations, we establish rigorously the existence of such solutions with oscillating tails (in the time domain) that can be made arbitrarily small, but finite. Due to the presence of the oscillating tails, these solutions are coined generalized q-gap breathers. Using a multiple-scale analysis, we also derive a tractable amplitude equation that describes the dynamics of breathers in the limit of small amplitude. In the presence of damping, we demonstrate the existence of transition fronts that connect the trivial state to the time-periodic ones. The analytical results are corroborated by systematic numerical simulations.</description>
