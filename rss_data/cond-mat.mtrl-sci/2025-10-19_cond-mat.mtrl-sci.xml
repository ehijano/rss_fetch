      <title>Incorporating Si into Sb2Se3: Tailoring Optical Phase Change Materials via Nanocomposites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chalcogenide-based optical phase change materials (OPCMs) exhibit a large contrast in refractive index when reversibly switched between their stable amorphous and crystalline states. OPCMs have rapidly gained attention due to their versatility as nonvolatile amplitude or phase modulators in various photonic devices. However, open challenges remain, such as achieving reliable response and transparency spanning into the visible spectrum, a combination of properties in which current broadband OPCMs (e.g., Ge2Sb2Se4Te1, Sb2Se3, or Sb2S3) fall short. Discovering novel materials or engineering existing ones is, therefore, crucial in extending the application scope of OPCMs. Here, we use magnetron co-sputtering to study the effects of Si doping into Sb2Se3. We employ ellipsometry, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and scanning and transmission electron microscopy to investigate the effects of Si doping on the optical properties and crystal structure and compare these results with those from first principles calculations. Moreover, we study the crystallization and melt-quenching of thin films via nano-differential scanning calorimetry (NanoDSC). Our experiments demonstrate that 20% Si doping increases the transparency window in both states, specifically to 800 nm (1.55 eV) in the amorphous phase, while reducing power consumption by lowering the melting temperature. However, this reduction comes at the cost of reducing the refractive index contrast between states and slowing the kinetics of the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Unusual dependence on the angle of magnetic field for the spin Hall magnetoresistance of monodomain epitaxial BiFeO3 thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) measurements provide a way to probe the surface spin structure of insulating magnetic materials. Such measurements produce resistance signals of the form {$\Delta$}R {$\propto$} cos[2($\alpha$-$\alpha$$_0$)], where $\alpha$ is the angle between the current and the external in-plane magnetic field. Previous experiments on a wide range of materials have found $\alpha$$_0$ = 0$\deg$ for ferromagnets and $\alpha$$_0$ = 90$\deg$ for antiferromagnets. Here we investigate SMR in bilayers of Pt with monodomain BiFeO$_3$ multiferroic epitaxial thin films. We observe signals of the form {$\Delta$}R {$\propto$} cos[2($\alpha$-$\alpha$$_0$)] but surprisingly the angle $\alpha$$_0$ can take values very different from 90$\deg$ or 0$\deg$, with large variations from sample to sample. The aim of the paper is to report this striking departure from the expected magnetic field dependence of SMR and to encourage consideration of possible microscopic mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Morphotropic Phase Boundary (MPB) Induced Enhancement of Ferroelectric and Piezoelectric Properties in Li and Ta modified K0.5Na0.5NbO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead-free (K0.48Na0.48Li0.04)(Nb1-xTax)O3 (KNLNT-x) ceramics were synthesized to study the effects of Li and Ta substitution on phase transition behavior, microstructure, and ferroelectric, dielectric, and piezoelectric properties. X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy show that compositions with x &lt; 0.10 exhibit a single orthorhombic (Amm2) phase, while 0.10 &lt;= x &lt;= 0.20 show coexistence of orthorhombic and tetragonal (Amm2 + P4mm) phases. For x &gt; 0.20, a single tetragonal (P4mm) phase is obtained. Microstructural analysis shows a dense ceramic with decreasing grain size as Ta concentration increases. Temperature-dependent dielectric studies reveal two transitions: orthorhombic-tetragonal (TO-T) and tetragonal-cubic (TC). Both transition temperatures decrease systematically with increasing Ta, and TO-T shifts below room temperature for x &gt; 0.15. The composition KNLNT-0.20 exhibits the highest dielectric constant (Er = 556) and piezoelectric coefficient (d33 = 159 pC/N). The enhanced piezoelectric response is attributed to a morphotropic phase boundary rather than a shift of the polymorphic phase boundary temperature. A composition-temperature phase diagram was constructed based on XRD, Raman, and dielectric data.</description>

      <title>Advancing AI-Driven Analysis in X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy: Spectral Domain Mapping and Universal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, rapid progress has been made in developing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods for x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis. Compared to traditional XAS analysis methods, AI/ML approaches offer dramatic improvements in efficiency and help eliminate human bias. To advance this field, we advocate an AI-driven XAS analysis pipeline that features several inter-connected key building blocks: benchmarks, workflows, databases, and AI/ML models. Specifically, we present two case studies for XAS ML. In the first study, we demonstrate the importance of reconciling the discrepancies between simulation and experiment using spectral domain mapping (SDM). Our ML model, which is trained solely on simulated spectra, predicts an incorrect oxidation state trend for Ti atoms in a combinatorial zinc titanate film. After transforming the experimental spectra into a simulation-like representation using SDM, the same model successfully recovers the correct oxidation state trend. In the second study, we explore the development of universal XAS ML models that are trained on the entire periodic table, which enables them to leverage common trends across elements. Looking ahead, we envision that an AI-driven pipeline can unlock the potential of real-time XAS analysis to accelerate scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Development and Validation of 2NN-MEAM Interatomic Potential for Sc and Al-Sc Alloys Thermodynamics Solidification and Intermetallic Ordering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a second-nearest-neighbor Modified Embedded Atom Method (2NN--MEAM) potential for Scandium (Sc) and Aluminum-Scandium (Al--Sc) alloys that unifies cohesive, thermodynamic, and solidification behavior within a single transferable framework. The Sc component accurately reproduces cohesive energy, lattice constants, defect energetics, and the experimental melting point obtained from two-phase coexistence, demonstrating reliable description of both hcp and liquid phases. The Al--Sc binary interaction parameters were fitted using the L1$_2$--Al$_3$Sc reference and benchmarked against first-principles and calorimetric data. The potential reproduces the strong negative formation enthalpy of Al$_3$Sc (--0.45~eV~atom$^{-1}$), correct relative stability of competing phases, and realistic elastic properties. Mixing enthalpies of the liquid alloy agree with ideal-associated-solution and CALPHAD models, confirming that the potential captures exothermic Al--Sc association in the melt. Molecular-dynamics simulations of solidification reveal the expected temperature and composition dependence of homogeneous nucleation. Pure Al crystallizes readily, while Al--1~at.\%~Sc exhibits a longer incubation and slower growth at the same absolute temperature due to reduced undercooling and solute drag. Within the alloy, ordered Al$_3$Sc-type L1$_2$ embryos appear spontaneously, with Sc atoms occupying cube-corner (B) sites surrounded by twelve Al neighbors. Energy--volume trajectories confirm that the potential links thermodynamics to microstructural evolution. Overall, the developed 2NN--MEAM potential provides a quantitatively grounded basis for modeling melting, solidification, and intermetallic ordering in Sc and Al--Sc systems, enabling future multicomponent alloy design and large-scale nucleation studies.</description>

      <title>Enhanced magnetic, electrical, and magnetostrictive properties of La-doped SrCoO3 synthesized by microwave heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report microwave-assisted synthesis and physical properties of La-doped SrCoO3-{\delta}. The Sr0.8La0.2CoO3-{\delta} synthesized via microwave heating (MWH) exhibits superior physical properties compared to a nominally identical composition obtained by conventional heating (CH) in an electrical furnace. The MWH sample exhibits an enhanced ferromagnetic Curie temperature (158 K in CH and 176 K in MWH samples) and higher saturation magnetization but smaller coercive field and magnetoresistance at 10 K compared to the CH sample. While the dc resistivity increases substantially below 120 K in the CH sample, it is metallic from 350 to 10 K in the MWH sample. Further, the longitudinal magnetostriction of the MWH sample ({\lambda}par = 247 ppm for H = 50 kOe) at 10 K is also higher than that of the CH sample ({\lambda}par = 128 ppm). The observed enhanced properties of the MWH sample can not be attributed to grain size and grain boundaries but are likely to arise from lesser oxygen defects and partial oxidation of Co3+ into Co4+, however, the exact mechanism is not fully understood at present.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio study of structural, vibrational and non-linear optical properties of (TiO2)-(Tl2O)-(TeO2) glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports on a systematic first-principles molecular dynamics investigation of binary (TlO$_{0.5}$)$_{y}$-(TeO$_2$)$_{1-y}$ and ternary $(TiO$_{2}$)$_{x}$-(TlO$_{0.5}$)$_{y}$-(TeO$_2$)_{1-x-y}$ tellurite glasses. The obtained structural models are validated against available measured X-ray pair distribution functions. In the binary system, increasing TlO$_{0.5}$ content induces network depolymerization through the reduction of Te coordination number, the substitution of Te-O-Te linkages with Te=O$^{-}$...Tl$^{+}$ units, and the proliferation of non-bridging oxygens. In addition, rings analysis demonstrates a loss of the network connectivity via the opening of small n-membered rings. In contrast, TiO$_2$ acts as a network former in ternary glasses, preserving Te coordination number, and promoting a high fraction of bridging oxygens. Ti atoms induces a network repolymerization that manifests through the formation of smaller Ti-containing n-membered rings thereby balancing the strong effect of Tl$_2$O modifier. Beside the structural analysis, we also computed Raman spectra and non-linear optical properties on the obtained large periodic models. Our results reproduce experimental trends in Raman band shifts with composition, while nonlinear optical calculations show that &lt;$\chi^{(3)}$&gt; remains stable with TlO$_{0.5}$ addition in binary glasses, consistent with experiment. In the case of ternary systems, we find that the inclusion of a small fraction of TiO$_2$ preserves the high optical nonlinearity of the TeO$_2$ network while maintaining the overall network connectivity. These results establish a predictive framework for tailoring the atomic structure and nonlinear optical response of tellurite glasses through the controlled interplay of modifiers nature and concentration.</description>

      <title>Dielectric Deposition Enhanced Crystallization in Atomic-Layer-Deposited Indium Oxide Transistors Achieving High Gated-Hall Mobility Exceeding 100 cm2/Vs at Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we report high-performance atomic-layer-deposited indium oxide (In2O3) transistors with high gated-Hall mobility ({\mu}H) exceeding 100 cm2/Vs at room temperature (RT). It is found that the deposition of top hafnium oxide (HfO2) above the In2O3 channel significantly enhances its crystallization, leading to an average grain size of 97.2 nm in a 4.2-nm In2O3 channel. The ALD of In2O3 exhibits an epitaxy-like growth behavior, with its (222) planes aligning parallel to the (111) planes of both the top and bottom HfO2 dielectrics. As a result, bottom-gate In2O3 transistors with a high {\mu}H of 100.9 cm2/Vs and a decent subthreshold swing (SS) of 94 mV/dec are achieved by gated-Hall measurement at RT. Furthermore, the devices maintain excellent performance at low temperatures, achieving a {\mu}H of 162.2 cm2/Vs at 100 K. Our study reveals the critical role of dielectric deposition induced crystallization in enhancing carrier transport and offers a scalable pathway toward high-mobility devices.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the Catalytic Activity of Dual-Metal Doped N6-Graphene for Sulfur Reduction via Machine Learning-Accelerated First-Principles Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and optimizing polysulfide adsorption and conversion processes are critical to mitigating shuttle effects and sluggish redox kinetics in lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). Here, we introduce a machine-learning-accelerated framework, Precise and Accurate Configuration Evaluation (PACE), that integrates Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) with Density Functional Theory (DFT) to systematically explore adsorption configurations and energetics of a series of N6-coordinated dual-atom catalysts (DACs). Our results demonstrate that, compared with single-atom catalysts, DACs exhibit improved LiPS adsorption and redox conversion through cooperative metal-sulfur interactions and electronic coupling between adjacent metal centers. Among all DACs, Fe-Ni and Fe-Pt show optimal catalytic performance, due to their optimal adsorption energies (-1.0 to -2.3 eV), low free-energy barriers (&lt;=0.4 eV) for the Li2S2 to Li2S conversion, and facile Li2S decomposition barriers (&lt;=1.0 eV). To accelerate catalyst screening, we further developed a machine learning (ML) regression model trained on DFT-calculated data to predict the Gibbs free energy (\Delta G) of Li2Sn adsorption using physically interpretable descriptors. The Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR) model yields an R^2 of 0.85 and an MAE of 0.26 eV, enabling the rapid prediction of \Delta G for unexplored DACs. Electronic-structure analyses reveal that the superior performance originates from the optimal d-band alignment and S-S bond polarization induced by the cooperative effect of dual metal centres. This dual ML-DFT framework demonstrates a generalizable, data-driven design strategy for the rational discovery of efficient catalysts for next-generation LSBs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermally induced antiphase boundaries (APBs) in ferromagnetic, ordered Ni-Mn-Ga single crystal exhibit complex, irregular shapes and closed loops without any lattice plane preferences. The APBs were visualized on polished (100) surface using magnetic force microscopy (MFM) at the same location in parent cubic austenite and monoclinic martensite with uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. Based on ab-initio calculation we suggest that one APB curve with dark and light contrast consists of a pair of APB interfaces with narrow, only one-layer thick, core with structural partial B2' order in contrast to full L21 order of bulk. Calculated magnetic contrast using magnetostatic continuum simulations agrees well with MFM observation.</description>

      <title>Synergistic modulation of band structure and phonon transport for higher thermoelectric performance of WSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tungsten diselenide (WSe2) emerges as a promising thermoelectric (TE) candidate due to its high thermopower (S), cost-effectiveness, and environmentally friendly characteristics. However, pristine WSe2 exhibits limited electrical conductivity (sigma), a low power factor (PF), and high lattice thermal conductivity (k_L), which restrict its overall TE performance. Here, we show that through co-doping of Nb for W and Te for Se in WSe2, its power factor increases 17-fold, reaching 8.91 microW cm^-1 K^-2 at 850 K. Simultaneously, its lattice thermal conductivity (k_L) decreases from 1.70 W m^-1 K^-1 to 0.48 W m^-1 K^-1. Experiments and density functional theory (DFT) analysis demonstrate that the enhancement of PF is linked to an increased density of states, higher effective mass (md*), improved mobility (mu), and elevated electrical conductivity (sigma) owing to the replacement of Se2- with Te2-; while the observed 72% reduction in k_L results primarily from phonon scattering at Te-Se and Nb-W defects. As a result, a remarkable ZT_max ~ 1 is obtained at 850 K for the sample W0.95Nb0.05Se2-yTey with y = 0.3, which is about a 30-fold increase compared to WSe2, proving that Nb and Te co-doping in WSe2 can significantly boost its TE performance.</description>

      <title>CoNi-MOF laccase-like nanozymes prepared by dielectric barrier discharge plasma for treatment of antibiotic pollution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laccase is a natural green catalyst and utilized in pollution treatment. Nevertheless, its practical application is constrained by limitations including high cost, poor stability, and difficulties in recovery. Herein, with inspiration from catalytic mechanism of natural laccase, we designed and prepared a bimetallic metal-organic framework, namely, CoNi-MOF, using low-temperature plasma (LTP) technology. We employed dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma to prepare CoNi-MOF, and by precisely modulating the N2/O2 gas ratio, we could modulate the distribution concentration of oxygen vacancies in CoNi-MOF. Experimental investigations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidated that the critical role of the oxygen vacancies in enhancing the laccase-like activity, which promoted the activation of molecular oxygen (O2) for generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Compared to natural laccase, CoNi-MOF exhibited superior catalytic performance in the degradation of antibiotic tetracycline (TC), along with enhanced resistance to harsh environmental conditions, improved stability, and low biotoxicity. Notably, aeration increased the dissolved oxygen (DO) content, further improving the TC degradation efficiency. As such, this study not only proposes a facile and efficient low-temperature plasma technology for synthesizing high-performance laccase-like nanozymes but also provides a promising and environmentally friendly strategy for the remediation of antibiotic contamination in the environment.</description>

Abstract: This article reports a concept of heat-induced topological modifications of non-layered WO 3 followed by successful synthesis of oxygen-vacant more-porous nanosheets with exposed active (002) facet. Experimental measurements and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations have revealed that the photoexcited electrons are found to accumulate preferentially on (002) facet to yield enhanced electron conduction, and consequently, strengthen the reduction potential as active catalytic sites for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Owing to these beneficial properties, the more-porous nanosheets of WO 3 with (002) facet have exhibited superior performance than that of less-porous nanosheets of WO3 with (220) facet and bulk WO3 with (205) facet. This study therefore provides a new understanding of regulating physical, optical, and electronic properties through intricate atomic structure modulation of WO3, and may find widespread application in optoelectronics, sensors, and energy conversion.</description>

      <title>A finite-element Delta-Sternheimer approach for accurate all-electron RPA correlation energies of arbitrary molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The incompleteness of single-particle basis sets has long cast a shadow over correlated electronic-structure methods, making it highly challenging to obtain numerically converged results. In this work, we compute the RPA correlation energies of general molecules using the finite element method, while ingeniously combining atomic orbital basis sets to accelerate the convergence of total energies. We report atomization energies for 50 molecules within the RPA framework, achieving accuracies on the order of meV per atom. The computational strategy that integrates real-space discretization techniques with atomic orbitals is expected to inspire the entire correlated electronic-structure community.</description>

      <title>Visualizing anomalous exciton diffusion dynamics in TMDCs using transient scattering microscopy: the role of trap states and Auger recombination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on energy transport has advanced in recent years with the emergence of transient microscopy techniques that allow for imaging of carriers with high spatial and temporal resolution. In this context, transient scattering microscopy (TScM), has emerged as an alternative to traditional techniques. However, the sensitivity of TScM to different carriers can complicate the interpretation of results, highlighting the need to develop models tailored to TScM. Here, TScM is used to visualize exciton transport in bulk TMDCs. We show that exciton populations exhibit non-Gaussian profiles by analyzing the their excess kurtosis. Numerical simulations incorporating anomalous diffusion -such as Auger recombination and trap states- reproduce these experimental observations. Furthermore, by tuning the injected carrier density, we demonstrate that the temporal signature of the kurtosis is distinct for Auger-dominated and trap-dominated regimes. Additionally, we find that traditional Gaussian-fitting methods can yield inconsistent results for the extracted diffusivities. As an alternative, we implement a discrete variable calculation which yields robust, consistent diffusivity values. Our results establish kurtosis as a vital diagnostic parameter for identifying anomolous diffusion and demonstrate the necessity of moving beyond Gaussian approximations for accurate analysis of TScM data.</description>

      <title>Surface diffusion of phosphorus on Si(100) after PBr3 adsorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phosphorus diffusion on a Si(100) surface was studied using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) at temperatures of 77 and 300 K. The phosphorus source utilized was the PBr$_3$ molecule, which fully dissociates on the surface at 77 K. We observed diffusion of P atoms both along and across the rows of Si dimers. To support the observation of different diffusion pathways of phosphorus, activation energy calculations were performed using density functional theory. At 77 K, phosphorus diffusion started and (or) finished mostly in bridge positions. At 300 K, phosphorus diffuses predominantly between end-bridge positions, accompanied by bromine diffusion. The presence of Br near phosphorus significantly restricts its mobility. Additionally, phosphorus was found to diffuse to an oxygen atom that appeared on the surface as a result of water adsorption. This diffusion occurs because the P site near the oxidized dimer is more stable compared to that on the clean surface. The obtained results complement the knowledge about the interaction of phosphorus with the silicon surface, specifically the phosphorus diffusion pathways on the Si(100) surface.</description>

      <title>Calculations of pathways of precise P incorporation into chlorinated Si(100) surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise incorporation of a phosphorus atom into a silicon surface is essential for the fabrication of nanoelectronic devices in which the active area is formed from single impurities. The most accurate approach employs scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) lithography, which may be done with atomic precision. However, the accuracy decreases when phosphorus is incorporated into the surface because P substitutes one of two neighboring Si atoms with equal probability. Here, the P-Si exchange mechanism was studied theoretically on a chlorinated Si(100) surface with an asymmetric configuration of Cl vacancies surrounding the P atom. Density functional theory was used to estimate the activation barriers and exchange rates between a P atom and neighboring Si atoms on a Si(100)-2$\times$1-Cl surface with three Cl vacancies. The calculation of various P-Si exchange pathways revealed that phosphorus has a higher probability of substituting one Si atom than the others due to the asymmetric configuration of Cl vacancies. Based on the theoretical study of the P-Si exchange mechanism and experimental results from previous works, a scheme for controlled P incorporation into the silicon surface without uncertainty is proposed.</description>

      <title>Transitions between positive and negative charge states of dangling bonds on a halogenated Si(100) surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dangling bonds (DBs) are common defects in silicon that affect its electronic performance by trapping carriers at the in-gap levels. For probing the electrical properties of individual DBs, a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) is an effective instrument. Here we study transitions between charge states of a single DB on chlorinated and brominated Si(100)-2$\times$1 surfaces in an STM. We observed transitions between positively and negatively charged states of the DB, without the participation of the neutral state. We demonstrated that the $(+/-)$ transition occurs when the DB and substrate states are out of equilibrium. This transition is related to the charge neutrality level (CNL), which indicates a change in the DB's character from donor-like to acceptor-like. The STM voltage at which the $(+/-)$ transition took place varied depending to the electrostatic environment of the DB. Our results complement the understanding of the electronic properties of the DBs, and they should be taken into account in applications that use charge manipulation on the DBs.</description>

      <title>Specimen preparation for atom probe tomography analysis of complex multifunctional nanoparticles and nanostructures: state-of-the-art and challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atom probe tomography (APT) provides the three-dimensional composition of materials at near-atomic length scales, achieving detection limits in the range of tens of atomic parts-per-million regardless of element type. APT requires the specimen to be shaped as a needle with a tip radius of ~100 nm. The development of site-specific lift-out procedures using focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) has enabled APT analysis of multifunctional materials, advancing our understanding of their structure-composition-property relationships. Yet these approaches are not readily suitable for analyzing many nanomaterials. Co-electrodeposition of metallic films forms a composite containing the nanomaterials of interest, thereby facilitating APT specimen preparation and enabling analysis of nanowires, nanosheets, and nano- and microparticles, etc. In this perspective article, we showcase diverse examples from simple elementary to compositionally complex alloys of varying dimensionalities, from individual nanoparticles to aerogel structures. We emphasize the challenges encountered with specific material classes during co-electrodeposition procedures and provide recommendations for improving specimen preparation protocols to enhance measurement yield, thereby advancing APT analysis capabilities for optimizing the performance of functional nanomaterials.</description>

Abstract: The silicon-hydrogen system is of key interest for solar-cell devices, including both crystalline and amorphous modifications. Elemental amorphous Si is now well understood, but the atomic-scale effects of hydrogenating the silicon matrix remain to be fully explored. Here, we present a machine-learned interatomic potential model based on the atomic cluster expansion (ACE) framework that can describe a wide range of Si-H phases, from crystalline and amorphous bulk structures to surfaces and molecules. We perform numerical and physical validation across a range of hydrogen concentrations and compare our results to experimental findings. Our work constitutes an advancement toward the exploration of large structural models of a-Si:H at realistic device scales.</description>

      <title>Atomically-resolved exciton emission from single defects in MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how atomic defects shape the nanoscale optical properties of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors is essential for advancing quantum technologies and optoelectronics. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) and luminescence (STML), we correlate the atomic structure and optical fingerprints of individual defects in monolayer MoS$_2$. A bilayer of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) effectively decouples MoS$_2$ from the graphene substrate, increasing its band gap and extending the defect charge state lifetime. This enables the observation of sharp STML emission lines from MoS$_2$ excitons and trions exhibiting nanoscale sensitivity to local potential fluctuations. We identify the optical signatures of common point defects in MoS$_2$: sulfur vacancies (Vac$_\text{S}^-$), oxygen substitutions (O$_\text{S}$), and negatively charged carbon-hydrogen complexes (CH$_\text{S}^-$). While Vac$_\text{S}^-$ and O$_\text{S}$ only suppress pristine excitonic emission, CH$_\text{S}^-$ generate defect-bound exciton complexes ($A^-X$) about 200\,meV below the MoS$_2$ exciton. Sub-nanometer-resolved STML maps reveal large spectral shifts near charged defects, concurrent with the local band bending expected for band-to-defect optical transitions. These results establish an atomically precise correlation between structure, electronic states, and optical response, enabling deterministic engineering of quantum emitters in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Multiferrons: lattice excitations with finite polarization and magnetization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferrons are a type of quasiparticle corresponding to elementary excitations of the ferroelectric order. Analogously to how magnons modulate and transport magnetization, ferrons modulate and transport electric polarization. Here, we introduce multiferrons as elementary excitations with both electric and magnetic character. Multiferrons lead to a tilt and elliptical precession of the polarization and at the same time create a magnetization through the mechanism of dynamical multiferroicity. Using first-principles calculations for LiNbO$_3$, we show that the electric polarization of multiferrons is perpendicular to the equilibrium ferroelectric polarization, whereas the magnetization is parallel to it. Our calculations further demonstrate that multiferrons carry net electric and magnetic quadrupole and octupole moments, which we term multipolons. These multipolons could couple to internal multipolar degrees of freedom, for example in altermagnets, or to external probes such as neutrons, leading to potentially experimentally observable phenomena following coherent or thermal excitation of multiferrons.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Modeling of Abnormal Grain Growth: Role of Solute Segregation and Grain Boundary Character</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abnormal grain growth (AGG) influences the properties of polycrystalline materials; however, the underlying mechanisms, particularly the role of solute segregation at the grain boundary (GB), are difficult to quantify precisely. This study demonstrates a multiscale framework that integrates atomic-scale segregation energetics (using density functional theory) with mesoscale grain growth dynamics (using phase-field model) to investigate AGG, using $\alpha$-Fe as an example system. Multisite segregation energies are calculated for symmetric tilt grain boundaries (STGBs) along the $\langle 110 \rangle$ axis for nine different solutes (Co, Cr, Mn, Mo, Nb, Ni, Ti, W, and V), encompassing three different types of coincident site lattice (CSL) boundaries: $\sum 3 (11\bar{2})$, $\sum 9 (\bar{2}21)$, and $\sum 3 (\bar{1}11)$. The model takes into account the effect of solute drag on GB mobility, estimated using a bulk solute concentration of 0.1 at\%. The results demonstrate that AGG originates due to GB anisotropy, the extent of which largely depends on the type of solute atom present. Such a complex dependence necessitates using a multiscale model to understand AGG comprehensively. In general, low-energy $\Sigma 3$ boundaries are found to have higher mobility and show preferential growth for most of the solutes, other than Co. The study reveals how the distribution of GB types significantly influences AGG. When 10-30\% of the GBs are high-mobility type, crown-like morphologies are observed, leading to AGG. These findings underscore the critical role of GB chemistry and crystallography in governing AGG, and the model can be generalized to provide a predictive framework for controlling grain growth through strategic solute design in advanced alloys.</description>

Abstract: This study demonstrates the control of neuronal survival and development using nitrogen-doped ultrananocrystalline diamond (N-UNCD). We highlight the role of N-UNCD in regulating neuronal activity via near-infrared illumination, demonstrating the generation of stable photocurrents that enhance neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth and foster a more active, synchronized neuronal network. Whole transcriptome RNA sequencing reveals that diamond substrates improve cellular-substrate interaction by upregulating extracellular matrix and gap junction-related genes. Our findings underscore the potential of conductive diamond as a robust and biocompatible platform for noninvasive and effective neural tissue engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution spectroscopy allows one to probe weak interactions and to detect subtle phenomena. While such measurements are routinely performed on atoms and molecules in the gas phase, spectroscopy of adsorbed species on surfaces is faced with challenges. As a result, previous studies of surface-adsorbed molecules have fallen short of the ultimate resolution, where the transition linewidth is determined by the lifetime of the excited state. In this work, we conceive a new approach to surface deposition and report on Fourier-limited electronic transitions in single dibenzoterrylenes adsorbed onto the surface of an anthracene crystal. By performing spectroscopy and super-resolution microscopy at liquid helium temperature, we shed light on various properties of the adsorbed molecules. Our experimental results pave the way for a new class of experiments in surface science, where high spatial and spectral resolution can be combined.</description>

Abstract: We apply the correlation matrix Hamiltonian reconstruction technique to the two-dimensional Gutzwiller-projected Fermi sea and {\pi}-flux states on finite-sized square and triangular lattices. Our results indicate no spin Hamiltonian with simple local interaction terms stabilizes such states for finite system sizes. We develop a quantitative assessment of the importance of local interactions to the stabilization of these liquid states. Lastly, we systematically assess arguments for the origin of local terms driving a Gutzwiller-projected ground state.</description>

      <title>Robust Orbital-Selective Flat Bands in Transition-Metal Oxychlorides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat electronic bands, which amplify electron correlations by quenching kinetic energy, provide an ideal foundation for exotic quantum phases. However, prevailing strategies -- including geometrically frustrated lattices, moire superlattices and heavy-fermion physics -- suffer from inherent trade-offs among robustness, tunability and orbital selectivity, limiting their broad applicability. Here, we unveil an intrinsic orbital-selective flat-band mechanism in the van der Waals materials NbOCl2 and TaOCl2, directly observed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and understood through density functional theory (DFT) and Wannier analysis. Crucially, we experimentally demonstrate that this momentum-independent flat band exhibits remarkable robustness, surviving from the bulk crystal down to the few-layer limit at room temperature. Our theoretical analysis traces its origin to the hybridization between Nb-dz2 orbital chains and the Lieb-like dx2-y2 sublattice, which is further reinforced by Peierls dimerization. Our findings not only establish transition-metal oxychlorides as a robust and tunable platform for flat-band-driven correlated phases under ambient conditions, but also uncover a new orbital-selective design principle for realizing flat bands in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Visible Imaging of Incoherent 1200-nm Light via Triplet--Triplet Annihilation Upconversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upconversion of low-energy photons to higher-energy photons provides an opportunity to surpass traditional limitations in fields such as 3D printing, photovoltaics, and photocatalysis. Triplet--triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) is particularly appealing for such applications as it can efficiently upconvert low-intensity, incoherent light. However, previously demonstrated thin-film TTA systems are simultaneously constrained by modest efficiencies and limited reach into the near infrared (NIR). Here, we design a single-layer thin-film bulk heterojunction that integrates PbS quantum dots (QDs) as tunable NIR absorbers within an organic semiconductor matrix of TES-ADT, achieving large anti-Stokes shifts up to 500 nm and internal quantum efficiencies that surpass previous reports across the NIR-I and NIR-II windows (800-1200 nm). UC performance is improved 15-fold through the incorporation of 5-tetracene carboxylic acid ligands on the PbS QD surface, which served to increase the yield of sensitized triplets, as confirmed by transient absorption and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements. We demonstrate visible imaging of incoherent 1200 nm light via thin-film TTA-UC at incident intensities at the imaging mask as low as 20 mWcm$^2$, marking a significant advance toward practical implementation of solid-state NIR-to-visible upconversion.</description>

      <title>High-entropy perovskites as new photocatalysts for cocatalyst-free water splitting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The photocatalytic water-splitting process is thermodynamically challenging and requires catalysts with suitable band structures, as well as the presence of supporting cocatalysts. By considering the unique charge carrier mobility in perovskites, this study introduces three new ABO3-type high-entropy perovskites (Ba1/2Sr1/2)(Ti1/3Zr1/3Hf1/3)O3, (Ba1/2Sr1/2)(Ga1/3In1/3Sn1/3)O3 and (Ba1/2Sr1/2)(Ti1/3Zr1/3Sn1/3)O3 for cocatalyst-free photocatalysis. The three catalysts, having a single-phase cubic structure, are designed by considering configurational entropy, tolerance factor, octahedral factor, ionic radius deviation and valence deviation of &gt;1.5R (R: gas constant), 0.9-1.0, 0.4-0.8, &gt;0.3 and &gt;0.3, respectively. The perovskites exhibit similar valence band tops, while their bandgaps vary slightly depending on the composition at the B-site (slightly lower bandgap by including d10 cations). Additionally, all three materials demonstrate effective hydrogen generation without the need for added cocatalysts. This investigation confirms that high-entropy oxide perovskites can offer significant potential for cocatalyst-free photocatalytic reactions.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism induced surface Chern insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new pathway to the quantized anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) by coupling an altermagnet to a topological crystalline insulator (TCI). The former gaps the topological surface states of the TCI, thereby realizing the QAHE in a robust and switchable platform with near- vanishing magnetization. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by studying a slab of the TCI SnTe coupled to an altermagnetic RuO2 layer. Our first-principles calculations reveal that the d-wave altermagnetism in RuO2 induces a 7 meV gap to the Dirac surface states on the (110) surface of SnTe, producing a finite anomalous Hall effect. Our approach generalizes to broader classes of altermagnetic materials and TCIs, thereby providing a family of topological altermagnetic heterostructures with small or vanishing magnetization that support nontrivial Chern numbers. Our results highlight a promising new topological platform with great tunability and applications to spintronics.</description>

      <title>Friction-controlled reentrant aging and fluidization in granular materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Granular materials densify under repeated mechanical perturbations, a nonequilibrium dynamics that underlies many natural and industrial processes. Because granular relaxation is governed by frictional contacts and energy dissipation, this aging behavior fundamentally differs from that of thermal glasses despite their apparent similarities. Here, we uncover how friction controls the compaction dynamics of granular packings subjected to cyclic shear. Using discrete element simulations, we construct a dynamic state diagram as a function of strain amplitude and friction, revealing a rich interplay between jamming marginality, stabilization, and fluidization. We identify a friction-dependent crossover strain that separates aging and fluidized regimes, showing reentrant, non-monotonic behavior: Increasing friction first suppresses fluidization, then promotes it through smooth, creep-like rearrangements. This transition is marked by a shift from intermittent, avalanche-like rearrangements to continuous, diffusive motion. Our findings demonstrate that friction exerts a dual role in granular aging -- both stabilizing and fluidizing -- thereby uncovering the fundamental nonequilibrium mechanisms that govern compaction, rheology, and aging in athermal disordered systems. More broadly, our results reveal a general principle for how friction governs metastability and flow in athermal matter -- from granular and frictional colloids to soils and seismic faults -- linking microscopic contact mechanics to macroscopic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable Josephson diodes in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report low-temperature measurements of two adjacent, gate-defined Josephson junctions (JJs) in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) at a moir\'e filling factor near $\nu = -2$. We show that both junctions exhibit a prominent, gate-tunable Josephson diode effect, which we explain by a combination of large kinetic inductance and non-uniform supercurrent distribution. Despite their proximity, the JJs display differences in their interference patterns and different diode behavior, underscoring that microscopic inhomogeneities such as twist angle variations shape the non-uniform supercurrent and drive the diode behavior. As a result, the nonreciprocal supercurrent can be tuned by gate voltage, enabling tuning of the diode efficiency and even reversing the polarity at fixed magnetic fields. Our findings offer potential routes for tailoring Josephson diode performance in superconducting quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>A Gauss-Bonnet Theorem for Quantum States: Gauss Curvature and Topology in the Projective Hilbert Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometry and topology are fundamental to modern condensed matter physics, but their precise connection in quantum systems remains incompletely understood. Here, we develop an analytical scheme for calculating the curvature of the quantum metric of Bloch bands. Using a gauge-invariant formulation based on eigenprojectors, we construct the full Riemannian geometry of the quantum-state manifold and apply it to a two-dimensional two-band model. We find that the Gauss curvature is constant over regular regions, but the manifold inevitably develops a closed curve of singular points where the metric tensor degenerates. These singularities obstruct the conventional Gauss-Bonnet theorem. By introducing the notion of a front and a signed area form, we derive a generalized Gauss-Bonnet relation that includes a singular curvature term defined along the fold curve. This result establishes a direct, quantized link between the total signed Gauss curvature and the Chern number, providing a unified geometric interpretation of Berry curvature and quantum metric. This framework bridges differential geometry and topological band theory, revealing how singular folds mediate the discrepancy between quantum volume and topological charge.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-forbidden intraband transitions leading to ultralow Gilbert damping in van der Waals ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12544v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based upon first-principles calculations, we report ultralow Gilbert damping in two-dimensional (2D) van derWaals (vdW) ferromagnets. The low damping occurs at weak scattering because mirror symmetry prohibits intraband transitions. The monotonic dependence on the electronic scattering rate suggests the absent lower limit, in contrast to conventional ferromagnetic materials. Breaking mirror symmetry through magnetization rotation, layer stacking, or structural phase transition significantly increases damping by enabling intraband transitions. Topological nodal lines, also protected by mirror symmetry, contribute substantially to interband-transition-mediated damping, which can be tuned by adjusting the Fermi level. Our findings elucidate the unique characteristics of Gilbert damping in 2D vdW ferromagnets, providing valuable insights for designing low-dimensional spintronic devices with high energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Prediction of ideal orientations in velocity gradient-driven processes for large plastic deformations of crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We focus on the crystal lattice ideal orientations, also referred to as preferred or attractor orientations, in crystalline materials, and how they can be used to predict the final texture of polycrystals after manufacturing processes. The simplified crystal plasticity (CP) models used here capture the main features of microstructural evolution in monocrystalline and polycrystalline materials undergoing velocity-gradient-driven processes, without considering hardening or softening effects. The evolution of the lattice orientation is described by a nonlinear ordinary differential equation, and a linear stability analysis is performed to identify the permanent orientations that act as attractors (i.e., the ideal or preferred orientations). Although our linear stability analysis is generally applicable, it is detailed using a simplified two-dimensional model with three slip systems. This approach successfully predicts lattice orientation attractors for large strains by analyzing the interplay between deformation and rotation, initial orientation, and the interaction between different slip systems under applied loads. Three fundamental problems in CP illustrate the effectiveness of the theory: polycrystal deformation under homogeneous velocity gradient loading, void evolution under radial loading, and slip band formation in a monocrystal. High-resolution CP numerical simulations, enhanced using re-meshing techniques, provide further validation of our findings concerning the impact of initial crystallographic orientations, deformation mechanisms, and loading conditions on the evolution of orientation attractors and the final crystal texture.</description>

      <title>Explainable Machine Learning for Oxygen Diffusion in Perovskites and Pyrochlores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explainable machine learning can help to discover new physical relationships for material properties. To understand the material properties that govern the activation energy for oxygen diffusion in perovskites and pyrochlores, we build a database of experimental activation energies and apply a grouping algorithm to the material property features. These features are then used to fit seven different machine learning models. An ensemble consensus determines that the most important features for predicting the activation energy are the ionicity of the A-site bond and the partial pressure of oxygen for perovskites. For pyrochlores, the two most important features are the A-site $s$ valence electron count and the B-site electronegativity. The most important features are all constructed using the weighted averages of elemental metal properties, despite weighted averages of the constituent binary oxides being included in our feature set. This is surprising because the material properties of the constituent oxides are more similar to the experimentally measured properties of perovskites and pyrochlores than the features of the metals that are chosen. The easy-to-measure features identified in this work enable rapid screening for new materials with fast oxide-ion diffusivity.</description>

Abstract: We present a first principles investigation of strain-driven vacancy clustering in aluminum. Specifically, we perform Kohn-Sham density functional theory calculations to study the influence of hydrostatic strains on clustering in tri-, quad-, and heptavacancies. We find that compressive strains are a key driving force for vacancy aggregation, particularly for collapse of clusters on the (111) plane, consistent with prior experimental observations of vacancy clusters on this plane. Notably, we find that the heptavacancy on the (111) plane collapses to form a prismatic dislocation loop for hydrostatic compressive strains exceeding 5\%, highlighting the critical role of such strains in prismatic dislocation loop nucleation in aluminum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conflicting experiments disagree on whether the titanium-vanadium (Ti-V) binary alloy exhibits a body-centred cubic (BCC) miscibility gap or remains completely soluble. A leading hypothesis attributes the miscibility gap to oxygen contamination during alloy preparation. To resolve this disagreement, we use an ab initio + machine-learning workflow that couples an actively-trained Moment Tensor Potential with Bayesian inference of free energy surface. This workflow enables construction of the Ti-V phase diagram across the full composition range with systematically reduced statistical and finite-size errors. The resulting diagram reproduces all experimental features, demonstrating the robustness of our approach, and clearly favors the variant with a BCC miscibility gap terminating at T = 980 K and c = 0.67. Because our simulations model a perfectly oxygen-free Ti-V system, the observed gap cannot originate from impurity effects, in contrast to recent CALPHAD reassessments.</description>

      <title>Interface Structure and Electronic Properties in Cubic Boron Nitride - Diamond Heterostructures</title>

Abstract: Heterointerfaces of cubic boron nitride (cBN) with diamond have garnered significant interest due to their ultra-wide bandgaps and small lattice mismatch ($\sim1.5$\%), offering promising advancements in high-power and high-frequency electronic devices. However, the realization of this heterointerface has been limited by challenging growth conditions and insufficient understanding of interfacial properties. In this work, we employ density-functional theory to investigate the structural and electronic properties of diamond/cBN heterostructures as a function of interfacial stoichiometry, cBN thickness, and surface termination and passivation. Formation energies and interfacial bond lengths reveal that boron-terminated heterojunctions are the most stable while abrupt nitrogen-terminated heterojunctions are least stable, but can be stabilized by carbon-mixing. Bandstructures are computed for the heterostructures using hybrid functionals, where we find the abrupt boron-terminated and nitrogen-terminated heterojunctions exhibit $p$-type and $n$-type conductivity, respectively, while carbon-mixed heterojunctions retain wide insulating bandgaps ($4.2-4.4$ eV). The effective masses of the abrupt interfaces are found to vary strongly with stoichiometry. Intriguingly, charge analysis reveals two-dimensional electron or hole gas regions with ultra-high densities on the order of $10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$, with distinct spatial localization on either side of the interface. Band alignments show type-I and type-II band offsets tunable by interfacial composition. Further analysis of the band alignments reveals that the diamond valence bands consistently lie above the cBN valence bands by $0.25-2.1$ eV. Interestingly, the interface termination type switches the relative conduction band position of diamond relative to the cBN conduction band, exhibiting a type-I to type-II band alignment transition...</description>

      <title>Ab-initio heat transport in defect-laden quasi-1D systems from a symmetry-adapted perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to their aspect ratio and wide range of thermal conductivities, nanotubes hold significant promise as heat-management nanocomponents. Their practical use is, however, often limited by thermal resistance introduced by structural defects or material interfaces. An intriguing question is the role that structural symmetry plays in thermal transport through those defect-laden sections. To address this, we develop a framework that combines representation theory with the mode-resolved Green's function method, enabling a detailed, symmetry-resolved analysis of phonon transmission through defected segments of quasi-1D systems. To avoid artifacts inherent to formalisms developed for bulk 3D systems, we base our analysis on line groups, the appropriate description of the symmetries of quasi-1D structures. This categorization introduces additional quantum numbers that partition the phonon branches into smaller, symmetry-distinct subsets, enabling clearer mode classification. We employ an Allegro-based machine learning potential to obtain the force constants and phonons with near-ab-initio accuracy. We calculate detailed phonon transmission profiles for single- and multi-layer MoS$_\mathrm{2}$-WS$_\mathrm{2}$ nanotubes and connect the transmission probability of each mode to structural symmetry. Surprisingly, we find that pronounced symmetry breaking can suppress scattering by relaxing selection rules and opening additional transmission channels. Molecular dynamics shows that the behavior persists even when anharmonicity is considered. The fact that higher disorder introduced through defects can enhance thermal transport, and not just suppress it, demonstrates the critical role of symmetry in deciphering the nuances of nanoscale thermal transport.</description>

Abstract: Point defects for quantum technologies is an emerging research area, with the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond at the forefront. However, how rare are defects with NV-like properties? In this perspective, I highlight the results of NV-like defects across 33 different materials, revealing that they are more common than finding four-leaf clovers. I also discuss expanding the search criteria to identify other defects relevant to quantum technologies. Utilizing point defect databases will be instrumental in assisting researchers in discovering previously unexplored defects suitable for quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Correlation Matrix Method for Phonon Quasiparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05960v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phonon anharmonicity is ubiquitous in real materials and is crucial for understanding thermal properties and phase stability. In this work, we show that anharmonic phonon modes can be obtained by maximizing their vibration stability during fitting the atomic trajectory. We prove that all information about these quasiparticles is contained in two small correlation matrices $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$, which can be constructed directly from molecular dynamics simulations. Based on these matrices, we proposed an optimization scheme, which allows us to efficiently determine temperature-dependent phonon modes along with their frequencies and lifetimes. We verified this method by applying it to silicon and cubic CaSiO$_3$, where it successfully captured their temperature-dependent phonon behaviors and the well-known phonon softening in cubic CaSiO$_3$. This theory provides a convenient tool for investigating phonon quasiparticles and can be extended to study other quasiparticles, such as electrons, holes, and magnons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sliding ferroelectrics, which exhibit out-of-plane polarization arising from specific stacking rather than conventional ionic displacements, are new types of ferroelectrics whose underdeveloped physics needs to be explored. Here, we investigate the electro-optic (EO) response of these materials using first-principles calculations, focusing on ZrI$_{2}$ as a prototype. We reveal that, contrary to conventional ferroelectrics, the EO effect in ZrI$_{2}$ is dominated by its electronic contribution rather than the ionic one, which promises faster EO responses. Furthermore, both biaxial and uniaxial strains significantly enhance this response, and a universal-like linear relationship between the band gap and such response is discovered. We also report a large elasto-optic coefficient that is independent of biaxial strain. Similar large linear EO coefficients and properties are found in other sliding ferroelectrics, including different zirconium dihalides, as well as BN and BP bilayers. These findings highlight sliding ferroelectrics as highly promising candidates for ultrafast nonlinear optical devices and reveal unusual mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Uniaxial Magnetic Anisotropy and Type-X/Y Current-Induced Magnetization Switching in Oblique-Angle-Deposited Ta/CoFeB/Pt and W/CoFeB/Pt Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planar current-induced magnetization switching (CIMS) driven by spin-orbit torque (SOT) requires an in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy (UMA), which can be induced by oblique-angle sputter deposition of the heavy-metal underlayer in heavy-metal/ferromagnet heterostructures. To enhance the SOT efficiency, we employ trilayer heterostructures of (Ta or W)/CoFeB/Pt, where the CoFeB layer exhibits a UMA of 50 mT at 2 nm thickness of Ta or W. The magnetization reversal in Hall-bar devices is detected through unidirectional spin Hall magnetoresistance (USMR) for the type Y geometry (easy-axis transverse to current) and planar Hall measurements for the type X geometry (easy-axis parallel to current). Both configurations exhibit CIMS with sub-microsecond current pulses, reaching switching current densities as low as $2 \times 10^{11}$ A/m$^2$ for a W (4 nm)/CoFeB (1.4 nm)/Pt (2 nm) stack with a UMA of 146 mT. Macrospin simulations reproduce the type Y switching as coherent magnetization rotation, whereas the type X devices switch at much lower currents than predicted, indicating that nucleation and domain-wall propagation dominate reversal in this geometry. Our results show that combining oblique-angle deposition with easy-axis engineering enables deterministic, field-free switching, paving the way for future low-power spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian and Liouvillian skin effects in magnetic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15792v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) has emerged as a hallmark of non-Hermitian physics, with far-reaching implications for transport, topology, and sensing. While recent works have uncovered the NHSE in magnetic systems, these analyses rely on effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, thereby leaving open critical questions regarding their applicability and predictive power in experimentally feasible platforms. Here, we address this gap by exploring both the non-Hermitian and Liouvillian dynamics of a spin chain coupled to a shared bosonic reservoir. We identify the parameter regime in which these frameworks yield congruent predictions, while showing that the non-Hermitian approach fails to capture essential dynamical features -- such as relevant timescales and conditions for experimental observability. Our analysis also reveals that the NHSE stems from the interplay between chiral spin couplings and reciprocal nonlocal dissipation -- two interactions that can naturally occur in magnetic crystals and be easily engineered in magnetic heterostructures. Focusing on a concrete example of such heterostructures, we establish an explicit connection between their Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) dynamics and our microscopic model, providing a tangible route toward realizing the NHSE in an experimentally relevant spintronics setup.</description>

      <title>Silicon nanoantennas for tailoring the optical properties of MoS2 monolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Silicon-based dielectric nanoantennas provide an effective platform for engineering light-matter interactions in van der Waals semiconductors. Here, we demonstrate near-field coupling between monolayer MoS2 and silicon nanoantennas arranged in hexagonal lattices with tunable geometric parameters, leading to a three-fold enhancement in photoluminescence and an excitation-wavelength-dependent emission that aligns with Mie-resonant modes. Raman spectroscopy reveals an up to 8-fold enhancement in the vibrational modes of MoS2, while second-harmonic generation exhibits a 20 to 30-fold increase in efficiency, closely correlating with the presence of the underlying nanoantennas. Our experiments and simulations quantify the tunable benefits of the near-field interactions, taking into account thin-film interference and strain-induced effects. Our findings present dielectric nanoantennas as a promising platform for tailoring linear and nonlinear optical properties in 2D materials, with potential applications in nanophotonic devices and integrated photonics.</description>

      <title>Multi-angle precession electron diffraction (MAPED): a versatile approach to 4D-STEM precession</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precession of a converged beam during acquisition of a 4D-STEM dataset improves strain, orientation, and phase mapping accuracy by averaging over continuous angles of illumination. Precession experiments usually rely on integrated systems, where automatic alignments lead to fast, high-quality results. The dependence of these experiments on specific hardware and software is evident even when switching to non-integrated detectors on a precession tool, as experimental set-up becomes challenging and time-consuming. Here, we introduce multi-angle precession electron diffraction (MAPED): a method to perform electron diffraction by collecting sequential 4D-STEM scans at different incident beam tilts. The multiple diffraction datasets are averaged together post-acquisition, resulting in a single dataset that minimizes the impact of the curvature and orientation of the Ewald sphere relative to the crystal under study. Our results demonstrate that even four additional tilts improved measurement of material properties, namely strain and orientation, as compared to single-tilt 4D-STEM experiments. We show the versatility and flexibility of our MAPED approach with data collected on a number of microscopes with different hardware configurations and a variety of detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an accurate and efficient framework for real-space Hubbard-corrected density functional theory. In particular, we obtain expressions for the energy, atomic forces, and stress tensor suitable for real-space finite-difference discretization, and develop a large-scale parallel implementation. We verify the accuracy of the formalism through comparisons with established planewave results. We demonstrate that the implementation is highly efficient and scalable, outperforming established planewave codes by more than an order of magnitude in minimum time to solution, with increasing advantages as the system size and/or number of processors is increased. We apply this framework to examine the impact of exchange-correlation inconsistency in local atomic orbital generation and introduce a scheme for optimizing the Hubbard parameter based on hybrid functionals, both while studying TiO$_2$ polymorphs.</description>

      <title>LeMat-Traj: A Scalable and Unified Dataset of Materials Trajectories for Atomistic Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) is limited by the fragmented availability and inconsistent formatting of quantum mechanical trajectory datasets derived from Density Functional Theory (DFT). These datasets are expensive to generate yet difficult to combine due to variations in format, metadata, and accessibility. To address this, we introduce LeMat-Traj, a curated dataset comprising over 120 million atomic configurations aggregated from large-scale repositories, including the Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. LeMat-Traj standardizes data representation, harmonizes results and filters for high-quality configurations across widely used DFT functionals (PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN). It significantly lowers the barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs. LeMat-Traj spans both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy, high-force structures, complementing molecular dynamics and active learning datasets. By fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also present LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library developed for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the community to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued evolution of large-scale materials datasets. LeMat-Traj and LeMaterial-Fetcher are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/LeMaterial/LeMat-Traj and https://github.com/LeMaterial/lematerial-fetcher.</description>

      <title>Migration as a Probe: A Generalizable Benchmark Framework for Specialist vs. Generalist Machine-Learned Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine-learned force fields (MLFFs), especially pre-trained foundation models, are transforming computational materials science by enabling ab initio-level accuracy at molecular dynamics scales. Yet their rapid rise raises a key question: should researchers train specialist models from scratch, fine-tune generalist foundation models, or use hybrid approaches? The trade-offs in data efficiency, accuracy, cost, and robustness to out-of-distribution failure remain unclear. We introduce a benchmarking framework using defect migration pathways, evaluated through nudged elastic band trajectories, as diagnostic probes that test both interpolation and extrapolation. Using Cr-doped Sb2Te3 as a representative two-dimensional material, we benchmark multiple training paradigms within the MACE architecture across equilibrium, kinetic (atomic migration), and mechanical (interlayer sliding) tasks. Fine-tuned models substantially outperform from-scratch and zero-shot approaches for kinetic properties but show partial loss of long-range physics. Representational analysis reveals distinct, non-overlapping latent encodings, indicating that different training strategies learn different aspects of system physics. This framework provides practical guidelines for MLFF development and establishes migration-based probes as efficient diagnostics linking performance to learned representations, guiding future uncertainty-aware active learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising approach to improve correctness in LLMs, however, in many scientific problems, the objective is not necessarily to produce the correct answer, but instead to produce a diverse array of candidates which satisfy a set of constraints. We study this challenge in the context of materials generation. To this end, we introduce PLaID++, an LLM post-trained for stable and property-guided crystal generation. We find that performance hinges on our crystallographic representation and reward formulation. First, we introduce a compact, symmetry-informed Wyckoff text representation which improves computational efficiency and encourages generalization from physical priors. Second, we demonstrate that temperature scaling acts as an entropy regularizer which counteracts mode collapse and encourages exploration. By encoding symmetry constraints directly into text and guiding model outputs towards desirable chemical space, PLaID++ generates structures that are thermodynamically stable, unique, and novel at a $\sim$50\% greater rate than prior methods and conditionally generates structures with desired space group properties. Our work demonstrates the potential of adapting post-training techniques from natural language processing to materials design, paving the way for targeted and efficient discovery of novel materials.</description>

Abstract: Spin Seebeck effect refers to the magnonic thermal spin injection from a magnet into the adjacent heavy metal. A ferrimagnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet (YIG) is the material most studied for the spin Seebeck effect. Here, to account for a convex downward temperature dependence of the spin Seebeck effect observed in YIG/Pt system near the Curie temperature $T_{\rm C}$, we develop Ginzburg-Landau theory of the spin Seebeck effect in two-sublattice ferrimagnets. We find that only when we take into account the "N\'{e}el coupling", i.e., interfacial exchange coupling between the N\'{e}el order parameter of YIG and spin accumulation of Pt, the convex downward temperature dependence is explained. The present result sheds light on the importance of the N\'{e}el coupling in ferrimagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>On the discovery of meteoritic mineral Zolenskyite; The artificial origin should not be overlooked</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently a new meteoritic mineral, Zolenskyite (Fe0.99Mn0.04Ca0.01Cr1.99S3.98), was discovered from the Indarch meteorite. Zolenskyite was structurally indexed as the monoclinic C2/m CrNb2Se4 - Cr3S4 type structure of synthetic FeCr2S4, with unit cell parameters a = 12.84(1) {\AA}, b = 3.44(1) {\AA}, c = 5.94(1) {\AA} and \b{eta} = 117(1){\deg}. Zolenskyite was reported as high-pressure phase formed from Daubr\'eelite at high pressures and temperatures in highly shocked regions of the EH parent asteroid. Although this discovery provides valuable information about the origin of meteoritic mineral assemblages, the results and conclusions raise controversies with those reported in previous articles where the synthetic FeCr2S4 was described. In this review, an alternative analysis of the supplementary X-ray data from Zolenskyite was made and yields to the monoclinic I2/m Cr3S4 type structure of synthetic FeCr2S4, with unit cell parameters a = 5.940 {\AA}, b = 3.440 {\AA}, c = 11.441 {\AA} and \b{eta} = 90.55{\deg}, in agreement with previous results in the literature and differ from those reported above. Regarding the genesis of Zolenskyite and according to solid-state laboratory synthesis, the transformation of cubic FeCr2S4 phase (ideal composition of Daubr\'eelite) to monoclinic FeCr2S4 (ideal composition of Zolenskyite) requires a process whose replication in Shock metamorphism stages is not well established and remains an open issue to address, together with another open issue related to the real composition of meteoritic minerals, with minor and trace metals, which is often overlooked when compared with synthetic ideal compositions. Whatever the results to be obtained by addressing the above open issues, they will shed more light on the genesis of Zolenskyite. In this context, it is worth to promote an open debate about the hypothesis of artificial origin.</description>

Abstract: Recent progress in spintronics within the paradigm of altermagnets (AMs) opens new avenues for next-generation electronic device design. Here, we establish a spin-corner locking mechanism that generates second-order topological states in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic systems, through effective model analysis. Remarkably, the breaking of Mxy symmetry under uniaxial strain creates spin-resolved corner modes, driving the system into a corner-polarized second-order topological insulator (CPSOTI). Beyond critical strain, a topological phase transition to quantum anomalous Hall insulator occurs with quantized conductance. Through first-principles calculations, we identify two experimentally viable candidates for 2D intrinsic AM CrO and Cr$_2$Se$_2$O -- which host robust CPSOTI. Moreover, we construct the topological phase diagram of CrO and predict the existence of an altermagnetic Weyl semimetal phase. Our findings open technological avenues in altermagnetism and higher-order topology, while providing opportunities for coupling topological spintronics with cornertronics.</description>
