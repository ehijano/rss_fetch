      <title>Evolutionary mechanisms that promote cooperation may not promote social welfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the emergence of prosocial behaviours among self-interested individuals is an important problem in many scientific disciplines. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the evolution of such behaviours, primarily seeking the conditions under which a given mechanism can induce highest levels of cooperation. As these mechanisms usually involve costs that alter individual payoffs, it is however possible that aiming for highest levels of cooperation might be detrimental for social welfare -- the later broadly defined as the total population payoff, taking into account all costs involved for inducing increased prosocial behaviours. Herein, by comparatively analysing the social welfare and cooperation levels obtained from stochastic evolutionary models of two well-established mechanisms of prosocial behaviour, namely, peer and institutional incentives, we demonstrate exactly that. We show that the objectives of maximising cooperation levels and the objectives of maximising social welfare are often misaligned. We argue for the need of adopting social welfare as the main optimisation objective when designing and implementing evolutionary mechanisms for social and collective goods.</description>

      <title>Design and Financial Analysis of a Health Insurance Based on an SIH-Type Epidemic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a design and financial analysis of a health insurance based on an SIH-type epidemic model. Specifically, we first construct the model in a continuous form, study its dynamical properties, and formulate the financial quantities involved in our insurance. Subsequently, we discretise the model using the forward Euler method, study the dynamical properties of the resulting discrete model, and formulate discrete analogues of the above financial quantities. We conduct a numerical simulation using two sets of parameter values, each representing a disease-free and an endemic scenario, which reveals that in the latter scenario, the insurance's gross premium is higher, the insurer's minimum loss-preventing start-up capital is lower, and the insurer's total profit is higher, compared to the corresponding values in the former scenario. Finally, through a sensitivity analysis, we show that in both scenarios, the disease's basic reproduction number, the gross premium, the minimum start-up capital, and the total profit depend most sensitively on the population's natural death coefficient, the disease's incidence coefficient, the hospitalisation benefit, and the premium surcharge percentage allocated to profit, respectively.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed spectral approximation of Koopman operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Koopman operators and transfer operators represent nonlinear dynamics in state space through its induced action on linear spaces of observables and measures, respectively. This framework enables the use of linear operator theory for supervised and unsupervised learning of nonlinear dynamical systems, and has received considerable interest in recent years. Here, we propose a data-driven technique for spectral approximation of Koopman operators of continuous-time, measure-preserving ergodic systems that is asymptotically consistent and makes direct use of known equations of motion (physics). Our approach is based on a bounded transformation of the Koopman generator (an operator implementing directional derivatives of observables along the dynamical flow), followed by smoothing by a Markov semigroup of kernel integral operators. This results in a skew-adjoint, compact operator whose eigendecomposition is expressible as a variational generalized eigenvalue problem. We develop Galerkin methods to solve this eigenvalue problem and study their asymptotic consistency in the large-data limit. A key aspect of these methods is that they are physics-informed, in the sense of making direct use of dynamical vector field information through automatic differentiation of kernel functions. Solutions of the eigenvalue problem reconstruct evolution operators that preserve unitarity of the underlying Koopman group while spectrally converging to it in a suitable limit. In addition, the computed eigenfunctions have representatives in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, enabling out-of-sample evaluation of learned dynamical features. Numerical experiments performed with this method on integrable and chaotic low-dimensional systems demonstrate its efficacy in extracting dynamically coherent observables under complex dynamics.</description>

      <title>Analytic proof of the emergence of new type of Lorenz-like attractors from the triple instability in systems with $\mathbb{Z}_4$-symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study bifurcations of a symmetric equilibrium state in systems of differential equations invariant with respect to a $\mathbb{Z}_4$-symmetry. We prove that if the equilibrium state has a triple zero eigenvalue, then pseudohyperbolic attractors of different types can arise as a result of the bifurcation. The first type is the classical Lorenz attractor and the second type is the so-called Sim\'o angel. The normal form of the considered bifurcation also serves as the normal form of the bifurcation of a periodic orbit with multipliers $(-1, i, -i)$. Therefore, the results of this paper can also be used to prove the emergence of discrete pseudohyperbolic attractors as a result of this codimension-3 bifurcation, providing a theoretical confirmation for the numerically observed Lorenz-like attractors and Sim\'o angels in the three-dimensional H\'enon map.</description>

      <title>Rigorous Hausdorff dimension estimates for conformal fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a versatile framework which allows us to rigorously estimate the Hausdorff dimension of maximal conformal graph directed Markov systems in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n \geq 2$. Our method is based on piecewise linear approximations of the eigenfunctions of the Perron-Frobenius operator via a finite element framework for discretization and iterative mesh schemes. One key element in our approach is obtaining bounds for the derivatives of these eigenfunctions, which, besides being essential for the implementation of our method, are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of composition operators on spaces of holomorphic functions on plane domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamic behaviour of (weighted) composition operators on the space of holomorphic functions on a plane domain. Any such operator is hypercyclic if and only if it is topologically mixing, and when the symbol is automorphic, such an operator is supercyclic if and only if it is mixing. When the domain is a punctured plane, a composition operator is supercyclic if and only if it satisfies the Frequent Hypercyclity Criterion, and when the domain is conformally equivalent to a punctured disc, such an operator is hypercyclic if and only if it satisfies the Frequent Hypercyclicity Criterion. When the domain is finitely connected and either conformally equivalent to an annulus or having two or more holes, no weighted composition operator can be supercyclic.</description>

      <title>Effects of time-delay couplings in the collective frequency of network oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we construct such systems with the Kuramoto model of globally coupled oscillators with time-delayed positive and negative couplings to explore the impact of coupling time delays in the collective frequency of synchronized oscillations. We discuss various identical and nonidentical systems with fixed and exponential distributed delays and derive relationships between the coupling delay and collective frequency for a stably synchronized state. For the nonidentical system of coupled oscillators, we consider the Lorentzian distribution of intrinsic frequencies and exponential distributions of coupling time delays in coupled oscillators, and analytically derived the collective frequency-time delay relationship. We found that the collective frequency of the network oscillations is dependent on both coupling strength and time delay. In identical cases, the network frequency decreases in most cases of positive coupling and increases in a negative coupling with increasing. In non-identical cases with distributed delays, along with the modulations in the network frequency, we discussed time-delay coupling can also lead to the appearance of bifurcations and transitions in the system's behavior resulting in the emergence of new patterns and the breakdown of existing ones. We discuss the implications of these results in understanding the behaviors of the natural systems.</description>

      <title>Comparison of uncertainty propagation techniques in small-body environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Close-proximity exploration of small celestial bodies is crucial for the comprehensive and accurate characterization of their properties. However, the complex and uncertain dynamical environment around them contributes to a rapid dispersion of uncertainty and the emergence of non-Gaussian distributions. Therefore, to ensure safe operations, a precise understanding of uncertainty propagation becomes imperative. In this work, the dynamical environment is analyzed around two asteroids, Apophis, which will perform a close flyby to Earth in 2029, and Eros, which has been already explored by past missions. The performance of different uncertainty propagation methods (Linear Covariance Propagation, Unscented Transformation, and Polynomial Chaos Expansion) are compared in various scenarios of close-proximity operations around the two asteroids. Findings are discussed in terms of propagation accuracy and computational efficiency depending on the dynamical environment. By exploring these methodologies, this work contributes to the broader goal of ensuring the safety and effectiveness of spacecraft operations during close-proximity exploration of small celestial bodies.</description>

Abstract: The method for controlling a DC-DC converter is proposed to ensures the high quality control at large fluctuations in load currents by using differential gain control coefficients and second derivative control. Various implementations of balancing the currents of a multiphase DC-DC converter are discussed, with a focus on achieving accurate current regulation without introducing additional delay in the control system. Stochastic particle swarm optimization method is used to find optimal values of the PID controller parameters. An automatic constraint-handling in optimization are also discussed as relevant techniques in the field.</description>

      <title>Multi-winged Lorenz attractors due to bifurcations of a periodic orbit with multipliers $(-1,i,-i)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that bifurcations of periodic orbits with multipliers $(-1,i,-i)$ can lead to the birth of pseudohyperbolic (i.e., robustly chaotic) Lorenz-like attractors of three different types: one is a discrete analogue of the classical Lorenz attractor, and the other two are new. We call them two- and four-winged ``Sim\'o angels''. These three attractors exist in an orientation-reversing, three-dimensional, quadratic H\'enon map. Our analysis is based on a numerical study of a normal form for this bifurcation, a three-dimensional system of differential equations with a Z4-symmetry. We investigate bifurcations in the normal form and describe those responsible for the emergence of the Lorenz attractor and the continuous-time version of the Simo angels. Both for the normal form and the 3D H\'enon map, we have found open regions in the parameter space where the attractors are pseudohyperbolic, implying that for every parameter value from these regions every orbit in the attractor has positive top Lyapunov exponent.</description>

      <title>Circle Foliations Revisited: Periods of Flows whose Orbits are all Closed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our purpose here is to adapt the results of Geodesic circle foliations for Reeb flows or Hamiltonian flows on contact manifolds. Consequently, all periods are exactly the same if the contact manifold is connected and all orbits on the contact manifold are closed. We also present concrete examples of periodic flows, all of whose orbits are closed, such as Harmonic oscillators, Lotka-Volterra systems, and others. Lotka-Volterra systems, Reeb flows, and some geodesic flows have non-trivial periods, whereas the periods of Harmonic oscillators and similar systems can be easily obtained through direct calculations. As an application to quantum mechanics, we examine the spectrum of semiclassical Shr\"odinger operators. Then we have one of the semiclassical analogies of the Helton-Guillemin theorem.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet improvability in $L_p$-norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a norm $F$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$, we consider the set of $F$-Dirichlet improvable numbers $\mathbf{DI}_F$. In the most important case of $F$ being an $L_p$-norm with $p=\infty$, which is a supremum norm, it is well-known that $\mathbf{DI}_F = \mathbf{BA}\cup \mathbb{Q}$, where $\mathbf{BA}$ is a set of badly approximable numbers. It is also known that $\mathbf{BA}$ and each $\mathbf{DI}_F$ are of measure zero and of full Hausdorff dimension.
  Using classification of critical lattices for unit balls in $L_p$, we provide a complete and effective characterization of $\mathbf{DI}_p:=\mathbf{DI}_{F^{[p]}}$ in terms of the occurrence of patterns in regular continued fraction expansions, where $F^{[p]}$ is an $L_p$-norm with $p\in[1,\infty)$. This yields several corollaries. In particular, we resolve two open questions by Kleinbock and Rao by showing that the set $\mathbf{DI}_{p}\setminus \mathbf{BA}$ is of full Hausdorff dimension, as well as proving some results about the size of the difference $\mathbf{DI}_{p_1}\setminus \mathbf{DI}_{p_2}$. To be precise, we show that the set difference of Dirichlet improvable numbers in Euclidean norm ($p=2$) minus Dirichlet improvable numbers in taxicab norm ($p=1$) and vice versa, that is $\mathbf{DI}_{2}\setminus \mathbf{DI}_{1}$ and $\mathbf{DI}_{1}\setminus \mathbf{DI}_{2}$, are of full Hausdorff dimension.
  We also find all values of $p$, for which the set $\mathbf{DI}_p^c\cap\mathbf{BA}$ has full Hausdorff dimension.
  Finally, our characterization result implies that the number $e$ satisfies $e\in \mathbf{DI}_p$ if and only if $p\in(1,2)\cup(p_0,\infty)$ for some special constant $p_0\approx2.57$.</description>

      <title>Learning in Time-Varying Monotone Network Games with Dynamic Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework for multi-agent learning in a nonstationary dynamic network environment. More specifically, we examine projected gradient play in smooth monotone repeated network games in which the agents' participation and connectivity vary over time. We model this changing system with a stochastic network which takes a new independent realization at each repetition. We show that the strategy profile learned by the agents through projected gradient dynamics over the sequence of network realizations converges to a Nash equilibrium of the game in which players minimize their expected cost, almost surely and in the mean-square sense. We then show that the learned strategy profile is an almost Nash equilibrium of the game played by the agents at each stage of the repeated game with high probability. Using these two results, we derive non-asymptotic bounds on the regret incurred by the agents.</description>

      <title>Locally Maximizing orbits for multi-dimensional Twist maps and Birkhoff billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we consider variational properties of exact symplectic twist maps $T$ that act on the cotangent bundle of a torus, or on a ball bundle over a sphere. An example of such a map is the well-known Birkhoff billiard map corresponding to smooth convex hypersurfaces. In this work we will focus on the important class $\mathcal{M}$ of orbits of $T$ which are locally maximizing with respect to the variational principle associated with a generating function of the symplectic twist map. Our first goal is to give geometric and variational characterization for orbits in the class $\mathcal M$.
  The billiard map is known to have two different generating functions, which brings forth a natural question: to compare the properties of these two generating functions. While our motivation comes from billiards, we will work in general, and assume that a general twist map $T$ has two generating functions. Thus we consider the orbits of $T$ which are locally maximizing with respect to either of the generating functions. We formulate a geometric criterion that guarantees that two generating functions of the same twist map have the same class of locally maximizing orbits, and we will show that the two generating functions for the Birkhoff billiard map do, in fact, satisfy this criterion. The proof of this last property will rely on the Sinai-Chernov formula from geometric optics and billiard dynamics.</description>

      <title>Extending Discrete Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory to Non-Hyperbolic Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the recently developed discrete geometric singular perturbation theory to the non-normally hyperbolic regime. Our primary tool is the Takens embedding theorem, which provides a means of approximating the dynamics of particular maps with the time-1 map of a formal vector field. First, we show that the so-called reduced map, which governs the slow dynamics near slow manifolds in the normally hyperbolic regime, can be locally approximated by the time-one map of the reduced vector field which appears in continuous-time geometric singular perturbation theory. In the non-normally hyperbolic regime, we show that the dynamics of fast-slow maps with a unipotent linear part can be locally approximated by the time-1 map induced by a fast-slow vector field in the same dimension, which has a nilpotent singularity of the corresponding type. The latter result is used to describe (i) the local dynamics of two-dimensional fast-slow maps with non-normally singularities of regular fold, transcritical and pitchfork type, and (ii) dynamics on a (potentially high dimensional) local center manifold in $n$-dimensional fast-slow maps with regular contact or fold submanifolds of the critical manifold. In general, our results show that the dynamics near a large and important class of singularities in fast-slow maps can be described via the use of formal embedding theorems which allow for their approximation by the time-1 map of a fast-slow vector field featuring a loss of normal hyperbolicity.</description>

      <title>Featurizing Koopman Mode Decomposition For Robust Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09146v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces an advanced Koopman mode decomposition (KMD) technique -- coined Featurized Koopman Mode Decomposition (FKMD) -- that uses delay embedding and a learned Mahalanobis distance to enhance analysis and prediction of high dimensional dynamical systems. The delay embedding expands the observation space to better capture underlying manifold structure, while the Mahalanobis distance adjusts observations based on the system's dynamics. This aids in featurizing KMD in cases where good features are not a priori known. We show that FKMD improves predictions for a high-dimensional linear oscillator, a high-dimensional Lorenz attractor that is partially observed, and a cell signaling problem from cancer research.</description>

      <title>Mean field coupled dynamical systems: Bifurcations and phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a bifurcation theory for infinite dimensional systems satisfying abstract hypotheses that are tailored for applications to mean field coupled chaotic maps. Our abstract theory can be applied to many cases, from globally coupled expanding maps to globally coupled Axiom A diffeomorphisms. To illustrate the range of applicability, we analyze an explicit example consisting of globally coupled Anosov diffeomorphisms. For such an example, we classify all the invariant measures as the coupling strength varies; we show which invariant measures are physical, and we prove that the existence of multiple invariant physical measures is a purely infinite dimensional phenomenon, i.e., the model exhibits phase transitions in the sense of statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Lower box dimension of infinitely generated self-conformal sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Lambda$ be the limit set of an infinite conformal iterated function system and let $F$ denote the set of fixed points of the maps. We prove that the box dimension of $\Lambda$ exists if and only if \[
  \overline{\dim}_{\mathrm B} F\leq \max \{\dim_{\mathrm H} \Lambda, \underline{\dim}_{\mathrm B} F\}. \] In particular, this provides the first examples of sets of continued fraction expansions with restricted digits for which the box dimension does not exist.
  More generally, we establish an explicit asymptotic formula for the covering numbers $N_r(\Lambda)$ in terms of $\dim_{\mathrm H}\Lambda$ and the covering function $r\mapsto N_r(F)$, where $N_r(\cdot)$ denotes the least number of open balls of radius $r$ required to cover a given set. Such finer scaling information is necessary: in general, the lower box dimension $\underline{\dim}_{\mathrm B} \Lambda$ is not a function of the Hausdorff dimension of $\Lambda$ and the upper and lower box dimensions of $F$, and we prove sharp bounds for $\underline{\dim}_{\mathrm B} \Lambda$ in terms of these three quantities.</description>

      <title>Non-convergence of some non-commuting double ergodic averages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $S$ and $T$ be measure-preserving transformations of a probability space $(X,{\mathcal B},\mu)$. Let $f$ be a bounded measurable functions, and consider the integrals of the corresponding `double' ergodic averages: \[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \int f(S^ix)f(T^ix)\ d\mu(x) \qquad (n\ge 1).\] We construct examples for which these integrals do not converge as $n\to\infty$. These include examples in which $S$ and $T$ are rigid, and hence have entropy zero, answering a question of Frantzikinakis and Host.
  Our proof begins with a corresponding construction for orthogonal operators on a Hilbert space, and then obtains transformations of a Gaussian measure space from them.</description>

Abstract: We study the number of the poles of the meromorphic continuation of the dynamical zeta functions $\eta_N$ and $\eta_D$ for several strictly convex disjoint obstacles satisfying non-eclipse condition. We obtain a strip $\{z \in \mathbb C:\: {\rm Re}\: s &gt; \beta\}$ with infinite number of poles. For $\eta_D$ we prove the same result assuming the boundary real analytic. Moreover, for $\eta_N$ we obtain a characterisation of $\beta$ by the pressure $P(2G)$ of some function $G$ on the space $\Sigma_A^f$ related to the dynamical characteristics of the obstacle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1910.05720v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a large deviation principle for stochastic differential equations driven by semimartingales, with additive controls. Conditions are given in terms of characteristics of driven semimartingales, so that if the noise-control pairs satisfy a large deviation principle with some good rate function, so do the solution processes. There is no joint exponential tightness assumption for noise-control-solution triplets and no uniform exponential tightness assumption for noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.14678v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intermediate dimensions are a family of dimensions which interpolate between the Hausdorff and box dimensions of sets. We prove a necessary and sufficient condition for a given function $h(\theta)$ to be realized as the intermediate dimensions of a bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$. This condition is a straightforward constraint on the Dini derivatives of $h(\theta)$, which we prove is sharp using a homogeneous Moran set construction.</description>

Abstract: Let $d\in\mathbb{N}$ and let $\varphi\colon(0,1)\to[0,d]$. We prove that there exists a set $F\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ such that $\operatorname{dim}_A^\theta F=\varphi(\theta)$ for all $\theta\in(0,1)$ if and only if for every $0&lt;\lambda&lt;\theta&lt;1$, \[0\leq (1-\lambda)\varphi(\lambda)-(1-\theta)\varphi(\theta)\leq (\theta-\lambda)\varphi\Bigl(\frac{\lambda}{\theta}\Bigr).\] In particular, the following behaviours which have not previously been witnessed in any examples are possible: the Assouad spectrum can be non-monotonic on every open set, and can fail to be H\"older in a neighbourhood of 1.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give new arguments for sums and products of sufficient numbers of arbitrary central Cantor sets to produce large open intervals. We further discuss the same question for $C^1$ images of such central Cantor sets. This gives another perspective on the results obtained by Astels through a different formulation on the thickness of these Cantor sets. There has been recent interest in the question of products and sums of powers of Cantor sets, and these are addressed by our methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07783v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide upper bounds for the Assouad spectrum $\dim_A^\theta(\text{Gr}(f))$ of the graph of a real-valued H\"older or Sobolev function $f$ defined on an interval $I \subset \mathbb{R}$. We demonstrate via examples that all of our bounds are sharp. In the setting of H\"older graphs, we further provide a geometric algorithm which takes as input the graph of an $\alpha$-H\"older continuous function satisfying a matching lower oscillation condition with exponent $\alpha$ and returns the graph of a new $\alpha$-H\"older continuous function for which the Assouad $\theta$-spectrum realizes the stated upper bound for all $\theta\in (0,1)$. Examples of functions to which this algorithm applies include the continuous nowhere differentiable functions of Weierstrass and Takagi.</description>

Abstract: Transformers play a central role in the inner workings of large language models. We develop a mathematical framework for analyzing Transformers based on their interpretation as interacting particle systems, which reveals that clusters emerge in long time. Our study explores the underlying theory and offers new perspectives for mathematicians as well as computer scientists.</description>

The proof is modeled after work of Green, Tao, and Ziegler and uses as a crucial input recent work of the first author regarding the equidistribution of nilsequences. In a companion paper, this result will be used to improve the bounds on Szemer\'{e}di's theorem.</description>

      <title>Leveraging KANs For Enhanced Deep Koopman Operator Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02875v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-layer perceptrons (MLP's) have been extensively utilized in discovering Deep Koopman operators for linearizing nonlinear dynamics. With the emergence of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as a more efficient and accurate alternative to the MLP Neural Network, we propose a comparison of the performance of each network type in the context of learning Koopman operators with control. In this work, we propose a KANs-based deep Koopman framework with applications to an orbital Two-Body Problem (2BP) and the pendulum for data-driven discovery of linear system dynamics. KANs were found to be superior in nearly all aspects of training; learning 31 times faster, being 15 times more parameter efficiency, and predicting 1.25 times more accurately as compared to the MLP Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in the case of the 2BP. Thus, KANs shows potential for being an efficient tool in the development of Deep Koopman Theory.</description>
