      <title>Explosive synchronization in networks of Type-I neurons with electrical synapses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explosive synchronization (ES), which was observed in the scale-free network of the Kuramoto model, has been studied widely in the oscillator model. However, investigations of ES in neuronal networks, in spite of their importance in neuroscience, are limited and restricted to specific models. In this work, we explore the nature of the transition to synchronization in a class of neurons, namely Type-I neurons. Leveraging the mapping between Type-I neurons and the Kuramoto model, we investigate whether the conditions known to induce ES in the Kuramoto model also do so in Type-I neurons. The neurons are coupled through electrical synapses and placed on a scale-free and star networks with complete and partial degree-frequency correlation conditions. Our simulations show ES in networks of Quadratic Integrate and Fire (QIF) neurons, the normal form of Type-I neurons, under weak heterogeneity. We further confirm this phenomenon in networks of Morris-Lecar neurons, in the regime of Type-I excitability, under similar conditions to the QIF neurons. Thus, this work establishes a set of universal conditions that allows ES to arise in Type-I neurons.</description>

      <title>Deterministic coherence and anti-coherence resonances in two coupled Lorenz oscillators: numerical study versus experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the deterministic coherence and anti-coherence resonance phenomena in two coupled identical chaotic Lorenz oscillators. Both effects are found to occur simultaneously when varying the coupling strength. In particular, the occurrence of deterministic coherence resonance is revealed by analysing time realizations $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ of both oscillators, whereas the anti-coherence resonance is identified when considering oscillations $z(t)$ at the same parameter values. Both resonances are observed when the coupling strength does not exceed a threshold value corresponding to complete synchronization of the interacting chaotic oscillators. In such a case, the coupled oscillators exhibit the hyperchaotic dynamics associated with the on-off intermittency. The highlighted effects are studied in numerical simulations and confirmed in physical experiments, showing an excellent correspondence and disclosing thereby the robustness of the observed phenomena.</description>

      <title>Diversity mitigates polarization and consensus in opinion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the opinion dynamics in a population by considering a variant of Kuramoto model where the phase of an oscillator represents the opinion of an individual on a single topic. Two extreme phases separated by $\pi$ represent opposing views. Any other phase is considered as an intermediate opinion between the two extremes. The interaction (or attitude) between two individuals depends on the difference between their opinions and can be positive (attractive) or negative (repulsive) based on the defined thresholds. We investigate the opinion dynamics when these thresholds are varied. We observe explosive transition from a bipolarized state to a consensus state with the existence of scattered and tri-polarized states at low values of threshold parameter. The system exhibits multistability between various states in a sizeable parameter region. These transitions and multistability are studied in populations with different degrees of diversity represented by the width of conviction distribution. We found that a more homogeneous population has greater tendency to exhibit bipolarized, tri-polarized and clustered states while a diverse population helps mitigate polarization among individuals by reaching to a consensus sooner. Ott-Antonsen analysis is used to analyse the system's long term macroscopic behaviour and verify the numerical results. We also study the effects of neutral individuals that do not interact with others or do not change their attitude on opinion formation, nature of transitions and multistability. Furthermore, we apply our model to language data to study the assimilation of diverse languages in India and compare the results with those obtained from model equations.</description>
