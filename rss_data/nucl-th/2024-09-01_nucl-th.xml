      <title>Longitudinal form factors of $A\,\leq\,10$ nuclei in a chiral effective field theory approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the elastic electron scattering longitudinal form factors of $A\le 10$ nuclei computed in a variational Monte Carlo approach. We employ the Norfolk family of local chiral interactions and a consistent electromagnetic charge operator. Our calculations are compared both to data and past theoretical evaluations. This work represents, to our knowledge, the first exact many-body calculation of longitudinal form factors in the $7\,\leq\,A\,\leq\,10$ mass range. Finally, we identify $^9$Be and $^{10}$B as candidate targets for renewed experimental interest, as they exhibit the potential to provide more stringent constraints on the theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Activation of momentum fluctuations in wave packet molecular dynamics: Impacts on momentum distributions of projectilelike fragments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics approaches use wave packets as nucleon wave functions to simulate the time evolution of nuclear reactions. It is crucial to activate the momentum fluctuation inherent in each wave packet so that it properly affects the time evolution. In the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD) model, this has traditionally been done by splitting the wave packets, i.e., by introducing a random fluctuation to the wave packet center of each particle. The present work proposes an improved approach to activate the fluctuation in both the one-body mean-field propagation and the two-nucleon collision processes, consistently based on the gradual or sudden change of the degree of isolation, which is derived from the fragment number function used for the zero-point energy subtraction. This new method is applied to the 12C + 12C and 12C + p reactions at about 100 MeV/nucleon, focusing on the momentum distribution of the 11B fragments produced by one-proton removal from the 12C projectile. The results show that, with the momentum fluctuation suitably activated, the method correctly accounts for the recoil from the removed nucleon to the residue and the 11B momentum distribution is significantly improved, while without activating the fluctuation the distribution is too narrow compared to the experimental data. Furthermore, the AMD results indicate that the momentum distribution consists of two components; one is the high $P_z$ component with a small shift from the beam velocity, resulting from the simple removal of a proton after an energetic collision with a target particle; the other is the low $P_z$ component with a larger peak shift resulting from the decay of an excited 12C nucleus in a longer time scale. The activation of momentum fluctuation mainly affects the high $P_z$ component to broaden it. The role of cluster correlations in this problem is also investigated.</description>

      <title>Exploring the effect of positive Q-value neutron transfer in coupled-channels calculations using microscopic nuclear potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the effect of the degree of freedom of neutron transfer on the cross section of heavy-ion fusion reactions, using the relativistic mean-field formalism within the coupled channel approach (CCFULL). We obtain the microscopic nuclear interaction potential in terms of the density distributions for the targets and projectiles with the NL3$^*$ parameter set and corresponding R3Y nucleon-nucleon potential. The present analysis includes the $^{18}$O-induced reactions, for which experimental fusion cross-section is available around the Coulomb barrier. It is evident from the results that including vibrational and/or rotational degrees of freedom enhances the fusion cross-section at energies below the barrier. However, fusion hindrance persists in this energy region. To address this, we incorporated the two-neutron $(2n)$ transfer channels in the Coupled Channel calculation. A comparison with the Woods-Saxon potential (WS) shows that the R3Y nucleon-nucleon (NN) potential, with intrinsic degrees of freedom, is superior to it, especially at energies below the barrier. This superiority can be attributed to the observed higher barrier heights and lower cross-section of the WS potential compared to the relativistic R3Y NN potential for the considered reaction systems. Consequently, we employed the relativistic mean-field formalism to estimate fusion characteristics for the unknown $^{18}$O-induced reactions, namely $^{18}$O + $^{62}${Ni}, $^{18}$O + $^{70,72,76}${Ge}, $^{18}$O + $^{144,150}${Nd}, and $^{18}$O + $^{144,148,152,154}${Sm}. Our analysis highlights the significant role of positive $Q$-value neutron transfer in enhancing the sub-barrier fusion cross-section for the $^{18}$O + $^{148}${Nd} reaction with the R3Y NN potential. However, the effect of this transfer channel for the other considered reactions is comparatively less pronounced.</description>

      <title>Neutron-proton pairing correlations described on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ADAPT-VQE approach is used to solve the neutron-proton pairing problem in atomic nuclei. This variational approach is considered today as one of the most powerful methods to iteratively find the ground state of a many-body problem, provided a performing set of operators, called the pool of operators, is used to explore the Hilbert space of many-body wave-functions. Three different pools of operators, which might eventually break one or several symmetries of the Hamiltonian during the descent to the ground state, are tested for the neutron-proton pairing problem. We observe that the breaking of some symmetries during the optimization of the trial wave-function might, in general, help to speed up the convergence towards the ground state. Still, we rejected the pool of operators that might explicitly break the total particle number because they become uncontrollable during the optimization process. Overall, we observed that the iterative optimization process rapidly becomes a delicate problem when the number of parameters to build the ansatz increases, and the energy might get stuck at energies higher than the ground state energy. To improve the convergence in this case, several techniques have been proposed, with some better controlling the symmetries during the energy minimization. Among the proposed methods, two have proven effective: one based on an embedding technique and the other on a randomized preparation of the initial state. We conclude that the ADAPT-VQE, complemented by these techniques, can provide a very accurate description of the neutron-proton pairing problem, and can outperform other standardly used techniques that break the particle number symmetry and restore afterwards.</description>

      <title>How do mirror charge radii constrain density dependence of the symmetry energy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been suggested that differences in the charge radii of mirror nuclei ($\Delta R^{\rm mirr}_{\rm ch}$) are strongly correlated with the neutron-skin thickness ($R_{\rm skin}$) of neutron-rich nuclei and with the slope of the symmetry energy ($L$). To test this assumption, we present ab initio calculations of $R_{\rm skin}$ in $^{48}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb, $\Delta R^{\rm mirr}_{\rm ch}$ in $^{36}$Ca$-^{36}$S, $^{38}$Ca$-^{38}$Ar, $^{41}$Sc$-^{41}$Ca, $^{48}$Ni$-^{48}$Ca, $^{52}$Ni$-^{52}$Cr, and $^{54}$Ni$-^{54}$Fe mirror pairs, and $L$. Employing the recently developed 34 chiral interaction samples, identified by the history matching approach, we conduct rigorous statistical analysis of correlations among $\Delta R^{\rm mirr}_{\rm ch}$, $R_{\rm skin}$ and $L$, accounting for quantified uncertainties from low-energy constants of chiral interaction, chiral effective field theory truncation and many-body method approximation. The ab initio results reveal an appreciable $\Delta R^{\rm mirr}_{\rm ch}-L$ correlation in $fp$-shell mirror pairs. However, contrary to previous studies, the present calculation finds that the studied $sd$-shell mirror pairs do not exhibit any $\Delta R^{\rm mirr}_{\rm ch}-L$ correlation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review some recent developments in mathematical aspects of relativistic fluids. The goal is to provide a quick entry point to some research topics of current interest that is accessible to graduate students and researchers from adjacent fields, as well as to researches working on broader aspects of relativistic fluid dynamics interested in its mathematical formalism. Instead of complete proofs, which can be found in the published literature, here we focus on the proofs' main ideas and key concepts. After an introduction to the relativistic Euler equations, we cover the following topics: a new wave-transport formulation of the relativistic Euler equations tailored to applications; the problem of shock formation for relativistic Euler; rough (i.e., low-regularity) solutions to the relativistic Euler equations; the relativistic Euler equations with a physical vacuum boundary; relativistic fluids with viscosity. We finish with a discussion of open problems and future directions of research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14535v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of the magnetic properties of atoms and nuclei was performed. A linear dependence between the strength of the magnetic field at the nucleus and the effective charge divided by the major quantum number were analyzed and explained. The calculations of the magnetic field at the nucleus were done for a wide set of electron configurations within the framework of relativistic Dirac-Hartree-Fock method. Results are compared to experimental results of $g$-factor measurements.</description>

      <title>Causality Bounds on Dissipative General-Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which a large class of relativistic generalizations of Braginskii's magnetohydrodynamics with shear, bulk, and heat diffusion effects is causal and strongly hyperbolic in the fully nonlinear regime in curved spacetime. We find that causality severely constrains the size of nonideal effects and the onset of kinetic instabilities. Our results are crucial for assessing the regime of validity of fluid dynamical simulations of plasmas near supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>A Collinear Perspective on the Regge Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00931v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The high energy (Regge) limit provides a playground for understanding all loop structures of scattering amplitudes, and plays an important role in the description of many phenomenologically relevant cross-sections. While well understood in the planar limit, the structure of non-planar corrections introduces many fascinating complexities, for which a general organizing principle is still lacking. We study the structure of multi-reggeon exchanges in the context of the effective field theory for forward scattering, and derive their factorization into collinear operators (impact factors) and soft operators. We derive the structure of the renormalization group consistency equations in the effective theory, showing how the anomalous dimensions of the soft operators are related to those of the collinear operators, allowing us to derive renormalization group equations in the Regge limit purely from a collinear perspective. The rigidity of the consistency equations provides considerable insight into the all orders organization of Regge amplitudes in the effective theory, as well as its relation to other approaches. Along the way we derive a number of technical results that improve the understanding of the effective theory. We illustrate this collinear perspective by re-deriving all the standard BFKL equations for two-Glauber exchange from purely collinear calculations, and we show that this perspective provides a number of conceptual and computational advantages as compared to the standard view from soft or Glauber physics. We anticipate that this formulation in terms of collinear operators will enable a better understanding of the relation between BFKL and DGLAP in gauge theories, and facilitate the analysis of renormalization group evolution equations describing Reggeization beyond next-to-leading order.</description>

      <title>Universality of Efimov states in highly mass-imbalanced cold-atom mixtures with van der Waals and dipole interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02441v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study three-body systems in a mass-imbalanced two-component cold-atom mixture, and we investigate the three-body parameter of their Efimov states for both bosonic and fermionic systems, with a major focus on the Er-Er-Li Efimov states. For a system interacting solely via van der Waals interactions, the van der Waals universality of the three-body parameter is analytically derived using the quantum defect theory. With the addition of a perturbative dipole interaction between the heavy atoms, the three-body parameters of the bosonic and fermionic Efimov states are found to behave differently. When the dipole interaction is as strong as the van der Waals interaction, corresponding to realistic Er-Er-Li Efimov states, we show that the van der Waals universality persists once the effects of the non-perturbative dipole interaction are renormalized into the s-wave and p-wave scattering parameters between the heavy atoms. For a dipole interaction much stronger than the van der Waals interaction, we find that the universality of the Efimov states can be alternatively characterized by a quasi-one-dimensional scattering parameter due to a strong anisotropic deformation of the Efimov wavefunctions. Our work thus clarifies the interplay of isotropic and anisotropic forces in the universality of the Efimov states. Based on the renormalized van der Waals universality, the three-body parameter is estimated for specific isotopes of Er-Li cold-atom mixtures.</description>

      <title>Spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons along beam direction in p+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=8.16$ TeV using hydrodynamic approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have implemented the 3+1 dimensional CLVisc hydrodynamics model with TRENTO-3D initial conditions to investigate the spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons along the beam direction in p+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 8.16$ TeV. Following our previous theoretical framework based on quantum kinetic theory, we consider three different scenarios: $\Lambda$ equilibrium, $s$ quark equilibrium, and iso-thermal equilibrium scenarios. We have computed the second Fourier sine coefficients of spin polarization along the beam direction, denoted as $\left\langle P_{z} \sin 2(\phi_{p} - \Psi_{2}) \right\rangle$, with $\phi_{p} - \Psi_{2}$ being the azimuthal angle relative to the second-order event plane $\Psi_{2}$, as functions of multiplicity, transverse momentum and pseudo-rapidity in the three scenarios. Additionally, we have also computed the spin polarization along the beam direction, $P_{z}$, as a function of the azimuthal angle. We find that the spin polarization induced by thermal vorticity always provides an opposite contribution compared to the shear-induced polarization in p+Pb collisions. The total spin polarization computed by the current hydrodynamic model disagrees with the data measured by LHC-CMS experiments. Our findings imply that other non-flow effects may play a crucial role in p+Pb collisions.</description>
