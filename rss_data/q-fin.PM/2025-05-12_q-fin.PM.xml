      <title>The bias of IID resampled backtests for rolling-window mean-variance portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backtests on historical data are the basis for practical evaluations of portfolio selection rules, but their reliability is often limited by reliance on a single sample path. This can lead to high estimation variance. Resampling techniques offer a potential solution by increasing the effective sample size, but can disrupt the temporal ordering inherent in financial data and introduce significant bias. This paper investigates the critical questions: First, How large is this bias for Sharpe Ratio estimates?, and then, second: What are its primary drivers?. We focus on the canonical rolling-window mean-variance portfolio rule. Our contributions are identifying the bias mechanism, and providing a practical heuristic for gauging bias severity. We show that the bias arises from the disruption of train-test dependence linked to the return auto-covariance structure and derive bounds for the bias which show a strong dependence on the observable first-lag autocorrelation. Using simulations to confirm these findings, it is revealed that the resulting Sharpe Ratio bias is often a fraction of a typical backtest's estimation noise, benefiting from partial offsetting of component biases. Empirical analysis further illustrates that differences between IID-resampled and standard backtests align qualitatively with these drivers. Surprisingly, our results suggest that while IID resampling can disrupt temporal dependence, its resulting bias can often be tolerable. However, we highlight the need for structure-preserving resampling methods.</description>

      <title>NewsNet-SDF: Stochastic Discount Factor Estimation with Pretrained Language Model News Embeddings via Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic Discount Factor (SDF) models provide a unified framework for asset pricing and risk assessment, yet traditional formulations struggle to incorporate unstructured textual information. We introduce NewsNet-SDF, a novel deep learning framework that seamlessly integrates pretrained language model embeddings with financial time series through adversarial networks. Our multimodal architecture processes financial news using GTE-multilingual models, extracts temporal patterns from macroeconomic data via LSTM networks, and normalizes firm characteristics, fusing these heterogeneous information sources through an innovative adversarial training mechanism. Our dataset encompasses approximately 2.5 million news articles and 10,000 unique securities, addressing the computational challenges of processing and aligning text data with financial time series. Empirical evaluations on U.S. equity data (1980-2022) demonstrate NewsNet-SDF substantially outperforms alternatives with a Sharpe ratio of 2.80. The model shows a 471% improvement over CAPM, over 200% improvement versus traditional SDF implementations, and a 74% reduction in pricing errors compared to the Fama-French five-factor model. In comprehensive comparisons, our deep learning approach consistently outperforms traditional, modern, and other neural asset pricing models across all key metrics. Ablation studies confirm that text embeddings contribute significantly more to model performance than macroeconomic features, with news-derived principal components ranking among the most influential determinants of SDF dynamics. These results validate the effectiveness of our multimodal deep learning approach in integrating unstructured text with traditional financial data for more accurate asset pricing, providing new insights for digital intelligent decision-making in financial technology.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Excess Volatility Puzzle Through the Lens of the Chiarella Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We amend and extend the Chiarella model of financial markets to deal with arbitrary long-term value drifts in a consistent way. This allows us to improve upon existing calibration schemes, opening the possibility of calibrating individual monthly time series instead of classes of time series. The technique is employed on spot prices of four asset classes from ca. 1800 onward (stock indices, bonds, commodities, currencies). The so-called fundamental value is a direct output of the calibration, which allows us to (a) quantify the amount of excess volatility in these markets, which we find to be large (e.g. a factor $\approx$ 4 for stock indices) and consistent with previous estimates; and (b) determine the distribution of mispricings (i.e. the difference between market price and value), which we find in many cases to be bimodal. Both findings are strongly at odds with the Efficient Market Hypothesis. We also study in detail the 'sloppiness' of the calibration, that is, the directions in parameter space that are weakly constrained by data. The main conclusions of our study are remarkably consistent across different asset classes, and reinforce the hypothesis that the medium-term fate of financial markets is determined by a tug-of-war between trend followers and fundamentalists.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Dimensional Barrier: A Pontryagin-Guided Direct Policy Optimization for Continuous-Time Multi-Asset Portfolio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11116v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving large-scale, continuous-time portfolio optimization problems involving numerous assets and state-dependent dynamics has long been challenged by the curse of dimensionality. Traditional dynamic programming and PDE-based methods, while rigorous, typically become computationally intractable beyond a few state variables ($\sim$3-6 limit in prior studies). To overcome this critical barrier, we introduce the \emph{Pontryagin-Guided Direct Policy Optimization} (PG-DPO) framework. PG-DPO leverages Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP) and backpropagation-through-time (BPTT) to directly inform neural network-based policy learning. A key contribution is our highly efficient \emph{Projected PG-DPO (P-PGDPO)} variant. This approach uniquely utilizes BPTT to obtain rapidly stabilizing estimates of the Pontryagin costates and their crucial derivatives with respect to the state variables. These estimates are then analytically projected onto the manifold of optimal controls dictated by PMP's first-order conditions, significantly reducing training overhead and enhancing accuracy. This enables a breakthrough in scalability: numerical experiments demonstrate that P-PGDPO successfully tackles problems with dimensions previously considered far out of reach (up to 50 assets and 10 state variables). Critically, the framework accurately captures complex intertemporal hedging demands, a feat often elusive for other methods in high-dimensional settings. P-PGDPO delivers near-optimal policies, offering a practical and powerful alternative for a broad class of high-dimensional continuous-time control problems.</description>

      <title>Robust Asset-Liability Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How should financial institutions hedge their balance sheets against interest rate risk when managing long-term assets and liabilities? We address this question by proposing a bond portfolio solution based on ambiguity-averse preferences, which generalizes classical immunization and accommodates arbitrary liability structures, portfolio constraints, and interest rate perturbations. In a further extension, we show that the optimal portfolio can be computed as a simple generalized least squares problem, making the solution both transparent and computationally efficient. The resulting portfolio also reduces leverage by implicitly regularizing the portfolio weights, which enhances out-of-sample performance. Numerical evaluations using both empirical and simulated yield curves from a no-arbitrage term structure model support the feasibility and accuracy of our approach relative to existing methods.</description>
