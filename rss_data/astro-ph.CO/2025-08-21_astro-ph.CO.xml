      <title>CPL-parametrized cosmic expansion in Galileon gravity: Constraints from recent data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the cosmic expansion history within the framework of Galileon gravity by employing a redshift-based expression for the Hubble rate, $H(z)$, derived from the CPL parametrization $\omega_{DE}(z)=\omega_{0}+\omega_{a}\frac{z}{1+z}$. This parametrization allows for a time-dependent expansion history consistent with the non-linear Galileon field equations. To constrain the model parameters, we perform a MCMC analysis using $46$ Hubble parameter measurements, DESI DR2 BAO data and $1701$ Pantheon+ datasets. The best fit values obtained are $H_0 = 67.7043^{+1.4354}_{-1.4102}$ km/s/Mpc, $\Omega_{m0} = 0.2668^{+0.0212}_{-0.0217}$, $\omega_0 = -0.8827^{+0.1076}_{-0.0967}$ and $\omega_a = 0.0011^{+0.0660}_{-0.0622}$. Model comparison using information criteria yields $\Delta AIC=1.46$ and $\Delta BIC = 11.5$ indicating that the Galileon model is a strong contender to the $\Lambda$CDM model. The deceleration parameter shows a transition at $z_{tr} = 0.7873$, with $q_0 = -0.598$. Energy density and pressure remain physically viable with $\rho_{de}(z)&gt;0$ and $p_{de}(z)&lt;0$ with the present day equation of state $\omega(z)$ value of $-0.2915$, which suggests mild dynamical dark energy. NEC and DECare satisfied, while SEC is violated. The model yields $r_{0}=0.657$, $s_{0}=0.1173$ and Om diagnostic shows a peak value of $-0.45$ at $z = 0.377$, converging to $-1$ at late times.These results demonstrate that Galileon gravity remains a viable and flexible alternative to $\Lambda$CDM in describing late-time cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Baryon Density$\unicode{x2013}$Hubble Constant Degeneracy in Fast Radio Burst Applications with Associated Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are a unique probe of the cosmos, owing to dispersion caused by free electrons in the intergalactic medium (IGM). Two of the main quantities of interest are degenerate: the density of matter $\Omega_\mathrm{b}f_\mathrm{d}$ outside of galaxies and the Hubble constant $H_0$. Here, we present a new possibility of breaking the degeneracy without invoking early Universe priors on $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$. Assuming some FRBs originate in compact object mergers, the combination of dispersion and luminosity distance from the gravitational wave (GW) can be used to measure $\Omega_\mathrm{b}h^2f_\mathrm{d}$ (where $h$ is the dimensionless Hubble constant). We show that this measurement can be combined with the abundant FRBs that have a redshift measurement. This combination breaks the degeneracy with the Hubble constant. We develop a Bayesian framework and forecast that third-generation GW detectors are required to obtain meaningful constraints. We forecast that one year of Einstein Telescope operations can constrain $H_0$ to $\pm 6\,\mathrm{km}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{b}h^2f_\mathrm{d}$ to $^{+0.0015}_{-0.0016}$ (68$\,\%$ credible interval). The method can also be used with luminosity distances obtained through other means than GWs.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of X-Ray Afterglow Light Curves of GRBs and its implication for constraining Cosmological Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) serve as important cosmological probes, whose X-ray afterglow light curves (LCs) may exhibit a plateau phase (with temporal slope $\alpha$ between 0 and 0.5) that may originate from magnetar energy injection. Similar to Type Ia Supernovae, GRBs with a common physical origin can be used as standardizable candles for cosmological studies. However, observational gaps in GRB light curves introduce significant uncertainties in plateau parameter estimation, thereby affecting cosmological constraints. In this work, we employ a stochastic reconstruction technique to reconstruct the X-ray afterglow LCs for 35 GRB samples exhibiting plateau features, generating 50 simulated data points for each LC. Using the reconstructed LCs, we calibrate three luminosity correlations: the $L_0$-$t_b$, $L_0$-$t_b$-$E_{p,i}$, and $L_0$-$t_b$-$E_{\gamma,\mathrm{iso}}$ relation, which are then applied to constrain both flat and non-flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological models. The main results include: (i) the $L_0$-$t_b$ relation yields a slope $b \approx -1$, supporting a constant magnetar energy injection rate; (ii) light curve reconstruction has limited impact on cosmological parameter constraints; (iii) for the flat $\Lambda$CDM model constrained by the $L_0$-$t_b$-$E_{p,i}$ relation, the precision of $\Omega_m$ improves by 6.25\%; For the non-flat $\Lambda$CDM model constrained by the $L_0$-$t_b$-$E_{p,i}$ relation, the precision of $\Omega_\Lambda$ improves by 1.01\%. Our findings suggest that increasing the number of LC data points provides limited improvement to cosmological constraints, while expanding the sample size of GRBs with identical physical origins may be more crucial.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Neutrino Emission from Spinning, Moving, and Charged Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The angular and spectral features of neutrinos emitted from primordial black holes (PBHs) carry key imprints of the black hole's fundamental properties. This work investigates the directional emission of neutrinos from Kerr-Newman PBHs undergoing Hawking evaporation, accounting for the combined effects of spin, motion, and electric charge. Rotation induces anisotropic fluxes through axisymmetric geometry and spin-dependent greybody factors, while relativistic motion leads to pronounced Doppler beaming along the direction of travel. Electric charge modifies the thermodynamic evolution and suppresses the emission of like-charged particles, altering the overall spectrum and burst duration. The resulting neutrino flux exhibits rich angular structure, energy dependence, and time profiles that vary with PBH parameters. These directional signatures enhance the prospects for detection at current and future neutrino observatories, and offer new multi-messenger probes of PBH populations in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Resurrecting Vanilla Power Law Inflation with the aid of Continuous Spontaneous Localization in the ACT era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vanilla Power Law Inflation is plagued with two severe drawbacks, the one being the issue of graceful exit, and the other being its compatibility with the existing data. There's yet another daunting problem generic to any inflationary model, and not particular to the Power Law Inflation, is the issue of classicalization of the primordial quantum perturbation. This issue is often treated as an isolated problem primarily because decoherence is often invoked to tackle such problems and decoherence, in principle, doesn't leaves any observational imprints. However, that's not the case if one invokes the collapse models of quantum mechanics to resolve such a problem, because the collapse models do modify the Schr\"{o}dinger evolution of the quantum system and the modified dynamics is bound to leave imprints. We show that collapsed modified Power Law Inflation can indeed circumvent the issue with observations and can be made compatible with all the current data coming from {\it Planck}, {\it ACT}, DESI and BAO while resolving the classicalization issue associated with the quantum primordial fluctuations. Such an inflationary model also produces a more red-tilted tensor spectrum and no running for both the scalar and tensor spectral indices, which can be a litmus test for this model.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of first-order phase transitions through a mass-acquiring scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase transitions in the early Universe give rise to effective masses for massless fields in the symmetry-broken phase. We use the lattice simulations to investigate the impact of a spectator scalar field with mass generation on the dynamics of first-order phase transitions and the generation of gravitational waves. In addition to the well-known friction effects, we identify a novel effect that significantly enhances the strength of first-order phase transitions. The amplitude of the mass-acquiring field is highly suppressed in the true vacuum bubbles, resulting in additional release of vacuum energy that concentrate on the bubble walls. We also establish an analytical method to explain our numerical results.</description>

      <title>Growth Index in the $\gamma\delta$CDM model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To better distinguish the nature of $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, it is necessary to separate the effects of expansion and the growth of structure. The growth index $\gamma$ was identified as the single parameter that characterizes the growth of density fluctuations independently of the effects of cosmic expansion. Analyses performed with various cosmological datasets indicate that the growth index has to be larger than its theoretically predicted value in the $\Lambda$CDM model. Cosmological models based on $f(R)$ gravity theories have scale-dependent growth indices, whose values are even more at odds with the growth rate data. In this work, we evaluate the growth index in the $\gamma\delta$CDM model both theoretically and numerically. Although based on $f(R)$ gravity theory, we show through several analyses with different combinations of datasets that the growth index and growth rate in the $\gamma\delta$CDM model behave similarly to the $\Lambda$CDM and the $\omega$CDM models. When faced with cosmological data, we also demonstrate that the $\gamma\delta$CDM model fits better than the $\Lambda$CDM and the $\omega$CDM models.</description>

      <title>Ly$\alpha$ visibility from z = 4.5 to 11 in the UDS field: evidence for a high neutral hydrogen fraction and small ionized bubbles at z $\sim$ 7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The resonant scattering nature of Ly$\alpha$ photons interacting with neutral hydrogen makes Ly$\alpha$-emitting galaxies (LAEs) robust tracers of the intergalactic neutral hydrogen fraction, and thus sensitive probes of cosmic reionization. We present an extensive study of the Ly$\alpha$ evolution from galaxies at 4.5 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 11 in the UDS field, observed as part of the CAPERS survey, and complemented with spectra from the DAWN JWST Archive. The combined sample includes 651 spectroscopically confirmed Ly$\alpha$-break galaxies, among which we find 73 S/N&gt;3 LAEs in JWST-NIRSpec PRISM spectra. We trace the redshift evolution of the Ly$\alpha$ emitter fraction with EW$_0$ &gt;25 A (X$_{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$) between z = 5 and z = 9, presenting the first such analysis in the UDS field. At z = 5 and 6, the UDS results agree with the average JWST X$_{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$ values from multiple fields. However, JWST measurements are consistently lower than ground-based results. To investigate this, we compare JWST observations to a population of star-forming galaxies at z$\sim$6 observed with VLT-FORS2. We find that a Ly$\alpha$ slit-loss of 35 $\pm$ 10% in JWST spectra accounts for the offset, as the resonant Ly$\alpha$ emission is more spatially extended than the stellar continuum. From z = 6 to 7, the UDS field shows a significant drop in Ly$\alpha$ visibility, from which we infer a neutral hydrogen fraction of X$_{\mathrm{HI}}$ = 0.7--0.9. Finally, we identify two robust ionized bubbles at z = 7.29 and 7.77, with radii of $R_{\mathrm{ion}}$ = 0.6 and 0.5 physical Mpc and photometric overdensities of N/$\langle$N$\rangle$ = 3 and 4, based on candidate counts down to the photometric completeness limit. Compared to the large ionized region at z$\sim$7 in the EGS field, these results indicate significant field-to-field variation, supporting a patchy, inhomogeneous reionization process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $F(R)$ inflationary models are analyzed without the Weyl transformation to the Einstein frame. Sufficient conditions for existence of global inflationary attractors in $F(R)$ models are provided. Following that, the procedure for calculating inflationary observables completely in the original, Jordan, frame is given. The described procedure is used to analyze a new $F(R)$ inflationary model (a one-parameter deformation of the Starobinsky model), which is shown to provide predictions in good agreement with the recent ACT data.</description>

      <title>Machine learning classification of black holes in the mass--spin diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the mass--spin diagram for classifying black holes and studying their formation pathways, providing an analogue to the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. This allows for black hole evolutionary tracks as a function of redshift, combining formation, accretion, and merger histories for the variety of black hole populations. A realistic black hole continuum constructed from initial mass and spin functions and approximate redshift evolution reveals possible black hole main sequences, such as sustained coherent accretion through cosmic time (i.e., Cosmic Accretion) or hierarchical merger trees. In the stellar-mass regime, we use a binary population synthesis software to compare three spin prescriptions for tidal evolution of Wolf-Rayet progenitors, showing how the mass--spin diagram exposes interesting modeling differences. We then classify black hole populations by applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning clustering methods to mass--spin datasets. While bare unsupervised clustering can nearly recover canonical population boundaries (stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive), a more sophisticated approach utilizing deep learning via variational autoencoders for latent space representation learning aids in clustering of realistic datasets with subclasses that highly overlap in mass--spin space. We find that a supervised random forest can accurately recover the correct clusters from the learned latent space representation depending on the complexity of the underlying dataset, semi-supervised methods show potential for further development, and the performance of unsupervised classifiers is a great challenge. Our findings motivate future machine learning applications and demonstrate that the mass--spin diagram can be used to connect gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations with theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Identifying Monochromatic Signals in LISA and Taiji via Spectral Split: Gravitational Waves versus Ultralight Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) has opened a new window to explore the dark Universe. Ultralight dark matter (ULDM), an attractive candidate for dark matter, might induce monochromatic signals in gravitational-wave (GW) laser interferometers. However it is not clear how such signals are disentangled from the GWs emitted by galactic compact binaries. Here we initiate the investigation on the spectral split of monochromatic signals caused by detector's heliocentric motion in space and show the annual modulation can induce distinct structures in the spectral harmonics for GWs and ULDM, which would enable to clearly identify the nature of the signal. We show the physical parameters can be inferred with high precision using the Fisher matrix formalism. Our results provide a practical algorithm for probing ULDM and broaden the scientific objectives of future GW detectors in space, such as LISA and Taiji.</description>

      <title>Scrutinizing Fermionic Dark Matter in Scotogenic Model with Low Reheating Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scotogenic model provides a minimal and elegant framework that simultaneously explains neutrino masses and accommodates a viable dark matter (DM) candidate. In this work, we investigate the phenomenology of fermionic DM in the scotogenic model, with a particular emphasis on the effects of a non-standard cosmological history characterized by a low reheating temperature. We demonstrate that entropy injection from inflaton decay can significantly dilute the DM abundance, thereby relaxing the annihilation cross section required to reproduce the observed relic density and opening new regions of viable parameter space. We further analyze the complementarity between current and future direct detection experiments and charged lepton flavour violation (cLFV) searches in probing this scenario. Our results show that next-generation direct detection experiments such as DARWIN and XLZD, together with upcoming cLFV searches (in particular the future sensitivity of $\mu \rightarrow 3e$ experiments), will be capable of testing substantial regions of the parameter space, including those associated with low reheating temperatures.</description>

      <title>A preference for dynamical phantom dark energy using one-parameter model with Planck, DESI DR1 BAO and SN data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) provides a powerful tool to measure cosmic expansion and consequently the nature of the Dark Energy (DE). Recent precise BAO measurements by Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument data release 1 (DESI DR1), when combined with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from Planck and Supernovae of Type Ia (SN Ia), favor evolving dark energy over cosmological constant. This result is strongly related to the assumed priors on the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization of DE. We test another parametrization which introduces two free parameters $n$ and $\alpha$, only $n$ is independent. Thus, it reduces the parameter space compared to the CPL model, which derives a more robust preference for evolving DE, if any. The model potentially produces three cosmological scenarios according to the values of its parameters. For $n=3$, the $\Lambda$CDM model is recovered, quintessence for $n&lt;3$, and phantom for $n&gt;3$. In the present study, we test the model on the background level, and, to our knowledge for the first time, on the linear perturbation level. Bayesian evidence analysis shows a weak preference \textbf{($\mathbf{\ln B \leq 1.8}$)} for dynamical DE in the phantom regime over the cosmological constant DE using Planck, DESI, and PantheonPlus \&amp; SH0ES data, similarly the AIC analysis supports dynamical DE scenario for the same data. The model predicts current phantom DE $w_{de,0} = -1.073 \pm 0.032$ and $H_0=70.9\pm 1.4$ km/s/Mpc when Planck+DESI data is used, which decreases the tension with $H_0$ local measurements to $1.2\sigma$ level.</description>

      <title>Probing primordial non-Gaussianity by reconstructing the initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to constrain the primordial (local-type) non-Gaussianity signal by first reconstructing the initial density field to remove the late time non-Gaussianities introduced by gravitational evolution. Our reconstruction algorithm combines perturbation theory on large scales with a convolutional neural network on small scales. We reconstruct the squared potential (that sources the non-Gaussian signal) out to $k=0.2\ h$/Mpc to an accuracy of 99.8%. We cross-correlate this squared potential field with the reconstructed density field and verify that this computationally inexpensive estimator has the same information content as the full matter bispectrum. As a proof of concept, our approach can yield up to a factor of three improvement in the $f_{\rm NL}$ constraints, although it does not yet include the complications of galaxy bias or imperfections in the reconstruction. These potential improvements make it a promising alternative to current approaches to constraining primordial non-Gaussianity.</description>

      <title>Evolving Dark Sector and the Dark Dimension Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: String theory naturally leads to the expectation that dark energy is not stable, and may be evolving as captured by the Swampland de Sitter conjectures. Moreover, motivated by the distance conjecture, a unification of dark sector has been proposed, where the smallness of dark energy leads to one extra dimension of micron size with dark matter being the Kaluza--Klein graviton excitations in this extra dimension. We consider the natural possibility that the radius of the dark dimension varies as the dark energy decreases, leading to the variation of the dark matter mass. This correlates the decrease of the dark energy with the variation of the dark matter mass as they depend on the variations of a scalar field $\phi$ controlling the radius of the extra dimension. A simple realization of this idea for small range of $\phi$ is adequately captured by choosing a potential which is locally of the form $V=V_0\ {\rm exp}(-c\phi)$ and dark matter mass $m_{\rm DM}=m_0\ {\rm exp}(-c' \phi)$ where the sign of $\phi$ is chosen such that $c'\geq 0$ while we have two choices for the sign of $c$ depending on whether the dark dimension expands or shrinks when the dark energy dominates. We find excellent agreement with recent experimental data from DESI DR2 combined with SN measurements (from DES, Union3 or Pantheon+) and reproduces the same significance as CPL parametrization with the added benefit of providing a natural explanation for the apparent phantom behavior ($w&lt;-1$) reported by DESI and DES based on a physical model. DESI and SN datasets independently favor non-zero values of $c'$ and $c$, respectively, both lying within the expected $\mathcal{O}(1)$ range suggested by the Swampland criteria. Moreover, our best fit value $c'\simeq 0.05 \pm 0.01$ is remarkably consistent with the experimental upper bound of $c'\lesssim 0.2$ demanded by the lack of detection of fifth force in the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Testing Planck 2020 and DESI data on wCDM Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11237v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work delves into the dynamical dark energy models of the wCDM parameterisation that are defined by their equation of state by comparing different, well-known parameterisation models, in an attempt to lessen the tensions of {H_0} and {\sigma_8} by using the latest observational data. This research also tested the newer Planck likelihood and compared it to the previously released dataset of Planck 2018 and the newer BAO data of DESI. The data that was used were: the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data of Planck 2018 and Planck 2020 data; Cosmic Chronometers (CC), a sample of Supernovae Type Ia; and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). A Bayesian analysis was performed to produce the results needed for the analysis. From the analyses, the best-fit values of the parameters show that almost all models are in favour of a phantom Universe when early-time data was used and favours a quintessence Universe when combinations of early-time and late-time data was considered. This study also showed that the new tested data constrained the models better than the previous ones, while also showing that the observation data supports the {\Lambda}CDM model over the dynamical dark energy models</description>

      <title>The impact of faint AGN discovered by JWST on reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relative contribution of emission from stellar sources and accretion onto supermassive black holes to reionization has been brought into focus again by the apparent high abundance of faint Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) at $4\lesssim z\lesssim11$ uncovered by JWST. We investigate here the contribution of these faint AGN to hydrogen and the early stages of helium reionization using the GPU-based radiative transfer code ATON-HE by post-processing a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation from the sherwood-relics suite of simulations. We study four models: two galaxy-only late-end reionization models, a QSO-assisted and a QSO-only model. In the QSO-assisted model, 1% of the haloes host AGN, with AGN luminosities scaled to contribute 17% of the total hydrogen-ionizing emissivity. In the QSO-only model, quasars account for all the hydrogen-ionizing emissivity, with 10% of the haloes hosting AGN. The SED of AGN is assumed to be a power-law with $\alpha=-1.7$ each with a 10 Myr lifetime. All models are calibrated to the observed mean Lyman-$\alpha$ forest transmission at $5\lesssim z\lesssim6.2$. The QSO-assisted model requires an emissivity similar to the galaxy-only models and fits the observed distribution of the Lyman-$\alpha$ optical depths well. The QSO-only model is inconsistent with the observed Lyman-$\alpha$ optical depths distribution, and produces excessively high IGM temperatures at $z\lesssim 5$ due to an early onset of HeII reionization, unless the escape fraction of HeII-ionizing photons is assumed to be low. Our results suggest that a modest AGN contribution to reionization aligns with the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data, whereas an AGN dominated scenario is difficult to reconcile.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Resonant Transitions of Tidally Perturbed Gravitational Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light bosons can form a gravitational atom (GA) around a spinning black hole through the superradiance process. Considering the black hole to be part of a binary system, the tidal potential of the companion periodically perturbs the GA such that an ``atomic'' transition occurs between two of its energy eigenstates. The resonant transition is modeled by the Landau-Zener system, where the orbital frequency of the companion determines the relevant transition. In this work, we study a novel gravitational wave signal originating directly from the level transition of the GA in a binary system. We derive the analytical formulae of both the strain waveform and frequency spectrum of the signal. We further investigate the GA-binary systems that can have a large signal-to-noise ratio in the milli-Hz to deci-Hz frequency band. Using the future space-based gravitational wave observatory DECIGO, we find the signal-to-noise ratio is $\mathcal{O}(10-200)$ for the fine-structure constant $\alpha\simeq 0.3$, host black hole mass $M= 150M_\odot$ and boson mass $\mu \simeq 10^{-13} \rm eV$ at a distance within 100 kpc.</description>

      <title>Holographic Entanglement Entropy in the FLRW Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute a holographic entanglement entropy via Ryu--Takayanagi prescription in the three-dimensional Friedmann--Lema\^itre--Robertson--Walker universe. We consider two types of holographic scenarios analogous to the static patch holography and the half de Sitter holography, in which the holographic boundary is timelike and placed in the bulk. We find in general that the strong subadditivity can be satisfied only in the former type and in addition the holographic boundary has to fit inside the apparent horizon. Also, for the universe filled with an ideal fluid of constant equation of state $w&lt;-1$, the condition is sharpened as that the holographic boundary has to fit inside the event horizon instead. These conditions provide a necessary condition for the dual quantum field theory to be standard and compatible with the strong subadditivity.</description>

      <title>A catalog to unite them all: REGALADE, a revised galaxy compilation for the advanced detector era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many applications in transient science, gravitational wave follow-up, and galaxy population studies require all-sky galaxy catalogs with reliable distances, extents, and stellar masses. However, existing catalogs often lack completeness beyond $\sim 100$ Mpc, suffer from stellar contamination, or do not provide homogeneous stellar mass estimates and size information. Our goal is to build a high-purity, high-completeness, all-sky galaxy catalog out to 2,000 Mpc, specifically designed to support time-domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. We combined major galaxy catalogs and deep imaging surveys -- including the Legacy Surveys, Pan-STARRS, DELVE, and SDSS -- and added spectroscopic, photometric, and redshift-independent distances. We cleaned the sample using the Gaia catalog to remove stars, and visually inspected all ambiguous cases below 100 Mpc through a classification platform that gathered 20,000 expert votes. Stellar masses were estimated using optical and mid-infrared profile-fit photometry, and we improved the accuracy of photometric distances by combining multiple independent estimates. The resulting catalog, REGALADE, includes nearly 80 million galaxies with distances under 2,000 Mpc. It provides stellar masses for 88\% of the sample and ellipse fits for 80\%. REGALADE is more than 90\% complete for massive galaxies out to 360 Mpc. In science tests, it recovers 60\% more known supernova hosts, doubles the number of low-luminosity transient hosts, and identifies more reliable hosts for ultraluminous and hyperluminous X-ray sources. REGALADE is the most complete and reliable all-sky galaxy catalog to date for the nearby Universe, built for real-world applications in transient and multi-messenger astrophysics. The full dataset, visual classifications, and code will be released to support broad community use.</description>
