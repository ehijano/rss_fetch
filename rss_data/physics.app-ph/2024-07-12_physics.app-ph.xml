      <title>Detecting and Focusing on a Nonlinear Target in a Complex Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wavefront shaping techniques allow waves to be focused on a diffraction-limited target deep inside disordered media. To identify the target position, a guidestar is required that typically emits a frequency-shifted signal. Here we present a noninvasive matrix approach operating at a single frequency only, based on the variation of the field scattered by a nonlinear target illuminated at two incident powers. The local perturbation induced by the nonlinearity serves as a guide for identifying optimal incident wavefronts. We demonstrate maximal focusing on electronic devices embedded in chaotic microwave cavities and extend our approach to temporal signals. Finally, we exploit the programmability offered by reconfigurable smart surfaces to enhance the intensity delivered to a nonlinear target. Our results pave the way for deep imaging protocols that use any type of nonlinearity as feedback, requiring only the measurement of a monochromatic scattering matrix.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Thermal Transport in Tunable Self-Assembled Nanocrystal Supercrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing tunable functional materials with built-in nanoscale heat flow directionality represents a significant challenge with the potential to enable novel thermal management strategies. Here we use spatiotemporally-resolved thermoreflectance to visualize lateral thermal transport anisotropy in self-assembled supercrystals of anisotropic Au nanocrystals. Correlative electron and thermoreflectance microscopy reveal that heat predominantly flows along the long-axis of the anisotropic nanocrystals, and does so across grain boundaries and curved assemblies while voids disrupt heat flow. We finely control the anisotropy via the aspect ratio of constituent nanorods, and it exceeds the aspect ratio for nano-bipyramid supercrystals and certain nanorod arrangements. Finite element simulations and effective medium modeling rationalize the emergent anisotropic behavior in terms of a simple series resistance model, further providing a framework for estimating thermal anisotropy as a function of material and structural parameters. Self-assembly of colloidal nanocrystals promises a novel route to direct heat flow in a wide range of applications that utilize this important class of materials.</description>

      <title>Domain-stored skyrmion structures for a reading error-detectable racetrack memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic racetrack memory (RTM) uses a series of either domains or skyrmions as data bits along nanowires. However, it lacks reading error detection capability in nanowires, which requires high electric current density for the deterministic motion of domain walls (DWs) or skyrmions. Here, we propose a method of a reading error-detectable RTM and explore domain-stored skyrmion structures for this RTM. This method uses domains as memory cells and assigns the presence and absence of a skyrmion in a domain to different bits, enabling the electrical signal of any memory cells to output the opposite sign to that of the adjacent memory cells. Using simulations and Lorentz microscopy, we demonstrate that perpendicularly magnetized nanowires with relatively large Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction can achieve domain-stored skyrmion structures. Additionally, our simulations show that when DWs approach to skyrmions during spin-orbit torque-induced motion, angular momentum transfers from DWs to skyrmions, resulting in fast motion of skyrmions.</description>

      <title>Cavity Formation in Silica-Filled Rubber Compounds Observed During Deformation by Ultra Small-Angle X-Ray Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When silica-filled rubber compounds are deformed, structural modifications in the material's bulk lead to irreversible damage, the most significant of which is cavitation appearing within the interfaces of interconnected polymer and filler networks. This work introduces a new method to analyze cavitation in industrial-grade rubbers based on Ultra Small-Angle X-ray Scattering. This method employs a specially designed multi-sample stretching device for high-throughput measurements with statistical relevance. The proposed data reduction approach allows for early detection and quantification of cavitation while providing at the same time information on the hierarchical filler structures at length scales ranging from the primary particle size to large silica agglomerates over four orders of magnitude. To validate the method, the scattering of SSBR rubber compounds filled with highly dispersible silica at different ratios was measured under quasi-static strain. The strain was applied in incremental steps up to a maximum achievable elongation or breakage of the sample. From the measurements performed in multiple repetitions, it was found that the minimum strain necessary for cavity formation and the size evolution of the cavities with increasing strain are comparable between these samples. The sample with the highest polymer content showed the lowest rate of cavity formation and higher durability of silica structures. The structural stability of the compounds was determined by the evolution of the filler hierarchical structures, obtained by fitting data across the available strain range.</description>

      <title>Study of a Novel Capacitive Pressure Sensor Using Spiral Comb Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For traditional capacitive pressure sensors, high nonlinearity and poor sensitivity greatly limited their sensing applications. Hence, an innovative design of capacitors based on spiral comb electrodes is proposed for high-sensitivity pressure detection in this work. Compared to traditional capacitive pressure sensors with straight plate electrodes, the proposed sensor with the spiral electrodes increases the overlap areas of electrodes sufficiently, the pressure sensitivity can thus be greatly improved. Moreover, the capacitance variation of the proposed sensor is dominated by the change of the overlap area of the electrodes rather than the electrode's distance, the linearity can also thus be improved to higher than 0.99. Theoretical analysis and COMSOL-based finite element simulation have been implemented for principle verification and performance optimization. Simulation results show that the proposed design has a mechanical sensitivity of 1.5x10-4 m/Pa, capacitive sensitivity of 1.10 aF/Pa, and nonlinear error of 3.63%, respectively, at the pressure range from 0 to 30 kPa. An equivalent experiment has been further carried out for verification. Experimental results also show that both the sensitivity and linearity of capacitive pressure sensors with spiral electrodes are higher than those with straight electrodes. This work not only provides a new avenue for capacitor design, but also can be applied to high-sensitivity pressure detection.</description>

      <title>Source-Independent Fault Detection Method for Transmission Lines in IBR-Dominated Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a source-independent method for the detection and classification of faults along Transmission Lines (TLs). It aims to reduce the protection issues arising from Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs). Inspired by Power Line Communication (PLC), the proposed method utilizes high-frequency carrier waves which are sent from either side of a TL over each phase. As faults disrupt the propagation of carriers, the receiving carrier waves before and during faults exhibit differences. Based on this principle, the proposed method continuously compares the receiving carrier waves with a short history of them to detect and classify faults. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using EMTP-RV and MATLAB, and compared to traditional phasor-based distance relays. The simulation results confirm the capability of the proposed method in detection and classification of different faults regardless of power sources types.</description>

      <title>SciQu: Accelerating Materials Properties Prediction with Automated Literature Mining for Self-Driving Laboratories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessing different material properties to predict specific attributes, such as band gap, resistivity, young modulus, work function, and refractive index, is a fundamental requirement for materials science-based applications. However, the process is time-consuming and often requires extensive literature reviews and numerous experiments. Our study addresses these challenges by leveraging machine learning to analyze material properties with greater precision and efficiency. By automating the data extraction process and using the extracted information to train machine learning models, our developed model, SciQu, optimizes material properties. As a proof of concept, we predicted the refractive index of materials using data extracted from numerous research articles with SciQu, considering input descriptors such as space group, volume, and bandgap with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) 0.068 and R2 0.94. Thus, SciQu not only predicts the properties of materials but also plays a key role in self-driving laboratories by optimizing the synthesis parameters to achieve precise shape, size, and phase of the materials subjected to the input parameters.</description>

      <title>Spatially-extended nonlinear generation of short-wavelength spin waves in YIG nanowaveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally study nonlinear propagation of spin waves in microscopic yttrium iron garnet waveguides, where the dispersion spectrum is engineered to enable efficient four-magnon interactions over a wide range of wavelengths. We show that under these conditions, the initial monochromatic spin wave nonlinearly generates co-propagating spin waves with well-defined, discrete frequencies. This process is characterized by a low energy threshold and can be observed in a wide range of frequencies and excitation powers. Thanks to the engineered dispersion, the process allows the generation of waves with short wavelengths that cannot be excited directly by a linear excitation mechanism. The nonlinearly generated short-wavelength spin waves continuously acquire the energy from the initial pump wave during co-propagation, which results in compensation of their propagation losses over significant distances. The observed phenomena can be used to implement frequency- and wavelength-conversion operations in magnonic nanodevices and circuits.</description>

      <title>Magic silicon dioxide for widely tunable integrated photonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated photonic circuits have transformed data communication, biosensing, and light detection and ranging, and hold wide-ranging potential for optical computing, optical imaging and signal processing. These applications often require tunable and reconfigurable photonic components, most commonly accomplished through the thermo-optic effect. However, the resulting tuning window is limited for standard optical materials such as silicon dioxide and silicon nitride. Most importantly, bidirectional thermal tuning on a single platform has not been realized. For the first time, we show that by tuning and optimizing the deposition conditions in inductively-coupled plasma chemical vapor deposition (ICPCVD) of silicon dioxide, this material can be used to deterministically tune the thermo-optic properties of optical devices without introducing significant losses. We demonstrate that we can deterministically integrate positive and negative wavelength shifts on a single chip, validated on amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC), silicon nitride (SiN) and silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platforms. We observe up to a 10-fold improvement of the thermo-optic tunability and, in addition, demonstrate athermal ring resonators with shifts as low as 1.5 pm/{\deg}C. This enables the fabrication of a novel tunable coupled ring optical waveguide (CROW) requiring only a single heater. In addition, the low-temperature deposition of our silicon dioxide cladding can be combined with lift-off to isolate the optical devices resulting in a decrease in thermal crosstalk by at least two orders of magnitude. Our method paves the way for novel photonic architectures incorporating bidirectional thermo-optic tunability.</description>

      <title>Patterns of link reciprocity in directed, signed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most of the analyses concerning signed networks have focused on the balance theory, hence identifying frustration with undirected, triadic motifs having an odd number of negative edges; much less attention has been paid to their directed counterparts. To fill this gap, we focus on signed, directed connections, with the aim of exploring the notion of frustration in such a context. When dealing with signed, directed edges, frustration is a multi-faceted concept, admitting different definitions at different scales: if we limit ourselves to consider cycles of length two, frustration is related to reciprocity, i.e. the tendency of edges to admit the presence of partners pointing in the opposite direction. As the reciprocity of signed networks is still poorly understood, we adopt a principled approach for its study, defining quantities and introducing models to consistently capture empirical patterns of the kind. In order to quantify the tendency of empirical networks to form either mutualistic or antagonistic cycles of length two, we extend the Exponential Random Graphs framework to binary, directed, signed networks with global and local constraints and, then, compare the empirical abundance of the aforementioned patterns with the one expected under each model. We find that the (directed extension of the) balance theory is not capable of providing a consistent explanation of the patterns characterising the directed, signed networks considered in this work. Although part of the ambiguities can be solved by adopting a coarser definition of balance, our results call for a different theory, accounting for the directionality of edges in a coherent manner. In any case, the evidence that the empirical, signed networks can be highly reciprocated leads us to recommend to explicitly account for the role played by bidirectional dyads in determining frustration at higher levels (e.g. the triadic one).</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Crystallization and Phase Transition of Niobium Dioxide Thin-Films for Neuromorphic Computing Applications Using a Tube Furnace Optical Transmission System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Significant research has focused on low-power stochastic devices built from memristive materials. These devices foster neuromorphic approaches to computational efficiency enhancement in merged biomimetic and CMOS architectures due to their ability to phase transition from a dielectric to a metal at an increased temperature. Niobium dioxide has a volatile memristive phase change that occurs $\sim$800$^\circ$C~that makes it an ideal candidate for future neuromorphic electronics. A straightforward optical system has been developed on a horizontal tube furnace for \emph{in situ} spectral measurements as an as-grown \NbtOf\ film is annealed and ultimately crystallizes as \NbOt. The system measures the changing spectral transmissivity of \NbtOf\ as it undergoes both reduction and crystallization processes. We were also able to measure the transition from metallic-to-non-metallic \NbOt\ during the cooldown phase, which is shown to occur about 100$^\circ$C~ lower on a sapphire substrate than fused silica. After annealing, the material properties of the \NbtOf\ and \NbOt\ were assessed via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and 4-point resistivity, confirming that we have made crystalline \NbOt.</description>

      <title>Domain wall and Magnetic Tunnel Junction Hybrid for on-chip Learning in UNet architecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present spintronic devices based hardware implementation of UNet for segmentation tasks. Our approach involves designing hardware for convolution, deconvolution, rectified activation function (ReLU), and max pooling layers of the UNet architecture. We designed the convolution and deconvolution layers of the network using the synaptic behavior of the domain wall MTJ. We also construct the ReLU and max pooling functions of the network utilizing the spin hall driven orthogonal current injected MTJ. To incorporate the diverse physics of spin-transport, magnetization dynamics, and CMOS elements in our UNet design, we employ a hybrid simulation setup that couples micromagnetic simulation, non-equilibrium Green's function, SPICE simulation along with network implementation. We evaluate our UNet design on the CamVid dataset and achieve segmentation accuracies of 83.71$\%$ on test data, on par with the software implementation with 821mJ of energy consumption for on-chip training over 150 epochs. We further demonstrate nearly one order $(10\times)$ improvement in the energy requirement of the network using unstable ferromagnet ($\Delta$=4.58) over the stable ferromagnet ($\Delta$=45) based ReLU and max pooling functions while maintaining the similar accuracy. The hybrid architecture comprising domain wall MTJ and unstable FM-based MTJ leads to an on-chip energy consumption of 85.79mJ during training, with a testing energy cost of 1.55 $\mu J$.</description>

      <title>Aluminium nanoparticle-based ultra-wideband high-performance polarizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06873v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The polarizer-based device industry is expanding quickly, requiring high-quality research on nanoscale wideband polarizers. Here, we investigated the possibility of utilizing Al dimer nanostructures on broad-band polarizers. Metals are always considered promising candidates for reflection-based polarizer development because of their high extinction ratio. This study proposes a nanoparticle polarizer comprised of semi-immersed Al nanodimers with a 200 nm radius on a CaF_2 substrate. Our proposed polarizer has effective polarization anisotropy in the near-infrared (NIR) and THz range. This study includes calculating performance parameters for the extraction of the proposed polarizer, including insertion loss, extinction ratio (ER), Mueller matrix values, and polarization ellipse diagram. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation-based results suggested obtaining more than 55 dB extinction ratio for the 0.2 to 9 THz range. The average extinction ratio and insertion loss over the 1-1665 micrometer wavelength were 29.01 dB and ~1 dB, respectively. We have reviewed recent reports of similar nanoparticle and wire grid-based polarizers to evaluate our Al nanodimer-based polarizer and performed a comparative analysis. The idea of Al dimer and the insight gained from the results extracted from the rigorous simulation report suggested a great opportunity for developing micro-scale metallic wideband polarizers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a concept for selective excitation of magnetostatic surface waves with quasi-discrete spectrum using spatially patterned femtosecond laser pulses inducing either ultrafast change of magnetic anisotropy or inverse Faraday effect. We micromagnetically simulate excitation of the waves with periodically patterned uni- or bipolar laser impact. Such excitation yields multiple wavepackets propagating with different group velocities, whose dispersion corresponds to the set of quasi-discrete points. In addition, we show that the frequency of the spectral peaks can be controlled by the polarity of the periodic impact and its spatial period. Presented consideration of multiple spatially periodic magnetostatic surface wave sources as a whole enables implementation of a comprehensive toolkit of spatio-temporal optical methods for tunable excitation and control of spin wave parameters</description>

Abstract: The effect of non-planar substrate surface on homogeneity and quality of cold sprayed (CS) deposits was studied by scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM). Fe coatings were cold sprayed onto Al substrates containing artificially introduced grooves of square- and trapezoid-shaped geometries, with flat or cylindrical bottoms. The Al substrates were either wrought or cold sprayed, to comprehend their prospective influence on the Fe coatings build-up. SAM was then used to assess morphological properties of the materials from the cross-view and top-view directions. The microstructure below the surface of the studied samples was visualized by measuring the amplitudes of the reflection echoes and the velocity of the ultrasonic waves. The SAM analysis revealed that the regions of coating imperfections around the grooves are larger than what is suggested by standard scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations. Furthermore, we found that the seemingly non-influenced coating regions that appear perfectly homogeneous and dense in SEM do, in fact, possess heterogeneous microstructure associated with the individual CS nozzle passes.</description>

Abstract: Over the past two decades, photonics have been developed as technological solutions for astronomical instrumentation for, e.g., near-infrared spectroscopy and long baseline interferometry. With increasing instrument capabilities, large quantities of high precision optical components are required to guide, manipulate, and analyze the light from astronomical sources. Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) and fiber-based devices offer enormous potential for astronomical instrumentation, as they can reduce the amount of bulky free-space optics and pave the way for innovative solutions. Astrophotonic devices are particularly interesting for interferometry due to their compact design on the centimeter scale, even for a large number of telescope inputs. Already, astrophotonic components are integrated in high-end instruments at the VLTI and at the CHARA Array. Photonic beam combiners at wavelengths from visible to mid-infrared have been fabricated using lithographic techniques or ultrafast-laser inscription, with several components tested on-sky. This paper will provide a glimpse into the growing field of astrophotonics, its current status and potential for new technologies.</description>
