      <title>Ultrasoft state of microquasar Cygnus X-3: X-ray polarimetry reveals the geometry of astronomical puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cygnus X-3 is an enigmatic X-ray binary, that is both an exceptional accreting system and a cornerstone for the population synthesis studies. Prominent X-ray and radio properties follow a well-defined pattern, yet the physical reasons for the state changes observed in this system are not known. Recently, the presence of an optically thick envelope around the central source in the hard state was revealed using the X-ray polarization data obtained with Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). In this work, we analyse IXPE data obtained in the ultrasoft (radio quenched) state of the source. The average polarization degree (PD) of $11.9\pm0.5\%$ at a polarization angle (PA) of $94^{\circ}\pm1^{\circ}$ is inconsistent with the simple geometry of the accretion disc viewed at an intermediate inclination. The high PD, the blackbody-like spectrum, and the weakness of fluorescent iron line imply that the central source is hidden behind the optically thick outflow and its beamed radiation is scattered towards our line of sight. In this picture the observed PD is directly related to the source inclination, which we conservatively determine to lie in the range $26^{\circ}&lt;i&lt;28^{\circ}$. Using the new polarimetric properties, we propose the scenario that can be responsible for the cyclic behaviour of the state changes in the binary.</description>

      <title>Evolution of High-energy Electron Distribution in Pulsar Wind Nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 17 powerful (with a spin-down luminosity greater than $10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$) young (with an age less than 15000 yrs) pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) using a simple time-independent one-zone emission model. Our aim is to investigate correlations between model parameters and the ages of the corresponding PWNe, thereby revealing the evolution of high-energy electron distributions within PWNe. Our findings are as follows: (1) The electron distributions in PWNe can be characterized by a double power-law with a superexponential cutoff; (2) As PWNe evolve, the high-energy end of the electron distribution spectrum becomes harder with the index decreasing from approximately 3.5 to 2.5, while the low-energy end spectrum index remains constant near 1.5; (3) There is no apparent correlation between the break energy or cutoff energy and the age of PWNe. (4) The average magnetic field within PWNe decreases with age, leading to a positive correlation between the energy loss timescale of electrons at the break energy or the high-energy cutoff, and the age of the PWN. (5) The total electron energy within PWNe remains constant near $2 \times 10^{48}$ erg, while the total magnetic energy decreases with age.</description>

      <title>Mirage Sources and Large TeV Halo-Pulsar Offsets: Exploring the Parameter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the asymmetric propagation of 100 TeV electrons (whose radiation mainly concentrates on 20--30 TeV) in turbulent magnetic fields around pulsars, using GPU-accelerated simulations to explore their trajectories and interactions within pulsar wind nebulae and the interstellar medium. Key results include the identification of ``mirage'' sources indicating significant offsets in high-energy emissions from their originating pulsars, challenging the results of traditional symmetric diffusion models. By varying parameters like source distance, magnetic field strength, and electron injection spectral index, the study delineates their effects on observable phenomena such as the probability that a source has at least one mirage around it, as well as the source separation. Our results offer insights into some puzzling sources observed recently by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), and shed light on the cosmic-ray transport mechanism in the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the Gamma-Ray Bursts prompt emission under the relativistically expanding fireball scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral properties of a composite thermal emission arising from a relativistic expanding fireball can be remarkably different from the Planck function. We perform a detailed study of such a system to explore the features of the prompt emission spectra from the gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Particularly, we address the effect of optical opacity and its dependence on the density profile between the expanding gas and the observer. This results in a nontrivial shape of the photospheric radius which in combination with the constraints derived from the equal-arrival-time can result in a mild broader spectrum compared to the Planck function. Further, we show the time-integrated spectrum from the expanding fireball deviates significantly from the instantaneous emission and is capable of explaining the observed broad spectral width of the GRBs. We also show, that the demand of the spectral width of the order of unity, obtained through statistical analysis, is consistent with the scenario where the dynamics of the expanding fireball are governed predominantly by the energy content of the matter.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Emission and Morphology of the Unidentified Gamma-Ray Source TeV J2032+4130</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first TeV gamma-ray source with no lower energy counterparts, TeV J2032+4130, was discovered by HEGRA. It appears in the third HAWC catalog as 3HWC J2031+415 and it is a bright TeV gamma-ray source whose emission has previously been resolved as 2 sources: HAWC J2031+415 and HAWC J2030+409. While HAWC J2030+409 has since been associated with the \emph{Fermi-LAT} Cygnus Cocoon, no such association for HAWC J2031+415 has yet been found. In this work, we investigate the spectrum and energy-dependent morphology of HAWC J2031+415. We associate HAWC J2031+415 with the pulsar PSR J2032+4127 and perform a combined multi-wavelength analysis using radio, X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray emission. We conclude that HAWC J2031+415 and, by extension, TeV J2032+4130 are most probably a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) powered by PSR J2032+4127.</description>

      <title>XMM-Newton and NuSTAR discovery of a likely IP candidate XMMU J173029.8-330920 in the Galactic Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim at characterizing the population of low-luminosity X-ray sources in the Galactic plane by studying their X-ray spectra and periodic signals in the light curves. We are performing an X-ray survey of the Galactic disk using XMM-Newton, and the source XMMU J173029.8-330920 was serendipitously discovered in our campaign. We performed a follow-up observation of the source using our pre-approved NuSTAR target of opportunity time. We used various phenomenological models in xspec for the X-ray spectral modeling. We also computed the Lomb-Scargle periodogram to search for X-ray periodicity. A Monte Carlo method was used to simulate 1000 artificial light curves to estimate the significance of the detected period. We also searched for X-ray, optical, and infrared counterparts of the source in various catalogs. The spectral modeling indicates the presence of an intervening cloud with $N_{\rm H}\sim(1.5-2.3)\times10^{23}\ \rm cm^{-2}$ that partially absorbs the incoming X-ray photons. The X-ray spectra are best fit by a model representing emission from a collisionally ionized diffuse gas with plasma temperature $kT=26^{+11}_{-5}$ keV. Furthermore, an Fe $K_{\alpha}$ line at $6.47^{+0.13}_{-0.06}$ keV was detected with an equivalent width of the line of $312\pm104$ eV. We discovered a coherent pulsation with a period of $521.7\pm0.8$ s. The 3-10 keV pulsed fraction of the source is around $\sim$50-60\%. The hard X-ray emission with plasma temperature $kT=26^{+11}_{-5}$ keV, iron $K_{\alpha}$ emission at 6.4 keV and a periodic behavior of $521.7\pm0.8$ s suggest XMMU J173029.8-33092 to be an intermediate polar. We estimated the mass of the central white dwarf to be $0.94-1.4\ M_{\odot}$ by assuming a distance to the source of $\sim1.4-5$ kpc.</description>

      <title>Timing of millisecond pulsars in NGC\,6752 -- III. On the presence of non-luminous matter in the cluster's core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars are subject to accelerations in globular clusters that manifest themselves in both the first and second spin period time derivatives, and can be used to explore the mass distribution of the potentials they inhabit. Here we report on over 20 years of pulsar timing observations of five millisecond radio pulsars in the core of the core-collapse globular cluster NGC\,6752 with the Parkes (Murriyang) and MeerKAT radio telescopes, that have allowed us to measure the proper motions, positions and first and second time derivatives of the pulsars. The pulsar timing parameters indicate that all the pulsars in the core experience accelerations and jerks that can be explained only if an amount of non-luminous mass of at least $2.56\times10^3M_\odot$ is resent in the core of NGC\,6752. On the other hand, our studies highly disfavour the presence of an intermediate mass black hole at the center of the cluster, with a mass equal to or greater than $\sim3000M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Large-scale ordered magnetic fields generated in mergers of helium white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar mergers are one important path to highly magnetised stars. Mergers of two low-mass white dwarfs may create up to every third hot subdwarf star. The merging process is usually assumed to dramatically amplify magnetic fields. However, so far only four highly magnetised hot subdwarf stars have been found, suggesting a fraction of less than $1\%$.
  We present two high-resolution magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of the merger of two helium white dwarfs in a binary system with the same total mass of $0.6\,M_\odot$. We analyse one equal-mass merger with two $0.3\,M_\odot$ white dwarfs, and one unequal-mass merger with a $0.25\,M_\odot$ white dwarf and a $0.35\,M_\odot$ white dwarf. We simulate the inspiral, merger, and further evolution of the merger remnant for about $50$ rotations.
  We find efficient magnetic field amplification in both mergers via a small-scale dynamo, reproducing previous results of stellar merger simulations. The magnetic field saturates at similar strength for both simulations.
  We then identify a second phase of magnetic field amplification in both merger remnants that happens on a timescale of several tens of rotational periods of the merger remnant. This phase generates a large-scale ordered azimuthal field. We identify it as a large-scale dynamo driven by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI).
  Finally, we suggest that in the unequal-mass merger remnant, helium burning will eventually start in a shell around a cold core. The convection zone this generates will coincide with the region that contains most of the magnetic energy, probably erasing the strong, ordered field. The equal-mass merger remnant instead will probably ignite burning in the center, retaining its ordered field. Therefore, the mass ratio of the initial merger could be the selecting factor that decides if a merger remnant will stay highly magnetised long after the merger.</description>

      <title>On the response of massive main sequence stars to mass accretion and outflow at high rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With a one-dimensional stellar evolution model, we find that massive main-sequence stars can accrete mass at very high mass accretion rates without expanding much if they lose a significant fraction of this mass from their outer layers simultaneously with mass accretion. We assume the accretion process is via an accretion disk that launches powerful jets from its inner zones. These jets remove the outer high-entropy layers of the mass-accreting star. This process operates in a negative feedback cycle, as the jets remove more envelope mass when the star expands. With the one-dimensional model, we mimic the mass removal by jets by alternative mass addition and mass removal phases. For the simulated models of 30Mo and 60Mo, the star does not expand much if we remove more than about half of the added mass in not-too-short episodes. This holds even if we deposit the energy the jets do not carry into the envelope. As the star does not expand much, its gravitational potential well stays deep, and the jets are energetic. These results are relevant to bright transient events of binary systems powered by accretion and the launching of jets, e.g., intermediate luminosity optical transients, including some luminous red novae, the grazing envelope evolution, and the 1837-1856 Great Eruption of Eta Carinae.</description>

      <title>Exploring pulsar glitches with dipolar supersolids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glitches are sudden spin-up events that interrupt the gradual spin-down of rotating neutron stars. They are believed to arise from the rapid unpinning of vortices in the neutron star inner crust. The analogy between the inner crust of neutron stars and dipolar supersolids allows to investigate glitches. Employing such analogy, we numerically analyze the vortex trapping mechanism and how the matter density distribution influences glitches. These results pave the way for the quantum simulation of celestial bodies in laboratories.</description>

      <title>An Optically Targeted Search for Gravitational Waves emitted by Core-Collapse Supernovae during the Third Observing Run of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results from a search for gravitational-wave transients associated with core-collapse supernovae observed optically within 30 Mpc during the third observing run of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. No gravitational wave associated with a core-collapse supernova has been identified. We then report the detection efficiency for a variety of possible gravitational-wave emissions. For neutrino-driven explosions, the distance at which we reach 50% detection efficiency is up to 8.9 kpc, while more energetic magnetorotationally-driven explosions are detectable at larger distances. The distance reaches for selected models of the black hole formation, and quantum chromodynamics phase transition are also provided. We then constrain the core-collapse supernova engine across a wide frequency range from 50 Hz to 2 kHz. The upper limits on gravitational-wave energy and luminosity emission are at low frequencies down to $10^{-4}\,M_\odot c^2$ and $6 \times 10^{-4}\,M_\odot c^2$/s, respectively. The upper limits on the proto-neutron star ellipticity are down to 3 at high frequencies. Finally, by combining the results obtained with the data from the first and second observing runs of LIGO and Virgo, we improve the constraints of the parameter spaces of the extreme emission models. Specifically, the proto-neutron star ellipticities for the long-lasting bar mode model are down to 1 for long emission (1 s) at high frequency.</description>

      <title>Perturbing the Stable Accretion Disk in Kerr and 4-D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravities: Comprehensive Analysis of Instabilities and Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of a disturbed accretion disk holds great significance in the realm of astrophysics, as such events play a crucial role in revealing the nature of disk structure, the release of energy, and the generation of shock waves. Consequently, they can help explain the causes of X-ray emissions observed in black hole accretion disk systems. In this paper, we perturb the stable disk formed by spherical accretion around Kerr and EGB black holes. This perturbation reveals one- and two-armed spiral shock waves around the black hole. We find a strong connection between these waves and the black hole spin parameter (a/M) and the EGB coupling constant (\alpha). Specifically, we found that as \alpha increases in the negative direction, the dynamics of the disk and the waves become more chaotic. Additionally, we observe that the angular momentum of the perturbing matter significantly affects mass accretion and the oscillation of the arising shock waves. This allows us to observe changes in QPO frequencies. Particularly, perturbations with angular momentum matching the observed $C-$ type low-frequency QPOs of the GRS 1915 + 105 source. Thus, we conclude that the possibility of the occurrence of shock waves within the vicinity of GRS 1915 + 105 is substantial.</description>

Abstract: Mrk 501 is a prototypical high-synchrotron-peaked blazar (HBL) and serves as one of the primary targets for the {\it Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer} ({\it IXPE}). In this study, we report X-ray polarization measurements of Mrk 501 based on six {\it IXPE} observations. The detection of X-ray polarization at a confidence level exceeding 99\% is achieved in four out of the six observations conducted across the entire energy range (2--8 keV) of {\it IXPE}. The maximum polarization degree ($\Pi_{\rm X}$) is measured to be $15.8\%\pm2.8\%$, accompanied by a polarization angle ($\psi_{\rm X}$) of $98.0\deg\pm5.1\deg$ at a confidence level of $5.6 \sigma$. During the remaining two observations, only an upper limit of $\Pi_{\rm X}&lt;$12\% could be derived at the 99\% confidence level. No temporal variability in polarization is observed throughout all six {\it IXPE} observations for Mrk 501. A discernible trend of energy-dependent variation in the polarization degree is detected in optical spectropolarimetry; however, no analogous indication is observed in $\Pi_{\rm X}$. The chromatic behavior of $\Pi$ and the consistent values of $\psi$ across different frequencies from X-rays to radio waves, along with the agreement between $\psi$ and jet position angle, strongly support the interpretation of the energy-stratified model with shock-accelerated particles in the jet of Mrk 501. Additionally, the possibility of the presence of a global helical magnetic field in the jet of Mrk 501 is discussed.</description>

      <title>Choked precessing jets in tidal disruption events and high-energy neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03139v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been suggested that relativistic jets might have been commonly formed in tidal disruption events (TDEs), but those with relatively weak power could be choked by the surrounding envelope. The discovery of high-energy neutrinos possibly associated with some normal TDEs may support this picture in the hypothesis that the neutrinos are produced by choked jets. Recently, it was noted that disrupted stars generally have misaligned orbits with respect to the supermassive black hole spin axis and highly misaligned precessing jets are more likely to be choked. Here we revisit the jet break-out condition for misaligned precessing jets by considering the jet could be collimated by the cocoon pressure while propagating in the disk wind envelope. The jet head opening angle decreases as the jet propagates in the envelope, but the minimum power of a successful jet remains unchanged in terms of the physical jet power. We further calculate the neutrino flux from choked precessing jets, assuming that the cocoon energy does not exceed the kinetic energy of the disk wind. We find that neutrino flux from highly misaligned choked jets is sufficient to explain the neutrinos from AT2019aalc, while it is marginal to explain the neutrinos from AT2019dsg and AT2019fdr. The latter could be produced by weakly misaligned choked jets, since the duty cycle that the jet sweeps across increases as the misaligned angle decreases. We also show that the population of choked TDE jets could contribute to ~10% of the observed diffuse neutrino flux measured by IceCube.</description>

      <title>Mass composition of ultra-high energy cosmic rays from distribution of their arrival directions with the Telescope Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a new method to estimate the injected mass composition of ultrahigh cosmic rays (UHECRs) at energies higher than 10 EeV. The method is based on comparison of the energy-dependent distribution of cosmic ray arrival directions as measured by the Telescope Array experiment (TA) with that calculated in a given putative model of UHECR under the assumption that sources trace the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe. As we report in the companion letter, the TA data show large deflections with respect to the LSS which can be explained, assuming small extra-galactic magnetic fields (EGMF), by an intermediate composition changing to a heavy one (iron) in the highest energy bin. Here we show that these results are robust to uncertainties in UHECR injection spectra, the energy scale of the experiment and galactic magnetic fields (GMF). The assumption of weak EGMF, however, strongly affects this interpretation at all but the highest energies E &gt; 100 EeV, where the remarkable isotropy of the data implies a heavy injected composition even in the case of strong EGMF. This result also holds if UHECR sources are as rare as $2 \times 10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$, that is the conservative lower limit for the source number density.</description>

      <title>Isotropy of cosmic rays beyond $10^{20}$ eV favors their heavy mass composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report an estimation of the injected mass composition of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) at energies higher than 10 EeV. The composition is inferred from an energy-dependent sky distribution of UHECR events observed by the Telescope Array surface detector by comparing it to the Large Scale Structure of the local Universe. In the case of negligible extra-galactic magnetic fields the results are consistent with a relatively heavy injected composition at E ~ 10 EeV that becomes lighter up to E ~ 100 EeV, while the composition at E &gt; 100 EeV is very heavy. The latter is true even in the presence of highest experimentally allowed extra-galactic magnetic fields, while the composition at lower energies can be light if a strong EGMF is present. The effect of the uncertainty in the galactic magnetic field on these results is subdominant.</description>

      <title>Radiation MHD Simulations of Soft X-ray Emitting Regions in Changing Look AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong soft X-ray emission called soft X-ray excess is often observed in luminous active galactic nuclei (AGN). It has been suggested that the soft X-rays are emitted from a warm ($T=10^6\sim10^7\ \rm{K}$) region that is optically thick for the Thomson scattering (warm Comptonization region). Motivated by the recent observations that soft X-ray excess appears in changing look AGN (CLAGN) during the state transition from a dim state without broad emission lines to a bright state with broad emission lines, we performed global three-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations assuming that the mass accretion rate increases and becomes around $10$\% of the Eddington accretion rate. The simulation successfully reproduces a warm, Thomson-thick region outside the hot radiatively inefficient accretion flow near the black hole. The warm region is formed by efficient radiative cooling due to inverse Compton scattering. The calculated luminosity $0.01L_{{\rm Edd}}-0.08L_{{\rm Edd}}$ is consistent with the luminosity of CLAGN. We also found that the warm Comptonization region is well described by the steady model of magnetized disks supported by azimuthal magnetic fields. When the anti-parallel azimuthal magnetic fields supporting the radiatively cooled region reconnect around the equatorial plane of the disk, the temperature of the region becomes higher by releasing the magnetic energy transported to the region.</description>

      <title>Can we discern millilensed gravitational-wave signals from signals produced by precessing binary black holes with ground-based detectors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07253v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Millilensed gravitational waves (GWs) can potentially be identified by the interference signatures caused by $\sim\!O(10\textrm{--}100)~\textrm{ms}$ time delays between multiple overlapping lensed signals. However, distinguishing millilensed GWs from GWs generated by precessing binary black-hole mergers can be challenging due to their apparent similar waveform shapes. This morphological similarity may be an obstacle to template-based searches to correctly identifying the origin of observed GWs and poses a fundamental question, can we discern millilensed GW signals from signals produced by precessing binary black holes? In this study, we investigate the feasibility of distinguishing between these GWs by performing a proof-of-principle injection study of simulated millilensed precessing GW signals, within the context of ground-based LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network detections. Our findings indicate that it is possible to differentiate between the two effects by comparing signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) computed using templates based on different hypotheses for the target signal. We further show from the parameter estimation study that while lensing magnification is sensitive to precession, it is possible to identify millilensing in precessing GW signals with an SNR of 18. The recovery of precession in the presence of lensing is more challenging but improves significantly for signals with an SNR of 40. Nonetheless, neglecting millilensing effects results in biases in the recovered spins, revealing the importance of accounting for these effects in accurate GW signal analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present shower formation constraints on the Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) energy scale for photons with cubic dispersion relation from recent gamma ray observations in $100$ TeV -- PeV energy range by LHAASO observatory. We assume Myers-Pospelov effective field theory framework, and calculate the suppression for the Bethe-Heitler process which is mainly responsible for the formation of photon-initiated atmosphere showers. Comparing the high-energy photon events with the suppressed flux predictions we obtain $95\%$ CL constraints on the LIV energy scale. The obtained shower constraint $E_{\rm LIV} \gtrsim \mathcal{O} \left( 10^{20} \mbox{ GeV}\right)$ is significantly weaker than existing birefringence constraints but is independent.</description>

      <title>A unified accretion disc model for supermassive black holes in galaxy formation simulations: method and implementation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well established that supermassive black hole (SMBH) feedback is crucial for regulating the evolution of massive, if not all, galaxies. However, modelling the interplay between SMBHs and their host galaxies is challenging due to the vast dynamic range. Previous simulations have utilized simple subgrid models for SMBH accretion, while recent advancements track the properties of the unresolved accretion disc, usually based on the thin $\alpha$-disc model. However, this neglects accretion in the radiatively inefficient regime, expected to occur through a thick disc for a significant portion of an SMBH's lifetime. To address this, we present a novel 'unified' accretion disc model for SMBHs, harnessing results from the analytical advection-dominated inflow-outflow solution (ADIOS) model and state-of-the-art GR(R)MHD simulations. Going from low to high Eddington ratios, our model transitions from an ADIOS flow to a thin $\alpha$-disc via a truncated disc, incorporating self-consistently SMBH spin evolution due to Lense-Thirring precession. Utilizing the moving mesh code AREPO, we perform simulations of single and binary SMBHs within gaseous discs to validate our model and assess its impact. The disc state significantly affects observable luminosities, and we predict markedly different electromagnetic counterparts in SMBH binaries. Crucially, the assumed disc model shapes SMBH spin magnitudes and orientations, parameters that gravitational wave observatories like LISA and IPTA are poised to constrain. Our simulations emphasize the importance of accurately modelling SMBH accretion discs and spin evolution, as they modulate the available accretion power, profoundly shaping the interaction between SMBHs and their host galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Symbiotic X-ray Binary IGR J16194-2810: A Window on the Future Evolution of Wide Neutron Star Binaries From Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present optical follow-up of IGR J16194-2810, a hard X-ray source discovered by the INTEGRAL mission. The optical counterpart is a $\sim500\,L_\odot$ red giant at a distance of $2.1$ kpc. We measured 17 radial velocities (RVs) of the giant over a period of $271$ days. Fitting these RVs with a Keplerian model, we find an orbital period of $P_{\rm orb} = 192.73 \pm 0.01$ days and a companion mass function $f(M_2) = 0.365 \pm 0.003 \,M_{\odot}$. We detect ellipsoidal variability with the same period in optical light curves from the ASAS-SN survey. Joint fitting of the RVs, light curves, and the broadband SED allows us to robustly constrain the masses of both components. We find a giant mass of $M_\star = 0.99^{+0.02}_{-0.03}\,M_{\odot}$ and a companion mass of $M_{2} = 1.23^{+0.05}_{-0.03}\,M_{\odot}$, implying that the companion is a neutron star (NS). We recover a $4.06$-hour period in the system's TESS light curve, which we tentatively associate with the NS spin period. The giant does not yet fill its Roche lobe, suggesting that current mass transfer is primarily via winds. MESA evolutionary models predict that the giant will overflow its Roche lobe in $5$-$10$ Myr, eventually forming a recycled pulsar + white dwarf binary with a $\sim 900$ day period. IGR J16194-2810 provides a window on the future evolution of wide NS + main sequence binaries recently discovered via Gaia astrometry. As with those systems, the binary's formation history is uncertain. Before the formation of the NS, it likely survived a common envelope episode with a donor-to-accretor mass ratio $\gtrsim 10$ and emerged in a wide orbit. The NS likely formed with a weak kick ($v_{\rm kick}\lesssim 50\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$), as stronger kicks would have disrupted the orbit.</description>

      <title>The SNEWS 2.0 Alert Software for the Coincident Detection of Neutrinos from Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The neutrino signal from the next galactic core-collapse supernova will provide an invaluable early warning of the explosion. By combining the burst trigger from several neutrino detectors, the location of the explosion can be triangulated minutes to hours before the optical emission becomes visible, while also reducing the rate of false-positive triggers. To enable multi-messenger follow-up of nearby supernovae, the SuperNova Early Warning System 2.0 (SNEWS 2.0) will produce a combined alert using a global network of neutrino detectors. This paper describes the trigger publishing and alert formation framework of the SNEWS 2.0 network. The framework is built on the HOPSKOTCH publish-subscribe system to easily incorporate new detectors into the network, and it implements a coincidence system to form alerts and estimate a false-positive rate for the combined triggers. The paper outlines the structure of the SNEWS 2.0 software and the initial testing of coincident signals.</description>
