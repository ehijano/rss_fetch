      <title>Existence and explicit formula for a semigroup related to some network problems with unbounded edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider an initial-boundary value problem related to some network dynamics where the underlying graph has unbounded edges. We show that there exists a C0-semigroup for this problem using a general result from the literature. We also find an explicit formula for this semigroup. This is achieved using the method of characteristics and then showing that the Laplace transform of the solution is equal to the resolvent operator of the generator.</description>

      <title>Meromorphic functions whose action on their Julia sets is Non-Ergodic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: the action of the function on its Julia set is still ergodic if some, but not all of the asymptotic values land on infinity, and the remaining ones land on a compact repeller. In this paper, we complete the characterization of ergodicity for Nevanlinna functions but proving that if all the asymptotic values land on infinity, then the Julia set is the whole sphere and the action of the map there is non-ergodic.</description>

      <title>Ergodic properties of infinite extension of symmetric interval exchange transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that skew products with the cocycle given by the function $f(x)=a(x-1/2)$ with $a\neq 0$ are ergodic for every ergodic symmetric IET in the base, thus giving the full characterization of ergodic extensions in this family. Moreover, we prove that under an additional natural assumption of unique ergodicity on the IET, we can replace $f$ with any differentiable function with a non-zero sum of jumps. Finally, by considering weakly mixing IETs instead of just ergodic, we show that the skew products with cocycle given by $f$ have infinite ergodic index.</description>

      <title>From exponential to finite/fixed-time stability: Applications to optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of finite/fixed-time stable optimization algorithms typically involves study of specific problem instances. The lack of a unified framework hinders understanding of more sophisticated algorithms, e.g., primal-dual gradient flow dynamics. The purpose of this paper is to address the following question: Given an exponentially stable optimization algorithm, can it be modified to obtain a finite/fixed-time stable algorithm? We provide an affirmative answer, demonstrate how the solution can be computed on a finite-time interval via a simple scaling of the right-hand-side of the original dynamics, and certify the desired properties of the modified algorithm using the Lyapunov function that proves exponential stability of the original system. Finally, we examine nonsmooth composite optimization problems and smooth problems with linear constraints to demonstrate the merits of our approach.</description>

      <title>Model-Embedded Gaussian Process Regression for Parameter Estimation in Dynamical System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying dynamical system (DS) is a vital task in science and engineering. Traditional methods require numerous calls to the DS solver, rendering likelihood-based or least-squares inference frameworks impractical. For efficient parameter inference, two state-of-the-art techniques are the kernel method for modeling and the "one-step framework" for jointly inferring unknown parameters and hyperparameters. The kernel method is a quick and straightforward technique, but it cannot estimate solutions and their derivatives, which must strictly adhere to physical laws. We propose a model-embedded "one-step" Bayesian framework for joint inference of unknown parameters and hyperparameters by maximizing the marginal likelihood. This approach models the solution and its derivatives using Gaussian process regression (GPR), taking into account smoothness and continuity properties, and treats differential equations as constraints that can be naturally integrated into the Bayesian framework in the linear case. Additionally, we prove the convergence of the model-embedded Gaussian process regression (ME-GPR) for theoretical development. Motivated by Taylor expansion, we introduce a piecewise first-order linearization strategy to handle nonlinear dynamic systems. We derive estimates and confidence intervals, demonstrating that they exhibit low bias and good coverage properties for both simulated models and real data.</description>

      <title>The geometry of dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dissipative phenomena manifest in multiple mechanical systems. In this dissertation, different geometric frameworks for modelling non-conservative dynamics are considered. The objective is to generalize several results from conservative systems to dissipative systems, specially those concerning the symmetries and integrability of these systems. More specifically, three classes of geometric frameworks modelling dissipative systems are considered: systems with external forces, contact systems and systems with impacts. The first two allow modelling a continuous dissipation of energy over time, while the latter also permits considering abrupt changes of energy in the instants of the impacts.</description>

      <title>Spectral clustering of time-evolving networks using the inflated dynamic Laplacian for graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex time-varying networks are prominent models for a wide variety of spatiotemporal phenomena. The functioning of networks depends crucially on their connectivity, yet reliable techniques for determining communities in spacetime networks remain elusive. We adapt successful spectral techniques from continuous-time dynamics on manifolds to the graph setting to fill this gap. We formulate an {\it inflated dynamic Laplacian} for graphs and develop a spectral theory to underpin the corresponding algorithmic realisations. We develop spectral clustering approaches for both multiplex and non-multiplex networks, based on the eigenvectors of the inflated dynamic Laplacian and specialised Sparse EigenBasis Approximation (SEBA) post-processing of these eigenvectors. We demonstrate that our approach can outperform the Leiden algorithm applied both in spacetime and layer-by-layer, and we analyse voting data from the US senate (where senators come and go as congresses evolve) to quantify increasing polarisation in time.</description>

      <title>Cyclicity Analysis of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we consider an $N$-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process satisfying the linear stochastic differential equation $d\mathbf x(t) = - \mathbf B\mathbf x(t) dt + \boldsymbol \Sigma d \mathbf w(t).$ Here, $\mathbf B$ is a fixed $N \times N$ circulant friction matrix whose eigenvalues have positive real parts, $\boldsymbol \Sigma$ is a fixed $N \times M$ matrix. We consider a signal propagation model governed by this OU process. In this model, an underlying signal propagates throughout a network consisting of $N$ linked sensors located in space. We interpret the $n$-th component of the OU process as the measurement of the propagating effect made by the $n$-th sensor. The matrix $\mathbf B$ represents the sensor network structure: if $\mathbf B$ has first row $(b_1 \ , \ \dots \ , \ b_N),$ where $b_1&gt;0$ and $b_2 \ , \ \dots \ ,\ b_N \le 0,$ then the magnitude of $b_p$ quantifies how receptive the $n$-th sensor is to activity within the $(n+p-1)$-th sensor. Finally, the $(m,n)$-th entry of the matrix $\mathbf D = \frac{\boldsymbol \Sigma \boldsymbol \Sigma^\text T}{2}$ is the covariance of the component noises injected into the $m$-th and $n$-th sensors. For different choices of $\mathbf B$ and $\boldsymbol \Sigma,$ we investigate whether Cyclicity Analysis enables us to recover the structure of network. Roughly speaking, Cyclicity Analysis studies the lead-lag dynamics pertaining to the components of a multivariate signal. We specifically consider an $N \times N$ skew-symmetric matrix $\mathbf Q,$ known as the lead matrix, in which the sign of its $(m,n)$-th entry captures the lead-lag relationship between the $m$-th and $n$-th component OU processes. We investigate whether the structure of the leading eigenvector of $\mathbf Q,$ the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of $\mathbf Q$ in modulus, reflects the network structure induced by $\mathbf B.$</description>

      <title>Computational Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the computational complexity theory of smooth, finite-dimensional dynamical systems. Building off of previous work, we give definitions for what it means for a smooth dynamical system to simulate a Turing machine. We then show that 'chaotic' dynamical systems (more precisely, Axiom A systems) and 'integrable' dynamical systems (more generally, measure-preserving systems) cannot robustly simulate universal Turing machines, although such machines can be robustly simulated by other kinds of dynamical systems. Subsequently, we show that any Turing machine that can be encoded into a structurally stable one-dimensional dynamical system must have a decidable halting problem, and moreover an explicit time complexity bound in instances where it does halt. More broadly, our work elucidates what it means for one 'machine' to simulate another, and emphasizes the necessity of defining low-complexity 'encoders' and 'decoders' to translate between the dynamics of the simulation and the system being simulated. We highlight how the notion of a computational dynamical system leads to questions at the intersection of computational complexity theory, dynamical systems theory, and real algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>LifeGPT: Topology-Agnostic Generative Pretrained Transformer Model for Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Game of Life (Life), a well known algorithm within the broader class of cellular automata (CA), exhibits complex emergent dynamics, with extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. Modeling and predicting such intricate behavior without explicit knowledge of the system's underlying topology presents a significant challenge, motivating the development of algorithms that can generalize across various grid configurations and boundary conditions. We develop a decoder-only generative pretrained transformer model to solve this problem, showing that our model can simulate Life on a toroidal grid with no prior knowledge on the size of the grid, or its periodic boundary conditions (LifeGPT). LifeGPT is topology-agnostic with respect to its training data and our results show that a GPT model is capable of capturing the deterministic rules of a Turing-complete system with near-perfect accuracy, given sufficiently diverse training data. We also introduce the idea of an `autoregressive autoregressor' to recursively implement Life using LifeGPT. Our results pave the path towards true universal computation within a large language model (LLM) framework, synthesizing of mathematical analysis with natural language processing, and probing AI systems for situational awareness about the evolution of such algorithms without ever having to compute them. Similar GPTs could potentially solve inverse problems in multicellular self-assembly by extracting CA-compatible rulesets from real-world biological systems to create new predictive models, which would have significant consequences for the fields of bioinspired materials, tissue engineering, and architected materials design.</description>

      <title>Around Furstenberg's times $p$, times $q$ conjecture: times $p$-invariant measures with some large Fourier coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each integer $n\ge 1$, denote by $T_{n}$ the map $x\mapsto nx\mod 1$ from the circle group $\mathbb{T} = \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ into itself. Let $p,q\ge 2$ be two multiplicatively independent integers. Using Baire Category arguments, we show that generically a $T_{p}$-invariant probability measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{T}$ with no atom has some large Fourier coefficients along the sequence $(q^n)_{n\ge 0}$. In particular, $(T_{q^{n}}\mu )_{n\ge 0}$ does not converges weak-star to the normalised Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{T}$. This disproves a conjecture of Furstenberg and complements previous results of Johnson and Rudolph. In the spirit of previous work by Meiri and Lindenstrauss-Meiri-Peres, we study generalisations of our main result to certain classes of sequences $(c_n)_{n\ge 0}$ other than the sequences $(q^{n})_{n\ge 0}$, and also investigate the multidimensional setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1981, Arnoux and Yoccoz gave the first examples of pseudo-Anosov maps with odd degree stretch factors. In 1985, D.~Fried deduced the existence of a pseudo-Anosov map in genus three with the same stretch factor as the Arnoux-Yoccoz example in that genus, and asked if these were the same. We show that they are distinct. We do this by, in a sense, reversing Fried's construction; we show that the mapping torus of the pseudo-Anosov map induced by the Arnoux-Yoccoz map on the surface obtained by blowing-up its two singularities has no cross section which is a torus with two points blown-up.</description>

Abstract: For a class of potentials $\psi$ satisfying a condition depending on the roof function of a suspension (semi)flow, we show an EKP inequality, which can be interpreted as a H\"older continuity property in the weak${^*}$ norm of measures, with respect to the pressure of those measures, where the H\"older exponent depends on the $L^q$-space that $\psi$ belongs to. This also captures a new type of phase transition for intermittent (semi)flows (and maps).</description>

Abstract: This work presents a framework for billiards in convex domains on two dimensional Riemannian manifolds. These domains are contained in connected, simply connected open subsets which are totally normal. In this context, some basic properties that have long been known for billiards on the plane are established. We prove the twist property and investigate conditions on the billiard for the existence and non existence of rotational invariant curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is twofold. On one hand we prove that the Moreau's sweeping process driven by a uniformly prox-regular moving set with local bounded retraction has a unique solution provided that the coefficient of prox-regularity is larger than the size of any jump of the driving set. On the other hand we show how the case of local bounded retraction can be easily reduced to the $1$-Lipschitz continuous case: indeed we first solve the Lipschitz continuous case by means of the so called ``catching-up algorithm", and we reduce the local bounded retraction case to the Lipschitz one by using a reparametrization technique for functions with values in the family of prox-regular sets.</description>

      <title>A Ruelle operator for holomorphic correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the ideas of certain notions that one studies in thermodynamic formalism of maps to the context when the dynamics in the phase space evolves by complex holomorphic correspondences. Towards that end, we define the topological entropy of holomorphic correspondences using spanning sets. We then, define the pressure of a real-valued continuous function defined on the Riemann sphere and investigate the Ruelle operator with respect to the H\"{o}lder continuous function, however restricted on the support of the Dinh-Sibony measure.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of automorphism groups of projective surfaces: classification, examples and outlook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We first present an overview of our previous work on the dynamics of subgroups of automorphism groups of compact complex surfaces, together with a selection of open problems and new classification results. Then, we study two families of examples in depth: the first one comes from folding plane pentagons, and the second one is a family of groups introduced by J\'er\'emy Blanc, which exhibits interesting new dynamical features.</description>

      <title>Killing tensors on reducible spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that on the product of two Riemannian manifolds one of which is compact, any Killing tensor is reducible, that is, is the sum of products of Killing tensors on the factors. The same is true for the lifts to the universal cover of Killing tensors on a compact manifold with reducible holonomy. We give a local description of Killing tensors on product manifolds and present an example of a complete product manifold whose factors are locally irreducible which admits an irreducible Killing tensor field.</description>

      <title>Stationary non-radial localized patterns in the planar Swift-Hohenberg PDE: constructive proofs of existence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a methodology for establishing constructive proofs of existence of smooth, stationary, non-radial localized patterns in the planar Swift-Hohenberg equation. Specifically, given an approximate solution $u_0$, we construct an approximate inverse for the linearization around $u_0$, enabling the development of a Newton-Kantorovich approach. Consequently, we derive a sufficient condition for the existence of a unique localized pattern in the vicinity of $u_0$. The verification of this condition is facilitated through a combination of analytic techniques and rigorous numerical computations. Moreover, an additional condition is derived, establishing that the localized pattern serves as the limit of a family of periodic solutions (in space) as the period tends to infinity. The integration of analytical tools and meticulous numerical analysis ensures a comprehensive validation of this condition. To illustrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology, we present computer-assisted proofs for the existence of three distinct unbounded branches of periodic solutions in the planar Swift-Hohenberg equation, all converging towards a localized planar pattern, whose existence is also proven constructively. All computer-assisted proofs, including the requisite codes, are accessible on GitHub at \cite{julia_cadiot}.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of periodic points for loxodromic automorphisms of affine surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that two automorphisms of an affine surface with dynamical degree strictly larger than 1 share a Zariski dense set of periodic points if and only if they have the same periodic points. We construct canonical heights for these automorphisms and use arithmetic equidistribution for adelic line bundles over quasiprojective varieties following the work of Yuan and Zhang. Finally, we extend the local arithmetic Hodge index theorem to a certain class of vertical adelic line bundles over quasiprojective varieties to conclude the proof.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Dynamical Stability of Stochastic Gradient Descent in Overparameterized Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For overparameterized optimization tasks, such as the ones found in modern machine learning, global minima are generally not unique. In order to understand generalization in these settings, it is vital to study to which minimum an optimization algorithm converges. The possibility of having minima that are unstable under the dynamics imposed by the optimization algorithm limits the potential minima that the algorithm can find. In this paper, we characterize the global minima that are dynamically stable/unstable for both deterministic and stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In particular, we introduce a characteristic Lyapunov exponent which depends on the local dynamics around a global minimum and rigorously prove that the sign of this Lyapunov exponent determines whether SGD can accumulate at the respective global minimum.</description>
