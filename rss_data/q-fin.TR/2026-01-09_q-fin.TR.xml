      <title>Trading Electrons: Predicting DART Spread Spikes in ISO Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of forecasting and optimally trading day-ahead versus real-time (DART) price spreads in U.S. wholesale electricity markets. Building on the framework of Galarneau-Vincent et al., we extend spike prediction from a single zone to a multi-zone setting and treat both positive and negative DART spikes within a unified statistical model. To translate directional signals into economically meaningful positions, we develop a structural and market-consistent price impact model based on day-ahead bid stacks. This yields closed-form expressions for the optimal vector of zonal INC/DEC quantities, capturing asymmetric buy/sell impacts and cross-zone congestion effects. When applied to NYISO, the resulting impact-aware strategy significantly improves the risk-return profile relative to unit-size trading and highlights substantial heterogeneity across markets and seasons.</description>

      <title>Technology Adoption and Network Externalities in Financial Systems: A Spatial-Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a unified framework for analyzing technology adoption in financial networks that incorporates spatial spillovers, network externalities, and their interaction. The framework characterizes adoption dynamics through a master equation whose solution admits a Feynman-Kac representation as expected cumulative adoption pressure along stochastic paths through spatial-network space. From this representation, I derive the Adoption Amplification Factor -- a structural measure of technology leadership that captures the ratio of total system-wide adoption to initial adoption following a localized shock. A Levy jump-diffusion extension with state-dependent jump intensity captures critical mass dynamics: below threshold, adoption evolves through gradual diffusion; above threshold, cascade dynamics accelerate adoption through discrete jumps. Applying the framework to SWIFT gpi adoption among 17 Global Systemically Important Banks, I find strong support for the two-regime characterization. Network-central banks adopt significantly earlier ($\rho = -0.69$, $p = 0.002$), and pre-threshold adopters have significantly higher amplification factors than post-threshold adopters (11.81 versus 7.83, $p = 0.010$). Founding members, representing 29 percent of banks, account for 39 percent of total system amplification -- sufficient to trigger cascade dynamics. Controlling for firm size and network position, CEO age delays adoption by 11-15 days per year.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Equity Correlations with Hybrid Transformer Graph Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies forward-looking stock-stock correlation forecasting for S\&amp;P 500 constituents and evaluates whether learned correlation forecasts can improve graph-based clustering used in basket trading strategies. We cast 10-day ahead correlation prediction in Fisher-z space and train a Temporal-Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (THGNN) to predict residual deviations from a rolling historical baseline. The architecture combines a Transformer-based temporal encoder, which captures non-stationary, complex, temporal dependencies, with an edge-aware graph attention network that propagates cross-asset information over the equity network. Inputs span daily returns, technicals, sector structure, previous correlations, and macro signals, enabling regime-aware forecasts and attention-based feature and neighbor importance to provide interpretability. Out-of-sample results from 2019-2024 show that the proposed model meaningfully reduces correlation forecasting error relative to rolling-window estimates. When integrated into a graph-based clustering framework, forward-looking correlations produce adaptable and economically meaningfully baskets, particularly during periods of market stress. These findings suggest that improvements in correlation forecasts translate into meaningful gains during portfolio construction tasks.</description>

      <title>Intraday Limit Order Price Change Transition Dynamics Across Market Capitalizations Through Markov Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative understanding of stochastic dynamics in limit order price changes is essential for execution strategy design. We analyze intraday transition dynamics of ask and bid orders across market capitalization tiers using high-frequency NASDAQ100 tick data. Employing a discrete-time Markov chain framework, we categorize consecutive price changes into nine states and estimate transition probability matrices (TPMs) for six intraday intervals across High ($\mathtt{HMC}$), Medium ($\mathtt{MMC}$), and Low ($\mathtt{LMC}$) market cap stocks. Element-wise TPM comparison reveals systematic patterns: price inertia peaks during opening and closing hours, stabilizing midday. A capitalization gradient is observed: $\mathtt{HMC}$ stocks exhibit the strongest inertia, while $\mathtt{LMC}$ stocks show lower stability and wider spreads. Markov metrics, including spectral gap, entropy rate, and mean recurrence times, quantify these dynamics. Clustering analysis identifies three distinct temporal phases on the bid side -- Opening, Midday, and Closing, and four phases on the ask side by distinguishing Opening, Midday, Pre-Close, and Close. This indicates that sellers initiate end-of-day positioning earlier than buyers. Stationary distributions show limit order dynamics are dominated by neutral and mild price changes. Jensen-Shannon divergence confirms the closing hour as the most distinct phase, with capitalization modulating temporal contrasts and bid-ask asymmetry. These findings support capitalization-aware and time-adaptive execution algorithms.</description>

      <title>ATLAS: Adaptive Trading with LLM AgentS Through Dynamic Prompt Optimization and Multi-Agent Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models show promise for financial decision-making, yet deploying them as autonomous trading agents raises fundamental challenges: how to adapt instructions when rewards arrive late and obscured by market noise, how to synthesize heterogeneous information streams into coherent decisions, and how to bridge the gap between model outputs and executable market actions. We present ATLAS (Adaptive Trading with LLM AgentS), a unified multi-agent framework that integrates structured information from markets, news, and corporate fundamentals to support robust trading decisions. Within ATLAS, the central trading agent operates in an order-aware action space, ensuring that outputs correspond to executable market orders rather than abstract signals. The agent can incorporate feedback while trading using Adaptive-OPRO, a novel prompt-optimization technique that dynamically adapts the prompt by incorporating real-time, stochastic feedback, leading to increasing performance over time. Across regime-specific equity studies and multiple LLM families, Adaptive-OPRO consistently outperforms fixed prompts, while reflection-based feedback fails to provide systematic gains.</description>

      <title>Trade-R1: Bridging Verifiable Rewards to Stochastic Environments via Process-Level Reasoning Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve remarkable reasoning in domains like mathematics and coding, where verifiable rewards provide clear signals. However, extending this paradigm to financial decision is challenged by the market's stochastic nature: rewards are verifiable but inherently noisy, causing standard RL to degenerate into reward hacking. To address this, we propose Trade-R1, a model training framework that bridges verifiable rewards to stochastic environments via process-level reasoning verification. Our key innovation is a verification method that transforms the problem of evaluating reasoning over lengthy financial documents into a structured Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) task. We construct a triangular consistency metric, assessing pairwise alignment between retrieved evidence, reasoning chains, and decisions to serve as a validity filter for noisy market returns. We explore two reward integration strategies: Fixed-effect Semantic Reward (FSR) for stable alignment signals, and Dynamic-effect Semantic Reward (DSR) for coupled magnitude optimization. Experiments on different country asset selection demonstrate that our paradigm reduces reward hacking, with DSR achieving superior cross-market generalization while maintaining the highest reasoning consistency.</description>
