      <title>Internal Lagrangians and spatial-gauge symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A direct reformulation of the Hamiltonian formalism in terms of the intrinsic geometry of infinitely prolonged differential equations is obtained. Concepts of spatial equation and spatial-gauge symmetry of a Lagrangian system of equations are introduced. A non-covariant canonical variational principle is proposed and demonstrated using the Maxwell equations as an example. A covariant canonical variational principle is formulated. The results obtained are applicable to any variational equations, including those that do not originate in physics.</description>

      <title>Hopf bifurcation of a non-parallel Navier-Stokes flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A plane non-parallel flow in a square fluid domain exhibits an odd number of vortices. A spectral structure is found to have a non-real solution of the spectral problem linearized around the flow. With the use of this structure, Hopf bifurcation or secondary time periodic flows branching of a basic square eddy flow is found. In contrast to a square eddy flow involving an even number of vortices in earlier analytical and experimental investigations, instability of the flow leads to steady-state bifurcations.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy in the ground state of non-interacting massless Dirac fermions in dimension one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel proof of a formula of Casini and Huerta for the entanglement entropy of the ground state of non-interacting massless Dirac fermions in dimension one localized to (a union of) intervals and generalize it to the case of R\'enyi entropies. At first, we prove that these entropies are well-defined for non-intersecting intervals. This is accomplished by an inequality of Alexander V.~Sobolev. Then we compute this entropy using a trace formula for Wiener--Hopf operators by Harold Widom. For intersecting intervals, we discuss an extended entropy formula of Casini and Huerta and support this with a proof for polynomial test functions (instead of entropy).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we consider the asymmetric nearest neighbor ferromagnetic Ising model on the $(d+s)$-dimensional unit cubic lattice $\Z^{d+s}$, at inverse temperature $\beta=1$ and with coupling constants $J_s&gt;0$ and $J_d&gt;0$ for edges of $\Z^s$ and $\Z^d$, respectively. We obtain a lower bound for the critical curve in the phase diagram of $(J_s,J_d)$. In particular, as $J_d$ approaches its critical value from below, our result is directly related to the so-called dimensional crossover phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Hilbert space representation for quasi-Hermitian position-deformed Heisenberg algebra and Path integral formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Position deformation of a Heisenberg algebra and Hilbert space representation of both maximal length and minimal momentum uncertainties may lead to loss of Hermiticity of some operators that generate this algebra. Consequently, the Hamiltonian operator constructed from these operators are also not Hermitian. In the present paper, with an appropriate positive-definite Dyson map, we establish the Hermiticity of these operators by means of a quasi-similarity transformation. We then construct Hilbert space representations associated with these quasi-Hermitian operators that generate a quasi-Hermitian Heisenberg algebra. With the help of these representations we establish the path integral formulation of any systems in this quasi-Hermitian algebra. Finally, using the path integral of a free particle as an example, we demonstrate that the Euclidean propagator, action, and kinetic energy of this system are constrained by the standard classical mechanics limits.</description>

      <title>Adinkras and Pure Spinors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nilpotence variety for extended supersymmetric quantum mechanics is a cone over a quadric in projective space. The pure spinor correspondence, which relates the description of off-shell supermultiplets to the classification of modules over the corresponding hypersurface ring, reduces to a classical problem of linear algebra. Spinor bundles, which correspond to maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules, serve as basic building blocks. Koszul duality appears as a deformed version of the Bernstein-Gel'fand-Gel'fand correspondence that we make fully concrete. We illustrate in numerous examples the close relationship between these connections and the powerful graphical technology of Adinkras. We emphasize the role of R-symmetry for recovering higher-dimensional gauge and gravity multiplets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive new models of stochastic Hall magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) by using a symmetry-reduced stochastic Euler-Poincar\'e variational principle. The new stochastic Hall MHD theory has potential applications for uncertainty quantification and data assimilation in space plasma (space weather) and solar physics. The stochastic geometric mechanics approach we take here produces coordinate-free results which may then be applied in a variety of spatial configurations.</description>

      <title>Quantum graph models for transport in filamentary switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of metallic nanofilaments bridging two electrodes across an insulator is a mechanism for resistive switching. Examples of such phenomena include atomic synapses, which constitute a distinct class of memristive devices whose behavior is closely tied to the properties of the filament. Until recently, experimental investigation of the low-temperature regime and quantum transport effects has been limited. However, with growing interest in understanding the true impacts of the filament on device conductance, comprehending quantum effects has become crucial for quantum neuromorphic hardware. We discuss quantum transport resulting from filamentary switching in a narrow region where the continuous approximation of the contact is not valid, and only a few atoms are involved. In this scenario, the filament can be represented by a graph depicting the adjacency of atoms and the overlap between atomic orbitals. Using quantum graphs, we calculate the scattering amplitude of charge carriers on this graph and explore the interplay between filamentary formation and quantum transport effects.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of the nonlinear Hartree equation for infinitely many particles with singular interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear Hartree equation (NLH) in the Heisenberg picture admits steady states of the form $\gamma_f=f(-\Delta)$ representing quantum states of infinitely many particles. In this article, we consider the time evolution of perturbations from a large class of such steady states via the three-dimensional NLH. We prove that if the interaction potential $w$ has finite measure and initial states have finite relative entropy, then solutions preserve the relative free energy, and they exist globally in time. This result extends the important work of Lewin and Sabin [arXiv:1310.0603] to singular interaction cases.</description>

      <title>Future stability of perfect fluids with extreme tilt and linear equation of state $p=c_s^2\rho$ for the Einstein-Euler system with positive cosmological constant: The range $\frac{1}{3}&lt;c_s^2&lt;\frac{3}{7}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the future stability of cosmological fluids, in spacetimes with an accelerated expansion, which exhibit extreme tilt behavior, ie. their fluid velocity becoming asymptotically null at timelike infinity. It has been predicted in the article \cite{LEUW} that the latter behavior is dominant for sound speeds beyond radiation $c_s=1/\sqrt{3}$, hence, bifurcating off of the stable orthogonal fluid behavior modeled by the classical FLRW family of solutions, for $c_s^2\in[0,\frac{1}{3}]$. First, we construct homogeneous solutions to the Einstein-Euler system with the latter behavior, in $\mathbb{S}^3$ spatial topology, for sound speeds $c_s^2\in(\frac{1}{3},1)$. Then, we study their future dynamics and prove a global stability result in the restricted range $c_s^2\in(\frac{1}{3},\frac{3}{7})$. In particular, we show that extreme tilt behavior persists to sufficiently small perturbations of the homogeneous backgrounds, without any symmetry assumptions or analyticity. Our method is based on a bootstrap argument, in weighted Sobolev spaces, capturing the exponential decay of suitable renormalized variables. Extreme tilt behavior is associated with a degeneracy in the top order energy estimates that we derive, which allows us to complete our bootstrap argument only in the aforementioned restricted range of sound speeds. Interestingly, this is a degeneracy that does not appear in the study of formal series expansions. Moreover, for the Euler equations on a fixed FLRW background, our estimates can be improved to treat the entire beyond radiation interval $c_s^2\in(\frac{1}{3},1)$, a result already obtained in \cite{MO}. The latter indicates that the former issue is related to the general inhomogeneous geometry of the perturbed metric in the coupled to Einstein case.</description>

      <title>Particle Scattering and Fusion for the Ablowitz-Ladik Chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ablowitz-Ladik chain is an integrable discretized version of the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation. We report on a novel underlying Hamiltonian particle system with properties similar to the ones known for the classical Toda chain and Calogero fluid with $1/\sinh^2$ pair interaction. Boundary conditions are imposed such that, both in the distant past and future, particles have a constant velocity. We establish the many-particle scattering for the Ablowitz-Ladik chain and obtain properties known for generic integrable many-body systems. For a specific choice of the chain, real initial data remain real in the course of time. Then, asymptotically, particles move in pairs with a velocity-dependent size and scattering shifts are governed by the fusion rule.</description>

      <title>Open reaction-diffusion systems: bridging probabilistic theory across scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reaction-diffusion processes are the foundational model for a diverse range of complex systems, ranging from biochemical reactions to social agent-based phenomena. The underlying dynamics of these systems occur at the individual particle/agent level, and in realistic applications, they often display interaction with their environment through energy or material exchange with a reservoir. This requires intricate mathematical considerations, especially in the case of material exchange since the varying number of particles/agents results in ``on-the-fly'' modification of the system dimension. In this work, we first overview the probabilistic description of reaction-diffusion processes at the particle level, which readily handles varying numbers of particles. We then extend this model to consistently incorporate interactions with macroscopic material reservoirs. Based on the resulting expressions, we bridge the probabilistic description with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions for linear and nonlinear reaction-diffusion systems, as well as for an archetypal open reaction-diffusion system. This establishes a methodological workflow to bridge particle-based probabilistic descriptions with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions of reaction-diffusion in open settings, laying the foundations for a multiscale theoretical framework upon which to construct theory and simulation schemes that are consistent across scales.</description>

Abstract: We survey the connections between the six-vertex (square ice) model of 2d statistical mechanics and random matrix theory. We highlight the same universal probability distributions appearing on both sides, and also indicate related open questions and conjectures. We present full proofs of two asymptotic theorems for the six-vertex model: in the first one the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble and GUE-corners process appear; the second one leads to the Tracy-Widom distribution $F_2$. While both results are not new, we found shorter transparent proofs for this text. On our way we introduce the key tools in the study of the six-vertex model, including the Yang-Baxter equation and the Izergin-Korepin formula.</description>

      <title>From Zero-Freeness to Strong Spatial Mixing via a Christoffel-Darboux Type Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unifying approach to derive the strong spatial mixing (SSM) property for the general 2-spin system from zero-free regions of its partition function. Our approach works for the multivariate partition function over all three complex parameters $(\beta, \gamma, \lambda)$, and we allow the zero-free regions of $\beta, \gamma$ or $\lambda$ to be of arbitrary shapes. As long as the zero-free region contains a positive point and it is a complex neighborhood of $\lambda=0$ when fixing $\beta, \gamma \in \mathbb{C}$, or a complex neighborhood of $\beta\gamma=1$ when fixing $\beta, \lambda\in \mathbb{C}$ or $\gamma, \lambda\in \mathbb{C}$ respectively, we are able to show that the corresponding 2-spin system exhibits SSM on such a region. The underlying graphs of the 2-spin system are not necessarily of bounded degree, while are required to include graphs with pinned vertices. We prove this result by establishing a Christoffel-Darboux type identity for the 2-spin system on trees. This identity plays an important role in our approach and is of its own interests. We also use certain tools from complex analysis such as Riemann mapping theorem.
  Our approach comprehensively turns all existing zero-free regions (to our best knowledge) of the partition function of the 2-spin system where pinned vertices are allowed into the SSM property. As a consequence, we obtain new SSM results for the 2-spin system beyond the direct argument for SSM based on tree recurrence. Moreover, we extend our approach to handle the 2-spin system with non-uniform external fields. As an application, we obtain a new SSM result for the non-uniform ferromagnetic Ising model from the celebrated Lee-Yang circle theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss Riemannian geometry of one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator. Its wavefunction is a holomorphic section of the complex line bundle $L_{\sf{v}}$ over the phase space $\mathbb{R}^2$. We show that the energy eigenfunctions $\psi_n$ with $n\ge 1$, corresponding to the energy levels $E_n$, are complex coordinates on orbifolds $\mathbb{R}^2/\mathbb{Z}_n$ embedded into $L_{\sf{v}}$, where $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is the cyclic group of order $n$. In fact, $\psi_n (t,z)$ is a standing wave on $\mathbb{R}^2/\mathbb{Z}_n$, where $z$ is a complex coordinate on the phase space $\mathbb{R}^2\cong\mathbb{C}$. Oscillators are characterized by two quantum charges $(q_l^{}, q_{\sf{v}})=(n,1)$, where $q_l^{}=n$ is the winding number for the group U(1) acting on $\mathbb{R}^2/\mathbb{Z}_n$ and $q_{\sf{v}}^{}=1$ is the winding number for the U(1)-rotations on fibres of the bundle $L_{\sf{v}}\to\mathbb{R}^2$, and $E_n=\hbar\omega(q_l^{}+\frac{1}{2} q_{\sf{v}}).$ We also discuss "antioscillators" with opposite quantum charges and the same positive energy.</description>

Abstract: We use a version of the Skorokhod integral to give a simple and rigorous formulation of the Wick-ordered (stochastic) heat equation with planar white noise, representing the free energy of an undirected random polymer. The solution for all times is expressed as the L1 limit of a martingale given by the Feyman-Kac formula and defines a randomized shift, or Gaussian multiplicative chaos. The fluctuations far from the centre are shown to be given by the one-dimensional KPZ equation.</description>

      <title>Global exterior stability of the Minkowski space: coupled Einstein-Yang-Mills perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we prove a global gauge-invariant radiation estimates for the perturbations of the $3+1$ dimensional Minkowski spacetime in the presence of Yang-Mills sources. In particular, we obtain a novel gauge invariant estimate for the Yang-Mills fields coupled to gravity in a double null framework in the Causal complement of a compact set of a Cauchy slice. A consequence of our result is the global exterior stability of the Minkowski space under coupled Yang-Mills perturbations. A special structure present both in the null Bianchi equations and the null Yang-Mills equations is utilized crucially to obtain the dispersive estimates necessary to conclude the global existence property. Direct use of Bel-Robinson and Yang-Mills stress-energy tensor to obtain the energy estimates is avoided in favor of weighted integration by parts taking advantage of the manifestly symmetric hyperbolic characteristics of null Bianchi and null Yang-Mills equations. Our result holds for any compact semi-simple gauge group. This is the first stability result of Minkowski space including a non-linear source.</description>

      <title>Tuning the separability in noncommutative space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Separability of the noncommutative (NC) space coordinate degrees of freedom with the generalized Peres-Horodecki separability criterion (Simon's condition) for a bipartite Gaussian state. Non-symplectic nature of the transformation between the usual commutative space and NC space restricts the use of Simon's condition in NCS. We transform the NCS system to an equivalent Hamiltonian in commutative space through Bopp shift, which enables the utilization of the separability criterion in NC space. For afairly general study, we consider a bilinear Hamiltonian with time-dependent (TD) parameters, along with a TD external interaction, which is linear in field modes. The system is transformed into canonical form keeping the intrinsic symplectic structure ($Sp(4,\mathbb{R})$) intact. The solution of the TD-Schr\"{o}dinger equation is obtained with the help of Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant method (LRIM). Expectation values of the observables (thus the covariance matrix ) are constructed from the states obtained from LRIM. It turns out that the existence of the NC parameters in the oscillator determines the separability of the states. In particular, for isotropic oscillators, the separability condition for the bipartite Gaussian states depends on NC parameters. Moreover, anisotropic parameter values for the oscillator affects the separability. In other words, both the deformation parameters ($\theta,\;\eta$) and parameter values of the oscillator are important for the separability of bipartite states. Thus tuning the parameter values, one can destroy or recreate the separability of states. With the help of toy models, we have demonstrated TD-NC space parameters effect on separability.</description>

      <title>Data Generation-based Operator Learning for Solving Partial Differential Equations on Unbounded Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02446v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wave propagation problems are typically formulated as partial differential equations (PDEs) on unbounded domains to be solved. The classical approach to solving such problems involves truncating them to problems on bounded domains by designing the artificial boundary conditions or perfectly matched layers, which typically require significant effort, and the presence of nonlinearity in the equation makes such designs even more challenging. Emerging deep learning-based methods for solving PDEs, with the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) method as a representative, still face significant challenges when directly used to solve PDEs on unbounded domains. Calculations performed in a bounded domain of interest without imposing boundary constraints can lead to a lack of unique solutions thus causing the failure of PINNs. In light of this, this paper proposes a novel and effective operator learning-based method for solving PDEs on unbounded domains. The key idea behind this method is to generate high-quality training data. Specifically, we construct a family of approximate analytical solutions to the target PDE based on its initial condition and source term. Then, using these constructed data comprising exact solutions, initial conditions, and source terms, we train an operator learning model called MIONet, which is capable of handling multiple inputs, to learn the mapping from the initial condition and source term to the PDE solution on a bounded domain of interest. Finally, we utilize the generalization ability of this model to predict the solution of the target PDE. The effectiveness of this method is exemplified by solving the wave equation and the Schrodinger equation defined on unbounded domains. More importantly, the proposed method can deal with nonlinear problems, which has been demonstrated by solving Burger's equation and Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial summation of Feynman diagrams: Equation of state of the 2D SU(N) Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13774v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feynman's diagrammatic series is a common language for a formally exact theoretical description of systems of infinitely-many interacting quantum particles, as well as a foundation for precision computational techniques. Here we introduce a universal framework for efficient summation of connected or skeleton Feynman diagrams for generic quantum many-body systems. It is based on an explicit combinatorial construction of the sum of the integrands by dynamic programming, at a computational cost that can be made only exponential in the diagram order on a classical computer and potentially polynomial on a quantum computer. We illustrate the technique by an unbiased diagrammatic Monte Carlo calculation of the equation of state of the $2D$ $SU(N)$ Hubbard model in an experimentally relevant regime, which has remained challenging for state-of-the-art numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Charging solid partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solid partitions are the 4D generalization of the plane partitions in 3D and Young diagrams in 2D, and they can be visualized as stacking of 4D unit-size boxes in the positive corner of a 4D room. Physically, solid partitions arise naturally as 4D molten crystals that count equivariant D-brane BPS states on the simplest toric Calabi-Yau fourfold, $\mathbb{C}^4$, generalizing the 3D statement that plane partitions count equivariant D-brane BPS states on $\mathbb{C}^3$. In the construction of BPS algebras for toric Calabi-Yau threefolds, the so-called charge function on the 3D molten crystal is an important ingredient -- it is the generating function for the eigenvalues of an infinite tower of Cartan elements of the algebra. In this paper, we derive the charge function for solid partitions. Compared to the 3D case, the new feature is the appearance of contributions from certain 4-box and 5-box clusters, which will make the construction of the corresponding BPS algebra much more complicated than in the 3D.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last 30 years, the mathematical theory of aperiodic order has developed enormously. Many new tilings and properties have been discovered, few of which are covered or anticipated by the early papers and books. Here, we start from the well-known Fibonacci chain to explain some of them, with pointers to various generalisations as well as to higher-dimensional phenomena and results. This should give some entry points to the modern literature on the subject.</description>

      <title>Global $\mathcal{L}^2$ minimization at uniform exponential rate via geometrically adapted gradient descent in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15487v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the scenario of supervised learning in Deep Learning (DL) networks, and exploit the arbitrariness of choice in the Riemannian metric relative to which the gradient descent flow can be defined (a general fact of differential geometry). In the standard approach to DL, the gradient flow on the space of parameters (weights and biases) is defined with respect to the Euclidean metric. Here instead, we choose the gradient flow with respect to the Euclidean metric in the output layer of the DL network. This naturally induces two modified versions of the gradient descent flow in the parameter space, one adapted for the overparametrized setting, and the other for the underparametrized setting. In the overparametrized case, we prove that, provided that a rank condition holds, all orbits of the modified gradient descent drive the ${\mathcal L}^2$ cost to its global minimum at a uniform exponential convergence rate; one thereby obtains an a priori stopping time for any prescribed proximity to the global minimum. We point out relations of the latter to sub-Riemannian geometry. Moreover, we generalize the above framework to the situation in which the rank condition does not hold; in particular, we show that local equilibria can only exist if a rank loss occurs, and that generically, they are not isolated points, but elements of a critical submanifold of parameter space.</description>

      <title>New cluster algebras from old: integrability beyond Zamolodchikov periodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider discrete dynamical systems obtained as deformations of mutations in cluster algebras associated with finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras. The original (undeformed) dynamical systems provide the simplest examples of Zamolodchikov periodicity: they are affine birational maps for which every orbit is periodic with the same period. Following on from preliminary work by one of us with Kouloukas, here we present integrable maps obtained from deformations of cluster mutations related to the following simple root systems: $A_3$, $B_2$, $B_3$ and $D_4$. We further show how new cluster algebras arise, by considering Laurentification, that is, a lifting to a higher-dimensional map expressed in a set of new variables (tau functions), for which the dynamics exhibits the Laurent property. For the integrable map obtained by deformation of type $A_3$, which already appeared in our previous work, we show that there is a commuting map of Quispel-Roberts-Thompson (QRT) type which is built from a composition of mutations and a permutation applied to the same cluster algebra of rank 6, with an additional 2 frozen variables. Furthermore, both the deformed $A_3$ map and the QRT map correspond to addition of a point in the Mordell-Weil group of a rational elliptic surface of rank two, and the underlying cluster algebra comes from a quiver that mutation equivalent to the $q$-Painlev\'e III quiver found by Okubo. The deformed integrable maps of types $B_2$, $B_3$ and $D_4$ are also related to elliptic surfaces.</description>

Abstract: Utilizing recent mathematical advances in proving stability of Minkowski spacetime with minimal decay rates and nonlinear stability of Kerr black holes with small angular momentum, we investigate the detailed asymptotic behaviors of gravitational waves generated in these spacetimes. Here we report and propose a new angular momentum memory effect along future null infinity. This accompanies Christodoulou's nonlinear displacement memory effect and the spin memory effect. The connections and differences to these effects are also addressed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the first eigenvalue of the magnetic Laplacian in a bounded and simply connected planar domain, with uniform magnetic field and Neumann boundary conditions. We investigate the reverse Faber-Krahn inequality conjectured by S. Fournais and B. Helffer, stating that this eigenvalue is maximized by the disk for a given area. Using the method of level lines, we prove the conjecture for small enough values of the magnetic field (those for which the corresponding eigenfunction in the disk is radial).</description>

      <title>Flux Quantization on 11-dimensional Superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flux quantization of the C-field in 11d supergravity is arguably necessary for the (UV-)completion of the theory, in that it determines the torsion charges carried by small numbers of M-branes. However, hypotheses about C-field flux-quantization ("models of the C-field") have previously been discussed only in the bosonic sector of 11d supergravity and ignoring the supergravity equations of motion. Here we highlight a duality-symmetric formulation of on-shell 11d supergravity on superspace, observe that this naturally lends itself to completion of the theory by flux quantization, and indeed that 11d super-spacetimes are put on-shell by carrying quantizable duality-symmetric super-C-field flux; the proof of which we present in detail.</description>

      <title>Flows in the Space of Interacting Chiral Boson Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study interacting theories of $N$ left-moving and $\overline{N}$ right-moving Floreanini-Jackiw bosons in two dimensions. A parameterized family of such theories is shown to enjoy (non-manifest) Lorentz invariance if and only if its Lagrangian obeys a flow equation driven by a function of the energy-momentum tensor. We discuss the canonical quantization of such theories along classical stress tensor flows, focusing on the case of the root-$T \overline{T}$ deformation, where we obtain perturbative results for the deformed spectrum in a certain large-momentum limit. In the special case $N = \overline{N}$, we consider the quantum effective action for the root-$T \overline{T}$-deformed theory by expanding around a general classical background, and we find that the one-loop contribution vanishes for backgrounds with constant scalar gradients. Our analysis can also be interpreted via dual $U(1)$ Chern-Simons theories in three dimensions, which might be used to describe deformations of charged $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ black holes or quantum Hall systems.</description>
