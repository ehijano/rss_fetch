      <title>A "Faux-Shock" Method for Hybrid Simulations of Astrophysical Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel setup for hybrid particle-in-cell simulations designed to isolate the physics of the shock precursor over long time periods for significantly lower computational cost than previous methods. This is achieved using a "faux-shock" or shock-like boundary condition on one edge of our simulation domain such that particles that interact with the boundary either pass through it or are reflected off of it with a change in momentum that mimics scattering in the downstream. We show that our faux-shock setup reproduces the same fluid quantities and phase spaces as traditional shock simulations, including those which could otherwise only be done in 3D, with higher particle resolution and for reduced computational cost. While the method involves an assumed boundary condition, it nonetheless captures the essential physics of interest, establishing it as a reliable and efficient tool for future self-consistent studies of instabilities driven by cosmic rays in a shock upstream medium.</description>

      <title>Accretion from a shock-inflated companion: double-peaked supernova lightcurve with periodic modulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the observational signatures from the interactions between a newly born neutron star and a companion star that is impacted by the supernova ejecta. We focus on the cases with bound post-explosion orbits, where the neutron star may periodically gravitationally capture gas from the companion. We find that neutron star accretion must occur if the pre-supernova binary separation is less than about 20 Rsun. This is because the stellar radius expands beyond this radius before the shock-inflated envelope undergoes Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction back to the main sequence. We then consider the internal shocks formed between adjacent episodes of disk wind. The shocks efficiently convert the wind kinetic energy into radiation (due to inverse-Compton cooling), which heats up the supernova ejecta located at much larger radii. The extra heating powers bright optical emission that is periodically modulated on the orbital timescale. The shocks also accelerate non-thermal particles which produce gamma-ray and neutrino emission from 100 MeV to 10 PeV via hardronic pp collisions. The high-energy photons leak out of the supernova ejecta after a delay of several months to one year. Photo-ionization of the slowest parts of the disk wind produces hydrogen recombination lines. We then use the model to explain the puzzling Type Ic supernova SN2022jli which shows a double-peaked optical lightcurve along with many peculiar properties, including delayed onset and rapid shutoff of the second peak, periodic modulations, delayed GeV emission, and narrow Balmer lines. Under this model, SN2022jli had a close-by companion at a pre-supernova binary separation of 10 to 20 Rsun, likely due to an earlier phase of common-envelope evolution.</description>

      <title>The day-long, repeating GRB 250702BDE / EP250702a: A unique extragalactic transient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are singular outbursts of high-energy radiation with durations typically lasting from milliseconds to minutes and, in extreme cases, a few hours. They are attributed to the catastrophic outcomes of stellar-scale events and, as such, are not expected to recur. Here, we present observations of an exceptional GRB\,250702BDE which triggered the {\em Fermi} gamma-ray burst monitor on three occasions over several hours, and which was detected in soft X-rays by the \textit{Einstein Probe} a day before the $\gamma$-ray triggers (EP250702a). We present the discovery of an extremely red infrared counterpart of the event with the VLT, as well as radio observations from MeerKAT. Hubble Space Telescope observations pinpoint the source to a non-nuclear location in a host galaxy with complex morphology, implying GRB 250702BDE is an extragalactic event. The multi-wavelength counterpart is well described with standard afterglow models at a relatively low redshift $z \sim 0.2$, but the prompt emission does not readily fit within the expectations for either collapsar or merger-driven GRBs. Indeed, a striking feature of the multiple prompt outbursts is that the third occurs at an integer multiple of the interval between the first two. Although not conclusive, this could be indicative of periodicity in the progenitor system. We discuss several possible scenarios to explain the exceptional properties of the burst, which suggest that either a very unusual collapsar or the tidal disruption of a white dwarf by an intermediate-mass black hole are plausible explanations for this unprecedented GRB.</description>

      <title>Early Emission from Double Detonation Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A popular model for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is the detonation of a CO white dwarf (WD) that is triggered by the prior detonation of a thin surface layer of helium, known as a double detonation (DD). We explore the unique early electromagnetic signatures that are expected from collision of the CO detonation with the He detonation. The three features are (1) a shock breakout flash, (2) a stage of planar shock breakout cooling, and finally (3) shock cooling emission from the thermal energy released by the collision. The planar phase is unique to the unusual density profile of the He-detonated layer in comparison to the steep profile at a stellar edge as is usually considered for shock breakout. The shock cooling emission can be modified by recombination, and we explore these effects. All together, we expect an initial flash dominated by the planar phase of $\sim6\times10^{43}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$, which lasts ~5 s in the soft X-rays. This is followed by ~12-24 hrs of shock cooling at a luminosity of $3-10\times10^{40}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$ in the optical/UV. We discuss prospects for detection of this early DD emission with current and upcoming surveys.</description>

      <title>Optical Counterparts to X-ray sources in LSST DP1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a crossmatch between a combined catalog of X-ray sources and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Data Preview 1 (DP1) to identify optical counterparts. The six fields targeted as part of DP1 include the Extended Chandra Deep Field South (E-CDF-S), the Euclid Deep Field South (EDF-S), the Fornax Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy (Fornax dSph), 47 Tucanae (47 Tuc) and science validation fields with low galactic and ecliptic latitude (SV\_95\_-25 and SV\_38\_7, respectively). We find matches to 2314 of 3830 X-ray sources. We also compare our crossmatch to DP1 in the E-CDF-S field to previous efforts to identify optical counterparts. The probability of a chance coincidence match varies across each DP1 field, with overall high reliability in the E-CDF-S field, and lower proportion of high-reliability matches in the other fields. The majority of previously known sources that we detect are, unsurprisingly, active galaxies. We plot the X-ray-to-optical flux ratio against optical magnitude and color in an effort to identify Galactic accreting compact objects using a {\em Gaia} color threshold transformed to LSST $g$--$i$, but do not find any strong candidates in these primarily extragalactic counterparts. The DP1 dataset contains high-cadence photometry collected over a number of nights. We calculate the Stetson \( J \) variability index for each object under the hypothesis that X-ray counterparts tend to exhibit higher optical variability; however, the evidence is inconclusive whether our sample is more variable over DP1 timescales when compared to field objects.</description>

      <title>A new long period radio transient: Discovery of pulses repeating every 1.16 hours from ASKAP J175534.9-252749.1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of several new pulses from the source ASKAP J175534.9-252749.1 (J1755-2527), originally identified from a single 2-min long pulse, confirming it as a long period transient (LPT) with a period of ~1.16 hours. The pulses are significantly scattered, consistent with Galactic electron density models. Two of the new pulses also had measurable polarisation, but unlike the originally detected pulse, the polarisation angle does not behave as expected from the rotating vector model. We interpret historical non-detections of J1755-2527 as an intrinsic intermittency that occurs on month-long timescales, and discuss possible causes. We conjecture that, like some other LPTs with periods &gt;~ 1 hour, J1755-2527 may host a white dwarf in a binary orbit, but note that its period is marginally shorter than the canonical orbital period minimum of cataclysmic variables. Our work highlights the importance of additional observations in establishing the nature of unusual radio-emitting objects.</description>

      <title>Unfolding the Atmospheric Muon Flux with IceCube: Investigating Stopping Muons and High-Energy Prompt Contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric muons produced in cosmic-ray air showers are classified as conventional muons from pion and kaon decays and prompt muons from heavy hadron decays. Conventional muons dominate at lower energies, and the prompt component becomes dominant at PeV energies and above. Precisely measuring the atmospheric muon flux from a few GeV to several PeV is valuable for advancing our understanding of cosmic-ray interactions and testing hadronic interaction models. Low-energy muons that stop within the IceCube in-ice array provide valuable information about the energy spectrum of muons from a few hundred GeV up to 10 TeV. Machine learning techniques are employed to enhance event reconstruction and selection to provide insights into the conventional and prompt components. This contribution presents the unfolding of the energy spectrum of stopping muons in IceCube as well as the unfolding of high-energy muons to probe the prompt component.</description>

      <title>Diversity in Hydrogen-rich Envelope Mass of Type II Supernovae. (III). The mass-loss and evolutionary pathways of the red supergiant progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of 32 type II supernovae (SNe II) with plateau phase photometry and late phase ($nebular$) spectroscopy available, aiming to bridge the gap between the surface and core of their red supergiant (RSG) progenitors. Using \texttt{MESA}\,+\texttt{STELLA}, we compute an extensive grid of SN II light curve models originating from RSG with effective temperatures $T_{\rm eff}$ around 3650\,K and hydrogen-rich envelopes artificially stripped to varying degrees. These models are then used to derive the hydrogen-rich envelope masses $M_{\rm Henv}$ for SNe II from their plateau phase light curves. Nebular spectroscopy further constrains the progenitor RSG's luminosity log\,$L_{\rm prog}$, and is employed to remove the degeneracies in light curve modeling. The comparison between log\,$L_{\rm prog}$-$M_{\rm Henv}$ reveals that $M_{\rm Henv}$ spans a broad range at the same log\,$L_{\rm prog}$, and almost all SNe II have lower $M_{\rm Henv}$ than the prediction of the default stellar wind models. We explore alternative wind prescriptions, binary evolution models, and the possibility of more compact RSG progenitors. Although binary interaction offers a compelling explanation for the non-monotonicity and large scatter in the log\,$L_{\rm prog}$-$M_{\rm Henv}$ relation, the high occurrence rate of partially-stripped RSGs cannot be accounted for by stable binary mass transfer alone without fine-tuned orbital parameters. This highlights that, despite being the most commonly observed class of core-collapse SNe, SNe II likely originate from a variety of mass-loss histories and evolutionary pathways that are more diverse and complex than typically assumed in standard stellar evolution models.</description>

      <title>A prolific repeating fast radio burst source and a crisis of the magnetar model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetars are widely considered to be the central engine of fast radio bursts (FRBs), capable of driving coherent radio emission through magnetic energy release. The accumulation of burst energy can be employed as a probe to reveal the nature of FRB energy engine. Current observations of repeaters have not yet provided sufficient constraints on the magnetic energy budget for magnetar models. Here we report 11,553 bursts detected from the hyper-active repeating source FRB 20240114A over 214 days during a recent active episode, with a peak burst rate as high as 729 hr$^{-1}$, above the detection threshold of the monitoring observations using Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). This represents the largest recorded burst sample from a single FRB source, comprising more than four times as many bursts as any previously known repeater and exceeding the cumulative total of all published bursts to date. Assuming a typical value of radio efficiency of $10^{-4}$ and a beaming factor of 0.1, the estimated total isotropic burst energy of this source exceeds 86\% of the dipolar magnetic energy of a typical magnetar with a polar surface magnetic field of $10^{15}$ G and a radius of $10^6$ cm. The total energy release of this source is about one and a half orders of magnitude higher than that of other known repeaters. We further provide the most stringent lower limit of $\bf{4.7\times10^{32}}$ G cm$^3$ on the magnetic moment of the underlying magnetar. The findings suggest that either the central engine emits with exceptionally high radio efficiency, possesses a small beaming factor, or it should be a more powerful compact object than typically considered in current magnetar models.</description>

      <title>Searching for periodic signals and quasi-periodic oscillations from an extremely active cycle of FRB 20240114A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Possible periodic features in fast radio bursts (FRBs) may provide insights into their astrophysical origins. Using extensive observations from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we conduct a search for periodicity across multiple timescales in the exceptionally active repeater source FRB 20240114A. A detailed analysis of 11,553 bursts reveals three candidate periodic signals (3.4-6$\sigma$), with frequencies of approximately 1.486 Hz, 1.576 Hz, and 1.865 Hz. This finding offers tentative evidence for a potential association with magnetar spin, although further studies are necessary for definitive confirmation. On longer timescales, a 67.5-69.2 day activity cycle is identified using two independent methods, with a significance exceeding $3.5\sigma$. In the burst time series, quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the range of a few hundred Hz are identified, with a significance exceeding 5$\sigma$, and a strong correlation is found between their central frequencies and widths (Pearson $R=0.97$). The decomposed temporal profiles of these QPOs suggest an amplitude-modulated quasi-periodic signal. The burst clusters manifest periodic burst trains ranging from a few milliseconds to several tens of milliseconds, revealing transient periodic characteristics. Despite the unprecedentedly large sample size from a single repeating FRB source during a time-continuous active period, no stable periodic signals are detected. Instead, there are multiple QPOs that dynamically evolve over time. These results clarify the bias of previous studies that occasionally detected QPOs believed to be potentially related to the spin of compact objects.</description>

      <title>Investigating FRB 20240114A with FAST: Morphological Classification and Drifting Rate Measurements in a Burst-Cluster Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the morphological classification and drifting rate measurement of the repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source FRB20240114A using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST). Detected on January 14, 2024, FRB20240114A showed an exceptionally high burst rate. During a continuous 15,780-second monitoring session on March 12, 2024, 3,203 bursts (2,109 burst-clusters) were detected. We refine the definitions of sub-bursts, bursts, and burst-clusters. Using an average dispersion measure (DM) of 529.2 pc cm$^{-3}$, burst-clusters were classified into Downward Drifting, Upward Drifting, No Drifting, No Evidence for Drifting, Not-Clear, and Complex categories. Notably, 233 (23.82%) of the 978 drifting burst-clusters showed upward drifting. Excluding 142 upward drifting single-component clusters, the remaining 91 upward drifting double- or multiple-components clusters account for 10.89% of the drifting sample. Further restricting to those with consecutive time intervals, only 9 upward drifting bursts remain. An inverse correlation is found between drifting rate and sub-burst effective width. Upward drifting single-component clusters tend to have smaller effective widths, bandwidths, and fluxes than downward drifting ones. For these upward drifting clusters, drifting rate increases with peak frequency. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test reveals longer consecutive intervals in upward drifting clusters compared to downward ones, suggesting differing underlying mechanisms.</description>

      <title>RADAR-Radio Afterglow Detection and AI-driven Response: A Federated Framework for Gravitational Wave Event Follow-Up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The landmark detection of both gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic (EM) radiation from the binary neutron star merger GW170817 has spurred efforts to streamline the follow-up of GW alerts in current and future observing runs of ground-based GW detectors. Within this context, the radio band of the EM spectrum presents unique challenges. Sensitive radio facilities capable of detecting the faint radio afterglow seen in GW170817, and with sufficient angular resolution, have small fields of view compared to typical GW localization areas. Additionally, theoretical models predict that the radio emission from binary neutron star mergers can evolve over weeks to years, necessitating long-term monitoring to probe the physics of the various post-merger ejecta components. These constraints, combined with limited radio observing resources, make the development of more coordinated follow-up strategies essential -- especially as the next generation of GW detectors promise a dramatic increase in detection rates. Here, we present RADAR, a framework designed to address these challenges by promoting community-driven information sharing, federated data analysis, and system resilience, while integrating AI methods for both GW signal identification and radio data aggregation. We show that it is possible to preserve data rights while sharing models that can help design and/or update follow-up strategies. We demonstrate our approach through a case study of GW170817, and discuss future directions for refinement and broader application.</description>

      <title>The population of hyperluminous X-ray sources as seen by XMM-Newton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultraluminous and hyperluminous X-ray sources (ULXs and HLXs) are among the brightest astrophysical objects in the X-ray sky. While ULXs most likely host stellar-mass compact objects accreting at super-Eddington rates, HLXs are compelling candidates for accreting intermediate-mass black holes. Our goal is to produce a clean sample of HLXs by removing possible contaminants and characterise the spectral properties of the remaining population. Starting with a set of 115 HLXs detected by XMM-Newton, we identified and removed contaminants (AGNs, X-ray diffuse emission detected as point-like, and tidal disruption event candidates) and retrieved 40 sources for which XMM-Newton spectra are available. We fitted them with an absorbed power law model and determined their unabsorbed luminosities and hardness ratios. We constructed the hardness-luminosity diagram, compared the results with the spectral properties of the HLX prototype, ESO 243-49 HLX-1, and conducted a deeper analysis on a few promising candidates. The resulting HLX population spans a luminosity range from $1\times10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to nearly $10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and is homogeneously spread in hardness between 0.5 and 5. Half of the population has hardness ratios higher than a typical AGN, and could be considered the extension of the ULX population at higher energies. We found four very soft outliers, which are characterised by steep power law spectra and no X-ray emission above 1$-$2 keV, similarly to ESO 243-49 HLX-1. Those with multi-epoch archival data show changes in luminosity up to almost two orders of magnitudes. We show that sources currently identified as HLXs can be more diverse than ULXs and disentangling between different types of objects is not trivial with currently available data. New observations would be beneficial to expand the current sample and uncover the true nature of many objects of this class.</description>

      <title>Tomographic constraints on the high-energy cosmic neutrino emission rate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite growing efforts to find the sources of high energy neutrinos measured by IceCube, the bulk of the neutrinos remain with unknown origins. We aim to constrain the emissivity of cosmic high-energy neutrinos from extragalactic sources through their correlation with the large-scale structure. We use cross-correlations between the IceCube 10-year dataset and tomographic maps of the galaxy overdensity to place constraints on the bias-weighted high-energy neutrino emissivity out to redshift $z\sim3$. We test two different models to describe the evolution of neutrino emissivity with redshift, a power law model $\propto (1+z)^a$, and a model tracking the star formation history, assuming a simple power law model for the energy injection spectrum. We also consider a non-parametric reconstruction of the astrophysical neutrino emissivity as a function of redshift. We do not find any significant correlation, with our strongest results corresponding to a $1.9 \sigma$ deviation with respect to a model with zero signal. We use our measurements to place upper bounds on the bias-weighted astrophysical high-energy neutrino emission rate as a function of redshift for different source models. This analysis provides a new probe to test extragalactic neutrino source models. With future neutrino and galaxy datasets we expect the constraining and detection power of this type of analysis analysis to increase.</description>

      <title>Exploring Jet Structure and Dynamics in Short Gamma Ray Bursts: A Case Study on GRB 090510</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts observed in high-energies allow the investigation of the emission processes of these still puzzling events. In this study, we perform general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations to investigate GRB 090510, a peculiar short GRB detected by Fermi-LAT. Our primary goal is to model the energetics, jet structure, variability, and opening angle of the burst to understand its underlying physical conditions. We tested the 2D and 3D models and estimated the time scale of variability. The predicted energetics and the jet opening angle reconcile with the observed ones with 1$\sigma$ when considering that the jet opening angles also evolve with redshift. Furthermore, we extend our analysis by incorporating dynamical ejecta into selected models to study its impact on jet collimation at smaller distances. In addition, we investigated a suite of models exhibiting a broad range of observable GRB properties, thereby extending our understanding beyond this specific event.</description>

      <title>Prospective Sensitivity to Solar Dark Matter using the IceCube Upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While astrophysical observations imply that 85% of the matter content is unaccounted for, the nature of this dark matter (DM) component remains unknown. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) - DM particles that interact at or below the weak interaction scale - could naturally explain this missing matter. These interactions with the Standard Model (SM) allow them to be gravitationally captured in celestial bodies like the Sun. Trapped DM in the solar core could subsequently annihilate, producing stable SM particles, of which only neutrinos can escape the Sun's dense interior. Therefore, an excess of neutrinos originating from the direction of the Sun would serve as evidence of DM. The IceCube Upgrade, a dense infill of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, will lower the energy threshold and improve sensitivity in the range from 1 to 500 GeV, thereby enhancing IceCube's ability to detect GeV-scale DM. In this contribution, I present projections of the IceCube Upgrade's sensitivity to the DM-proton scattering cross section for DM masses between 3 GeV and 500 GeV. These sensitivities position IceCube as the most sensitive indirect detection experiment for DM in the mass range from 3 GeV to 10 TeV.</description>

      <title>Optical spectroscopy of blazars for the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory- IV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blazars, including BL Lacs and FSRQs, are the most luminous extragalactic {\gamma}-ray sources. They account for about 56% of the sources listed in the recent Fermi-LAT catalog (4FGL-DR4). The optical and UV spectra of BL Lacs are nearly featureless, making it difficult to precisely determine their redshifts. Consequently, nearly half of the {\gamma}-ray BL Lacs lack reliable redshift measurements. This poses a major challenge, since redshift is crucial for studying the cosmic evolution of the blazar population and {\gamma}-ray propagation studies such as indirect evidence of EBL, placing constraints on IGMF and searches for LIV and ALPs. This paper is the fourth in a series dedicated to determining the redshift of a sample of blazars identified as key targets for future observations with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). We performed Monte Carlo simulations to select {\gamma}-ray blazars detected by Fermi-LAT with hard spectra, that lack redshift measurements. These blazars are expected to be detectable by CTAO within 30 hours or less of exposure assuming an average flux state. In this fourth paper, we report the results of detailed spectroscopic observations of 29 blazars using the ESO/VLT, Keck II, and SALT telescopes. Our analysis involved a thorough search for spectral lines in the spectra of each blazar, and when features of the host galaxy were identified, we modeled its properties. We also compared the magnitudes of the targets during the observations to their long-term light curves. In the sample studied, 9 of 29 sources were observed with a high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N &gt; 100), while the remaining 20 were observed with a moderate or low S/N. We successfully determined firm redshifts for 12 blazars, ranging from 0.1636 to 1.1427, and identified two lower limit redshifts at z &gt; 1.0196 and z &gt; 1.4454. The remaining 15 BL Lac objects exhibited featureless spectra.</description>

      <title>Harnessing PyStoch potential: detecting continuous gravitational waves from interesting supernova remnant targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting continuous gravitational waves (CWs) is challenging due to their weak amplitude and high computational demands, especially with poorly constrained source parameters. Stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) searches using cross-correlation techniques can identify unresolved astrophysical sources, including CWs, at lower computational cost, albeit with reduced sensitivity. This motivates a hybrid approach where SGWB algorithms act as a first-pass filter to identify CW candidates for follow-up with dedicated CW pipelines.
  We evaluated the discovery potential of the SGWB analysis tool PyStoch for detecting CWs, using simulated signals from spinning down NSs. We then applied the method to data from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run (O3), covering the (20-1726) Hz frequency band, and targeting four supernova remnants: Vela Jr., G347.3-0.5, Cassiopeia A, and the NS associated with the 1987A supernova remnant. If necessary, significant candidates are followed up using the 5-vector Resampling and Band-Sampled Data Frequency-Hough techniques. However, since no interesting candidates were identified in the real O3 analysis, we set 95\% confidence-level upper limits on the CW strain amplitude $h_0$. The most stringent limit was obtained for Cassiopeia A, and is $h_0 = 1.13 \times 10^{-25}$ at $201.57$ Hz with a frequency resolution of $1/32$ Hz. As for the other targets, the best upper limits have been set with the same frequency resolution, and correspond to $h_0 = 1.20 \times 10^{-25} $ at $202.16$ Hz for G347.3-0.5, $1.20 \times 10^{-25}$ at $217.81$ Hz for Vela Jr., and $1.47 \times 10^{-25}$ at $186.41$ Hz for the NS in the 1987A supernova remnant.</description>

      <title>The hunt for new pulsating ultraluminous X-ray sources: a clustering approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of fast and variable coherent signals in a handful of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) testifies to the presence of super-Eddington accreting neutron stars, and drastically changed the understanding of the ULX class. Our capability of discovering pulsations in ULXs is limited, among others, by poor statistics. However, catalogues and archives of high-energy missions contain information which can be used to identify new candidate pulsating ULXs (PULXs). The goal of this research is to single out candidate PULXs among those ULXs which have not shown pulsations due to an unfavourable combination of factors. We applied an AI approach to an updated database of ULXs detected by XMM-Newton. We first used an unsupervised clustering algorithm to sort out sources with similar characteristics into two clusters. Then, the sample of known PULX observations has been used to set the separation threshold between the two clusters and to identify the one containing the new candidate PULXs. We found that only a few criteria are needed to assign the membership of an observation to one of the two clusters. The cluster of new candidate PULXs counts 85 unique sources for 355 observations, with $\sim$85% of these new candidates having multiple observations. A preliminary timing analysis found no new pulsations for these candidates. This work presents a sample of new candidate PULXs observed by XMM-Newton, the properties of which are similar (in a multi-dimensional phase space) to those of the known PULXs, despite the absence of pulsations in their light curves. While this result is a clear example of the predictive power of AI-based methods, it also highlights the need for high-statistics observational data to reveal coherent signals from the sources in this sample and thus validate the robustness of the approach.</description>

      <title>Radiation Spectrum of the Photospheric Emission for a Turbulent Relativistic Jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prompt $\gamma$-rays of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) may originate from the photosphere of a relativistic jet. However, only a few GRBs have been observed with evident blackbody-like emission, for example, GRB~090902B. It has been demonstrated that internal dissipation processes, such as magnetic reconnection, can occur within the relativistic jet and thereby drive violent turbulence in the dissipation region. In this paper, we study the photospheric emission of a jet with turbulence below its photosphere. Here, the turbulence is modeled phenomenological under the assumption that the four-velocity of its eddies follows a Gaussian distribution in the jet's co-moving frame. It is found that the turbulence scatters photons to high energies and thus intensifies the emission in the high-energy regime. The corresponding distortion of the radiation field can be preserved if and only if the turbulence occurs in a region with incomplete photon-electron coupling. Consequently, the observed radiation spectrum can be reshaped into a Band-like spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar-mass black holes ($3$ $M_\odot \lesssim M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 150$ $M_\odot$) are the natural product of the evolution of heavy stars ($M_{\rm star} \gtrsim 20$ $M_\odot$). In our Galaxy, we expect $10^8$-$10^9$ stellar-mass black holes formed from the gravitational collapse of heavy stars, but currently we know less than 100 objects. We also know $\sim 100$ stellar-mass black holes in other galaxies, most of them discovered by gravitational wave observatories in the past 10 years. The detection of black holes is indeed extremely challenging and possible only in very special cases. This article is a short review on the physics and astrophysics of stellar-mass black holes.</description>

      <title>Forward and Reverse Shock Emission from Relativistic Jets with Arbitrary Angular and Stratified Radial Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts are expected to be generated by structured jets, whose profiles significantly impact their afterglow emission. Previously, we developed a numerical code jetsimpy, to model the afterglow of jets with arbitrary angular profiles. In this study, we extend the code to incorporate a stratified radial profile, enabling it to model jets with arbitrary axisymmetric two-dimensional structures. The radial profile leads to the formation of a reverse shock. We modeled the shock system using an energy conservation prescription, which differs from the pressure balance approach. This leads to remarkably different predictions for reverse shock emission. In particular, we find that the reverse shock emission in the thin shell case is significantly overestimated in analytic models. We also explore the off-axis reverse shock emission from structured jets, where the cores belong to thick shell cases and the wings belong to thin shell cases. We have confirmed the prediction that off-axis observers may see a thin-to-thick transition, but we find that the light curve morphology is hard to distinguish from pure thin or thick shell cases. A radial profile also introduces hydrodynamic energy injection. As such, our code can naturally apply to refreshed shock cases, where the modeling of kilonova afterglows is demonstrated as an example. To validate our method, we fit the optical flash of GRB 990123, showing good agreement with the data. The upgraded jetsimpy provides unprecedented flexibility in modeling the afterglow emission of jets with various profiles, including those derived from general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations.</description>

      <title>A unified model for long-period radio transients and white dwarf binary pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-period radio transients (LPTs) represent a recently uncovered class of Galactic radio sources exhibiting minute-to-hour periodicities and highly polarised pulses of second-to-minute duration. Their phenomenology does not fit exactly in any other class, although it might resemble that of radio magnetars or of white dwarf (WD) radio emitting binary systems. Notably, two LPTs with confirmed multi-wavelength counterparts have been identified as synchronised white dwarf-M dwarf binaries (polars). Meanwhile, systems such as AR Scorpii and J1912-44 exhibit short-period pulsations in a hr-tight orbit, with polarized radio emission proposed to be generated by the interaction of the WD magnetosphere with the low-mass companion wind.
  Here we demonstrate that both LPTs and WD binary pulsars can be explained within a single geometric model in which radio emission is triggered when the magnetic pole of a rotating white dwarf intersects its companion's wind in the binary orbital plane. We use a 36-year timing baseline to infer the orbital period and binary geometry solely from radio data of GPM J1839-10, the longest-active LPT known. The model naturally predicts its intermittent emission and double-pulse structure. Crucially, we show that the beat period between the spin and the orbit matches the observed pulse substructure and polarisation signatures, providing strong support for the model. Applying this model to the WD binary pulsar J1912-44, it can also reproduce the system emission and geometry. Our results place GPM J1839-10, and other LPTs in general and radio emitting WD binaries, at different stages of a continuum between intermediate and synchronised polars, suggesting a unified population of magnetic WD binaries driving coherent radio emission.</description>

      <title>Implementing and Verifying a Fourier Domain Approach to Fast Stochastic X-ray Polarimetry Timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The launch of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), the first space-based polarimeter since 1978, offers a two order of magnitude improvement to the measurement of X-ray polarisation than its predecessor OSO-8, offering unprecedented precision for the measurement of polarisation degree and polarisation angle of X-ray sources. This advancement lends itself to the birth of a number of contemporary techniques to study Galactic compact objects, including X-ray polarimetry-timing, the study of how polarisation properties evolve over short timescales. However, the statistical nature of polarisation measurements poses a challenge for studies on arbitrarily short timescales, as a large number of photons are required to achieve statistically significant measurements of polarisation degree and angle for time-resolved analyses. Furthermore, if the polarisation variability is stochastic, then phase-folding techniques introduce systematic errors in the phase assignment of photons. Ingram and Maccarone presented a model independent Fourier-based technique that circumvents these issues. It can be used on arbitrarily short timescales for any kind of variability, whether aperiodic, quasi-periodic or purely periodic. Here we implement this method on real IXPE data. We address several instrumental effects and test the technique on X-ray pulsars, RX-J0440.9+4431 and Hercules X-1 . We verify that our technique recovers the polarisation variability signal that we already know to be there from typical phase-folding techniques. It will now be possible to study fast stochastic polarisation variability of X-ray sources, with applications including quasi-periodic oscillations, mass accretion rate fluctuations, and reverberation mapping.</description>

      <title>Solar disk gamma-rays emission via synthetic magnetic field from photosphere to low corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray emission in the GeV-TeV range from the solar disk is likely to arise from collisions of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) with solar atmospheric plasma. In a previous study, we demonstrated that closed turbulent magnetic arcades trap efficiently GCRs leading to a gamma-ray flux consistent with the Fermi-HAWC observations (from $\sim 0.1$ GeV to $\sim 1$ TeV). Here, we model a synthetic magnetic field with a static, laminar structure of open field lines in the chromosphere increasingly braiding near the solar surface, with a scale height of $\sim 10^{-2} R_\odot$. The height-dependent increase in magnetic field line braiding is modulated by an exponential scalar function, mimicking the bending of the photo- and chromo-spheric magnetic field revealed by polarimetric observations and reproduced by MHD simulations. Employing 3D test-particle numerical simulations, we investigate how distorted magnetic field lines affect the gamma-rays production by injecting GeV-TeV protons into both magnetically laminar and braided regions. We find that with the chosen spatial resolution this synthetic magnetic field can account for the $&gt; 10$ GeV gamma-ray spectrum observed by Fermi-LAT/HAWC. A rebrightening between approximately $30$ and $100$ GeV (following a $\sim 30$ GeV spectral dip), suggests an enhanced confinement within the photo-/chromospheric layer by a stronger braiding.</description>

      <title>Delayed Launch of Ultrafast Outflows in the Tidal Disruption Event AT2020afhd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection and characterization of ultrafast outflows (UFOs) in the X-ray spectra of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2020afhd, based on observations from NICER, Swift, and XMM. Prominent blueshifted absorption features were detected exclusively during the intermediate phase of the event, occurring between days 172 and 212 within the first 300 days post-discovery. During this period, the UFO appeared no earlier than day 74, strengthened between days 172 and 194, and disappeared after day 215. This marks the first time that the full evolutionary sequence of X-ray outflows has been observed in a TDE. Moreover, the outflows exhibited a dramatic deceleration from ~0.19c to ~0.0097c over a span of approximately 10 days. Photoionization spectral analysis reveals an inverse correlation between outflow velocity and ionization parameter, in contradiction to the predictions from radiation pressure-driven wind. Eventually, we propose that the delayed onset of the outflows may result from an increase in the wind opening angle and/or metal enrichment, particularly iron and oxygen, during the disk formation phase.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Exploding Supermassive PopIII Stars at High Redshift in JWST, EUCLID and Roman Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently discovered supermassive black holes with masses of $\sim10^8\,M_\odot$ at redshifts $z\sim9$-$11$ in active galactic nuclei (AGN) pose severe challenges to our understanding of supermassive black hole formation. One proposed channel are rapidly accreting supermassive PopIII stars (SMSs) that form in large primordial gas halos and grow up to $&lt;10^6\,M_\odot$. They eventually collapse due to the general relativistic instability and could lead to supernova-like explosions. This releases massive and energetic ejecta that then interact with the halo medium via an optically thick shock. We develop a semi-analytic model to compute the shock properties, bolometric luminosity, emission spectrum and photometry over time. The initial data is informed by stellar evolution and general relativistic SMS collapse simulations. We find that SMS explosion light curves reach a brightness $\sim10^{45\mathrm{-}47}\,\mathrm{erg/s}$ and last $10$-$200$ years in the source frame - up to $250$-$3000$ years with cosmic time dilation. This makes them quasi-persistent sources which vary indistinguishably to little red dots and AGN within $0.5$-$9\,(1+z)$ yrs. Bright SMS explosions are observable in long-wavelength JWST filters up to $z\leq20$ ($24$-$26$ mag) and pulsating SMSs up to $z\leq15$. EUCLID and the Roman space telescope (RST) can detect SMS explosions at $z&lt;11$-$12$. Their deep fields could constrain the SMS rate down to $10^{-11}$Mpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, which is much deeper than JWST bounds. Based on cosmological simulations and observed star formation rates, we expect to image up to several hundred SMS explosions with EUCLID and dozens with RST deep fields.</description>

      <title>A Common Origin of Normal Type Ia Supernovae Suggested by the Photometric Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, with an increasing number of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered soon after their explosions, a non-negligible fraction of SNe Ia with early-excess emissions (EExSNe Ia) have been confirmed. In this letter, we present a total of \textbf{67} early-phase normal SNe Ia from published papers and ongoing transient survey projects to systematically investigate their photometric behaviors from very early time. We found that EExSNe Ia in our sample have longer rise and brighter peak luminosities compared to those of non-EExSNe Ia. Moreover, EExSNe Ia commonly have ``red-bump" features in the early $B-V$ color while non-EExSNe Ia show blueward evolution from the very beginning. Here, we propose that the thin-helium double-detonation scenario can phenomenologically explain the photometric diversities of normal SNe Ia considering different white dwarf-He-shell mass combinations and the viewing-angle effect, implying a unified explosion mechanism of normal-type SNe Ia. To further testify the possible common origin of normal SNe Ia, systematical studies of multiband photometric and spectral properties of early-phase SNe Ia through the new generation wide-field time-domain survey facilities and global real-time follow-up networks are highly demanded.</description>

      <title>Characterization of downward Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes detected at the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Downward Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGFs) are sub-millisecond bursts of MeV gamma rays produced in thunderclouds. According to the Relativistic Runaway Electron Avalanche model, gamma rays are produced, via bremsstrahlung, from electron cascades activated by a relativistic "seed" electron. It is not clear what mechanism is responsible for the acceleration of electrons to relativistic energies in electric discharges. To better understand the acceleration sites and the TGF production mechanisms, it is critically important to identify the TGF source position and geometry in the atmosphere and to study the gamma emission characteristics. The Surface Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory, with its 1600 water-Cherenkov detectors very sensitive to high-energy photons and with a very fine time-sampling, is a valuable instrument to study downward TGFs. The possibility to analyze the radiation emission in detail led to the observation of the first TGFs with an asymmetric azimuthal structure, suggesting a complex source different from the initially hypothesized downward beam. We report on these observations and the new perspectives which may open with the incorporation of new instruments at the Auger site to study lightning development alongside gamma emission, and the increasingly detailed data provided by satellites and global lightning networks.</description>

      <title>Examining the Gap in the Chirp Mass Distribution of Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass distribution of binary black holes inferred from gravitational wave measurements is expected to shed light on their formation scenarios. An emerging structure in the mass distribution indicates the presence of multiple peaks around chirp masses of $8M_\odot$, $14M_\odot$, and $27M_\odot$. In particular, there is a lack of observations between chirp masses of 10 and 12 $M_\odot$. In this letter, we report that observations significantly favour the model supporting suppression of the rate in a narrow chirp mass range compared to the model that doesn't include suppression at a confidence greater than 99.5\%. Using another test, which measures the deviation between the inferred chirp mass distributions from the two models, we conservatively estimate a 95\% confidence in the presence of a feature. A lack of confidence has been reported in the presence of a gap around a comparable location in the component mass distribution. The differing conclusions are due to a unique correlation between the primary~(heavier of the two masses) and the secondary~(lighter of the two masses) masses of binary black holes. This correlation results in increased clustering of measured chirp masses around specific values.</description>

      <title>Spectral analysis of ultraluminous X-ray pulsars with models of X-ray pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fraction of the Ultra Luminous X-ray (ULX) sources are known to be accreting neutron stars as they show coherent X-ray pulsations with pulse periods ranging from ~1-30 seconds. While initially thought to host intermediate-mass black holes, ULXs have since been recognized as a diverse class of objects, including ULX pulsars. These pulsars require models specifically tailored to account for their unique accretion physics, distinct from those used for Galactic black hole binaries. The X-ray spectra of all Galactic accreting X-ray pulsars (including sources in the Magellanic Clouds) are dominated by a high energy cut-off power-law and some of the sources show a soft excess, some emission lines, cyclotron absorption features, etc. In this work, we undertake a comprehensive analysis of the broadband X-ray spectra of five ULX pulsars using simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations and show that their X-ray spectra can be effectively described by spectral models, similar to those used for the local accretion-powered X-ray pulsars. A soft excess is detected in all the sources which is also consistent with the local X-ray pulsars that have low absorption column density. We have marginal detection or low upper limit on the presence of the iron K-alpha emission line from these sources, which is a key difference of the ULX pulsars with the local accreting X-ray pulsars. We discuss the implication of this on the nature of the binary companion and the accretion mechanism in the ULX pulsars.</description>

      <title>Decadal evolution of a repeating fast radio burst source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs), the brightest cosmic radio explosions, is still unknown. Bearing critical clues to FRBs' origin, the long-term evolution of FRBs has yet to be confirmed, since the field is still young and most FRBs were seen only once. Here we report clear evidence of decadal evolution of FRB~20121102A, the first precisely localized repeater. In conjunction with archival data, our FAST and GBT monitoring campaign since 2020 reveals a significant 7% decline of local dispersion measure (DM). The rotation measure (RM) of 30,755$\pm$16 $\mathrm{rad\,m^{-2}}$ detected in the last epoch represents a 70% decrease compared to that from December 2016. The $\sigma_{RM}$ parameter, which describes the complexity of the magneto-ionic environment surrounding the source, was shown to have decreased by 13%. These general trends reveal an evolving FRB environment, which could originate from an early-phase supernova associated with an enhanced pair wind from the FRB central engine.</description>

      <title>1D Vlasov Simulations of QED Cascades Over Pulsar Polar Caps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in the study of pulsar radio emission revealed that the microphysics of quantum electrodynamic (QED) pair cascades at pulsar polar caps may be responsible for generating the observed coherent radio waves. However, modeling the pair cascades in the polar cap region poses significant challenges, particularly under conditions of high plasma multiplicity. Traditional Particle-in-Cell (PIC) methods often face rapidly increasing computational costs as the multiplicity grows exponentially. To address this issue, we present a new simulation code using the Vlasov method, which efficiently simulates the evolution of charged particle distribution functions in phase space without a proportional increase in computational expense at high multiplicities. We apply this code to study $e^\pm$ pair cascades in 1D, incorporating key physical processes such as curvature radiation, radiative cooling, and magnetic pair production. We study both the Ruderman-Sutherland (RS) and the Space-charge-limited Flow (SCLF) regimes, and find quasiperiodic gap formation and pair production bursts in both cases. These features produce strong electric field oscillations, potentially enabling coherent low-frequency radio emission. We construct a unified analytic model that describes the key features of the polar cap cascade, which can be used to estimate the return current heating rate that can be used to inform X-ray hotspot models. Spectral analysis shows that a significant amount of energy is carried in superluminal modes -- collective excitations that could connect to observed radio features. Our results align with previous PIC studies while offering enhanced fidelity in both dense and rarefied regions.</description>

      <title>Accretion Disk Luminosity and Topological Characteristics for a Schwarzschild Black Hole Surrounded by a Hernquist Dark Matter Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study some characteristics and gravitational signatures of the Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a Hernquist dark matter halo (SBH-HDM). We determine the black hole's remnant radius and mass, which provide useful residual information at the end of its evaporation. We then explore the luminosity of the accretion disk from the SBH-HDM model. In this way, we determine the key orbital parameters of the test particles within the accretion disk, such as angular velocity, angular momentum, energy, and the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit, based on the dark matter model parameters. We also numerically estimate the accretion disk's efficiency in converting matter into radiation. We also demonstrate that dark matter, which significantly alters the geometry surrounding a Schwarzschild black hole, influences the accretion disk's radiative flux, temperature, differential luminosity, and spectral luminosity. The stability of a black hole spacetime is determined in the eikonal regime. The Lyapunov exponent is also analyzed to quantify the stability of the particle regime and to demonstrate the infall into or escape from the black hole to infinity, as well as the quasi-normal modes. Finally, some properties of black holes are studied from a topological perspective.</description>

      <title>Speed of sound peak in isospin QCD: a natural prediction of the Medium Separation Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present predictions for the zero-temperature equation of state at finite isospin density using the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model within the Medium Separation Scheme (MSS) -- a scheme that explicitly disentangles medium effects from the ultraviolet divergent vacuum terms. Recent lattice QCD results reveal a nonmonotonic speed of sound ($c_s^2$) as a function of isospin chemical potential ($\mu_I$), exhibiting explicit violation of the conformal bound $c_s^2 = 1/3$. These findings have attracted significant theoretical interest, as established models -- including the NJL model -- failed to anticipate this behavior prior to lattice simulations. Conventional NJL implementations yield unphysical artifacts, often attributed to regularization scale sensitivity stemming from nonrenormalizability. However, in this work, we demonstrate that the standard NJL framework combined with MSS quantitatively reproduces state-of-the-art lattice data for isospin QCD.</description>

      <title>Double tidal disruption events in the changing-look AGN Mrk1018</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) as excellent beacons to black hole (BH) accreting systems have been studied for more than five decades with a single star tidally disrupted by a central massive BH. However, if considering two stars passing through a central BH and being tidally disrupted in a short period, so-called double TDEs could be expected and lead to unique variability features very different from features from standard TDEs. Here, we report such oversimplified double TDEs in the known changing-look AGN Mrk1018, of which 15years-long light curve with plateau features can be described by two main-sequence stars tidally disrupted by the central supermassive BH. Meanwhile, the BH mass determined by the double TDEs is consistent with the M-sigma relation determined value by the measured stellar velocity dispersions in Mrk1018. The results indicate tight connections between the TDEs and the changing-look properties in Mrk1018.</description>

      <title>New Frontiers in the Study of Magnetic Massive Stars with the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-mass stars are notable for several reasons: they are characterized by strong winds, which inject momentum and enriched material into their surroundings, and die spectacularly as supernovae, leaving behind compact remnants and heavy elements (such as those that make life on Earth possible). Despite their relative rarity, they play a disproportionate role in the evolution of the galaxies that host them, and likely also played a significant role in the early days of the Universe. A subset ($\sim$10\%) of these stars was also found to host magnetic fields on their surface. These fields impact their evolution, and may lead to exotic physics (e.g., heavy stellar-mass black holes, pair-instability supernovae, magnetars, etc.). However, the detection and measurement of magnetic fields is limited, due to current instrumentation, to nearby massive stars in the Milky Way. To truly understand how magnetism arises in massive stars, and what role it might have played in earlier stages of our Universe, we require next-generation hardware, such as the proposed near-infrared-to-ultraviolet spectropolarimeter Pollux, on the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). In this contribution, we detail how Pollux @ HWO will enable new frontiers in the study of magnetic massive stars, delivering results that will profoundly impact the fields of stellar formation, stellar evolution, compact objects, and stellar feedback.</description>

      <title>Properties of compact objects in quadratic non-metricity gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical compact objects are studied in the context of quadratic non-metricity gravity. The solutions to the gravitational field equations, which include fluid components, are analyzed to investigate the density and pressure properties of radio pulsars. It is explicitly demonstrated that the theoretically stable models are consistent with astronomical data, due to the geometric features of the quadratic component. Furthermore, it is shown that, in contrast to the compactness limits of black holes in general relativity, the core density can significantly exceed the density at which nuclear saturation occurs, and the surface density can also surpass the value of nuclear saturation. Additionally, it is found that the radial sound speed remains below the conformal upper bound for sound velocity established by perturbative quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Universality of gravitational radiation from magnetar magnetospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intense magnetic fields inferred from magnetars suggest they may be strong gravitational-wave emitters. Although emissions due to hydromagnetic deformations are more promising from a detection standpoint, exterior fields also contribute a strain. However, numerical evidence suggests that the free energy of stable magnetospheric solutions cannot exceed a few tens of percent relative to the potential state, implying that the gravitational-wave luminosity cannot differ significantly between models. This prompts `universality', in the sense that the strain provides a direct probe of the near-surface field without being muddied by magnetospheric currents. Using a suite of three-dimensional, force-free, general-relativistic solutions for dipole and dipole-plus-quadrupole fields, we find that space-based interferometers may enable marginal detections out to $\lesssim$ kpc distances for slowly-rotating magnetars with fields of $\gtrsim 10^{15}$ G.</description>

      <title>Frabjous: Deep Learning Fast Radio Burst Morphologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing field of view of radio telescopes and improved data processing capabilities have led to a surge in the detection of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). The discovery rate of FRBs is already a few per day and is expected to increase rapidly with new surveys coming online. The growing number of events necessitates prioritized follow-up due to limited multi-wavelength resources, requiring rapid and automated classification. In this study, we introduce Frabjous, a deep learning framework for an automated morphology classifier with an aim towards enabling the prompt follow-up of anomalous and intriguing FRBs, and a comprehensive statistical analysis of FRB morphologies. Deep learning models require a large training set of each FRB archetype, however, publicly available data lacks sufficient samples for most FRB types. In this paper, we build a simulation framework for generating realistic examples of FRBs and train a network based on a combination of simulated and real data, starting with the CHIME/FRB catalog. Applying our framework to the first CHIME/FRB catalog, we achieve an overall classification accuracy of approximately 55%, well over a random multiclass classification rate of 20 % with five balanced classes during training. While this falls short of desirable performance, we critically discuss the limitations of our approach and propose potential avenues for improvement. Future work should explore strategies to augment training datasets and broaden the scope of FRB morphological studies, aiming for more accurate and reliable classification results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electromagnetic (EM) helicity flux density and the magnetic helicity are related by topological Chern-Simons terms. We show that the helicity flux density is distinguished from magnetic helicity by analysing Hopf solitons. We find the helicity flux density for a point charge moving with an acceleration, extending the Li\'enard-Wiechert angular distribution of radiant power. We also derive the multipole expansion of the helicity flux density, generalizing the Larmor's formula for the radiant power. These formulae have been applied to discuss the helicity flux density in several toy models such as circular and helical motion as well as soft bremsstrahlung. We also comment on the potential applications of the EM helicity flux density to pulsar systems.</description>

      <title>General form for Pseudo-Newtonian Potentials, imitating Schwarzschild geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new, general form for a pseudo-Newtonian gravitational potential (PNP), expressed as a series of Paczy\'nski-Wiita-like functions with the addition of increasing negative powers of $r$ with arbitrary coefficients. We present a procedure for determining these coefficients to construct a custom PNP that replicates key features of Schwarzschild geodesics for a test particle near a black hole. As an example, we construct potentials set to reproduce (I) the presence of an innermost stable circular orbit at the $r=6$ (geometric units), with the correct infall velocity for small deviations (on the geodesic universal infall), (II) the periapsis advance at large distances, and (III) the presence of a marginally bound circular orbit with specific angular momentum $L=4$, and the periapsis advance of parabolic orbits close to it. We compare the performance of our examples against the Paczy\'nski-Wiita potential and other existing potentials. Finally, we discuss the limitations and advantages of our formulation.</description>

      <title>Smooth binary evolution from wide resonances in boson clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight scalars can form superradiant clouds around rotating black holes. These may alter the dynamics of compact binaries and the ensuing waveform through orbital resonances and cloud ionization. We re-examine resonances involving states with nonzero decay width, deriving an effective treatment for resonances that are wider than the binary's frequency chirp. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by calculating an upper bound for the cloud's mass surviving up to the latest stages of the inspiral. Next, we study the accumulation of resonances with high-energy bound states. When these infinitely many, increasingly weak resonances are properly taken into account, they smooth out the "sharp features" in the binary's evolution that had been attributed to the ionization of the cloud. We compare our Newtonian results with recent relativistic calculations, highlighting common features as well as discrepancies. Our conclusions emphasize the need to carefully incorporate resonances in boson cloud waveform modeling.</description>

      <title>Leveraging NRTidalv3 to develop gravitational waveform models with higher-order modes for binary neutron star systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and reliable gravitational waveform models are crucial in determining the properties of compact binary mergers. In particular, next-generation gravitational-wave detectors will require more accurate waveforms to avoid biases in the analysis. In this work, we extend the recent NRTidalv3 model to account for higher-mode corrections in the tidal phase contributions for binary neutron star systems. The higher-mode, multipolar NRTidalv3 model is then attached to several binary-black-hole baselines, such as the phenomenological IMRPhenomXHM and IMRPhenomXPHM models, and the effective-one-body-based model SEOBNRv5HM_ROM. We test the performance and validity of the newly developed models by comparing them with numerical-relativity simulations and other tidal models. Finally, we employ them in parameter estimation analyses on simulated signals from both comparable-mass and high-mass-ratio systems, as well as on the gravitational-wave event GW170817, for which we find consistent results with respect to previous analyses.</description>

Abstract: The ASTRI Mini-Array is an international collaboration led by the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics. The project aims to construct and operate an array of nine Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes to study gamma-ray sources at very high energy (TeV) and perform stellar intensity interferometry observations. We describe the updated Online Observation Quality System (OOQS) software architecture. The OOQS is one of the subsystems of the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. It aims to execute real-time data quality checks on the data acquired by the Cherenkov cameras and intensity interferometry instruments and provide feedback to both SCADA and the Operator about abnormal conditions detected. The data quality results are stored in the Quality Archive for further investigation and sent to the Operator Human Machine Interface (HMI) through Kafka.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that the recently reported GW231123 event, with component masses $M_1=137^{+22}_{-17}\,M_\odot$, $M_2=103^{+20}_{-52}\,M_\odot$ and a local merger rate $R_{\mathrm{local}}=0.08^{+0.19}_{-0.07}\,\mathrm{Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}$, originates from primordial black holes (PBHs) formed during an early matter-dominated era. We compute the PBH mass function, abundance, spin distribution and the merger rate density and find a set of choices for the parameters to reproduce the key properties of GW231123. We also show that the resulting PBH abundance, $f_{\mathrm{pbh}}= 1.64^{+5.00}_{-1.59}\times10^{-1}$, is at the border of the exclusion regions, but still remains self-consistent. Finally, we estimate the scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) that are inevitably generated during PBH formation. PBHs that interpret GW231123 are accompanied by negligible SIGWs in the nano-hertz band, indicating no conflict with current pulsar timing arrays data.</description>

      <title>Simulating a Gaussian stochastic gravitational wave background signal in pulsar timing arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the theoretical modeling and simulation of a Gaussian stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) signal in a pulsar timing array (PTA). We show that the correlation between Fourier components of pulsar timing residuals can be expressed using transfer functions; that are indicative of characteristic temporal correlations in a SGWB signal observed in a finite time window. These transfer functions, when convolved with the SGWB power spectrum and spatial correlation (Hellings \&amp; Downs curve), describe the variances and correlations of the pulsar timing residuals' Fourier coefficients. The convolutions are the exact frequency- and Fourier-domain representations of the time-domain covariance function. We derive explicit forms for the transfer functions for unpolarized and circularly polarized SGWB signals. We validate our results by comparing Gaussian theoretical expectation values with standard simulations based on point sources and our own covariance-matrix-based approach. The unified frequency- and Fourier-domain formalism provides a robust foundation for future PTA precision analyses and highlights the importance of temporal correlations in interpreting GW signals.</description>

      <title>Shocked jets in CCSNe can power the zoo of fast blue optical transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.04636v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evidence is mounting that recent multiwavelength detections of fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) in star-forming galaxies comprise a new class of transients, whose origin is yet to be understood. We show that hydrogen-rich collapsing stars that launch relativistic jets near the central engine can naturally explain the entire set of FBOT observables. The jet-star interaction forms a mildly-relativistic shocked jet (inner cocoon) component, which powers cooling emission that dominates the high velocity optical signal during the first few weeks, with a typical energy of $ \sim 10^{50}-10^{51} $ erg. During this time, the cocoon radial energy distribution implies that the optical lightcurve exhibits a fast decay of $ L \propto t^{-2.4} $. After a few weeks, when the velocity of the emitting shell is $ \sim 0.01 $ c, the cocoon becomes transparent, and the cooling envelope governs the emission. The interaction between the cocoon and the dense circumstellar winds generates synchrotron self-absorbed emission in the radio bands, featuring a steady rise on a month timescale. After a few months the relativistic outflow decelerates, enters the observer's line of sight, and powers the peak of the radio lightcurve, which rapidly decays thereafter. The jet (and the inner cocoon) become optically thin to X-rays $ \sim $ day after the collapse, allowing X-ray photons to diffuse from the central engine that launched the jet to the observer. Cocoon cooling emission is expected at higher volumetric rates than gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) by a factor of a few, similar to FBOTs. We rule out uncollimated outflows, however both GRB jets and failed collimated jets are compatible with all observables.</description>

      <title>Mass-gap Black Holes in Coalescing Neutron Star Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of a mass gap of $3-5\,M_{\odot}$ between the heaviest neutron stars (NSs) and the lightest black holes (BHs), inferred from the BH mass distribution in low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), has been suggested for decades. The recently reported gravitational-wave source GW230529 has been confidently identified as a NSBH merger, with the BH mass falling within this lower mass gap. This detection provides strong evidence against the existence of the latter and introduces new implications for the coalescing NSBH population, including a revised BH mass distribution and an updated local merger rate. In this study, we employ POSYDON, a binary population synthesis code that integrates detailed single- and binary-star models, to investigate coalescing NSBH binaries formed through isolated binary evolution. In particular, we focus on the BH mass distribution of the intrinsic NSBH merger population. We find that, with a high common-envelope efficiency of $\alpha_{\rm{CE}} =2 $, the BH masses in NSBH mergers concentrate in the lower mass gap, aligning more closely with observations. However, after accounting for the constraints of the selection bias against mass-gap BHs in LMXBs, which suggests that the maximum NS birth mass is below $\simeq 2\,M_{\odot}$, we find that introducing a high $\alpha_{\rm{CE}}$ is not required to match observations. Additionally, we explore the impact of core-collapse supernova kicks. Finally, we present the property distributions of observable NSBH mergers from our simulation and find that they match well with the observations. We find that the fraction of electromagnetic counterparts in observable populations is $\approx 4-30\%$, depending on different NS equations of state.

      <title>Relativistic Gas Accretion onto Supermassive Black Hole Binaries from Inspiral Through Merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06389v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accreting supermassive black hole binaries are powerful multimessenger sources emitting both gravitational and EM radiation. Understanding the accretion dynamics of these systems and predicting their distinctive EM signals is crucial to informing and guiding upcoming efforts aimed at detecting gravitational waves produced by these binaries. To this end, accurate numerical modeling is required to describe both the spacetime and the magnetized gas around the black holes. In this paper, we present two key advances in this field of research. First, we have developed a novel 3D GRMHD framework that combines multiple numerical codes to simulate the inspiral and merger of supermassive black hole binaries starting from realistic initial data and running all the way through merger. Throughout the evolution, we adopt a simple but functional prescription to account for gas cooling through photon emission. Next, we have applied our new computational method to follow the time evolution of a circular, equal-mass, non-spinning black hole binary for ~200 orbits, starting from a separation of 20r_g and reaching the post-merger evolutionary stage of the system. We have shown how mass continues to flow toward the binary even after the binary "decouples" from its surrounding disk, but the accretion rate onto the black holes diminishes. We have identified how the minidisks orbiting each black hole are slowly drained and eventually dissolve as the binary compresses. We confirm previous findings that the system's luminosity decreases by only a factor of a few during inspiral; however, we observe an abrupt increase by ~50% in this quantity at the time of merger, likely accompanied by an equally abrupt change in spectrum. Finally, we have demonstrated that during the inspiral, fluid ram pressure regulates the fraction of the magnetic flux transported to the binary that attaches to the black holes' horizons.</description>

      <title>Modulation of the galactic cosmic ray spectrum in an anisotropic diffusion approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel diffusion model for the propagation of cosmic rays (CRs) that incorporates an anisotropic diffusion tensor of a general form within a realistically modeled large-scale Galactic magnetic field. The parameters of the model are consistent with the contemporary understanding of the large-scale Galactic magnetic field structure and the dynamics of small-scale turbulent CR propagation. The paper demonstrates the modulation of spectra of Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) in the magnetic rigidity range of 1 - 30 PV (the CR knee) and explores the spatial variation of this phenomenon. The observed modulation of the spectrum is explained by changes in the leakage mechanism.</description>

      <title>Study on the magnetic field of the ultraluminous X-ray pulsar RX J0209.6-7427</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: RX J0209.6-7427 is an ultraluminous X-ray pulsar (ULXP) having spin period of about 9.3 s. To date, no cyclotron resonance scattering features have been detected in this source, which can enable direct measurement of the magnetic field of the pulsar. We estimate the surface magnetic field of the neutron star in this source using different models and find that the inferred magnetic field lies in the range of $2.4-4 \times 10^{13}$G. We study the magnetic field and spin period evolution of the source using existing models and find that the magnetic field will decay to about $\sim 10^{9}$G assuming steady accretion and the source will become a millisecond pulsar at the end of the accretion phase of the accreting binary. Comparison between the magnetic field and the spin period of other ULXPs with those of magnetars suggests that some ULXPs may have magnetar-like strong dipolar magnetic fields. Studying the magnetic and spin period evolution of ULXPs may be helpful for understanding magnetar evolution and the millisecond pulsar formation.</description>

      <title>X-ray reflection spectroscopy with improved calculations of the emission angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00946v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reflection spectrum produced by a cold medium illuminated by X-ray photons is not isotropic and its shape depends on the emission angle. In the reflection spectrum of an accretion disk of a black hole, the value of the emission angle changes over the disk and, in general, is different from the value of the inclination angle of the disk because of the light bending in the strong gravitational field of the black hole. Current reflection models make some approximations, as calculating a reflection spectrum taking the correct emission angle at every point of the disk into account would be too time-consuming and make the model too slow to analyze observations. In a recent paper, we showed that these approximations are unsuitable to fit high-quality black hole spectra expected from the next generation of X-ray missions. Here, we present a reflection model with improved calculations of the emission angle that solves this problem.</description>

      <title>Effects of Lorentz invariance violation on particle and photon production in astrophysical sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) on radiation processes in astrophysical sources, focusing on synchrotron and inverse Compton interactions. We derive modified expressions for radiated power and photon energy under LIV assumptions and incorporate them into first-order Fermi acceleration models. Our analysis reveals energy thresholds beyond which LIV significantly alters particle dynamics and photon spectra, introducing non-physical divergences that highlight limitations in perturbative approaches. We model synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission in the presence of LIV and assess its consequences for photon fluxes from blazars, including Markarian 501 and the BL Lac population. LIV introduces distinct high-energy emission regions that deviate from standard expectations. Comparisons with observational data, particularly upper limits from the Pierre Auger Observatory, suggest that future multi-messenger observations could constrain LIV parameters through the non-detection of such excesses.</description>

      <title>The cosmic-ray sea explains the Galactic $\gamma$-ray and $\nu$ diffuse emissions from GeV to PeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The LHAASO collaboration has recently released the spectrum and the angular distribution of the gamma-ray Galactic diffuse emission from 1 TeV to 1 PeV measured with the Kilometer-2 Array (KM2A) and the Water Cherenkov Detector Array (WCDA). We show that those data are in remarkably good agreement with a set of pre-existing models that assume the emission to be produced by the Galactic population of cosmic rays if its spectral shape traces that measured by CALET, DAMPE as well as KASCADE at higher energies. No extra-components besides the CR sea is needed to explain LHAASO results. Spatial dependent CR transport models, although not required to reproduce LHAASO results, are in better agreement with them respect to conventional ones and needed to consistently reproduce Fermi-LAT and neutrino data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The IceCube Observatory at the South Pole has been operating in its full configuration since May 2011 with a duty cycle of about 99%. Its main component consists of a cubic-kilometer array of optical sensors deployed deep in the Glacial ice designed for the detection of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos. A surface array for cosmic ray air shower detection, IceTop, and a denser inner subdetector, DeepCore, significantly enhance the capabilities of the observatory, making it a multipurpose facility. This list of contributions to the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference in Geneva, Switzerland (July 15-24, 2025) summarizes the latest results from IceCube covering a broad set of key questions in physics and astrophysics. The papers in this index are grouped topically to highlight IceCube contributions related to high-energy neutrino and multi-messenger astrophysics, atmospheric fluxes, cosmic-ray physics, low-energy neutrino transients, physics beyond the Standard Model, detector calibration and event reconstruction, and the status and performance of the IceCube Upgrade, a dense sensor infill complemented by calibration devices to be deployed by the end of 2025. Contributions related to IceCube-Gen2, the planned future extension of IceCube, are available in a separate collection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory, located in La Pampa Amarilla, Argentina, has been continuously acquiring data since 2004. It comprises a surface detector array covering 3,000 km$^2$ and 27 fluorescence telescopes, designed to detect extensive air showers initiated by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. An upgrade to the Observatory was commissioned in 2024, enhancing the existing water-Cherenkov detectors with additional radio antennas, surface scintillator detectors, and a buried scintillator array. This compilation of contributions to the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference, held in Geneva, Switzerland (July 15-24, 2025), presents recent results from the Pierre Auger Collaboration, addressing a wide range of fundamental questions in astroparticle physics. The included papers cover measurements of the energy spectrum, mass composition, and arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, investigations of hadronic interactions in extensive air showers, and searches for ultra-high-energy photons and neutrinos. Additional topics include radio detection techniques, solar-related phenomena, and atmospheric events such as ELVES and TGFs. The list also contains first results and performance evaluations of the upgraded detectors, AugerPrime, along with reports on outreach and social engagement initiatives conducted by the Collaboration.</description>

      <title>X-Ray Constraints on Dark Photon Tridents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark photons that are sufficiently light and/or weakly-interacting represent a compelling vision of dark matter. Dark photon decay into three photons, which we call the dark photon trident, can be the dominant channel when the dark photon mass falls below the electron pair threshold and can produce a significant flux of x-rays. We use 16 years of data from INTEGRAL/SPI to constrain sub-MeV dark photon decay, producing new worlds-best constraints on the kinetic mixing parameter for dark photon masses between 61 keV and 1022 keV, and comment on the potential for future x-ray observatories to discover the trident decay process.</description>

      <title>Low-Energy Supernova Constraints on Millicharged Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hot and dense conditions of the supernova core provide an ideal environment for the production of new feebly-interacting particles. Low-energy supernovae, characterized by low explosion energy, are particularly intriguing due to their stringent constraints on energy transfer from the core to the mantle by new particles. We investigate low-energy supernova constraints on millicharged particles by considering three production channels in the core: plasmon decay, proton bremsstrahlung, and electron-positron annihilation. We compute the energy deposition due to Coulomb scatterings of millicharged particles with protons in the mantle and find that low-energy supernovae impose the most stringent constraints on millicharged particles in the mass range of $\sim(12 - 170)$ MeV. Furthermore, we find that the electron-positron annihilation process, previously omitted in supernova studies on millicharged particles, is the dominant production channel in the high-mass region. This leads to new constraints from both supernova cooling calculations and low-energy supernova analyses. We also investigate MCP production via processes involving thermal pions and find that these processes could dominate over electron-positron annihilation, albeit with significant uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Spin effects in the phasing formula of eccentric compact binary inspirals up to the third post-Newtonian order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compact binary sources that emit gravitational waves (GW) are expected to be both spinning and on eccentric orbits. No closed-form expression for the phasing of GWs are available to date that contain information from both spin and eccentricity. The introduction of eccentricity can slow waveform generation, often requiring slower numerical methods governing its evolution. However, closed-form expressions for the waveform phase can be obtained when eccentricity is treated as a small parameter, enabling quick waveform generation. In this paper, closed-form expressions for the GW phasing in the form of Taylor approximants up to the eighth power in initial eccentricity $(e_0)$ are obtained while also including aligned spins up to the third post-Newtonian order. The phasing is obtained in both time and frequency domains. The fully analytical approximant (TaylorT2) is also resummed for usage in scenarios where initial eccentricities are as high as 0.5. The frequency domain approximant (TaylorF2) based on Stationary Phase approximation is compared with an existing model (TaylorF2Ecc) to assess the importance of the newly computed eccentric/spinning terms. The findings indicate that for eccentricities $\gtrsim 0.15$ (defined at 10 Hz) and small spins $(\sim 0.2)$, the mismatches can be higher than 1%. This leads to an overall loss in signal-to-noise ratio and lower detection efficiency of GWs coming from eccentric spinning compact binary inspirals if the combined effects of eccentricity and aligned spins are neglected in the waveforms.</description>

      <title>The thermal index of neutron-star matter in the virial approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by gravitational wave observations of binary neutron-star mergers, we study the thermal index of low-density, high-temperature dense matter. We use the virial expansion to account for nuclear interaction effects. We focus on the region of validity of the expansion, which reaches $10^{-3}$ fm$^{-3}$ at $T=5$ MeV up to almost saturation density at $T=50$ MeV. In pure neutron matter, we find an analytical expression for the thermal index, and show that it is nearly density- and temperature-independent, within a fraction of a percent of the non-interacting, non-relativistic value of $\Gamma_\text{th} \approx 5/3$. When we incorporate protons, electrons and photons, we find that the density and temperature dependence of the thermal index changes significantly. We predict a smooth transition between an electron-dominated regime with $\Gamma_\text{th} \approx 4/3$ at low densities to a neutron-dominated region with $\Gamma_\text{th} \approx 5/3$ at high densities. This behavior is by and large independent of proton fraction and is not affected by nuclear interactions in the region where the virial expansion converges. We model this smooth transition analytically and provide a simple but accurate parametrization of the inflection point between these regimes. When compared to tabulated realistic models of the thermal index, we find an overall agreement at high temperatures that weakens for colder matter. The discrepancies can be attributed to the missing contributions of nuclear clusters. The virial approximation provides a clear and physically intuitive framework for understanding the thermal properties of dense matter, offering a computationally efficient solution that makes it particularly well-suited for the regimes relevant to neutron star binary remnants.</description>

      <title>Can a secluded self-interacting dark sector generate detectable gravitational waves?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the possibility to detect the gravitational waves generated by a secluded self-interacting dark sector. ``Secluded'' means that the dark sector has almost no portal to the visible sector and thus its entropy is conserved by itself, and ``self-interacting'' means that dark matter in this model has a significant interaction to itself, making it consistent with the small-scale structure observations. A spontaneously broken $U(1)'$ is introduced for the interactions in the dark sector, and nearly massless dark radiation is also introduced to avoid the over-closure problem. Through a parameter space scan, we find that this model is highly constrained by the current observed effective number of neutrinos ($N_{\text{eff}}$) and the large-scale structure observable Lyman-$\alpha$. Combined together, these two constraints make such a secluded self-interacting dark sector almost impossible to generate gravitational waves accessible at future projects like SKA or LISA.</description>

      <title>The First Model-Independent Chromatic Microlensing Search: No Evidence in the Gravitational Wave Catalog of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lensing of Gravitational Waves (GWs) due to intervening matter distribution in the universe can lead to chromatic and achromatic signatures in the wave-optics and geometrical-optics limit respectively. This makes it difficult to model for the unknown mass distribution of the lens and hence requires a model-independent lensing detection technique from GW data. We perform the first model-independent microlensing search in the wave-optics limit on the 72 super-threshold GW events observed with both the LIGO detectors up to the third observation catalog GWTC-3 of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA using the analysis method $\mu$-\texttt{GLANCE}. These unmodelled searches pick up one plausible candidate $\rm GW190408\_181802$ with a slightly above threshold residual amplitude compared to the residual expected from detector noise. However, exploring the microlensing modulation signatures on this event, we do not find any conclusive evidence of the microlensing signal in the data. With this, we confidently rule out the presence of any statistically significant microlensing signal in the 72 events up to GWTC-3 in a model-independent way.</description>

      <title>Predicting the outcome of collisional neutrino flavor conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16961v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collisional flavor instabilities, driven by differing neutrino and antineutrino reaction rates, are expected to occur in dense astrophysical environments like supernovae and neutron star mergers, but have yet to be incorporated in large-scale simulations. We derive analytical expressions for the asymptotic state resulting from a homogeneous and isotropic instability, and apply these predictions to two representative conditions from a neutron star merger simulation. We emphasize the importance of using a collision term that allows for both damping of flavor coherence and relaxation back to the classical steady state. When this classical configuration is collisional-unstable, the resulting asymptotic state reflects a compromise between classical relaxation and flavor conversion, defining a "quantum" equilibrium with nonzero coherence. This analysis highlights the possibility of a tradeoff between classical and quantum effects, an important feature with regard to the inclusion of flavor oscillation physics into global simulations.</description>

      <title>$g$-mode oscillations of dark matter admixed neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate $g$-mode oscillations in dark matter admixed neutron stars employing a relativistic mean field model to describe hadronic matter and a model for self-interacting fermionic dark matter motivated by the neutron decay anomaly. Following the construction of such admixed configurations, we derive the equilibrium and adiabatic speeds of sound therein, leading to a computation of the star's $g$-mode spectrum in the Cowling approximation. In particular, we explore the effect of dark matter self-interaction, the nucleon effective mass and dark matter fraction on the principal $g$-mode frequency, and its first overtone. We show that the effect on $g$-mode frequency depends predominantly on the dark matter fraction, and demonstrate an equation of state-independent constraint for the latter. Prospects of identifying the presence of dark matter in neutron stars using $g$-mode are discussed.</description>

      <title>Bringing the Norma Dark Cloud to Light in X-rays</title>

Abstract: The filamentary dark cloud complex in Norma reveals signs of active low-mass star formation including protostars, H-alpha emission line stars, Herbig Haro objects, and the eruptive FU Orionis-like star V346 Nor. We present results of the first pointed X-ray observations of the Norma dark cloud, focusing on the westernmost Sandqvist 187 region. Chandra detected 75 X-ray sources and a complementary XMM-Newton observation detected 92 sources within the Chandra field-of-view, of which 46 are cross-matched to Chandra, yielding 121 unique X-ray sources. We present a catalog of X-ray sources along with basic X-ray properties and candidate IR and optical counterparts. Existing near-IR photometry reveals several X-ray sources with color excesses as typical of young stars with disks. Gaia parallaxes single out foreground stars and X-ray sources with distances of 500 - 1000 pc that are probable cloud members. The known emission line stars Sz 136 and Sz 137 were detected but V346 Nor was not. Interestingly, the optical and IR counterparts of the brightest Chandra source are not known with certainty but the prime suspects are very faint. Thus, the nature of the object responsible for the bright X-ray emission remains speculative. The X-ray observations presented here will serve as a pathfinder for identifying and characterizing the young stellar population in the Norma dark cloud.</description>

      <title>Composition of Scalar Mesons and Their Effects on Nuclear Matter Properties in an Extended Linear Sigma Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been argued that the iso-scalar and iso-vector mesons play significant roles in nuclear matter and neutron star structures. We improve the extended linear sigma model with baryons, proposed in our previous work, by introducing the flavor structures constructed from antisymmetric tensors of chiral representations to study these physics. The parameter space of this model is refined with well-reproduced nuclear matter properties at saturation density by the lowest order Lagrangian, ensuring consistency with vacuum results, such as $f_\pi \approx 134 \, \text{MeV}$. The anticipated plateau-like behaviors of the symmetry energy are predicted at intermediate densities, which is crucial for the consistency of GW170817 and the neutron skin thickness of $\text{Pb}^{208}$. Subsequently, neutron star structures are calculated using several parameter sets, and the results for the nuclear matter properties at saturation density align with empirical values. It is found that the neutron star structures are sensitive to the couplings between the iso-vector $a_0$ meson and nucleons and the four-vector meson couplings: small values of both are favorable. Meanwhile, nuclear matter properties at saturation density favor larger values of the latter and are not sensitive to the former. This signifies the statistical significance of neutron star observations when obtaining realistic chiral effective field theories or models at various densities. The parameter set favored by neutron star observations also aligns the behavior of the sound velocity with the conformal limit at high densities relevant to cores of massive stars. It is hoped that the results of this work can guide future studies on the relationship between the microscopic symmetry of strong interactions and macroscopic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Simulation-based Inference for Gravitational Wave Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11192v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration has ushered in a new era of observational astronomy, emphasizing the need for rapid and detailed parameter estimation and population-level analyses. Traditional Bayesian inference methods, particularly Markov chain Monte Carlo, face significant computational challenges when dealing with the high-dimensional parameter spaces and complex noise characteristics inherent in gravitational wave data. This review examines the emerging role of simulation-based inference methods in gravitational wave astronomy, with a focus on approaches that leverage machine-learning techniques such as normalizing flows and neural posterior estimation. We provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundations underlying various simulation-based inference methods, including neural posterior estimation, neural ratio estimation, neural likelihood estimation, flow matching, and consistency models. We explore the applications of these methods across diverse gravitational wave data processing scenarios, from single-source parameter estimation and overlapping signal analysis to testing general relativity and conducting population studies. Although these techniques demonstrate speed improvements over traditional methods in controlled studies, their model-dependent nature and sensitivity to prior assumptions are barriers to their widespread adoption. Their accuracy, which is similar to that of conventional methods, requires further validation across broader parameter spaces and noise conditions.</description>

      <title>Boosted dark matter versus dark matter-induced neutrinos from single and stacked blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The physics responsible for the production of observed high-energy neutrinos have not been established so far, neither for the diffuse astrophysical ones nor for those detected from single blazars. We recently proposed that both could be explained by deep inelastic scatterings between sub-GeV dark matter (DM) around blazars and protons within their jets. Here, we compute the proton-recoil signals at the neutrino detectors Super-Kamiokande, KamLAND, Borexino, JUNO, Hyper-Kamiokande and DUNE induced by DM that is itself boosted by the scatterings with protons in blazar jets. We do it for the four cases of vector, axial, scalar and pseudoscalar mediators of DM-quark interactions. We perform the analysis for the single blazar TXS 0506+056 and for a sample of more than 300 stacked blazars. We find that searches for such blazar-boosted DM leave room for a variety of DM models to explain observations of high-energy neutrinos. We check that the depletion of the DM spike induced by DM-proton and DM-DM interactions does not compromise the DM interpretation for high-energy neutrinos, but challenges other blazar-DM signals.</description>
