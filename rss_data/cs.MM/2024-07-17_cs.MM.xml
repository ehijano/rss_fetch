      <title>MMSD-Net: Towards Multi-modal Stuttering Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stuttering is a common speech impediment that is caused by irregular disruptions in speech production, affecting over 70 million people across the world. Standard automatic speech processing tools do not take speech ailments into account and are thereby not able to generate meaningful results when presented with stuttered speech as input. The automatic detection of stuttering is an integral step towards building efficient, context-aware speech processing systems. While previous approaches explore both statistical and neural approaches for stuttering detection, all of these methods are uni-modal in nature. This paper presents MMSD-Net, the first multi-modal neural framework for stuttering detection. Experiments and results demonstrate that incorporating the visual signal significantly aids stuttering detection, and our model yields an improvement of 2-17% in the F1-score over existing state-of-the-art uni-modal approaches.</description>

      <title>ReLaX-VQA: Residual Fragment and Layer Stack Extraction for Enhancing Video Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of User-Generated Content (UGC) exchanged between users and sharing platforms, the need for video quality assessment in the wild has emerged. UGC is mostly acquired using consumer devices and undergoes multiple rounds of compression or transcoding before reaching the end user. Therefore, traditional quality metrics that require the original content as a reference cannot be used. In this paper, we propose ReLaX-VQA, a novel No-Reference Video Quality Assessment (NR-VQA) model that aims to address the challenges of evaluating the diversity of video content and the assessment of its quality without reference videos. ReLaX-VQA uses fragments of residual frames and optical flow, along with different expressions of spatial features of the sampled frames, to enhance motion and spatial perception. Furthermore, the model enhances abstraction by employing layer-stacking techniques in deep neural network features (from Residual Networks and Vision Transformers). Extensive testing on four UGC datasets confirms that ReLaX-VQA outperforms existing NR-VQA methods with an average SRCC value of 0.8658 and PLCC value of 0.8872. We will open source the code and trained models to facilitate further research and applications of NR-VQA: https://github.com/xinyiW915/ReLaX-VQA.</description>

      <title>TGIF: Text-Guided Inpainting Forgery Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital image manipulation has become increasingly accessible and realistic with the advent of generative AI technologies. Recent developments allow for text-guided inpainting, making sophisticated image edits possible with minimal effort. This poses new challenges for digital media forensics. For example, diffusion model-based approaches could either splice the inpainted region into the original image, or regenerate the entire image. In the latter case, traditional image forgery localization (IFL) methods typically fail. This paper introduces the Text-Guided Inpainting Forgery (TGIF) dataset, a comprehensive collection of images designed to support the training and evaluation of image forgery localization and synthetic image detection (SID) methods. The TGIF dataset includes approximately 80k forged images, originating from popular open-source and commercial methods; SD2, SDXL, and Adobe Firefly. Using this data, we benchmark several state-of-the-art IFL and SID methods. Whereas traditional IFL methods can detect spliced images, they fail to detect regenerated inpainted images. Moreover, traditional SID may detect the regenerated inpainted images to be fake, but cannot localize the inpainted area. Finally, both types of methods fail when exposed to stronger compression, while they are less robust to modern compression algorithms, such as WEBP. As such, this work demonstrates the inefficiency of state-of-the-art detectors on local manipulations performed by modern generative approaches, and aspires to help with the development of more capable IFL and SID methods.

      <title>Statistics-aware Audio-visual Deepfake Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11650v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an enhanced audio-visual deep detection method. Recent methods in audio-visual deepfake detection mostly assess the synchronization between audio and visual features. Although they have shown promising results, they are based on the maximization/minimization of isolated feature distances without considering feature statistics. Moreover, they rely on cumbersome deep learning architectures and are heavily dependent on empirically fixed hyperparameters. Herein, to overcome these limitations, we propose: (1) a statistical feature loss to enhance the discrimination capability of the model, instead of relying solely on feature distances; (2) using the waveform for describing the audio as a replacement of frequency-based representations; (3) a post-processing normalization of the fakeness score; (4) the use of shallower network for reducing the computational complexity. Experiments on the DFDC and FakeAVCeleb datasets demonstrate the relevance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Infusion Tuning for Large Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05060v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large-scale models have showcased remarkable generalization capabilities in various tasks. However, integrating multimodal processing into these models presents a significant challenge, as it often comes with a high computational burden. To address this challenge, we introduce a new parameter-efficient multimodal tuning strategy for large models in this paper, referred to as Multimodal Infusion Tuning (MiT). MiT leverages decoupled self-attention mechanisms within large language models to effectively integrate information from diverse modalities such as images and acoustics. In MiT, we also design a novel adaptive rescaling strategy at the attention head level, which optimizes the representation of infused multimodal features. Notably, all foundation models are kept frozen during the tuning process to reduce the computational burden and only 2.5\% parameters are tunable. We conduct experiments across a range of multimodal tasks, including image-related tasks like referring segmentation and non-image tasks such as sentiment analysis. Our results showcase that MiT achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal understanding while significantly reducing computational overhead(10\% of previous methods). Moreover, our tuned model exhibits robust reasoning abilities even in complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Robustness of Decision-Level Through Adversarial Attacks on LLM-Based Embodied Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19802v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embodied intelligence empowers agents with a profound sense of perception, enabling them to respond in a manner closely aligned with real-world situations. Large Language Models (LLMs) delve into language instructions with depth, serving a crucial role in generating plans for intricate tasks. Thus, LLM-based embodied models further enhance the agent's capacity to comprehend and process information. However, this amalgamation also ushers in new challenges in the pursuit of heightened intelligence. Specifically, attackers can manipulate LLMs to produce irrelevant or even malicious outputs by altering their prompts. Confronted with this challenge, we observe a notable absence of multi-modal datasets essential for comprehensively evaluating the robustness of LLM-based embodied models. Consequently, we construct the Embodied Intelligent Robot Attack Dataset (EIRAD), tailored specifically for robustness evaluation. Additionally, two attack strategies are devised, including untargeted attacks and targeted attacks, to effectively simulate a range of diverse attack scenarios. At the same time, during the attack process, to more accurately ascertain whether our method is successful in attacking the LLM-based embodied model, we devise a new attack success evaluation method utilizing the BLIP2 model. Recognizing the time and cost-intensive nature of the GCG algorithm in attacks, we devise a scheme for prompt suffix initialization based on various target tasks, thus expediting the convergence process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method exhibits a superior attack success rate when targeting LLM-based embodied models, indicating a lower level of decision-level robustness in these models.</description>

      <title>MotionCtrl: A Unified and Flexible Motion Controller for Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motions in a video primarily consist of camera motion, induced by camera movement, and object motion, resulting from object movement. Accurate control of both camera and object motion is essential for video generation. However, existing works either mainly focus on one type of motion or do not clearly distinguish between the two, limiting their control capabilities and diversity. Therefore, this paper presents MotionCtrl, a unified and flexible motion controller for video generation designed to effectively and independently control camera and object motion. The architecture and training strategy of MotionCtrl are carefully devised, taking into account the inherent properties of camera motion, object motion, and imperfect training data. Compared to previous methods, MotionCtrl offers three main advantages: 1) It effectively and independently controls camera motion and object motion, enabling more fine-grained motion control and facilitating flexible and diverse combinations of both types of motion. 2) Its motion conditions are determined by camera poses and trajectories, which are appearance-free and minimally impact the appearance or shape of objects in generated videos. 3) It is a relatively generalizable model that can adapt to a wide array of camera poses and trajectories once trained. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the superiority of MotionCtrl over existing methods.

      <title>An Avalanche of Images on Telegram Preceded Russia's Full-Scale Invasion of Ukraine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Governments use propaganda, including through visual content -- or Politically Salient Image Patterns (PSIP) -- on social media, to influence and manipulate public opinion. In the present work, we collected Telegram post-history of from 989 Russian milbloggers to better understand the social and political narratives that circulated online in the months surrounding Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Overall, we found an 8,925% increase (p&lt;0.001) in the number of posts and a 5,352% increase (p&lt;0.001) in the number of images posted by these accounts in the two weeks prior to the invasion. We also observed a similar increase in the number and intensity of politically salient manipulated images that circulated on Telegram. Although this paper does not evaluate malice or coordination in these activities, we do conclude with a call for further research into the role that manipulated visual media has in the lead-up to instability events and armed conflict.</description>

      <title>Dance Any Beat: Blending Beats with Visuals in Dance Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated choreography advances by generating dance from music. Current methods create skeleton keypoint sequences, not full dance videos, and cannot make specific individuals dance, limiting their real-world use. These methods also need precise keypoint annotations, making data collection difficult and restricting the use of self-made video datasets. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel task: generating dance videos directly from images of individuals guided by music. This task enables the dance generation of specific individuals without requiring keypoint annotations, making it more versatile and applicable to various situations. Our solution, the Dance Any Beat Diffusion model (DabFusion), utilizes a reference image and a music piece to generate dance videos featuring various dance types and choreographies. The music is analyzed by our specially designed music encoder, which identifies essential features including dance style, movement, and rhythm. DabFusion excels in generating dance videos not only for individuals in the training dataset but also for any previously unseen person. This versatility stems from its approach of generating latent optical flow, which contains all necessary motion information to animate any person in the image. We evaluate DabFusion's performance using the AIST++ dataset, focusing on video quality, audio-video synchronization, and motion-music alignment. We propose a 2D Motion-Music Alignment Score (2D-MM Align), which builds on the Beat Alignment Score to more effectively evaluate motion-music alignment for this new task. Experiments show that our DabFusion establishes a solid baseline for this innovative task. Video results can be found on our project page: https://DabFusion.github.io.</description>

      <title>SHMamba: Structured Hyperbolic State Space Model for Audio-Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09833v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) task holds significant potential for applications. Compared to traditional unimodal approaches, the multi-modal input of AVQA makes feature extraction and fusion processes more challenging. Euclidean space is difficult to effectively represent multi-dimensional relationships of data. Especially when extracting and processing data with a tree structure or hierarchical structure, Euclidean space is not suitable as an embedding space. Additionally, the self-attention mechanism in Transformers is effective in capturing the dynamic relationships between elements in a sequence. However, the self-attention mechanism's limitations in window modeling and quadratic computational complexity reduce its effectiveness in modeling long sequences. To address these limitations, we propose SHMamba: Structured Hyperbolic State Space Model to integrate the advantages of hyperbolic geometry and state space models. Specifically, SHMamba leverages the intrinsic properties of hyperbolic space to represent hierarchical structures and complex relationships in audio-visual data. Meanwhile, the state space model captures dynamic changes over time by globally modeling the entire sequence. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive curvature hyperbolic alignment module and a cross fusion block to enhance the understanding of hierarchical structures and the dynamic exchange of cross-modal information, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SHMamba outperforms previous methods with fewer parameters and computational costs. Our learnable parameters are reduced by 78.12\%, while the average performance improves by 2.53\%. Experiments show that our method demonstrates superiority among all current major methods and is more suitable for practical application scenarios.</description>

      <title>OneDiff: A Generalist Model for Image Difference Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In computer vision, Image Difference Captioning (IDC) is crucial for accurately describing variations between closely related images. Traditional IDC methods often rely on specialist models, which restrict their applicability across varied contexts. This paper introduces the OneDiff model, a novel generalist approach that utilizes a robust vision-language model architecture, integrating a siamese image encoder with a Visual Delta Module. This innovative configuration allows for the precise detection and articulation of fine-grained differences between image pairs. OneDiff is trained through a dual-phase strategy, encompassing Coupled Sample Training and multi-task learning across a diverse array of data types, supported by our newly developed DiffCap Dataset. This dataset merges real-world and synthetic data, enhancing the training process and bolstering the model's robustness. Extensive testing on diverse IDC benchmarks, such as Spot-the-Diff, CLEVR-Change, and Birds-to-Words, shows that OneDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in accuracy and adaptability, achieving improvements of up to 85\% CIDEr points in average. By setting a new benchmark in IDC, OneDiff paves the way for more versatile and effective applications in detecting and describing visual differences. The code, models, and data will be made publicly available.</description>
