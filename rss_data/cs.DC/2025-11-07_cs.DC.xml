      <title>OMPILOT: Harnessing Transformer Models for Auto Parallelization to Shared Memory Computing Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly accelerated progress in code translation, enabling more accurate and efficient transformation across programming languages. While originally developed for natural language processing, LLMs have shown strong capabilities in modeling programming language syntax and semantics, outperforming traditional rule-based systems in both accuracy and flexibility. These models have streamlined cross-language conversion, reduced development overhead, and accelerated legacy code migration. In this paper, we introduce OMPILOT, a novel domain-specific encoder-decoder transformer tailored for translating C++ code into OpenMP, enabling effective shared-memory parallelization. OMPILOT leverages custom pre-training objectives that incorporate the semantics of parallel constructs and combines both unsupervised and supervised learning strategies to improve code translation robustness. Unlike previous work that focused primarily on loop-level transformations, OMPILOT operates at the function level to capture a wider semantic context. To evaluate our approach, we propose OMPBLEU, a novel composite metric specifically crafted to assess the correctness and quality of OpenMP parallel constructs, addressing limitations in conventional translation metrics.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Modeling for Energy-Efficient Edge Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge Computing enables low-latency processing for real-time applications but introduces challenges in power management due to the distributed nature of edge devices and their limited energy resources. This paper proposes a stochastic modeling approach using Markov Chains to analyze power state transitions in Edge Computing. By deriving steady-state probabilities and evaluating energy consumption, we demonstrate the benefits of AI-driven predictive power scaling over conventional reactive methods. Monte Carlo simulations validate the model, showing strong alignment between theoretical and empirical results. Sensitivity analysis highlights how varying transition probabilities affect power efficiency, confirming that predictive scaling minimizes unnecessary transitions and improves overall system responsiveness. Our findings suggest that AI-based power management strategies significantly enhance energy efficiency by anticipating workload demands and optimizing state transitions. Experimental results indicate that AI-based power management optimizes workload distribution across heterogeneous edge nodes, reducing energy consumption disparities between devices, improving overall efficiency, and enhancing adaptive power coordination in multi-node environments.</description>

      <title>Parallel Spawning Strategies for Dynamic-Aware MPI Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic resource management is an increasingly important capability of High Performance Computing systems, as it enables jobs to adjust their resource allocation at runtime. This capability has been shown to reduce workload makespan, substantially decrease job waiting times and improve overall system utilization. In this context, malleability refers to the ability of applications to adapt to new resource allocations during execution. Although beneficial, malleability incurs significant reconfiguration costs, making the reduction of these costs an important research topic.
  Some existing methods for MPI applications respawn the entire application, which is an expensive solution that avoids the reuse of original processes. Other MPI methods reuse them, but fail to fully release unneeded processes when shrinking, since some ranks within the same communicator remain active across nodes, preventing the application from returning those nodes to the system. This work overcomes both limitations by proposing a novel parallel spawning strategy, in which all processes cooperate in spawning before redistribution, thereby reducing execution time. Additionally, it removes shrinkage limitations, allowing better adaptation of parallel systems to workload and reducing their makespan. As a result, it preserves competitive expansion times with at most a $1.25\times$ overhead, while enabling fast shrink operations that reduce their cost by at least $20\times$. This strategy has been validated on both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems and can also be applied in shared-resource environments.</description>

      <title>Enabling Dynamic Sparsity in Quantized LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) on end-user devices is gaining importance due to benefits in responsiveness, privacy, and operational cost. Yet the limited memory and compute capability of mobile and desktop GPUs make efficient execution difficult. Recent observations suggest that the internal activations of LLMs are often dynamically sparse, meaning that for each input, only part of the network contributes significantly to the output. Such sparsity could reduce computation, but it interacts poorly with group-wise quantization, which remains the dominant approach for fitting LLMs onto resource-constrained hardware. To reconcile these two properties, this study proposes a set of techniques that realize dynamic sparse inference under low-bit quantization. The method features: (1) a zigzag-patterned quantization layout that organizes weights in a way consistent with activation sparsity and improves GPU memory locality; (2) a specialized GEMV kernel designed for this layout to fully utilize parallel compute units; and (3) a compact runtime mechanism that gathers sparse indices with minimal overhead. Across several model scales and hardware configurations, the approach achieves up to 1.55x faster decoding throughput while maintaining accuracy comparable to dense quantized inference, showing that structured sparsity and quantization can effectively coexist on commodity GPUs.</description>

      <title>A New Probabilistic Mobile Byzantine Failure Model for Self-Protecting Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern distributed systems face growing security threats, as attackers continuously enhance their skills and vulnerabilities span across the entire system stack, from hardware to the application layer. In the system design phase, fault tolerance techniques can be employed to safeguard systems. From a theoretical perspective, an attacker attempting to compromise a system can be abstracted by considering the presence of Byzantine processes in the system. Although this approach enhances the resilience of the distributed system, it introduces certain limitations regarding the accuracy of the model in reflecting real-world scenarios. In this paper, we consider a self-protecting distributed system based on the \emph{Monitoring-Analyse-Plan-Execute over a shared Knowledge} (MAPE-K) architecture, and we propose a new probabilistic Mobile Byzantine Failure (MBF) that can be plugged into the Analysis component. Our new model captures the dynamics of evolving attacks and can be used to drive the self-protection and reconfiguration strategy. We analyze mathematically the time that it takes until the number of Byzantine nodes crosses given thresholds, or for the system to self-recover back into a safe state, depending on the rates of Byzantine infection spreading \emph{vs.} the rate of self-recovery. We also provide simulation results that illustrate the behavior of the system under such assumptions.</description>

      <title>Resolving Conflicts with Grace: Dynamically Concurrent Universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization is the major obstacle to scalability in distributed computing. Concurrent operations on the shared data engage in synchronization when they encounter a \emph{conflict}, i.e., their effects depend on the order in which they are applied. Ideally, one would like to detect conflicts in a \emph{dynamic} manner, i.e., adjusting to the current system state. Indeed, it is very common that two concurrent operations conflict only in some rarely occurring states. In this paper, we define the notion of \emph{dynamic concurrency}: an operation employs strong synchronization primitives only if it \emph{has} to arbitrate with concurrent operations, given the current system state. We then present a dynamically concurrent universal construction.</description>

      <title>Universal Quantum Simulation of 50 Qubits on Europe`s First Exascale Supercomputer Harnessing Its Heterogeneous CPU-GPU Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a new version of the high-performance J\"ulich universal quantum computer simulator (JUQCS-50) that leverages key features of the GH200 superchips as used in the JUPITER supercomputer, enabling simulations of a 50-qubit universal quantum computer for the first time. JUQCS-50 achieves this through three key innovations: (1) extending usable memory beyond GPU limits via high-bandwidth CPU-GPU interconnects and LPDDR5 memory; (2) adaptive data encoding to reduce memory footprint with acceptable trade-offs in precision and compute effort; and (3) an on-the-fly network traffic optimizer. These advances result in an 11.4-fold speedup over the previous 48-qubit record on the K computer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a reinforced genetic approach to a defined d-resource system optimization problem. The classical evolution schema was ineffective due to a very strict feasibility function in the studied problem. Hence, the presented strategy has introduced several modifications and adaptations to standard genetic routines, e.g.: a migration operator which is an analogy to the biological random genetic drift.</description>

      <title>Scalable Domain-decomposed Monte Carlo Neutral Transport for Nuclear Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: EIRENE [1] is a Monte Carlo neutral transport solver heavily used in the fusion community. EIRENE does not implement domain decomposition, making it impossible to use for simulations where the grid data does not fit on one compute node (see e.g. [2]). This paper presents a domain-decomposed Monte Carlo (DDMC) algorithm implemented in a new open source Monte Carlo code, Eiron. Two parallel algorithms currently used in EIRENE are also implemented in Eiron, and the three algorithms are compared by running strong scaling tests, with DDMC performing better than the other two algorithms in nearly all cases. On the supercomputer Mahti [3], DDMC strong scaling is superlinear for grids that do not fit into an L3 cache slice (4 MiB). The DDMC algorithm is also scaled up to 16384 cores in weak scaling tests, with a weak scaling efficiency of 45% in a high-collisional (heavier compute load) case, and 26% in a low-collisional (lighter compute load) case. We conclude that implementing this domain decomposition algorithm in EIRENE would improve performance and enable simulations that are currently impossible due to memory constraints.</description>

      <title>ThunderServe: High-performance and Cost-efficient LLM Serving in Cloud Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their remarkable proficiency in a range of tasks. Compared to in-house homogeneous GPU clusters, deploying LLMs in cloud environments with diverse types of GPUs is crucial for addressing the GPU shortage problem and being more cost-effective. However, the diversity of network environments and various GPU types on the cloud bring difficulties to achieving high-performance serving. In this work, we propose ThunderServe, a high-performance and cost-efficient LLM serving system for heterogeneous cloud environments. We introduce a novel scheduling algorithm, which optimizes the deployment plan of LLM serving to accommodate the heterogeneous resource and network bandwidth conditions in cloud environments. Furthermore, we propose a lightweight re-scheduling mechanism, designed to adapt to fluctuating online conditions (e.g., node failures, workload shifts) without the need for costly restarts of ongoing services. Empirical results in both heterogeneous cloud and homogeneous in-house environments reveal that ThunderServe delivers up to a 2.1$\times$ and on average a $1.7\times$ increase in throughput and achieves up to a 2.5$\times$ and on average a $1.5\times$ reduction in latency deadlines compared with state-of-the-art systems given the same price budget, suggesting opting for cloud services provides a more cost-efficient solution.</description>

      <title>Arrow: Adaptive Scheduling Mechanisms for Disaggregated LLM Inference Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing large language model (LLM) serving systems typically employ Prefill-Decode disaggregated architecture to prevent computational interference between the prefill and decode phases. However, in real-world LLM serving scenarios, significant fluctuations in request input/output lengths lead to imbalanced computational loads between prefill and decode nodes under traditional static node allocation strategies, consequently preventing efficient utilization of computing resources to improve the system's goodput. To address this challenge, we design and implement Arrow, an adaptive scheduler that leverages stateless instances and latency characteristics of prefill and decode tasks to achieve efficient adaptive request and instance scheduling. Arrow dynamically adjusts the number of instances handling prefill and decode tasks based on real-time cluster performance metrics, substantially enhancing the system's capability to handle traffic spikes and load variations. Our evaluation under diverse real-world workloads shows that Arrow achieves up to $2.55 \times$ higher request serving rates compared to state-of-the-art Prefill-Decode disaggregated serving systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A pronounced imbalance in GPU resources exists on campus, where some laboratories own underutilized servers while others lack the compute needed for AI research. GPU sharing can alleviate this disparity, while existing platforms typically rely on centralized oversight and persistent allocation models, conflicting with the voluntary and autonomous nature of academic resource ownership. We present GPUnion, a campus-scale GPU sharing platform enabling voluntary participation while preserving full provider autonomy. GPUnion incorporates three core mechanisms: i) container-based task dispatching and execution, ii) resource provider-first architecture, and iii) resilient execution featuring automatic check-pointing and migration. Case studies across multiple campus scenarios demonstrate 30% more GPU utilization improvement, 40% increase in interactive sessions, and 94% successful workload migration during provider departures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15105v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern distributed data processing systems struggle to balance performance, maintainability, and developer productivity when integrating machine learning at scale. These challenges intensify in large collaborative environments due to high communication overhead and coordination complexity. We present a "Declarative Data Pipeline" (DDP) architecture that addresses these challenges while processing billions of records efficiently. Our modular framework seamlessly integrates machine learning within Apache Spark using logical computation units called Pipes, departing from traditional microservice approaches. By establishing clear component boundaries and standardized interfaces, we achieve modularity and optimization without sacrificing maintainability. Enterprise case studies demonstrate substantial improvements: 50% better development efficiency, collaboration efforts compressed from weeks to days, 500x scalability improvement, and 10x throughput gains.</description>

      <title>SP-MoE: Speculative Decoding and Prefetching for Accelerating MoE-based Model Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has been widely adopted in large language models (LLMs) to reduce computation cost through model sparsity. Employing speculative decoding (SD) can further accelerate MoE inference by drafting multiple tokens per step and verifying them in parallel. However, combining MoE with SD inflates GPU memory and aggravates CPU-GPU bandwidth contention during multi-token verification. Existing MoE offloading systems are SD-agnostic and do not address this bottleneck. We present SP-MoE, the first SD-aware expert-offloading and compute-communication pipelining framework. SP-MoE introduces: (1) speculative expert prefetching that exploits structural correspondence between the draft and target models to prefetch likely experts ahead of verification; (2) a cutoff-layer policy that bounds per-layer prefetch depth based on empirical profiles and an analytical latency model, guaranteeing just-in-time availability without overfetch; and (3) a pipelined runtime with asynchronous prefetch threads and batched I/O to hide loading latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SP-MoE achieves a 1.07-3.5 times TPOT speedup over state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets, environments, and MoE-based models.</description>

      <title>Characterising Global Platforms: Centralised, Decentralised, Federated, and Grassroots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global digital platforms are software systems designed to serve entire populations, with some already serving billions of people. We propose atomic transactions-based multiagent transition systems and protocols as a formal framework to study them; introduce essential agents -- minimal sets of agents the removal of which makes communication impossible; and show that the cardinality of essential agents partitions all global platforms into four classes:
  1. Centralised -- one (the server)
  2. Decentralised -- finite $&gt;1$ (bootstrap nodes)
  3. Federated -- infinite but not universal (all servers)
  4. Grassroots -- universal (all agents)
  Our illustrative formal example is a global social network, for which we provide centralised, decentralised, federated, and grassroots specifications via multiagent atomic transactions, and prove they all satisfy the same basic correctness properties. We discuss informally additional global platforms -- currencies, ``sharing economy'' apps, AI, and more. While this may be the first characterisation of centralised, decentralised, and federated global platforms, grassroots platforms have been formally defined previously, but using different notions. Here, we prove that their original definition implies that all agents are essential, placing grassroots platforms in a distinct class within the broader formal context that includes all global platforms. This work provides the first mathematical framework for classifying any global platform -- existing or imagined -- by providing a multiagent atomic-transactions specification of it and determining the cardinality of the minimal set of essential agents in the ensuing multiagent protocol. It thus provides a unifying mathematical approach for the study of global digital platforms, perhaps the most important class of computer systems today.</description>

      <title>FedQUIT: On-Device Federated Unlearning via a Quasi-Competent Virtual Teacher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07587v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) systems enable the collaborative training of machine learning models without requiring centralized collection of individual data. FL participants should have the ability to exercise their right to be forgotten, ensuring their past contributions can be removed from the learned model upon request. In this paper, we propose FedQUIT, a novel algorithm that uses knowledge distillation to scrub the contribution of the data to forget from an FL global model while preserving its generalization ability. FedQUIT directly works on client devices that request to leave the federation, and leverages a teacher-student framework. The FL global model acts as the teacher, and the local model works as the student. To induce forgetting, FedQUIT tailors the teacher's output on local data (the data to forget) penalizing the prediction score of the true class. Unlike previous work, our method does not require hardly viable assumptions for cross-device settings, such as storing historical updates of participants or requiring access to proxy datasets. Experimental results on various datasets and model architectures demonstrate that (i) FedQUIT outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in forgetting data, (ii) has the exact computational requirements as a regular FedAvg round, and (iii) reduces the cumulative communication costs by up to 117.6$\times$ compared to retraining from scratch to restore the initial generalization performance after unlearning.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Federated Fine-Tuning: A Single Communication Round is Enough for Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent advancement of foundation models (FMs) has increased the demand for fine-tuning these models on large-scale cross-domain datasets. To address this, federated fine-tuning has emerged, allowing FMs to be fine-tuned on distributed datasets across multiple devices while ensuring data privacy. However, the substantial parameter size and the multi-round communication in federated learning algorithms result in prohibitively high communication costs, challenging the practicality of federated fine-tuning. In this paper, we identify and analyze, both theoretically and empirically, that the traditional multi-round aggregation algorithms may not be necessary for federated fine-tuning large FMs. Our experiments reveal that a single round of aggregation (i.e., one-shot federated fine-tuning) yields a global model performance comparable to that achieved through multiple rounds of aggregation. Through rigorous mathematical and empirical analyses, we demonstrate that large FMs, due to their extensive parameter sizes and pre-training on general tasks, achieve significantly lower training loss in one-shot federated fine-tuning compared to smaller models. Our extensive experiments show that one-shot federated fine-tuning significantly reduces communication costs. It also has the potential to enable asynchronous aggregation, enhances privacy, and maintains performance consistency with multi-round federated fine-tuning on both text generation and text-to-image generation tasks. Our findings provide insights to revolutionize federated fine-tuning in practice, enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, and expanding accessibility for FMs.</description>

      <title>Rollbaccine : Herd Immunity against Storage Rollback Attacks in TEEs [Technical Report]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Today, users can "lift-and-shift" unmodified applications into modern, VM-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) in order to gain hardware-based security guarantees. However, TEEs do not protect applications against disk rollback attacks, where persistent storage can be reverted to an earlier state after a crash; existing rollback resistance solutions either only support a subset of applications or require code modification. Our key insight is that restoring disk consistency after a rollback attack guarantees rollback resistance for any application. We present Rollbaccine, a device mapper that provides automatic rollback resistance for all applications by provably preserving disk consistency. Rollbaccine intercepts and replicates writes to disk, restores lost state from backups during recovery, and minimizes overheads by taking advantage of the weak, multi-threaded semantics of disk operations. Rollbaccine performs on-par with state-of-the-art, non-automatic rollback resistant solutions; in fact, across benchmarks over PostgreSQL, HDFS, and two file systems (ext4 and xfs), Rollbaccine adds only 19% overhead, except for the fsync-heavy Filebench Varmail.</description>

      <title>Scalable hybrid quantum Monte Carlo simulation of U(1) gauge field coupled to fermions on GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16298v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a GPU-accelerated hybrid quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to solve the fundamental yet difficult problem of $U(1)$ gauge field coupled to fermions, which gives rise to a $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state under the description of (2+1)d quantum electrodynamics QED$_3$. The algorithm renders a good acceptance rate and, more importantly, nearly linear space-time volume scaling in computational complexity $O(N_{\tau} V_s)$, where $N_\tau$ is the imaginary time dimension and $V_s$ is spatial volume, which is much more efficient than determinant QMC with scaling behavior of $O(N_\tau V_s^3)$. Such acceleration is achieved via a collection of technical improvements, including (i) the design of the efficient problem-specific preconditioner, (ii) customized CUDA kernel for matrix-vector multiplication, and (iii) CUDA Graph implementation on the GPU. These advances allow us to simulate the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state with unprecedentedly large system sizes, which is up to $N_\tau\times L\times L = 660\times66\times66$, and reveal its novel properties. With these technical improvements, we see the asymptotic convergence in the scaling dimensions of various fermion bilinear operators and the conserved current operator when approaching the thermodynamic limit. The scaling dimensions find good agreement with field-theoretical expectation, which provides supporting evidence for the conformal nature of the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state in the \qed. Our technical advancements open an avenue to study the Dirac spin liquid state and its transition towards symmetry-breaking phases at larger system sizes and with less computational burden.</description>

      <title>Action Deviation-Aware Inference for Low-Latency Wireless Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To support latency-sensitive AI applications ranging from autonomous driving to industrial robot manipulation, 6G envisions distributed ML with computational resources in mobile, edge, and cloud connected over hyper-reliable low-latency communication (HRLLC). In this setting, speculative decoding can facilitate collaborative inference of models distributively deployed: a lightweight on-device model locally generates drafts while a more capable remote target model on a server verifies and corrects them in parallel with speculative sampling, thus resulting in lower latency without compromising accuracy. However, unlike autoregressive text generation, behavior cloning policies, typically used for embodied AI applications, cannot parallelize verification and correction for multiple drafts as each generated action depends on observation updated by a previous action. To this end, we propose Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference (ADAHI), wherein drafts are selectively transmitted and verified based on action deviation, which has a strong correlation with action's rejection probability by the target model. By invoking server operation only when necessary, communication and computational overhead can be reduced while accuracy gain from speculative sampling is preserved. Experiments on our testbed show that ADAHI reduces transmission and server operations by approximately 40%, lowers end-to-end latency by 39.2%, and attains up to 97.2% of the task-success rate of baseline that invokes speculative sampling for every draft embedding vector.</description>

      <title>Non-Convex Over-the-Air Heterogeneous Federated Learning: A Bias-Variance Trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26722v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming \emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous} wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured, time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL baselines.</description>

      <title>SnapStream: Efficient Long Sequence Decoding on Dataflow Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of 100B+ parameter Large Language Models (LLMs) with 100k+ context length support have resulted in increasing demands for on-chip memory to support large KV caches. Techniques such as StreamingLLM and SnapKV demonstrate how to control KV cache size while maintaining model accuracy. Yet, these techniques are not commonly used within industrial deployments using frameworks like vLLM or SGLang. The reason is twofold: on one hand, the static graphs and continuous batching methodology employed by these frameworks make it difficult to admit modifications to the standard multi-head attention algorithm, while on the other hand, the accuracy implications of such techniques on modern instruction-following and reasoning models are not well understood, obfuscating the need for implementing these techniques. In this paper, we explore these accuracy implications on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1, and develop SnapStream, a KV cache compression method that can be deployed at scale. We demonstrate the efficacy of SnapStream in a 16-way tensor-parallel deployment of DeepSeek-671B on SambaNova SN40L accelerators running at 128k context length and up to 1832 tokens per second in a real production setting. SnapStream enables $4\times$ improved on-chip memory usage and introduces minimal accuracy degradation on LongBench-v2, AIME24 and LiveCodeBench. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of sparse KV attention techniques deployed in a production inference system with static graphs and continuous batching.</description>
