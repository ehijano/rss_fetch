      <title>Generative AI on SpectrumNet: An Open Benchmark of Multiband 3D Radio Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio map is an efficient demonstration for visually displaying the wireless signal coverage within a certain region. It has been considered to be increasingly helpful for the future sixth generation (6G) of wireless networks, as wireless nodes are becoming more crowded and complicated. However, the construction of high resolution radio map is very challenging due to the sparse sampling in practical systems. Generative artificial intelligence (AI), which is capable to create synthetic data to fill in gaps in real-world measurements, is an effective technique to construct high precision radio maps. Currently, generative models for radio map construction are trained with two-dimension (2D) single band radio maps in urban scenario, which has poor generalization in diverse terrain scenarios, spectrum bands, and heights. To tackle this problem, we provide a multiband three-dimension (3D) radio map dataset with consideration of terrain and climate information, named SpectrumNet. It is the largest radio map dataset in terms of dimensions and scale, which contains the radio map of 3 spacial dimensions, 5 frequency bands, 11 terrain scenarios, and 3 climate scenarios. We introduce the parameters and settings for the SpectrumNet dataset generation, and evaluate three baseline methods for radio map construction based on the SpectrumNet dataset. Experiments show the necessity of the SpectrumNet dataset for training models with strong generalization in spacial, frequency, and scenario domains. Future works on the SpectrumNet dataset are also discussed, including the dataset expansion and calibration, as well as the extended studies on generative models for radio map construction based on the SpectrumNet dataset.</description>

      <title>A generative foundation model for five-class sleep staging with arbitrary sensor input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gold-standard sleep scoring as performed by human technicians is based on a subset of PSG signals, namely the EEG, EOG, and EMG. The PSG, however, consists of many more signal derivations that could potentially be used to perform sleep staging, including cardiac and respiratory modalities. Leveraging this variety in signals would offer advantages, for example by increasing reliability, resilience to signal loss, and application to long-term non-obtrusive recordings. This paper proposes a deep generative foundation model for fully automatic sleep staging from a plurality of sensors and any combination thereof. We trained a score-based diffusion model with a transformer backbone using a dataset of 1947 expert-labeled overnight sleep recordings with 36 different signals, including neurological, cardiac, and respiratory signals. We achieve zero-shot inference on any sensor set by using a novel Bayesian factorization of the score function across the sensors, i.e., it does not require retraining on specific combinations of signals. On single-channel EEG, our method reaches the performance limit in terms of PSG inter-rater agreement (5-class accuracy 85.6%, kappa 0.791). At the same time, the method offers full flexibility to use any sensor set derived from other modalities, for example, as typically used in home recordings that include finger PPG, nasal cannula and thoracic belt (5-class accuracy 79.0%, kappa of 0.697), or by combining derivations not typically used for sleep staging such as the tibialis and sternocleidomastoid EMG (5-class accuracy 71.0%, kappa of 0.575). Additionally, we propose a novel interpretability metric in terms of information gain per sensor and show that this is linearly correlated with classification performance. Lastly, our foundation model allows for post-hoc addition of entirely new sensor modalities by merely training a score estimator on the novel input.</description>

      <title>Emotion Classification from Multi-Channel EEG Signals Using HiSTN: A Hierarchical Graph-based Spatial-Temporal Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a parameter-efficient Hierarchical Spatial Temporal Network (HiSTN) specifically designed for the task of emotion classification using multi-channel electroencephalogram data. The network incorporates a graph hierarchy constructed from bottom-up at various abstraction levels, offering the dual advantages of enhanced task-relevant deep feature extraction and a lightweight design. The model's effectiveness is further amplified when used in conjunction with a proposed unique label smoothing method. Comprehensive benchmark experiments reveal that this combined approach yields high, balanced performance in terms of both quantitative and qualitative predictions. HiSTN, which has approximately 1,000 parameters, achieves mean F1 scores of 96.82% (valence) and 95.62% (arousal) in subject-dependent tests on the rarely-utilized 5-classification task problem from the DREAMER dataset. In the subject-independent settings, the same model yields mean F1 scores of 78.34% for valence and 81.59% for arousal. The adoption of the Sequential Top-2 Hit Rate (Seq2HR) metric highlights the significant enhancements in terms of the balance between model's quantitative and qualitative for predictions achieved through our approach when compared to training with regular one-hot labels. These improvements surpass 50% in subject-dependent tasks and 30% in subject-independent tasks. The study also includes relevant ablation studies and case explorations to further elucidate the workings of the proposed model and enhance its interpretability.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection in Time Series of EDFA Pump Currents to Monitor Degeneration Processes using Fuzzy Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a novel fuzzy clustering based anomaly detection method for pump current time series of EDFA systems. The proposed change detection framework (CDF) strategically combines the advantages of entropy analysis (EA) and principle component analysis (PCA) with fuzzy clustering procedures. In the framework, EA is applied for dynamic selection of features for reduction of the feature space and increase of computational performance. Furthermore, PCA is utilized to extract features from the raw feature space to enable generalization capability of the subsequent fuzzy clustering procedures. Three different fuzzy clustering methods, more precisely the fuzzy clustering algorithm, a probabilistic clustering algorithm and a possibilistic clustering algorithm are evaluated for performance and generalization. Hence, the proposed framework has the innovative feature to detect changes in pump current time series at an early stage for arbitrary points of operation, compared to state-of-the-art predefined alarms in commercially used EDFAs. Moreover, the approach is implemented and tested using experimental data. In addition, the proposed framework enables further approaches of applying decentralized predictive maintenance for optical fiber networks.</description>

      <title>Estimating ECG Intervals from Lead-I Alone: External Validation of Supervised Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of a number of cardiovascular disorders rely on ECG interval measurements, including the PR, QRS, and QT intervals. These quantities are measured from the 12-lead ECG, either manually or using automated algorithms, which are readily available in clinical settings. A number of wearable devices, however, can acquire the lead-I ECG in an outpatient setting, thereby raising the potential for out-of-hospital monitoring for disorders that involve clinically significant changes in ECG intervals. In this work, we therefore developed a series of deep learning models for estimating the PR, QRS, and QT intervals using lead-I ECG. From a corpus of 4.2 million ECGs from patients at the Massachusetts General Hospital, we train and validate each of the models. At internal holdout validation, we achieve mean absolute errors (MAE) of 6.3 ms for QRS durations and 11.9 ms for QT intervals, and an MAE of 9.2 ms for estimating PR intervals. Moreover, as a well-defined P-wave does not always exist in ECG tracings - for example, when there is atrial fibrillation - we trained a model that can identify when there is a P-wave, and consequently, a measurable PR interval. We validate our models on three large external healthcare datasets without any finetuning or retraining - 3.2 million ECG from the Brigham and Womens Hospital, 668 thousand from MIMIC-IV, and 20 thousand from PTB-XL - and achieve similar performance. Also, our models significantly outperform two publicly available baseline algorithms. This work demonstrates that ECG intervals can be tracked from only lead-I ECG using deep learning, and highlights the potential for out-of-hospital applications.</description>

      <title>Concentric UCAs Based Low-Order OAM for High Capacity in Radio Vortex Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the potential capacity-boosting for wireless communications, the Radio vOrtex Wireless COMMunication (RowComm) over orthogonal states/modes of Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) has been paid much attention in recent years. Uniform circular array (UCA), as an efficient and convenient antenna structure, can transmit/receive multiple OAM beams with different OAM-modes simultaneously when the transmitter and receiver are aligned. However, for high-order OAM-modes, the OAM beams are divergent accompanied by severe attenuations. Thus, it is difficult to directly use high-order OAM-modes to achieve high capacity for RowComms. To obtain high capacity potentially offered by OAM-modes, in this paper we transform the singular UCA into the concentric UCAs, where high capacity can be achieved using multiple parallel low-order OAM-modes instead of all high-order OAM-modes, to increase the capacity of transmitter-receiver aligned RowComms. In particular, we study two cases: 1). Concentric UCAs based RowComms without co-mode interference; 2). Concentric UCAs based RowComms with co-mode interference. We propose a co-mode-interference-free and a co-mode-interference-contained mode-decomposition schemes to recover transmit signals for these two cases, respectively. Also, we develop the optimal power allocation schemes to maximize the capacity for these two cases. Numerical simulations are presented to validate and evaluate that our developed concentric UCAs based low-order RowComms can significantly increase the capacity as compared with that of singular UCA based RowComms.</description>

      <title>Seamless 5G Automotive Connectivity with Integrated Satellite Terrestrial Networks in C-Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines integrated satellite-terrestrial networks (ISTNs) in urban environments, where terrestrial networks (TNs) and non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) share the same frequency band in the C-band which is considered the promising band for both systems. The dynamic issues in ISTNs, arising from the movement of low Earth orbit satellites (LEOSats) and the mobility of users (UEs), are addressed. The goal is to maximize the sum rate by optimizing link selection for UEs over time. To tackle this challenge, an efficient iterative algorithm is developed. Simulations using a realistic 3D map provide valuable insights into the impact of urban environments on ISTNs and also demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Globally Optimal Movable Antenna-Enhanced multi-user Communication: Discrete Antenna Positioning, Motion Power Consumption, and Imperfect CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) represent a promising paradigm to enhance the spatial degrees of freedom of conventional multi-antenna systems by dynamically adapting the positions of antenna elements within a designated transmit area. In particular, by employing electro-mechanical MA drivers, the positions of the MA elements can be adjusted to shape a favorable spatial correlation for improving system performance. Although preliminary research has explored beamforming designs for MA systems, the intricacies of the power consumption and the precise positioning of MA elements are not well understood. Moreover, the assumption of perfect CSI adopted in the literature is impractical due to the significant pilot overhead and the extensive time to acquire perfect CSI. To address these challenges, we model the motion of MA elements through discrete steps and quantify the associated power consumption as a function of these movements. Furthermore, by leveraging the properties of the MA channel model, we introduce a novel CSI error model tailored for MA systems that facilitates robust resource allocation design. In particular, we optimize the beamforming and the MA positions at the BS to minimize the total BS power consumption, encompassing both radiated and MA motion power while guaranteeing a minimum required SINR for each user. To this end, novel algorithms exploiting the branch and bound (BnB) method are developed to obtain the optimal solution for perfect and imperfect CSI. Moreover, to support practical implementation, we propose low-complexity algorithms with guaranteed convergence by leveraging successive convex approximation (SCA). Our numerical results validate the optimality of the proposed BnB-based algorithms. Furthermore, we unveil that both proposed SCA-based algorithms approach the optimal performance within a few iterations, thus highlighting their practical advantages.</description>

      <title>Joint Offloading and Beamforming Design in Integrating Sensing, Communication, and Computing Systems: A Distributed Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When applying integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in future mobile networks, many sensing tasks have low latency requirements, preferably being implemented at terminals. However, terminals often have limited computing capabilities and energy supply. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of leveraging the advanced computing capabilities of mobile edge computing (MEC) servers and the cloud server to address the sensing tasks of ISAC terminals. Specifically, we propose a novel three-tier integrated sensing, communication, and computing (ISCC) framework composed of one cloud server, multiple MEC servers, and multiple terminals, where the terminals can optionally offload sensing data to the MEC server or the cloud server. The offload message is sent via the ISAC waveform, whose echo is used for sensing. We jointly optimize the computation offloading and beamforming strategies to minimize the average execution latency while satisfying sensing requirements. In particular, we propose a low-complexity distributed algorithm to solve the problem. Firstly, we use the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and derive the closed-form solution for offloading decision variables. Subsequently, we convert the beamforming optimization sub-problem into a weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE) problem and propose a fractional programming based algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed ISCC framework and distributed algorithm significantly reduce the execution latency and the energy consumption of sensing tasks at a lower computational complexity compared to existing schemes.</description>

      <title>Software-defined Programmable Metamaterial Lens System for Dynamic Wireless Power Transfer Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A software-defined 2-bit Programmable Transmit Metamaterial (PTM) array surface with beam steering capabilities is proposed for indoor dynamic Wireless Power Transfer (DWPT) applications. The novel metamaterial unit cell structure is designed based on transmission phase, amplitude, and electric field response to model DWPT using PTM. Theoretical analysis of the electric field (e-field), coupling effect, and current distribution at the metamaterial interface enhances the intelligence and reconfigurability of the PTM lens. The modeled 2-bit 6x6 array PTM is designed to operate at a frequency of 4 GHz. The reconfigurable architecture comprises a fixed system with a single-layer PTM lens capable of 60{\deg} beam scanning. The PTM lens, along with a distribution board, is fabricated and experimentally tested. The results between simulation and measurements are in good agreement. The system enables dynamic optimisation of the beam pattern to track the positions of mobile users with minimal software-hardware complexity. This novel work presents a low-cost experiment achieving an average 90.7% beamforming accuracy throughout the analytical and measurement processes of DWPT for movable users, utilizing a programmable transmit metamaterial array.</description>

      <title>Symbiotic Sensing and Communication: Framework and Beamforming Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel symbiotic sensing and communication (SSAC) framework, comprising a base station (BS) and a passive sensing node. In particular, the BS transmits communication waveform to serve vehicle users (VUEs), while the sensing node is employed to execute sensing tasks based on the echoes in a bistatic manner, thereby avoiding the issue of self-interference. Besides the weak target of interest, the sensing node tracks VUEs and shares sensing results with BS to facilitate sensing-assisted beamforming. By considering both fully digital arrays and hybrid analog-digital (HAD) arrays, we investigate the beamforming design in the SSAC system. We first derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the two-dimensional angles of arrival estimation as the sensing metric. Next, we formulate an achievable sum rate maximization problem under the CRLB constraint, where the channel state information is reconstructed based on the sensing results. Then, we propose two penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based alternating algorithms for fully digital and HAD arrays, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can achieve an outstanding data rate with effective localization capability for both VUEs and the weak target. In particular, the HAD beamforming design exhibits remarkable performance gain compared to conventional schemes, especially with fewer radio frequency chains.</description>

      <title>3D Photon Counting CT Image Super-Resolution Using Conditional Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to improve photon counting CT (PCCT) image resolution using denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM). Although DDPMs have shown superior performance when applied to various computer vision tasks, their effectiveness has yet to be translated to high dimensional CT super-resolution. To train DDPMs in a conditional sampling manner, we first leverage CatSim to simulate realistic lower resolution PCCT images from high-resolution CT scans. Since maximizing DDPM performance is time-consuming for both inference and training, especially on high-dimensional PCCT data, we explore both 2D and 3D networks for conditional DDPM and apply methods to accelerate training. In particular, we decompose the 3D task into efficient 2D DDPMs and design a joint 2D inference in the reverse diffusion process that synergizes 2D results of all three dimensions to make the final 3D prediction. Experimental results show that our DDPM achieves improved results versus baseline reference models in recovering high-frequency structures, suggesting that a framework based on realistic simulation and DDPM shows promise for improving PCCT resolution.</description>

      <title>ES-PTAM: Event-based Stereo Parallel Tracking and Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual Odometry (VO) and SLAM are fundamental components for spatial perception in mobile robots. Despite enormous progress in the field, current VO/SLAM systems are limited by their sensors' capability. Event cameras are novel visual sensors that offer advantages to overcome the limitations of standard cameras, enabling robots to expand their operating range to challenging scenarios, such as high-speed motion and high dynamic range illumination. We propose a novel event-based stereo VO system by combining two ideas: a correspondence-free mapping module that estimates depth by maximizing ray density fusion and a tracking module that estimates camera poses by maximizing edge-map alignment. We evaluate the system comprehensively on five real-world datasets, spanning a variety of camera types (manufacturers and spatial resolutions) and scenarios (driving, flying drone, hand-held, egocentric, etc). The quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state of the art in majority of the test sequences by a margin, e.g., trajectory error reduction of 45% on RPG dataset, 61% on DSEC dataset, and 21% on TUM-VIE dataset. To benefit the community and foster research on event-based perception systems, we release the source code and results: https://github.com/tub-rip/ES-PTAM</description>

      <title>Hybrid OTFS/OFDM Design in Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a downlink (DL) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, where different users have different mobility profiles. To support this system, we categorize the users into two disjoint groups according to their mobility profile and implement a hybrid orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS)/orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation scheme. Building upon this framework, two precoding designs, namely full-pilot zero-forcing (FZF) precoding and partial zero-forcing (PZF) precoding are considered. To shed light on the system performance, the spectral efficiency (SE) with a minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE)-successive interference cancellation (SIC) detector is investigated. Closed-form expressions for the SE are obtained using some tight mathematical approximations. To improve fairness among different users, we consider max-min power control for both precoding schemes based on the closed-form SE expression. However, by noting the large performance gap for different groups of users with PZF precoding, the per-user SE will be compromised when pursuing overall fairness. Therefore, we propose a weighted max-min power control scheme. By introducing a weighting coefficient, the trade-off between the per-user performance and fairness can be enhanced. Our numerical results confirm the theoretical analysis and reveal that with mobility-based grouping, the proposed hybrid OTFS/OFDM modulation significantly outperforms the conventional OFDM modulation for high-mobility users.</description>

      <title>Movable Antennas Meet Intelligent Reflecting Surface: When Do We Need Movable Antennas?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and movable antenna (MA)/fluid antenna (FA) techniques have both received increasing attention in the realm of wireless communications due to their ability to reconfigure and improve wireless channel conditions. In this paper, we investigate the integration of MAs/FAs into an IRS-assisted wireless communication system. In particular, we consider the downlink transmission from a multi-MA base station (BS) to a single-antenna user with the aid of an IRS, aiming to maximize the user's received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), by jointly optimizing the BS/IRS active/passive beamforming and the MAs' positions. Due to the similar capability of MAs and IRS for channel reconfiguration, we first conduct theoretical analysis of the performance gain of MAs over conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs) under the line-of-sight (LoS) BS-IRS channel and derive the conditions under which the performance gain becomes more or less significant. Next, to solve the received SNR maximization problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm that decomposes it into two subproblems and solve them alternately. Numerical results are provided to validate our analytical results and evaluate the performance gains of MAs over FPAs under different setups.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Based Speckle Filtering for Polarimetric SAR Images. Application to Sentinel-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speckle suppression in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is a key processing step which continues to be a research topic. A wide variety of methods, using either spatially-based approaches or transform-based strategies, have been developed and have shown to provide outstanding results. However, recent advances in deep learning techniques and their application to SAR image despeckling have been demonstrated to offer state-of-the-art results. Unfortunately, they have been mostly applied to single-polarimetric images. The extension of a deep learning-based approach for speckle removal to polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) images is complicated because of the complex nature of the measured covariance matrices for every image pixel, the properties of which must be preserved during filtering. In this work, we propose a complete framework to remove speckle in polarimetric SAR images using a convolutional neural network. The methodology includes a reversible transformation of the original complex covariance matrix to obtain a set of real-valued intensity bands which are fed to the neural network. In addition, the proposed method includes a change detection strategy to avoid the neural network to learn erroneous features in areas strongly affected by temporal changes, so that the network only learns the underlying speckle component present in the data. The method is implemented and tested with dual-polarimetric images acquired by Sentinel-1. Experiments show that the proposed approach offers exceptional results in both speckle reduction and resolution preservation. More importantly, it is also shown that the neural network is not generating artifacts or introducing bias in the filtered images, making them suitable for further polarimetric processing and exploitation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) inspired by the forward-backward algorithm (FBA) are used as equalizers for bandlimited channels with a memoryless nonlinearity. The NN-equalizers are combined with successive interference cancellation (SIC) to approach the information rates of joint detection and decoding (JDD) with considerably less complexity than JDD and other existing equalizers. Simulations for short-haul optical fiber links with square-law detection illustrate the gains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01672v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sixth generation (6G) of wireless technology is seen as one of the enablers of real-time fusion of the physical and digital realms, as in Digital Twin, eXtended reality, or the Metaverse. This would allow people to interact, work, and entertain themselves in an immersive social network of online 3D~virtual environments. From the viewpoint of communication and networking, this will represent an evolution of the \emph{game networking} technology, designed to interconnect massive users in real-time online gaming environments. This article presents the basic principles of game networking and discusses their evolution towards meeting the requirements of the Metaverse and similar applications. Several open research challenges are discussed, along with possible solutions through experimental case studies.</description>

      <title>Myocardial Infarction Detection from ECG: A Gramian Angular Field-based 2D-CNN Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for inferior myocardial infarction (MI) detection using lead II of electrocardiogram (ECG). We evaluate our proposed method on a public dataset, namely, Physikalisch Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) ECG dataset from Physionet. Under our proposed method, we first clean the noisy ECG signals using db4 wavelet, followed by an R-peak detection algorithm to segment the ECG signals into beats. We then translate the ECG timeseries dataset to an equivalent dataset of gray-scale images using Gramian Angular Summation Field (GASF) and Gramian Angular Difference Field (GADF) operations. Subsequently, the gray-scale images are fed into a custom two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) which efficiently differentiates between a healthy subject and a subject with MI. Our proposed approach achieves an average classification accuracy of 99.68%, 99.80%, 99.82%, and 99.84% under GASF dataset with noise and baseline wander, GADF dataset with noise and baseline wander, GASF dataset with noise and baseline wander removed, and GADF dataset with noise and baseline wander removed, respectively. Most importantly, this work opens the floor for innovation in wearable devices to measure lead II ECG (e.g., by a smart watch worn on right wrist, along with a smart patch on left leg), in order to do accurate, real-time and early detection of inferior wall MI.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Based Resource Allocator for Communication Systems with Dynamic User Utility Demands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) based resource allocation (RA) has recently gained significant attention due to its performance efficiency. However, most related studies assume an ideal case where the number of users and their utility demands, e.g., data rate constraints, are fixed, and the designed DL-based RA scheme exploits a policy trained only for these fixed parameters. Consequently, computationally complex policy retraining is required whenever these parameters change. In this paper, we introduce a DL-based resource allocator (ALCOR) that allows users to adjust their utility demands freely, such as based on their application layer requirements. ALCOR employs deep neural networks (DNNs) as the policy in a time-sharing problem. The underlying optimization algorithm iteratively optimizes the on-off status of users to satisfy their utility demands in expectation. The policy performs unconstrained RA (URA)--RA without considering user utility demands--among active users to maximize the sum utility (SU) at each time instant. Depending on the chosen URA scheme, ALCOR can perform RA in either a centralized or distributed scenario. Derived convergence analyses provide guarantees for ALCOR's convergence, and numerical experiments corroborate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Communication-Assisted Sensing in 6G Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07157v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploring the mutual benefit and reciprocity of sensing and communication (S\&amp;C) functions is fundamental to realizing deeper integration for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. This paper investigates a novel communication-assisted sensing (CAS) system within 6G perceptive networks, where the base station actively senses the targets through device-free wireless sensing and simultaneously transmits the estimated information to end-users. In such a CAS system, we first establish an optimal waveform design framework based on the rate-distortion (RD) and source-channel separation (SCT) theorems. After analyzing the relationships between the sensing distortion, coding rate, and communication channel capacity, we propose two distinct waveform design strategies in the scenario of target impulse response estimation. In the separated S\&amp;C waveforms scheme, we equivalently transform the original problem into a power allocation problem and develop a low-complexity one-dimensional search algorithm, shedding light on a notable power allocation tradeoff between the S\&amp;C waveform. In the dual-functional waveform scheme, we conceive a heuristic mutual information optimization algorithm for the general case, alongside a modified gradient projection algorithm tailored for the scenarios with independent sensing sub-channels. Additionally, we identify the presence of both subspace tradeoff and water-filling tradeoff in this scheme. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Geometric Neural Network based on Phase Space for BCI-EEG decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05645v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: The integration of Deep Learning (DL) algorithms on brain signal analysis is still in its nascent stages compared to their success in fields like Computer Vision. This is particularly true for BCI, where the brain activity is decoded to control external devices without requiring muscle control. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely adopted choice for designing BCI systems due to its non-invasive and cost-effective nature and excellent temporal resolution. Still, it comes at the expense of limited training data, poor signal-to-noise, and a large variability across and within-subject recordings. Finally, setting up a BCI system with many electrodes takes a long time, hindering the widespread adoption of reliable DL architectures in BCIs outside research laboratories. To improve adoption, we need to improve user comfort using, for instance, reliable algorithms that operate with few electrodes. Approach: Our research aims to develop a DL algorithm that delivers effective results with a limited number of electrodes. Taking advantage of the Augmented Covariance Method and the framework of SPDNet, we propose the Phase-SPDNet architecture and analyze its performance and the interpretability of the results. The evaluation is conducted on 5-fold cross-validation, using only three electrodes positioned above the Motor Cortex. The methodology was tested on nearly 100 subjects from several open-source datasets using the Mother Of All BCI Benchmark (MOABB) framework. Main results: The results of our Phase-SPDNet demonstrate that the augmented approach combined with the SPDNet significantly outperforms all the current state-of-the-art DL architecture in MI decoding. Significance: This new architecture is explainable and with a low number of trainable parameters.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning based Positioning with Multi-task Learning and Uncertainty-based Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) methods have been shown to improve the performance of several use cases for the fifth-generation (5G) New radio (NR) air interface. In this paper we investigate user equipment (UE) positioning using the channel state information (CSI) fingerprints between a UE and multiple base stations (BSs). In such a setup, we consider two different fusion techniques: early and late fusion. With early fusion, a single DL model can be trained for UE positioning by combining the CSI fingerprints of the multiple BSs as input. With late fusion, a separate DL model is trained at each BS using the CSI specific to that BS and the outputs of these individual models are then combined to determine the UE's position. In this work we compare these different fusion techniques and show that fusing the outputs of separate models achieves higher positioning accuracy, especially in a dynamic scenario. We also show that the combination of multiple outputs further benefits from considering the uncertainty of the output of the DL model at each BS. For a more efficient training of the DL model across BSs, we additionally propose a multi-task learning (MTL) scheme by sharing some parameters across the models while jointly training all models. This method, not only improves the accuracy of the individual models, but also of the final combined estimate. Lastly, we evaluate the reliability of the uncertainty estimation to determine which of the fusion methods provides the highest quality of uncertainty estimates.</description>

      <title>Blind Bistatic Radar Parameter Estimation for AFDM Systems in Doubly-Dispersive Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for blind bistatic radar parameter estimation (RPE), which enables integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) by allowing passive (receive) base stations (BSs) to extract radar parameters (ranges and velocities of targets), without requiring knowledge of the information sent by an active (transmit) BS to its users. The contributed method is formulated with basis on the covariance of received signals, and under a generalized doubly-dispersive channel model compatible with most of the waveforms typically considered for ISAC, such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM). The original non-convex problem, which includes an $\ell_0$-norm regularization term in order to mitigate clutter, is solved not by relaxation to an $\ell_1$-norm, but by introducing an arbitrarily-tight approximation then relaxed via fractional programming (FP). Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed method approaches that of an ideal system with perfect knowledge of the transmit signal covariance with an increasing number of transmit frames.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, radar systems have advanced significantly, offering environmental adaptation and multi-task capabilities. These developments pose new challenges for electronic intelligence (Elint) and electronic support measures (ESM), which need to identify and interpret sophisticated radar behaviors. This paper introduces a Deep Multi-Intentional Inverse Reinforcement Learning (DMIIRL) method for the identification and inverse cognition of cognitive multi-function radars (CMFR). Traditional Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) methods primarily target single reward functions, but the complexity of CMFRs necessitates multiple reward functions to fully encapsulate their behavior. To this end, we develop a method that integrates IRL with Expectation-Maximization (EM) to concurrently handle multiple reward functions, offering better trajectory clustering and reward function estimation. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>Cloud-Based Federation Framework and Prototype for Open, Scalable, and Shared Access to NextG and IoT Testbeds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a new federation framework for UnionLabs, an innovative cloud-based resource-sharing infrastructure designed for next-generation (NextG) and Internet of Things (IoT) over-the-air (OTA) experiments. The framework aims to reduce the federation complexity for testbeds developers by automating tedious backend operations, thereby providing scalable federation and remote access to various wireless testbeds. We first describe the key components of the new federation framework, including the Systems Manager Integration Engine (SMIE), the Automated Script Generator (ASG), and the Database Context Manager (DCM). We then prototype and deploy the new Federation Plane on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) public cloud, demonstrating its effectiveness by federating two wireless testbeds: i) UB NeXT, a 5G-and-beyond (5G+) testbed at the University at Buffalo, and ii) UT IoT, an IoT testbed at the University of Utah. Through this work we aim to initiate a grassroots campaign to democratize access to wireless research testbeds with heterogeneous hardware resources and network environment, and accelerate the establishment of a mature, open experimental ecosystem for the wireless community. The API of the new Federation Plane will be released to the community after internal testing is completed.</description>

Abstract: Digital Twin (DT) technology is expected to play a pivotal role in NextG wireless systems. However, a key challenge remains in the evaluation of data-driven algorithms within DTs, particularly the transfer of learning from simulations to real-world environments. In this work, we investigate the sim-to-real gap in developing a digital twin for the NSF PAWR Platform, POWDER. We first develop a 3D model of the University of Utah campus, incorporating geographical measurements and all rooftop POWDER nodes. We then assess the accuracy of various path loss models used in training modeling and control policies, examining the impact of each model on sim-to-real link performance predictions. Finally, we discuss the lessons learned from model selection and simulation design, offering guidance for the implementation of DT-enabled wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Correlation recurrent units: A novel neural architecture for improving the predictive performance of time-series data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.16653v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The time-series forecasting (TSF) problem is a traditional problem in the field of artificial intelligence. Models such as Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and GRU (Gate Recurrent Units) have contributed to improving the predictive accuracy of TSF. Furthermore, model structures have been proposed to combine time-series decomposition methods, such as seasonal-trend decomposition using Loess (STL) to ensure improved predictive accuracy. However, because this approach is learned in an independent model for each component, it cannot learn the relationships between time-series components. In this study, we propose a new neural architecture called a correlation recurrent unit (CRU) that can perform time series decomposition within a neural cell and learn correlations (autocorrelation and correlation) between each decomposition component. The proposed neural architecture was evaluated through comparative experiments with previous studies using five univariate time-series datasets and four multivariate time-series data. The results showed that long- and short-term predictive performance was improved by more than 10%. The experimental results show that the proposed CRU is an excellent method for TSF problems compared to other neural architectures.</description>

      <title>Dual-Functional Artificial Noise (DFAN) Aided Robust Covert Communications in Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16621v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates covert communications in an integrated sensing and communications system, where a dual-functional base station (called Alice) covertly transmits signals to a covert user (called Bob) while sensing multiple targets, with one of them acting as a potential watcher (called Willie) and maliciously eavesdropping on legitimate communications. To shelter the covert communications, Alice transmits additional dual-functional artificial noise (DFAN) with a varying power not only to create uncertainty at Willie's signal reception to confuse Willie but also to sense the targets simultaneously. Based on this framework, the weighted sum of the sensing beampattern means square error (MSE) and cross correlation is minimized by jointly optimizing the covert communication and DFAN signals subject to the minimum covert rate requirement. The robust design considers both cases of imperfect Willie's CSI (WCSI) and statistical WCSI. Under the worst-case assumption that Willie can adaptively adjust the detection threshold to achieve the best detection performance, the minimum detection error probability (DEP) at Willie is analytically derived in the closed-form expression. The formulated covertness constrained optimization problems are tackled by a feasibility-checking based difference-of-convex relaxation (DC) algorithm utilizing the S-procedure, Bernstein-type inequality, and the DC method. Simulation results validate the feasibility of the proposed scheme and demonstrate the covertness performance gains achieved by our proposed design over various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Convex-Hull Relaxation Based Algorithm for Multi-User Discrete Passive Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is an emerging technology to enhance spatial multiplexing in wireless networks. This letter considers the discrete passive beamforming design for IRS in order to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among multiple users in an IRS-assisted downlink network. The main design difficulty lies in the discrete phase-shift constraint. Differing from most existing works, this letter advocates a convex-hull relaxation of the discrete constraints which leads to a continuous reformulated problem equivalent to the original discrete problem. This letter further proposes an efficient alternating projection/proximal gradient descent and ascent algorithm for solving the reformulated problem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly.</description>

      <title>Submodular Maximization Approaches for Equitable Client Selection in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a conventional Federated Learning framework, client selection for training typically involves the random sampling of a subset of clients in each iteration. However, this random selection often leads to disparate performance among clients, raising concerns regarding fairness, particularly in applications where equitable outcomes are crucial, such as in medical or financial machine learning tasks. This disparity typically becomes more pronounced with the advent of performance-centric client sampling techniques. This paper introduces two novel methods, namely SUBTRUNC and UNIONFL, designed to address the limitations of random client selection. Both approaches utilize submodular function maximization to achieve more balanced models. By modifying the facility location problem, they aim to mitigate the fairness concerns associated with random selection. SUBTRUNC leverages client loss information to diversify solutions, while UNIONFL relies on historical client selection data to ensure a more equitable performance of the final model. Moreover, these algorithms are accompanied by robust theoretical guarantees regarding convergence under reasonable assumptions. The efficacy of these methods is demonstrated through extensive evaluations across heterogeneous scenarios, revealing significant improvements in fairness as measured by a client dissimilarity metric.</description>
