      <title>SOLSAT: An FPGA Based satellite for effective Solar-activity monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kp-Index is a very important factor for determining how the Sun's magnetic field is affecting the Earth's magnetic field and help us prepare for the worst (like solar or geomagnetic storms). Currently there are around thirteen observation centers to determine the worldwide Kp index. Huge data is generated from all the observation centers which is then used to determine several factors, but the observatories are concentrated in places like North America and Europe only. To eliminate the data dependency from a very limited geographical periphery we can use a constellation of satellites in LEO which can log in data continuously and provide a real time and accurate Kp index which can help humanity for tackling with the impending issues from our nearest star in a better way. The constellation of the satellites will be deployed in the Low Earth Orbit(LEO) and continuously log the geomagnetic data and provide a constant stream of data, which will be more diverse given the area coverage made by one satellite. This is essentially a boon as more the data we can have better geomagnetic data and the Kp index will be all encompassing which can help in better mapping of any solar-catastrophe.</description>

      <title>Low-Latitude Auroras: Insights from 23 April 2023 Solar Storm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In April 2023, low-latitude aurora observation by the all-sky camera at Hanle, Ladakh, India ($33^{\circ} {} N $ geographic latitude (GGLat)) was reported, which stimulated a lot of discussion among scientists as well as masses across the globe. The reported observation was intriguing as the solar storm that triggered this aurora was moderate and the first such observation from Indian region in the space-era. In this communication, we investigate such a unique modern-day observation of low-latitude auroral sighting occurring during the passage of sheath-region of Interplanetary-Coronal-Mass-Ejection, utilizing in situ multi-spacecraft particle measurements along with geomagnetic-field observations by ground and satellite-based magnetometers. Auroral observations at Hanle coincided with the intense substorm occurrences. It is unequivocally found that the aurora didnt reach India, rather the equatorward boundary of the aurora was beyond $ 50^{\circ} {}N $ GGLat. The multi-instrumental observations enabled us to estimate the altitude of the red auroral emissions accurately. The increased flux of low-energy electrons ($&lt;$100 eV) precipitating at $\sim 54^{\circ}N$ GGLat causing red-light emissions at higher altitudes ($\sim$700-950 km) can be visible from Hanle. The observed low-latitude red aurora from India resulted from two factors: emissions at higher altitudes in the auroral oval and a slight expansion of the auroral oval towards the equator. The precipitating low-energy particles responsible for red auroral emissions mostly originate from the plasma sheet. These particles precipitate due to wave-particle interactions enhanced by strong compression of the magnetosphere during high solar wind pressure. This study using multi-point observations holds immense importance in providing a better understanding of low-latitude auroras.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Solar Cycle Influence on Long-Term Orbital Deterioration of Space Debris in LEO and MEO orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid increase in the number of space debris represents a substantial threat to the sustained viability of space operations. Monitoring these debris is critical for space situational awareness. Therefore, it has become of immense importance to understand the impact of solar activity on the space debris orbit. This study examines the effect of solar cycles, specifically Solar Cycles 22, 23, and 24, on the orbital decay of space debris. Utilizing TLE data for 95 objects in LEO and MEO dating back to the 1960s, we examined the orbital decay rates of these objects across the three solar cycles. Our analysis reveals a significant correlation between orbital decay and various indices serving as proxies for solar and geomagnetic activity. Notably, Solar Cycle 22 exhibited the highest decay rates, while Solar Cycle 24 showed the lowest. Moreover, we observed a similar impact at altitudes exceeding 2000 km, albeit with a time lag of over 14 months compared to the shorter lag observed at LEO orbits during peak solar activity. These findings underscore the crucial relationship between solar activity and its enduring influence on space debris.</description>

      <title>Applications of Fast Magnetic Reconnection Models to the Atmospheres of the Sun and Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partially-ionized plasmas consist of charged and neutral particles whose mutual collisions modify magnetic reconnection compared with the fully-ionized case. The collisions alter the rate and locations of the magnetic dissipation heating and the distribution of energies among the particles accelerated into the non-thermal tail. We examine the collisional regimes for the onset of fast reconnection in two environments: the partially-ionized layers of the solar atmosphere and the protoplanetary disks that are the birthplaces for planets around young stars. In both these environments, magnetic nulls readily develop into resistive current sheets in the regime where the charged and neutral particles are fully coupled by collisions, but the current sheets quickly break down under the ideal tearing instability. The current sheets collapse repeatedly, forming magnetic islands at successively smaller scales, till they enter a collisionally-decoupled regime where the magnetic energy is rapidly turned into heat and charged-particle kinetic energy. Small-scale, decoupled fast reconnection in the solar atmosphere may lead to preferential heating and energization of ions and electrons that escape into the corona. In protoplanetary disks such reconnection causes localized heating in the atmospheric layers that produce much of the infrared atomic and molecular line emission observed with the Spitzer and James Webb Space Telescopes.</description>
