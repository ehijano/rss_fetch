      <title>Supergluon scattering in AdS: constructibility, spinning amplitudes, and new structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We elaborate on a new recursive method proposed in arXiv:2312.15484 for computing tree-level $n$-point supergluon amplitudes as well as those with one gluon, i.e., spinning amplitudes, in ${\rm AdS}_5 \times S^3$. We present an improved proof for the so-called "constructibility" of supergluon and spinning amplitudes based on their factorizations and flat-space limit, which allows us to determine these amplitudes in Mellin space to all $n$. We present explicit and remarkably simple expressions for up to $n=7$ supergluon amplitudes and $n=6$ spinning amplitudes, which can be viewed as AdS generalizations of the scalar-scaffolded gluon amplitudes proposed recently. We then reveal a series of hidden structures of these AdS amplitudes including (1) an understanding of general pole structures especially the precise truncation on descendent poles (2) a derivation of simple "Feynman rules" for the all-$n$ amplitudes with the simplest R-symmetry structures, and (3) certain universal behavior analogous to the soft/collinear limit of flat-space amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Surface Operators and Exact Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface operators are nonlocal probes of gauge theories capable of distinguishing phases that are not discernible by the classic Wilson-'t Hooft criterion. We prove that the correlation function of a surface operator with a chiral primary operator in ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills is a finite polynomial in the Yang-Mills coupling constant. Surprisingly, in spite of these observables receiving nontrivial quantum corrections, we find that these correlation functions are exactly captured in the 't Hooft limit by supergravity in asymptotically $AdS_5\times S^5$ [1]! We also calculate exactly the surface operator vacuum expectation value and the correlator of a surface operator with 1/8-BPS Wilson loops using supersymmetric localization. We demonstrate that these correlation functions in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM realize in a nontrivial fashion the conjectured action of $S$-duality. Finally, we perturbatively quantize ${\cal N}=4$ SYM around the surface operator singularity and identify the Feynman diagrams that when summed over reproduce the exact result obtained by localization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study certain higher point thermal correlators of heavy and light scalar primaries in a holographic CFT. Assuming simple self-interactions and couplings of the scalars in the bulk theory, we show that the thermal correlators contain a signature of the proper time to singularity from the horizon. The key idea is to use WKB approximations for the propagators and evaluate the bulk integrals using saddle point method.</description>

      <title>Topology of the charged AdS black hole in restricted phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The local topological properties of black hole systems can be expressed by the winding numbers as the defects. As so far, AdS black hole thermodynamics is often depicted by the dual parameters of $(T,S),~ (P,V), (\Phi, Q)$ in the extended phase space, while there is several study on the black hole thermodynamics in the restricted phase space. In this paper, we analyze the topological properties of the charged AdS black holes in the restricted phase space under the higher dimensions and higher order curvature gravities frame. The results show that the topological number of the charged black hole in the same canonical ensembles is a constant and is independent of the concrete dual thermodynamical parameters. However, the topological number in the grand canonical ensemble is different from that in the canonical ensemble for the same black hole system. Furthermore, these results are independent of the dimension $d$, the highest order $k$ of the Lanczos-Lovelock densities.</description>

      <title>New Factorizations of Yang-Mills Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new factorization pattern for tree-level Yang-Mills (YM) amplitudes, where they decompose into a sum of products of two lower-point amplitudes by setting specific two-point non-planar Mandelstam variables within a rectangular configuration to zero. This approach manifests the hidden zeros of YM amplitudes recently identified. Furthermore, by setting specific Lorentz products involving polarization vectors to zero, the amplitudes further reduce to a sum of products of three currents. These novel factorizations provide a fresh perspective on the structure of YM amplitudes, potentially enhancing our understanding and calculation of these fundamental quantities.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of a twisted modulus on a mirror of rigid Calabi-Yau manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stabilization of a twisted modulus in Type IIB flux compactifications on a mirror of the rigid Calabi-Yau threefold. By analyzing the effective action of twisted and untwisted moduli, we find that three-form fluxes satisfying the tadpole cancellation conditions lead to supersymmetric AdS vacua. We also investigate swampland conjectures on this non-geometric background.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative determination of the ${\cal N} = 1$ SUSY Yang-Mills gluino condensate at large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first non-perturbative large-$N$ calculation of the $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric (SUSY) $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Yang-Mills gluino condensate, obtained by means of numerical simulations of the lattice-discretized theory, and exploiting large-$N$ twisted volume reduction. We present two different determinations based, respectively, on the Banks-Casher formula and on the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation, both giving perfectly consistent results. By matching the lattice and the Novikov-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov (NSVZ) regularization schemes, we are able for the first time to compare numerical and analytic computations. Our most accurate determination gives $\Sigma_{\rm RGI} /\Lambda_{\rm NSVZ}^3 = 1.55(57)$, in very good agreement with the $N$-dependence and the value predicted by the weak coupling instanton-based approach $\Sigma_{\rm RGI} /\Lambda_{\rm NSVZ}^3 = 1$.</description>

      <title>Revisiting subregion holography using OPE blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we revisit the entanglement wedge representation of AdS$_3$ bulk fields in terms of CFT operator product expansion (OPE) blocks for a general class of blocks. Given a boundary interval and its associated causal diamond, the OPEs involve boundary operators with or without spin, and located either at spacelike or timelike edges of the diamond. Only for a subset of these cases, can the OPE block be dual to a geodesic bulk field. We show that when applied to de Sitter, a suitable combination of Euclidean OPE blocks can represent a dS scalar integrated over the timelike extremal surfaces, which play an important role in defining pseudo-entropy. We also work out some simple higher dimensional examples.</description>

      <title>An alternative to purification in CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conformal field theories, in contrast to \emph{adding} some auxiliary states into the bipartite mixed state $\rho_{AB}$ as the usual purifications do, we show a pure entangled state $\psi_{AB}$ can be constructed by \emph{subtracting} the undetectable regions. In this pure state $\psi_{AB}$, the von Neumann entropy $S_{\text{vN}}(A)$ naturally captures quantum entanglement between $A$ and $B$. We verify that $S_{\text{vN}}(A)$ is equal to the entanglement wedge cross-section $E_{W}$ in AdS spacetime, which is conjectured to be the holographic dual of the entanglement of purification. We show such constructed entanglement entropy has a phase transition. The ordinary entanglement entropies of critical and non-critical QFTs are simply limits of the two phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the covariant proposal for the gravitational Compton amplitude for a Kerr black hole. Employing the covariant three- and four-point Compton amplitudes, we assemble the classical one-loop integrand on the maximal cut at all orders in spin, utilizing the method of unitarity. Expanding in powers of spin, we evaluate the one-loop amplitude up to $\mathcal O(G^2 a^8)$. Supplemented with extra contact contributions derived from the far-zone data of the Teukolsky solutions, the one-loop amplitude is in agreement with results available in the literature. We showcase the classical eikonal in the aligned-spin case at $\mathcal O(G^2 a^7)$.</description>

      <title>Higher spin swampland conjecture for massive AdS$_{3}$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that a possible version of the swampland weak gravity conjecture for higher spin (HS) massive topological AdS$_{3}$ gravity can be expressed in terms of mass $M_{hs}$, charge $Q_{hs}$ and coupling constant $g_{hs}$ of 3D gravity coupled to higher spin fields as $M_{hs} \leq \sqrt{2}$ $Q_{hs}$ $g_{hs}$ $M_{Pl}$. The higher spin charge is given by the $SO(1,2)$ quadratic Casimir $Q_{hs}^{2}=s\left (s-1\right) $ and the HS coupling constant by ${\large g}_{hs} ^{2}=2/\left (M_{Pl}^{2} l_{AdS_{3}}^{2}\right )$ while the mass expressed like $\left( l_{AdS_{3}} \text{M}_{hs}\right) ^{2}$ is defined as $ \left (1+\mu l_{AdS_{3}} \right ) ^{2} s \left ( s-1 \right ) +[1- \left ( \mu l_{AdS_{3}} \right ) ^{2} \left ( s-1 \right ) ]$.</description>

      <title>Gluon scattering on the self-dual dyon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computation of scattering amplitudes in the presence of non-trivial background gauge fields is an important but extremely difficult problem in quantum field theory. In even the simplest backgrounds, obtaining explicit formulae for processes involving more than a few external particles is often intractable. Recently, it has been shown that remarkable progress can be made by considering background fields which are chiral in nature. In this paper, we obtain a compact expression for the tree-level, maximal helicity violating (MHV) scattering amplitude of an arbitrary number of gluons in the background of a self-dual dyon. This is a Cartan-valued, complex gauge field sourced by a point particle with equal electric and magnetic charges, and can be viewed as the self-dual version of a Coulomb field. Twistor theory enables us to manifest the underlying integrability of the self-dual dyon, trivializing the perturbative expansion in the MHV sector. The formula contains a single position-space integral over a spatial slice, which can be evaluated explicitly in simple cases. As an application of the formula, we show that the holomorphic collinear splitting functions of gluons in the self-dual dyon background are un-deformed from a trivial background, meaning that holomorphic celestial OPE coefficients and the associated chiral algebra are similarly un-deformed. We also comment on extensions of our MHV formula to the full tree-level gluon S-matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any four-dimensional Supersymmetric Quantum Field Theory with eight supercharges can be associated to a certain complex symplectic manifold called the "K-theoretic Coulomb branch" of the theory. The collection of K-theoretic Coulomb branches include many complex phase spaces of great interest, including in particular the "character varieties" of complex flat connections on a Riemann surface. The SQFT definition endows K-theoretic Coulomb branches with a variety of canonical structures, including a deformation quantization. In this paper we introduce a canonical "Schur" quantization of K-theoretic Coulomb branches. It is defined by a variant of the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction, applied to protected Schur correlation functions of half-BPS line defects. Schur quantization produces an actual quantization of the complex phase space. As a concrete application, we apply this construction to character varieties in order to quantize Chern-Simons gauge theory with a complex gauge group. Other applications include the definition of a new quantum deformation of the Lorentz group, and the solution of certain spectral problems via dualities.</description>

      <title>To curve, or not to curve: Is curvature-assisted quintessence observationally viable?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-field models of accelerated expansion with nearly flat potentials, despite being able to provide observationally viable explanations for the early-time cosmic inflation and the late-time cosmic acceleration, are in strong tension with string theory evidence and the associated de Sitter swampland constraints. It has recently been argued that in an open universe, where the spatial curvature is negative (i.e., with $\Omega_k&gt;0$), a new stable fixed point arises, which may lead to viable single-field-based accelerated expansion with an arbitrarily steep potential. Here we show, through a dynamical systems analysis and a Bayesian statistical inference of cosmological parameters, that the additional cosmological solutions based on the new fixed point do not render steep-potential, single-field, accelerated expansion observationally viable. We mainly focus on quintessence models of dark energy, but we also argue that a similar conclusion can be drawn for cosmic inflation.</description>

The first approach involves utilizing the Euler-Lagrange equations derived from a Lagrangian that describes the propagation of the first massive excitation of open superstrings. The second method entails enforcing the conditions that the trace vanishes and that the covariant derivative of the equations vanish. We very briefly comment about other spins.</description>

      <title>Freudenthal Duality in Conformal Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotational Freudenthal duality (RFD) relates two extremal Kerr-Newman (KN) black holes (BHs) with different angular momenta and electric-magnetic charges, but with the same Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Through the Kerr/CFT correspondence (and its KN extension), a four-dimensional, asymptotically flat extremal KN BH is endowed with a dual thermal, two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) such that the Cardy entropy of the CFT is the same as the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the KN BH itself. Using this connection, we study the effect of the RFD on the thermal CFT dual to the KN extremal BH. We find that the RFD maps two different thermal, two-dimensional CFTs with different temperatures and central charges, but with the same asymptotic density of states, thereby matching the Cardy entropy. In an appendix, we discuss the action of the RFD on doubly-extremal rotating BHs, finding a spurious branch in the non-rotating limit, and determining that for this class of BH solutions the image of the RFD necessarily over-rotates.</description>

      <title>Non-Invertible Surface Defects in 2+1d QFTs from Half Spacetime Gauging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study duality defects in 2+1d theories with $\bZ^{(0)}_N\times\bZ^{(1)}_N$ global symmetry and trivial mixed 't Hooft anomaly. By gauging these symmetries simultaneously in half of the spacetime, we define duality defects for theories that are self-dual under gauging. We calculate the fusion rules involving duality defects and show that they obey a fusion 2-category. We also construct the corresponding symmetry topological field theory, a four-dimensional BF theory on a slab which realizes the duality defects on the boundary upon shrinking the interval. Furthermore, we provide explicit examples of such duality defects in $U(1)\times U(1)$ gauge theories and in more general product theories. Finally, we find duality defects in non-Lagrangian theories obtained by compactification of 6d $\cN=(2,0)$ SCFTs of type $A_{N-1}$ on various three-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Warm Hawking Relics From Primordial Black Hole Domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmological impact of warm, dark-sector relic particles produced as Hawking radiation in a primordial-black-hole-dominated universe before big bang nucleosynthesis. If those dark-sector particles are stable, they would survive to the present day as "Hawking relics" and modify the subsequent growth of cosmological structure. We show that such relics are produced with much larger momenta, but in smaller quantities than the familiar thermal relics considered in standard cosmology. Consequently, Hawking relics with keV-MeV masses affect the growth of large-scale structure in a similar way to eV-scale thermal relics like massive neutrinos. We model their production and evolution, and show that their momentum distributions are broader than comparable relics with thermal distributions. Warm Hawking relics affect the growth of cosmological perturbations and we constrain their abundance to be less than $2\%$ of the dark matter over a broad range of their viable parameter space. Finally, we examine how future measurements of the matter power spectrum can distinguish Hawking relics from thermal particles.</description>

      <title>Extra-Dimensional Axion Expectations</title>

Abstract: Axions arising as modes of higher-dimensional gauge fields are known to offer a compelling solution to the axion quality problem and to naturally arise in string theory. In this context, it is interesting to ask how we would interpret an experimental measurement of the axion decay constant $f$. I give several arguments for, as well as concrete examples in string theory of, the existence in such a model of an axion string with tension of order $2\pi S_\mathrm{inst} f^2$, where $S_\mathrm{inst}$ is the instanton action. Furthermore, in models of this type axion strings are typically fundamental objects (rather than solitons), whose tension is at or above the fundamental cutoff of the theory. As a result, I argue that for an extra-dimensional QCD axion, it is likely that the fundamental cutoff scale lies at most two orders of magnitude above $f$. In addition to these core arguments, this paper begins with a self-contained introduction to the physics of extra-dimensional axions and ends with some comments on axion physics in relation to chiral fermions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the Russian Doll Model (RDM) of superconductivity for finite energy levels. Previously, cyclic renormalization group (RG) and Efimov scaling were found in RDM for part of the equidistant spectrum and we generalize this observation in a few directions. We find that when the whole spectrum is considered, equidistancy condition is removed or diagonal disorder is added, the cyclicity of RG survives but the period of RG becomes energy dependent. The analytic analysis is supported with exact diagonalization.</description>

      <title>Family of Exact and Inexact Quantum Speed Limits for Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional quantum speed limits formulated in density matrix space perform poorly for dynamics beyond unitary, as they are generally unattainable and fail to characterize the fastest possible dynamics. To address this, we derive two distinct quantum speed limits in Liouville space for Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving (CPTP) dynamics that outperform previous bounds. The first bound saturates for time-optimal CPTP dynamics, while the second bound is exact for all states and all CPTP dynamics. Our bounds have a clear physical and geometric interpretation arising from the uncertainty of superoperators and the geometry of quantum evolution in Liouville space. They can be regarded as the generalization of the Mandelstam-Tamm bound, providing uncertainty relations between time, energy, and dissipation for open quantum dynamics. Additionally, our bounds are significantly simpler to estimate and experimentally more feasible as they require to compute or measure the overlap of density matrices and the variance of the Liouvillian. We have also obtained the form of the Liouvillian, which generates the time-optimal (fastest) CPTP dynamics for given initial and final states. We give two important applications of our bounds. First, we show that the speed of evolution in Liouville space bounds the growth of the spectral form factor and Krylov complexity of states, which are crucial for studying information scrambling and quantum chaos. Second, using our bounds, we explain the Mpemba effect in non-equilibrium open quantum dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We provide general relativistic treatment of the single-component field described by Dirac's positive-energy wave equation of 1971. It is motivated by Bogomolny's proposal to regard that field as a possible candidate for dark matter. Our emphasis is on standard (flat) Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology. The early universe is not considered, though there is a strong indication that the field may play a role in internally driven generation of cosmic anisotropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes bearing magnetic charges may bypass the constraints imposed by Hawking radiation, thereby enabling reasonable present-day populations, even for masses below $10^{15}\,\text{g}$ -- a range previously considered improbable. They could, therefore, conceivably contribute to a component of dark matter. We investigate novel Faraday rotation signatures exhibited by primordial magnetic black holes while also establishing new Parker-type bounds on their populations. For the latter, we bound the dark matter fraction from intergalactic magnetic fields in cosmic voids $\left(f_{\text{DM}} \lesssim 10^{-8}\right)$ and cosmic web filaments $\left(f_{\text{ DM}} \lesssim 10^{-4}\right)$, notably eclipsing previous bounds. Exploring Faraday rotation effects, we discern a pronounced rotation of the polarization angle and the rotation measure values for extremal primordial magnetic black holes with masses $M^{\text{ ex.}}_{\text{ BH}}\gtrsim 10^{-6}~ \text{M}_\odot$. This makes them potentially detectable in current observations. A comparative investigation finds that the effects are notably greater than for a neutron star, like a Magnetar, with a similar magnetic field at the surface. Moreover, the polarization angle maps for primordial magnetic black holes exhibit unique features, notably absent in other astrophysical magnetic configurations. In this context, we also introduce a simple integral measure, offering a quantitative measure for their discrimination in many scenarios. These traits potentially suggest a robust avenue for their observational detection and differentiation.</description>

      <title>Frozen boson stars in an infinite tower of higher-derivative gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a solution for a five-dimensional boson star under gravity with infinite tower of higher curvature corrections. We discover that when the coupling constant exceeds a certain threshold, an alternative configuration emerges, distinct from the conventional five-dimensional boson star. This new structure is characterized by a broader frequency range, with its minimum value approaching zero. At a truncation of $n=2$ for the correction order, the solution and its scalar curvature diverge as the frequency approaches zero. However, as the order of higher curvature corrections increases, the singularity at the center vanishes, resulting in a globally regular solution. Additionally, as the frequency approaches zero, the scalar field's radial distribution becomes concentrated within the critical radius $r_c$, forming what we term a ``frozen star". Beyond this radius, the metric of the frozen star almost degenerates into that of an extreme black hole. The solutions for such frozen stars offer a new avenue for exploring the enigmatic interiors of compact celestial bodies, enhancing our understanding of the internal structure of black holes under semi-classical conditions and potentially addressing the series of paradoxes associated with information loss due to singularities and horizons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An exponential modified gravity with additional logarithmic corrections is considered with the presence of an axion-like scalar field in the role of dark matter. Axion fields are thought to become important at late-times when the axion-like scalar field oscillates around its vacuum expectation value, mimicking dark matter behaviour. The model is compared with the usual pressureless fluid description of dark matter. Both models are tested with observational data including some of the latest sources, providing similar fits in comparison with the $\Lambda$CDM model. Despite results are not statistically relevant to rule out any model, the number of free parameters still favours $\Lambda$CDM model, as shown by computing the goodness of the fits.</description>

Abstract: We investigate thermodynamics of apparent horizon in the $f(Q)$ universe with trivial and nontrivial connections. We first explore the perspectives of the first law, generalized second law and $P-V$ phase transition with trivial connection. We show that the lowest-order correction of entropy has the same form as that in loop quantum gravity, and the critical exponents of the phase transition caused by the lowest-order correction are consistent with those in mean field theory. We then examine the thermodynamic implication of nontrivial connections. We find that nontrivial connections in the $f(Q)$ universe imply non-equilibrium states from the perspective of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Boson Production from Inflaton Coupling during Reheating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) fields is a common feature in many models beyond the Standard Model, characterized by their exclusive derivative couplings. This paper investigates a scenario where a pNGB is coupled to the inflaton field during the reheating phase of the early universe. We calculate the perturbative decay rate of a coherently oscillating inflaton into pNGBs on a general basis, considering both constant and field-dependent couplings with monomial potentials at the minimum. As a concrete application, we explore the production of axions when the radial mode of the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) scalar serves as the inflaton, particularly in the presence of a large gravitational non-minimal coupling. Our findings suggest that the presence of pNGBs during reheating can lead to significant non-thermal relics, offering new constraints on inflationary reheating models and providing potential observational signatures in the form of dark radiation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Unruh effect, predicting a thermal reservoir for accelerating systems, calls for a more refined understanding of measurement processes involving quantum systems as thermometers. Conventional models fail to account for the inherent spatial extent of the thermometer, neglecting the complexities associated with accelerated extended quantum systems. Our work builds upon the seminal work of Bell, Hughes, and Leinaas. We propose a refined thermometer model incorporating a spin-1/2 particle where the spin acts as a temperature indicator. This refined model demonstrates the ability to effectively measure the temperature under specific, realistic conditions, providing a unique value that essentially averages the local Unruh temperatures throughout the extended quantum system acting as the thermometer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the question of how generic is the formation of primordial black holes via self-resonant growth of inflaton fluctuations in the post-inflationary, preheating phase. Using analytical and lattice calculations, we find that primordial black hole production is far from being a generic outcome. Also, in most of the parameter space of viable inflationary models, the metric preheating term is subleading to the anharmonic terms and the approximation of a quadratic potential for describing the resonance dynamics is inadequate. Nonetheless, the anharmonicity of the potential cannot be used to rescue the mechanism: The generic outcome of the non-linear evolution of the scalar field in this case is the formation of metastable transients or oscillons, that do not generically collapse into black holes.</description>

Abstract: It is commonly held that quantum states with energy $E = 0$ would belong to the continuum. However, several situations have been reported when a zero-energy state becomes bound subject to certain restrictions on the coupling constants defining the potential. In the present work, we present another evidence of the existence of regular zero-energy normalizable solutions for a system of QES potentials that correspond to rationally extended many-body truncated Calogero-Sutherland model. Our procedure is based upon the potential group approach with an underlying so$(2, 1)$ structure that utilizes the three cases guided by it on profitably carrying out a point canonical transformation. We deal with each case separately by suitably restricting the coupling parameters.</description>

Abstract: We consider spherically symmetric gravity coupled to a spherically symmetric scalar field with a specific coupling which depends on the Areal Radius. Classical collapse is described by the Vaidya solution. The semiclassical Einstein equations are well defined. Their solution describes an evaporating black hole. A balance law at future null infinity relates the rate of change of a back reaction-corrected Bondi mass to a manifestly positive flux. Its detailed form suggests a quantum extension of future null infinity along which all information including that in the collapsing matter is expected to emerge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a holographic dark energy model that incorporates the first-order approximate Kaniadaski entropy, utilizing the Hubble horizon, $1/H$, as the infrared cutoff. We investigate the cosmological evolution within this framework. The model introduces an extra parameter relative to the $\Lambda$CDM model. It posits a Universe that is initially dominated by dark matter, which then evolves to a phase where dark energy becomes the predominant component, with this transition occurring at a redshift of approximately $z \sim 0.419$. The energy density of dark energy is ultimately expected to become constant, thereby circumventing the potential issue of a "big rip". Employing the most recent Type Ia supernova and Hubble parameter data, we constrain the model's parameters and find a Hubble constant of $H_0=72.8$ km/s/Mpc, thereby resolving the Hubble tension issue. The estimated age of the Universe, based on the best-fit parameter values, is $14.2$ Gyr. Furthermore, we predict the number of strong gravitational lenses and conduct statefinder and $Om$ diagnostic analyses to validate and characterize the model.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the quasinormal mode spectrum for Kerr black holes surrounded by an asymptotically uniform magnetic field, modeled with the Ernst-Wild geometry. A perturbative expansion in both the rotation parameter $a$ and the magnetic field $B$ allows separation of the perturbation equations, and we obtain the spectrum for a variety of scalar quasinormal modes over a range of parameters using the continued fraction method. We then interpolate the low-lying mode spectrum to construct an Ernst-Wild template for the ringdown, and use the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA analysis tool pyRing to assess the impact of the magnetosphere on the extraction of ringdown signatures from several observed binary black hole mergers.</description>

Abstract: In the two-dimensional Liouville conformal field theory, correlation functions involving a degenerate field satisfy partial differential equations due to the decoupling of the null descendant field. On the other hand, the instanton partition function of a four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric theory in the $\Omega$-background at a special point of the parameter space also satisfies a partial differential equation resulting from the constraints of the gauge field configurations. This partial differential equation can be proved using the nonperturbative Dyson-Schwinger equations. We show for the next-to-simplest case that the partial differential equations obtained from two different perspectives can be identified, thereby confirming an assertion of the BPS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.13397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a $4D$ supersymmetric theory is placed on $S^3 \times \mathbb{R}$, the supersymmetric algebra is necessarily modified to $su(2|1)$ and we are dealing with a weak supersymmetric system. For such systems, the excited states of the Hamiltonian are not all paired. As a result, the Witten index Tr$\{(-1)^F e^{-\beta H}\}$ is no longer an integer number, but a $\beta$-dependent function.
  However, this function stays invariant under deformations of the theory that keep the supersymmetry algebra intact. Based on the Hilbert space analysis, we give a simple general proof of this fact. We then show how this invariance works for two simplest weak supersymmetric quantum mechanical systems involving a real or a complex bosonic degree of freedom.</description>

Abstract: For a Lorentzian invariant theory, the entanglement entropy should be a function of the domain of dependence of the subregion under consideration. More precisely, it should be a function of the domain of dependence and the appropriate cut-off. In this paper, we refine the concept of cut-off to make it applicable to timelike regions and assume that the usual entanglement entropy formula also applies to timelike intervals. Using the Rindler method, the timelike entanglement entropy can be regarded as the thermal entropy of the CFT after the Rindler transformation plus a constant $ic\pi/6$ with $c$ the central charge. The gravitational dual of the `covariant' timelike entanglement entropy is finally presented following this method.</description>

Abstract: In this work we initiate a positive semi-definite numerical bootstrap program for multi-point correlators. Considering six-point functions of operators on a line we reformulate the crossing symmetry equation for a pair of comb-channel expansions as a semi-definite programming problem. We provide two alternative formulations of this problem. At least one of them turns out to be amenable to numerical implementation. Through a combination of analytical and numerical techniques we obtain rigorous bounds on CFT data in the triple-twist channel for several examples.</description>

      <title>On the anomaly interpretation of amplitudes in self-dual Yang-Mills and gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the integrability anomalies arising in the self-dual sectors of gravity and Yang-Mills theory, focusing on their connection to both the chiral anomaly and the trace anomaly. The anomalies in the self-dual sectors generate the one-loop all-plus amplitudes of gravitons and gluons, and have recently been studied via twistor constructions. On the one hand, we show how they can be interpreted as an anomaly of the chiral U(1) electric-magnetic-type duality in the self-dual sectors. We also note the similarity, for the usual fermionic chiral anomaly, between the 4D setting of self-dual Yang-Mills and the 2D setting of the Schwinger model. On the other hand, the anomalies in the self-dual theories also resemble the trace anomaly, sharing the same type of non-local effective action. We highlight the role of a Weyl-covariant fourth-order differential operator familiar from the trace anomaly literature, which (i) explains the conformal properties of the one-loop amplitudes, and (ii) indicates how this story may be extended to non-trivial spacetime backgrounds, e.g. with a cosmological constant. Moving beyond the self-dual sectors, and focusing on the gravity case, we comment on an intriguing connection to the two-loop ultraviolet divergence of pure gravity, whereby cancelling the anomaly at one-loop eliminates the two-loop divergence for the simplest helicity amplitudes.</description>

Abstract: We consider the XXZ spin chain in the scaling limit in the Matsubara direction. The main result of this paper is new representations for the functions $\Psi(l, \kappa)$ and $\Theta(l, m; \kappa, \alpha)$ associated with the function $\omega(\zeta, \xi; \kappa, \kappa)$ found in the expression for the correlation function of the generators of the fermionic basis for the XXZ spin chain. The final result incorporates the case of particle-hole excitations which is needed for the relation of the fermionic basis to the Virasoro basis of the CFT descendants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00890v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the atypical non-equilibrium state found in [1708.06328] which holographically represents a behind-the-horizon excitation in a blackhole spacetime. The special feature of this state is that it looks like an equilibrium state when probed by a class of low-energy operators. First, we retrieve this property using the uniformization mapping in the limit of large central charge, in the process we are able to derive rather than presume approximate thermal physics. Furthermore, in the large-c and high-energy limit we realize these excitations as elements of the commutant algebra of a GNS-representation of the light operator algebra. Instead of analytically continuing a mixed heavy-light Euclidean correlator to a Lorentzian correlator, we identify the Euclidean correlator as a GNS-linear form and interpret the Lorentzian correlator as a vacuum expectation value of representatives of the light operator algebra on the GNS-vacuum.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic features of AdS black holes within the Rastall gravity and perfect fluid matter framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we analyzed the impact of a perfect fluid on the phase transition of Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes within the Rastall gravitational background. Compared to similar studies in the literature, the findings of this work are highlighted by the determination of analytical expressions for critical points for charged and Kerr-Newman AdS black holes using approximated formulas for the horizon radius. An accurate analysis of these new analytical expressions allowed us to discover a new viable condition that relates the Rastall parameter \k{appa}{\lambda} to the equation of state parameter {\omega}, expressed as: \k{appa}{\lambda} = {\omega}/(1+{\omega}). Thanks to this new condition, we were able to reproduce all the analytical expressions of critical points calculated within the framework of Einstein\^as general relativity for two cases: a charged AdS black hole and a rotating AdS black hole. These findings suggest that Rastall gravity, considering this new condition, could serve as an alternative theory of gravitation to general relativity. The approximate expression of the horizon radius also enabled the exploration of the distinctiveness of fractional-order phase transitions in these AdS black holes. Furthermore, we calculated the critical exponents, offering insights into the behavior of crucial thermodynamic quantities near the inflection point. Examining how a perfect fluid influences phase transition reveals various critical behaviors, demonstrating that the variation in the phase transition depends on the intensity of the perfect fluid. Notably, this variation is portrayed by a linearly increasing trajectory with the escalation of this intensity.</description>

      <title>Higher order corrections to KPV: The nonabelian brane stack perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the decay of $\overline{D3}$-branes in the setup of Kachru, Pearson, and Verlinde (KPV) at higher order in $\alpha'$ from the perspective of a nonabelian $\overline{D3}$-brane stack. We extend the leading order analysis of KPV by including higher order commutators as well as higher derivative corrections. Recently, the KPV setup has been studied at higher order in $\alpha'$ from the NS5-brane perspective. It was found that in order to control $\alpha'$ corrections the quantity $g_sM^2$ determining the amount of warping in the Klebanov-Strassler throat has to be much larger than expected. This leads to serious issues when using the $\overline{D3}$-branes as an uplift to dS. The benefit of the analysis in this work is that the $\overline{D3}$-brane perspective is controlled when the distance between the branes inside the brane stack is substringy which is a regime not controlled on the NS5-brane side. As a main result, we find that the strong bound $g_sM^2\sim \mathcal{O}(100)$ obtained on the NS5-brane also holds in the regime accessible from the $\overline{D3}$-brane perspective. We also show that the novel way of uplifting proposed in the recent work on $\alpha'$ corrections to the KPV setup can only work for small warped throats.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding string backgrounds with de Sitter spacetime, where all approximations and corrections are controlled, is an open problem. We revisit the search for de Sitter solutions in the classical regime for specific type IIB supergravity compactifications on group manifolds, an under-explored corner of the landscape that offers an interesting testing ground for swampland conjectures. While the supergravity de Sitter solutions we obtain numerically are ambiguous in terms of their classicality, we find an analytic scaling that makes four out of six compactification radii, as well as the overall volume, arbitrarily large. This potentially provides parametric control over corrections. If we could show that these solutions, or others to be found, are fully classical, they would constitute a counterexample to conjectures stating that asymptotic de Sitter solutions do not exist. We discuss this point in great detail.</description>

      <title>Probing the quantum nature of gravity using a Bose-Einstein condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effect of noise induced by gravitons has been investigated using a Bose-Einstein condensate. The gravitational wave perturbation is then considerd as a sum of discrete Fourier modes in the momentum space. Coming to an operatorial representation and quantizing the phase space variables via appropriately introduced canonincal commutation relations between the canonically conjugate variables corresponding to the graviton and bosonic part of the total system, one obtains a proper quantum gravity setup. Then we obtain the Bogoliubov coefficients from the solution of the time-dependent part of the pseudo-Goldstone boson and construct the covariance metric for the bosons initially being in a squeezed state. Using the stochastic average of the Fisher information, we obtain a lower bound on the amplitude parameter of the gravitational wave. As the entire calculation is done at zero temperature, the bosonic system, by construction, will behave as a Bose-Einstein condensate. For a Bose-Einstein condensate with a single mode, we observe that the lower bound of the expectation value of the square of the uncertainty in the amplitude measurement does not become infinite when the total observational term approaches zero. In order to sum over all possible momentum modes, we next consider a noise term with a suitable Gaussian weight factor which decays over time. We then obtain the lower bound on the final expectation value of the square of the variance in the amplitude parameter. Because of the noise induced by the graviton, there is a minimum value of the measurement time below which it is impossible to detect any gravitational wave using a Bose-Einstein condensate. Finally, we consider interaction between the phonon modes of the Bose-Einstein condensate which results in the decoherence. We observe that the decoherence effect becomes significant for gravitons with minimal squeezing.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of Higgs mechanism within the context of spontaneous symmetry breaking has offered a new perspective on the early time cosmic inflation and also on the relationship between elementary particles and dark energy, believed to drive the universe's accelerating expansion. We suggest an inflation scenario driven by the Higgs boson within the framework of unimodular gravity, where the Higgs field acts as the inflaton and has a significant non-minimal coupling to the gravity. We present a detailed analysis of the problem in the Jordan and then Einstein frame for a unimodular Higgs inflation, followed by a comparison of our findings with the Cosmic Microwave Background observations made by the Planck Collaboration and other joint data sets. Therefore, new constraints are imposed on the non-minimal coupling parameter, $\xi$, by determining the magnitudes required for effective cosmic inflation. We demonstrate that a substantial non-minimal coupling of order $\xi\sim 10^{2}-10^{4}$ is required for this model to match with the observed primordial spectrum.</description>

      <title>Holographic RG flows in a 3d gauged supergravity at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider finite-temperature holographic RG flows in $D=3$ $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ gauged truncated supergravity coupled to a sigma model with a hyperbolic target space. In the context of the holographic duality, fixed points (CFTs) at finite temperature are described by AdS black holes. We come from the gravity EOM to a 3d autonomous dynamical system, which critical points can be related to fixed points of dual field theories. Near-horizon black hole solutions correspond to infinite points of this system. We use Poincar\'e transformations to project the system on $\mathbf{R}^3$ into the 3d unit cylinder such that the infinite points are mapped onto the boundary of the cylinder. We explore numerically the space of solutions. We show that the exact RG flow at zero temperature is the separatrix for asymptotically AdS black hole solutions if the potential has one extremum, while for the potential with three extrema the separatrices are RG flows between AdS fixed points. We find near-horizon analytical solutions for asymptotically AdS black holes using the dynamical equations. We also present a method for constructing full analytical solutions.</description>

Abstract: We formulate scalar field theories in a curved braided $L_\infty$-algebra formalism and analyse their correlation functions using Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization. We perform detailed calculations in cubic braided scalar field theory up to two-loop order and three-point multiplicity. The divergent tadpole contributions are eliminated by a suitable choice of central curvature for the $L_\infty$-structure, and we confirm the absence of UV/IR mixing. The calculations of higher loop and higher multiplicity correlators in homological perturbation theory are facilitated by the introduction of a novel diagrammatic calculus. We derive an algebraic version of the Schwinger-Dyson equations based on the homological perturbation lemma, and use them to prove the braided Wick theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a tensor network (TN) scheme into the entanglement augmentation process of the synergistic optimization framework by Rudolph et al. [arXiv:2208.13673] to build its process systematically for inhomogeneous systems. Our synergistic approach first embeds the variational optimal solution of the TN state with the entropic area law, which can be perfectly optimized in conventional (classical) computers, in a quantum variational circuit ansatz inspired by the TN state with the entropic volume law. Next, the framework performs a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) process with embedded states as the initial state. We applied the synergistic to the ground-state analysis of the all-to-all coupled random transverse-field Ising, XYZ, Heisenberg model, employing the binary multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) state and branching MERA states as TN states with entropic area law and volume law, respectively. We then show that the synergistic accelerates VQE calculations in the three models without an initial parameter guess of the branching-MERA-inspired ansatz and can avoid a local solution trapped by a standard VQE with the ansatz in the Ising model. The improvement of optimizers for MERA in all-to-all coupled inhomogeneous systems, enhancement, and potential synergistic applications are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: We construct symmetry-preserving lattice regularizations of 2d QED with one and two flavors of Dirac fermions, as well as the `3450' chiral gauge theory, by leveraging bosonization and recently-proposed modifications of Villain-type lattice actions. The internal global symmetries act just as locally on the lattice as they do in the continuum, the anomalies are reproduced at finite lattice spacing, and in each case we find a sign-problem-free dual formulation.</description>

Abstract: We address the variational preparation of the Thermofield Double state (TFD) as the ground state of a suitably engineered Hamiltonian acting on the doubled Hilbert space. Through the use of the entanglement forging ansatz, we propose a solution that involves only circuits of width $N$. We illustrate the method with generic fermionic hamiltonians. The free fermion case can be solved in closed form, and yields a warm start state for the variational circuits whenever interactions are present.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative probability insights into the double-scaling limit SYK Model with constant perturbations: moments cumulants and $q$-independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extending our previous results, we study the double-scaling limit SYK (DSSYK) model with an additional diagonal matrix with a fixed number $c$ of nonzero constant entries $\theta$. This constant diagonal term can be rewritten in terms of Majorana fermion products. Its specific formula depends on the value of $c$. We find exact expressions for the moments of this model. More importantly, by proposing a moment-cumulant relation, we reinterpret the effect of introducing a constant term in the context of non-commutative probability theory. This gives rise to a $\tilde{q}$ dependent mixture of independences within the moment formula. The parameter $\tilde{q}$, derived from the $q$-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck ($q$-OU) process, controls this transformation. It interpolates between classical independence ($\tilde{q}=1$) and Boolean independence ($\tilde{q}=0$). The underlying combinatorial structures of this model provide the non-commutative probability connections. Additionally, we explore the potential relation between these connections and their gravitational path integral counterparts.</description>

      <title>Speed limits to the growth of Krylov complexity in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the propagation of information through quantum many-body systems, developed to study quantum chaos, have found many application from black holes to disordered spin systems. Among other quantitative tools, Krylov complexity has been explored as a diagnostic tool for information scrambling in quantum many-body systems. We introduce a universal limit to the growth of the Krylov complexity in dissipative open quantum systems by utilizing the uncertainty relation for non-hermitian operators. We also present the analytical results of Krylov complexity for characteristic behavior of Lanczos coefficients in dissipative systems. The validity of these results are demonstrated by explicit study of transverse-field Ising model under dissipative effects.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a model of a one-dimensional Bose gas with attraction. We study ground state equal-time correlation functions in this model using the algebraic Bethe ansatz. In cases of strong interaction or/and large-volume systems, we obtain very simple explicit formulas for correlations.</description>

      <title>All-order Feynman rules for leading-twist gauge-invariant operators in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Feynman rules for leading-twist gauge-invariant quark and gluon operators with an arbitrary number of total derivatives and applicable to any order in perturbation theory. This generalizes previous results and constitutes a necessary ingredient in the computation of the matrix elements of the corresponding operators. The results are written in a form appropriate for implementation in a computer algebra system. To illustrate the latter we provide implementations in Mathematica and FORM, which are made available at https://github.com/vtsam/NKLO.</description>

      <title>Testing disformal non-circular deformation of Kerr black holes with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is strong observational evidence that almost every large galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center. It is of fundamental importance to know whether such black holes are described by the standard Kerr solution in General Relativity (GR) or by another black hole solution. An interesting alternative is the so-called disformal Kerr black holes which exist within the framework of degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories of gravity. The departure from the standard Kerr black hole spacetime is parametrized by a parameter $D$, called $\textit{disformal parameter}$. In the present work, we discuss the capability of LISA to detect the disformal parameter. For this purpose, we study Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRI's) around disformal Kerr black holes within the framework of the quadrupole hybrid formalism. Even when the disformal parameter is very small, its effect on the globally accumulated phase of the gravitational waveform of an EMRI can be significant due to the large number of cycles in the LISA band made by the small compact object. We show that LISA will in principle be able to detect and measure extremely small values of the disformal parameter which in turn, can be seen as an assessment of LISA's ability to detect very small deviations from the Kerr geometry.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic constraints and exact scaling exponents of flocking matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use advances in the formalism of boost agnostic passive fluids to constrain transport in polar active fluids, which are subsequently described by the Toner-Tu equations. Acknowledging that the system fundamentally breaks boost symmetry we compel what were previously entirely phenomenological parameters in the Toner-Tu model to satisfy precise relationships among themselves. Consequently, we propose a thermodynamic argument to determine the exact scalings of the transport coefficients under dynamical renormalisation group flow. These scalings perfectly agree with the results of recent state-of-the-art numerical simulation and experiments</description>

      <title>Constraints and Time Evolution in Generic $f$(Riemann) Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a detailed canonical analysis of the $n$-dimensional $f$(Riemann) gravity, correcting the earlier results in the literature. We also write the field equations in the Fischer-Marsden form which is amenable to identifying the non-stationary energy on a spacelike hypersurface. We give pure $R^{2}$ theory as an example.</description>

      <title>Gross-Neveu-Yukawa theory of $\text{SO}(2N)\rightarrow \text{SO}(N) \times \text{SO}(N)$ spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct and study the relativistic Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theory for the $\text{SO}(2N)$ real symmetric second-rank tensor order parameter coupled to $N_f$ flavors of $4N$-component Majorana fermions in 2+1 dimensions. Such a tensor order parameter unifies all Lorentz-invariant mass-gap orders for $N$ two-component Dirac fermions in two dimensions except for the $\text{SO}(2N)$-singlet anomalous quantum Hall state. The value $N_f=1$ corresponds to the canonical Gross-Neveu model. Within the leading-order $\epsilon$-expansion around the upper critical dimension of $3+1$ the field theory exhibits a critical fixed point in its renormalization group flow which describes spontaneous symmetry breaking to $\text{SO}(N)\times \text{SO}(N)$ for the number of flavors of Majorana fermions higher than a critical value $N_{f,c2}\approx 2N$. For $N_{f, c1}&lt; N_f &lt; N_{f,c2}$ , with $N_{f,c1} \approx 1.080 N$ the critical fixed point resides in the unstable region of the theory where the effective potential is unbounded from below, whereas for $N_f &lt; N_{f,c1}$ there is no real critical fixed point, and the flow runs away. In either case, for $N_f &lt; N_{f,c2}$ the transition should become fluctuation-induced first-order, and we discuss the dependence of its size on the parameters in the theory. One-loop critical exponents for the new universality class at $N_{f, c2}&lt; N_f $ are computed and the flow diagram in various regimes is discussed.</description>

      <title>Effective Quantum Gravitational Collapse in a Polymer Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how the presence of an area gap, different than zero, affects the gravitational collapse of a dust ball. The implementation of such discreteness is achieved through the framework of polymer quantization, a scheme inspired by loop quantum gravity (LQG). We study the collapse using variables which represent the area, in order to impose the non-zero area gap condition. The collapse is analyzed for both the flat and spherical Oppenheimer-Snyder models. In both scenarios the formation of the singularity is avoided, due to the inversion of the velocity at finite values of the sphere surface. This happens due to the presence of a negative pressure, with origins at a quantum level. When the inversion happens inside the black hole event horizon, we achieve a geometry transition to a white hole. When the inversion happens outside the event horizon, we find a new possible astrophysical object. A characterization of such hypothetical object is done. Some constraints on the value for the area gap are also imposed in order to maintain the link with our already established physical theories.</description>
