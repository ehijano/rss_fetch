      <title>Optical Algorithm for Derivative of Real-Valued Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The derivation of a function is a fundamental tool for solving problems in calculus. Consequently, the motivations for investigating physical systems capable of performing this task are numerous. Furthermore, the potential to develop an optical computer to replace conventional computers has led us to create an optical algorithm and propose an experimental setup for implementing the derivative of one-dimensional real-valued functions using a paraxial and monochromatic laser beam. To complement the differentiation algorithm, we have experimentally implemented a novel optical algorithm that can transfer a two-dimensional phase-encoded function to the intensity profile of a light beam. Additionally, we demonstrate how to implement the n-th derivative of functions encoded in the phase of the transverse profile of photons.</description>

      <title>Anderson transition for light in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Anderson transition for light in three dimensions by performing large-scale ab-initio simulations of electromagnetic wave transport in disordered ensembles of conducting spheres. A mobility edge that separates diffusive transport and Anderson localization is identified, revealing a sharp transition from diffusion to localization for light. Critical behavior in the vicinity of the mobility edge is well described by a single-parameter scaling law. The critical exponent is found to be consistent with the value known for the Anderson transition of the orthogonal universality class. Statistical distribution of total transmission at the mobility edge is described without any fit parameter by the diagrammatic perturbation theory originally developed for scalar wave diffusion, but notable deviation from the theory is found when Anderson localization sets in.</description>

      <title>Photonic biosensing via Su-Schrieffer-Heeger boundary modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a conceptual device for multiplexed biosensor in a photonic crystal chip based on the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger mechanism. Remarkably, the proposed biosensor can identify three distinct disease markers through a single-shot photon transmission measurement, due to the couplings among the three Su-Schrieffer-Heeger boundary modes in the photonic crystal. Our biosensor design is more robust against defects and disorders inevitable in real-life device applications than previous designs. Such robustness is invaluable for achieving efficient, reliable, and integrated biosensing based on nanophotonic systems. We further demonstrate that various combinations of disease markers can be recognized via the photon transmission spectrum, unveiling a promising route toward high performance advanced biosensing for future biomedical technology.</description>

      <title>Topologically integrated photonic biosensor circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated nanophotonic biosensors offer a promising route toward future biomedical detection applications that may enable inexpensive, portable, and sensitive diagnosis of diseases with a small amount of biological samples for convenient early-stage screening of fatal diseases. However, the current photonic biosensor designs are not suitable for highly integrated and multiplexing device architectures that can achieve the detection of complex combinations of many biomarkers. Here, we propose a topological scheme for the integration of miniature biosensors in photonic crystal chips that can meet the above requirement. Using photonic topological edge states as robust one-dimensional waveguides that connect many photonic biosensors, we propose here the topologically integrated photonic biosensor circuits. We demonstrate that the performance of the topologically integrated photonic biosensors is much more robust against disorders than that of the photonic biosensors connected by the normal photonic waveguides, due to the robust transport of photons along the edge channel. Since disorders arising from the fabrication imperfection and the random distribution of the biomarkers are inevitable in genuine devices, resilience against disorders is a necessity for on-chip integration of biosensors. The topological scheme proposed here thus opens a promising path toward reliable integration of photonic biosensors for next-generation biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional spin-flipping topological edge state laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological edge states manifest spin-momentum-locking propagation as a primary consequence of topological crystals. However, experimental studies on spin manipulation and the resulting propagation of these states are lacking. Here, we demonstrate experimentally spin manipulation of topological edge states by the boundary conditions of the one-dimensional path. Armchair boundaries at the endpoints of the path induce spin-flipping back-scattering, resulting in a novel one-dimensional resonance -- traveling resonance. Remarkably, we demonstrate lasing of this one-dimensional traveling resonance. Our findings hold significant potential for practical applications in spin manipulation of light.</description>

      <title>Hidden photoexcitations probed by multi-pulse photoluminescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-resolved photoluminescence is a validated method for tracking the photoexcited carrier dynamics in luminescent materials. This technique probes the photoluminescence decays upon a periodic excitation by short laser pulses. Herein, we demonstrate that this approach cannot directly detect hidden photoexcitations with much slower dynamics than the photoluminescence decay. We demonstrate a new method based on a multi-pulse excitation scheme that enables an unambiguous detection and an easily interpreted tracking of these hidden species. The multi-pulse excitation consists of a single pulse (Read) followed by a burst of many closely separated pulses (Write) and finally another single pulse (Read). To illustrate the efficacy of the Read-Write-Read excitation scheme, we apply it to metal halide perovskites to directly visualize carrier trapping, extract the concentration of trapped charges and determine the rate constant of trap depopulation. The developed approach allows studying performance-limiting processes in energy devices using a versatile, highly applicable all-optical method.</description>

      <title>Nanoroughness induced anti-reflection and haze effects in opaque systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How to make a material anti-reflective without changing its high refraction index? Achieving anti-reflection in high-refractive-index materials poses challenges due to their high reflectivity (Fresnel equations). Based on theory with new boundary conditions, we propose modifying surface properties on a nanoscale to tackle this. Our study on weakly rough opaque surfaces reveals significant changes in specular and diffuse scattering, predicting anti-reflection where roughness matches light penetration depth for the first time. Experimental validation on nano-roughened Si films (at wavelengths 300-400 nm) supports our findings. We also analyze angular and polarization dependences of nanoroughness-induced haze, showing predominant p-polarization and minimal haze at nanoscale, yet impactful specular reflection reduction.</description>

      <title>Infrared Beam-shaping on Demand via Tailored Geometric Phase Metasurfaces employing the Plasmonic Phase-Change Material In3SbTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional optical elements are bulky and limited to specific functionalities, contradicting the increasing demand of miniaturization and multi-functionalities. Optical metasurfaces enable tailoring light-matter interaction at will, especially important for the infrared spectral range which lacks commercially available beam-shaping elements. While the fabrication of those metasurfaces usually requires cumbersome techniques, direct laser writing promises a simple and convenient alternative. Here, we exploit the non-volatile laser-induced insulator-to-metal transition of the plasmonic phase-change material In3SbTe2 (IST) for optical programming of large-area metasurfaces for infrared beam-shaping. We tailor the geometric phase of metasurfaces with rotated crystalline IST rod antennas to achieve beam steering, lensing, and beams carrying orbital angular momenta. Finally, we investigate multi-functional and cascaded metasurfaces exploiting enlarged holography, and design a single metasurface creating two different holograms along the optical axis. Our approach facilitates fabrication of large-area metasurfaces within hours, enabling rapid-prototyping of customized infrared meta-optics for sensing, imaging and quantum information.</description>

      <title>Lithography-free patterning of chalcogenide materials for integrated photonic devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chalcogenide material-based integrated photonic devices have garnered widespread attention due to their unique wideband transparency. Despite their recognized CMOS compatibility, the fabrication of these devices relies predominantly on lithography techniques. However, chalcogenide thin films are highly susceptible to oxidation, necessitating customized process flows and complex protective measures during lithography. These requirements are hardly compatible with current commercial CMOS manufacturing platforms designed for silicon photonics, significantly limiting the practical applications of chalcogenide photonic devices. In this work, we ingeniously exploit the ease of oxidation of chalcogenide materials, presenting a novel laser-induced localized oxidation technique for spatial patterning on chalcogenide thin films, enabling concise lithography-free fabrication of chalcogenide integrated photonic devices. Using Sb2S3 as an example, we experimentally demonstrate localized multi-level oxidation with a sizable overall refractive index contrast of 0.7 at near-infrared, featuring a high spatial resolution of 0.6 um. Based on this technique, multiple integrated photonic devices are demonstrated, showing versatile functionalities, including color printing at visible and metasurface-based spatial light modulation at near-infrared regions. Leveraging the inherent phase-change property of Sb2S3, an active Fresnel zone plate, enabling switchable beam focusing, is further demonstrated, indicating the feasibility of concise fabrication of active photonic devices. Our work offers a brand-new modulation dimension for chalcogenide materials and provides a significantly simplified approach for realizing chalcogenide-integrated photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous PT-symmetry breaking transitions under the influence of noise in an optomechanical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a phenomenon of an alteration of a state symmetry without a change in the system symmetry. A transition from a state with unbroken symmetry to a state with broken symmetry leads to a qualitative change in system properties, and respective states are called as symmetric and non-symmetric phases of the system. Usually, the change in the system parameters is necessary for the transition between symmetric and non-symmetric phases. In this letter, we consider the behavior of an optomechanical system with an exceptional point under the influence of noise. We demonstrate that below the exceptional point, PT-symmetric and non-PT-symmetric phases can coexist. In this regime, a noise can lead to random transitions between the symmetric and non-symmetric phases. These transitions are accompanied by the abrupt changes in the intensities of photon and phonon modes. The predicted phenomenon opens up the possibility of studying the kinetics of phase transitions caused by spontaneous breaking of PT symmetry.</description>

      <title>When do molecular polaritons behave like optical filters?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This perspective outlines several linear optical effects featured by molecular polaritons arising in the collective strong light-matter coupling regime, focusing on the limit when the number of molecules per photon mode is large. We show that, under these circumstances, molecular absorption within a cavity can be understood as the overlap between the polariton transmission and bare molecular absorption spectra, suggesting that polaritons act in part as optical filters. This framework demystifies and provides a straightforward explanation for a large class of theoretical models of polaritonic phenomena, highlighting that similar effects might be achievable outside a cavity with shaped laser pulses. With a few modifications, this simple conceptual picture can also be adapted to understand the incoherent nonlinear response of polaritonic systems. However, we note that there are experimental observations in the collective regime that exhibit phenomena that go beyond this treatment. Our analysis underscores the importance of the notion that the field still needs to establish a clear distinction between polaritonic phenomena that can be fully explained through classical optics and those that require a more advanced theoretical framework. The linear optics approach presented here is exact when the number of molecules tends to infinity and is quite accurate for a large, but finite, number of molecules. We highlight the limitations of this treatment when the rates of the single-molecule processes that facilitate dark-state-to-polariton relaxation cannot be neglected and in systems under strong coupling with few molecules. Further exploration in these areas is needed to uncover novel polaritonic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Dynamic X-ray coherent diffraction analysis: bridging the timescales between imaging and photon correlation spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of diffraction limited sources and developments in detector technology opens up new possibilities for the study of materials in situ and operando. Coherent X-ray diffraction techniques such as coherent X-ray diffractive imaging (CXDI) and X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) are capable for this purpose and provide complimentary information, although due to signal-to-noise requirements, their simultaneous demonstration has been limited. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for the simultaneous use of CXDI and XPCS to study in situ the Brownian motion of colloidal gold nanoparticles of 200 nm diameter suspended in a glycerol-water mixture. We visualise the process of agglomeration, examine the spatiotemporal space accessible with the combination of techniques, and demonstrate CXDI with 22 ms temporal resolution.</description>

      <title>Generalised Brillouin Zone for Non-Reciprocal Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it has been observed that the Floquet-Bloch transform with real quasiperiodicities fails to capture the spectral properties of non-reciprocal systems. The aim of this paper is to introduce the notion of a generalised Brillouin zone by allowing the quasiperiodicities to be complex in order to rectify this. It is proved that this shift of the Brillouin zone into the complex plane accounts for the unidirectional spatial decay of the eigenmodes and leads to correct spectral convergence properties. The results in this paper clarify and prove rigorously how the spectral properties of a finite structure are associated with those of the corresponding semi-infinitely or infinitely periodic lattices and give explicit characterisations of how to extend the Hermitian theory to non-reciprocal settings. Based on our theory, we characterise the generalised Brillouin zone for both open boundary conditions and periodic boundary conditions. Our results are consistent with the physical literature and give explicit generalisations to the $k$-Toeplitz matrix cases.</description>

      <title>Generation of Ultrafast Magnetic Steps for Coherent Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A long-standing challenge in ultrafast magnetism and in functional materials research in general, has been the generation of a universal, ultrafast stimulus able to switch between stable magnetic states. Solving it would open up many new opportunities for fundamental studies, with potential impact on future data storage technologies. Ideally, step-like magnetic field transients with infinitely fast rise time would serve this purpose. Here, we develop a new approach to generate ultrafast magnetic field steps, based on an ultrafast quench of supercurrents in a superconductor. Magnetic field steps with millitesla amplitude, picosecond risetimes and slew rates approaching 1 GT/s are achieved. We test the potential of this technique by coherently rotating the magnetization in a ferrimagnet. With suitable improvements in the geometry of the device, these magnetic steps can be made both larger and faster, leading to new applications that range from quenches across phase transitions to complete switching of magnetic order parameters.</description>

      <title>Generation of Quantum Vortex Electrons with Intense Laser Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accelerating a free electron to high energy forms the basis for studying particle and nuclear physics. Here it is shown that wavefunction of such an energetic electron can be further manipulated with femtosecond intense lasers. During the scattering between a high-energy electron and a strong laser pulse, we find a regime where the enormous photon spin angular momenta can be efficiently transferred to the electron orbital angular momentum (OAM). The wavefunction of the scattered electron is twisted from its initial plane-wave state to quantum vortex state. Nonlinear quantum electrodynamics (QED) theory suggests that GeV-level electrons acquire average intrinsic OAM beyond 100 h-barat laser intensities of 10^20W/cm^2 with linear scaling. These electrons emit gamma photons with double-peaked spectrum, which sets them apart from ordinary electrons. The findings demonstrate a proficient method for generating relativistic leptons with quantum vortex wavefunctions based on existing laser technology, thereby fostering a novel source for particle and nuclear physics.</description>

Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) defy conventional wisdom that assumes a spectral separation between propagating waves, that carry energy away, and spatially localized waves corresponding to discrete frequencies. They can be described as resonance states with infinite lifetime, i.e., leaky modes with zero leakage. The advent of metamaterials and nanophotonics allowed the creation of BICs in a variety of systems. Mainly, BICs have been realized by destructive interference between outgoing resonant modes or exploiting engineered global symmetries that enforce the decoupling of a symmetry-incompatible bound mode from the surrounding radiation modes. Here, we introduce theoretically BICs relying on a different mechanism, namely local symmetries that enforce a field concentration on a part of a complex system without implying any global symmetry. We experimentally implement such BICs using microwaves in a compact one-dimensional photonic network and show that they emerge from the annihilation of two topological singularities, a zero and a pole, of the measured scattering matrix. Our alternative for achieving BICs in complex wave systems may be useful for applications like sensing, lasing, and enhancement of nonlinear interactions that require high-$Q$ modes.</description>

      <title>Sub-Rayleigh Ghost Imaging via Structured Speckle Illumination</title>

Abstract: The structured illumination is adopted widely in the super-resolution microscopy imaging. Here, we studied the ghost imaging scheme with sinusoidal structured speckle illumination, whose spatial resolution can surpass the Rayleigh-resolution limit by a factor of 2. In addition, ghost image with a higher spatial resolution can be realized by a pseudo-modulation structured illumination, whose modulation frequency breaks the upper limit of imaging system. Finally, our research verifies that the structural speckle illumination, a free-standing sub-Rayleigh technology, can be grafted with a variety of sub-Rayleigh ghost imaging schemes to further improve the spatial resolution of ghost image, such as the pseudo-inverse ghost imaging.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Relativistic Vortex Electrons in External Laser Fields</title>

Abstract: Investigating vortex electron interactions with electromagnetic fields is essential for advancing particle acceleration techniques, scattering theory in background fields, and obtaining novel electron beams for material diagnostics. A systematic investigation into the dynamics of vortex electrons in external laser fields and the exploration of laser-induced vortex modes remains lacking. In this work, we study the propagation of vortex electrons in linearly polarized (LP) and circularly polarized (CP) laser pulses, both separately and in their combined form in two-mode laser pulses. The theoretical formalism is developed by utilizing Volkov-Bessel wave functions, and the four-current density is obtained as a crucial observable quantity. Numerical results illustrate the dynamics of vortex electrons in external lasers, showing that the beam center of the vortex electron follows the classical motion of a point charge electron, while maintaining the probability distribution structure for both vortex eigenstates and superposition modes. The combined effect of LP and CP laser pulses in the two-mode laser field allows for the versatile control of vortex electrons, which is absent with LP or CP lasers alone, at femtosecond and sub-nanometer scales. Our findings demonstrate the versatile control over vortex electrons via laser pulses, with our formalism providing a reference for vortex scattering in laser backgrounds and inspiring the laser-controlled achievement of novel vortex modes as targeted diagnostic probes for specialized materials.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovianity in High-Dimensional Open Quantum Systems using Next-generation Multicore Optical Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00094</link>

Abstract: With the advent of quantum technology, the interest in communication tasks assisted by quantum systems has increased both in academia and industry. Nonetheless, the transmission of a quantum state in real-world scenarios is bounded by environmental noise, so that the quantum channel is an open quantum system. In this work, we study a high-dimensional open quantum system in a multicore optical fiber by characterizing the environmental interaction as quantum operations corresponding to probabilistic phase-flips. The experimental platform is currently state-of-the-art for quantum information processing with multicore fibers. At a given evolution stage we observe a non-Markovian behaviour of the system, which is demonstrated through a proof-of-principle implementation of the Quantum Vault protocol. A better understanding of phase-noise in multicore fibers will improve several real-world communication protocols, since they are a prime candidate to be adopted in future telecom networks.</description>

      <title>Localization engineering by resonant driving in dissipative polariton arrays</title>

Abstract: Arrays of microcavity polaritons are very versatile systems that allow for broad possibilities for the engineering of multi-orbital lattice geometries using different state preparation schemes. One of these schemes, spatially modulated resonant driving, can be used to selectively localize the polariton field on a particular region of the lattice. Both the frequency and the spatial amplitude distribution (module and phase) of the driven laser field are important and serve as a knob to control the extend of the spatial localization. Here, we analyse both the linear and nonlinear regimes using the lattice Green function formalism that is particularly suitable for the case of polariton arrays described in a tight-binding approximation. We identify the conditions for maximum localization on arbitrary lattice's geometries and discuss some experimentally relevant cases. We find that the polariton-polariton interaction leads to a frequency shift of the optimal localization condition that could be used to further control it.</description>

      <title>Nonclassical signatures of photon-phonon antibunching in a multifield driven optomechanical cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02896</link>

Abstract: Destructive interference-based photon-phonon antibunching can lead to violations of classical inequalities in optomechanical cavity systems. In this paper, we explore the violation of the classical Cauchy-Schwarz inequality by examining second-order auto-correlation and cross-correlation functions, as well as Bell's nonlocality, to analyze the quantum correlations of single photon-phonon excitations when the system is driven by two weak probe fields. We propose that the violation of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality can serve as an indicator for the stronger nonclassical tests associated with Bell's theorem. Our system reveals strong quantum correlations of photon-phonon pairs with distinctive antidiagonal patterns of photon filtering. For numerical analysis, we consider a weak effective optomechanical coupling strength and various optical-to-mechanical field amplitude ratios that enable unconventional photon (phonon) blockades at resonance. The findings are significant for producing sub-Poissonian signals under optimal conditions and have potential applications in hybrid systems for generating on-demand single photon-phonon pairs.</description>
