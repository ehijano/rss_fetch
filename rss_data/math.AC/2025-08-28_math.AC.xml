      <title>Govorov--Lazard and finite deconstructibility for Gorenstein and restricted homological dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over Cohen--Macaulay rings admitting a pointwise dualizing module, we show that the class of modules of restricted projective dimension bounded by any integer is finitely deconstructible and that the class of modules of restricted flat dimension bounded by any integer satisfies the Govorov-Lazard property. Along the way, we prove the corresponding result for Gorenstein projective and flat dimensions over (locally) Gorenstein rings. Outside of Cohen--Macaulay rings, we consider analogous properties for restricted projective dimension zero and restricted flat dimension zero and establish them for commutative noetherian rings of finite Krull dimension. This has consequences for the corresponding classes of finitely generated modules being preenveloping in certain cases and provides generalizations of Holm's results on structure of balanced big Cohen--Macaulay modules in various directions.</description>

      <title>Binomial edge rings associated to skew Ferrers diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the binomial edge ring associated with the skew Ferrers diagram. By employing Sagbi basis theory, we construct a quadratic Gr\"{o}bner basis for its defining ideal. As an application, we prove that this ring is a Koszul, Cohen-Macaulay, normal domain. Moreover, we precisely determine its Krull dimension.</description>

      <title>Metric completions of triangulated categories from hereditary rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The focus of this article is on metric completions of triangulated categories arising in the representation theory of hereditary finite dimensional algebras and commutative rings. We explicitly describe all completions of bounded derived categories with respect to additive good metrics for two classes of rings - hereditary commutative noetherian rings and hereditary algebras of tame representation type over an algebraically closed field. To that end, we develop and study the lattice theory of metrics on triangulated categories. Moreover, we establish a link between metric completions of bounded derived categories of a ring and the ring's universal localisations.</description>

      <title>An Effective Positivstellensatz over the Rational Numbers for Finite Semialgebraic Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of representing multivariate polynomials with rational coefficients, which are nonnegative and strictly positive on finite semialgebraic sets, using rational sums of squares.
  We focus on the case of finite semialgebraic sets S defined by equality constraints, generating a zero-dimensional ideal I, and by nonnegative sign constraints.
  First, we obtain existential results. We prove that a strictly positive polynomial f with coefficients in a subfield K of R has a representation in terms of weighted Sums-of-Squares with coefficients in this field, even if the ideal I is not radical. We generalize this result to the case where f is nonnegative on S and (f ) + (I : f ) = 1. We deduce that nonnegative polynomials with coefficients in K can be represented in terms of Sum-of-Squares of polynomials with coefficients in K, when the ideal is radical.
  Second, we obtain degree bounds for such Sums-of-Squares representations, which depend linearly on the regularity of the ideal and the degree of the defining equations, when they form a graded basis.
  Finally, we analyze the bit complexity of the Sums-of-Squares representations for polynomials with coefficients in Q, in the case the ideal is radical. The bitsize bounds are quadratic or cubic in the Bezout bound, and linear in the regularity, generalizing and improving previous results obtained for special zero dimensional ideals.
  As an application in the context of polynomial optimization, we retrieve and improve results on the finite convergence and exactness of the moment/Sums-of-Squares hierarchy.</description>
