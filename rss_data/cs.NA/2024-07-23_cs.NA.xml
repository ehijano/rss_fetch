      <title>High-dimensional sparse trigonometric approximation in the uniform norm and consequences for sampling recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent findings by Jahn, T. Ullrich, Voigtlaender [10] relate non-linear sampling numbers for the square norm to quantities involving trigonometric best $m-$term approximation errors in the uniform norm. Here we establish new results for sparse trigonometric approximation with respect to the high-dimensional setting, where the influence of the dimension $d$ has to be controlled. In particular, we focus on best $m-$term trigonometric approximation for (unweighted) Wiener classes in $L_q$ and give precise constants. Our main results are approximation guarantees where the number of terms $m$ scales at most quadratic in the inverse accuracy $1/\varepsilon$. Providing a refined version of the classical Nikol'skij inequality we are able to extrapolate the $L_q$-result to $L_\infty$ while limiting the influence of the dimension to a $\sqrt{d}$-factor and an additonal $\log$-term in the size of the (rectangular) spectrum. This has consequences for the tractable sampling recovery via $\ell_1$-minimization of functions belonging to certain Besov classes with bounded mixed smoothness. This complements polynomial tractability results recently given by Krieg [12].</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the Stokes problem under modified pressure Dirichlet boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper shows that the Stokes problem is well-posed when both velocity and pressure vanish on the domain boundary. This result is achieved by extending Ne\v{c}as' inequality to square-integrable functions that vanish in a small band covering the boundary. It is found that the associated a priori pressure estimate depends inversely on the volume of the band. Numerical experiments confirm these findings. Based on these results, guidelines are provided for applying vanishing pressure boundary conditions in model coupling and domain decomposition methods.</description>

      <title>Mixed Precision Block-Jacobi Preconditioner: Algorithms, Performance Evaluation and Feature Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose two mixed precision algorithms for Block-Jacobi preconditioner(BJAC): a fixed low precision strategy and an adaptive precision strategy. We evaluate the performance improvement of the proposed mixed precision BJAC preconditioners combined with the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm using problems including diffusion equations and radiation hydrodynamics equations. Numerical results show that, compared to the uniform high precision PCG algorithm, the mixed precision preconditioners can achieve speedups from 1.3 to 1.8 without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, we observe the phenomenon of convergence delay in some test cases for the mixed precision preconditioners, and further analyse the matrix features associate with the convergence delay behavior.</description>

      <title>A priori and a posteriori error estimates for discontinuous Galerkin time-discrete methods via maximal regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maximal regularity property of discontinuous Galerkin methods for linear parabolic equations is used together with variational techniques to establish a priori and a posteriori error estimates of optimal order under optimal regularity assumptions. The analysis is set in the maximal regularity framework of UMD Banach spaces. Similar results were proved in an earlier work, based on the consistency analysis of Radau IIA methods. The present error analysis, which is based on variational techniques, is of independent interest, but the main motivation is that it extends to nonlinear parabolic equations; in contrast to the earlier work. Both autonomous and nonautonomous linear equations are considered.</description>

      <title>A discontinuous Galerkin method for the three-dimensional heterodimer model with application to prion-like proteins' dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurocognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, have a wide social impact. These proteinopathies involve misfolded proteins accumulating into neurotoxic aggregates. Mathematical and computational models describing the prion-like dynamics offer an analytical basis to study the diseases' evolution and a computational framework for exploring potential therapies. This work focuses on the heterodimer model in a three-dimensional setting, a reactive-diffusive system of nonlinear partial differential equations describing the evolution of both healthy and misfolded proteins. We investigate traveling wave solutions and diffusion-driven instabilities as a mechanism of neurotoxic pattern formation. For the considered mathematical model, we propose a space discretization, relying on the Discontinuous Galerkin method on polytopal/polyhedral grids, allowing high-order accuracy and flexible handling of the complicated brain's geometry. Further, we present a priori error estimates for the semi-discrete formulation and we perform convergence tests to verify the theoretical results. Finally, we conduct simulations using realistic data on a three-dimensional brain mesh reconstructed from medical images.</description>

      <title>Early Recognition of Parkinson's Disease Through Acoustic Analysis and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that significantly impacts both motor and non-motor functions, including speech. Early and accurate recognition of PD through speech analysis can greatly enhance patient outcomes by enabling timely intervention. This paper provides a comprehensive review of methods for PD recognition using speech data, highlighting advances in machine learning and data-driven approaches. We discuss the process of data wrangling, including data collection, cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis, to prepare the dataset for machine learning applications. Various classification algorithms are explored, including logistic regression, SVM, and neural networks, with and without feature selection. Each method is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, and training time. Our findings indicate that specific acoustic features and advanced machine-learning techniques can effectively differentiate between individuals with PD and healthy controls. The study concludes with a comparison of the different models, identifying the most effective approaches for PD recognition, and suggesting potential directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Optimal parameter choice for regularized Shannon sampling formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fast reconstruction of a bandlimited function from its sample data is an essential problem in signal processing. In this paper, we consider the widely used Gaussian regularized Shannon sampling formula in comparison to regularized Shannon sampling formulas employing alternative window functions, including the modified Gaussian function, the sinh-type window function, and the continuous Kaiser-Bessel window function. It is shown that the approximation errors of these regularized Shannon sampling formulas possess an exponential decay with respect to the truncation parameter. The main focus of this paper is to identify the optimal variance of the (modified) Gaussian function as well as the optimal shape parameters of the sinh-type window function and the continuous Kaiser-Bessel window function, with the aim of achieving the fastest exponential decay of the approximation error. In doing so, we demonstrate that the decay rate of the sinh-type regularized Shannon sampling formula is considerably superior to that of the Gaussian regularized Shannon sampling formula. Additionally, numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A high-order numerical method is developed for solving the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations with the Flory-Huggins potential. The scheme is based on the $Q_k$ finite element with mass lumping on rectangular grids, the second-order convex splitting method, and the pressure correction method. The unique solvability, unconditional stability, and bound-preserving properties are rigorously established. The key to bound-preservation is the discrete $L^1$ estimate of the singular potential. Ample numerical experiments are performed to validate the desired properties of the proposed numerical scheme.</description>

      <title>Adaptive time-stepping for aggregation-shattering kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an experimental study of adaptive time-stepping methods for efficient modeling of the aggregation-fragmentation kinetics. Precise modeling of this phenomena usually requires utilization of the large systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations and intensive computations. We concentrate on performance of three explicit Runge-Kutta time-integration methods and provide simulations for two types of problems: finding of equilibrium solutions and simulations for kinetics with periodic solutions. The first class of problems may be analyzed through the relaxation of the solution to the stationary state after large time. In this case, the adaptive time-stepping may help to reach it using big steps reducing cost of the calculations without loss of accuracy. In the second case, the problem becomes numerically unstable at certain points of the phase space and may require tiny steps making the simulations very time-consuming. Adaptive criteria allows to increase the steps for most of points and speedup simulations significantly.</description>

      <title>Regenerative Ulam-von Neumann Algorithm: An Innovative Markov chain Monte Carlo Method for Matrix Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an extension of the classical Ulan-von Neumann Markov chain Monte-Carlo algorithm for the computation of the matrix inverse. The algorithm presented in this paper, termed as \emph{regenerative Ulam-von Neumann algorithm}, utilizes the regenerative structure of classical, non-truncated Neumann series defined by a non-singular matrix and produces an unbiased estimator of the matrix inverse. Furthermore, the accuracy of the proposed algorithm depends on a single parameter that controls the total number of Markov transitions simulated thus avoiding the challenge of balancing between the total number of Markov chain replications and its corresponding length as in the classical Ulam-von Neumann algorithm. To efficiently utilize the Markov chain transition samples in the calculation of the regenerative quantities, the proposed algorithm quantifies automatically the contribution of each Markov transition to all regenerative quantities by a carefully designed updating scheme that utilized three separate matrices containing the current weights, total weights, and regenerative cycle count, respectively. A probabilistic analysis of the performance of the algorithm, including the variance of the estimator, is provided. Finally, numerical experiments verify the qualitative effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuits for the heat equation with physical boundary conditions via Schrodingerisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the explicit design of quantum circuits for quantum simulation of partial differential equations (PDEs) with physical boundary conditions. These equations and/or their discretized forms usually do not evolve via unitary dynamics, thus are not suitable for quantum simulation. Boundary conditions (either time-dependent or independent) make the problem more difficult. To tackle this challenge, the Schrodingerisation method can be employed, which converts linear partial and ordinary differential equations with non-unitary dynamics into systems of Schrodinger-type equations, via the so-called warped phase transformation that maps the equation into one higher dimension. Despite advancements in Schrodingerisation techniques, the explicit implementation of quantum circuits for solving general PDEs, especially with physical boundary conditions, remains underdeveloped. We present two methods for handling the inhomogeneous terms arising from time-dependent physical boundary conditions. One approach utilizes Duhamel's principle to express the solution in integral form and employs linear combination of unitaries (LCU) for coherent state preparation. Another method applies an augmentation to transform the inhomogeneous problem into a homogeneous one. We then apply the quantum simulation technique from [CJL23] to transform the resulting non-autonomous system to an autonomous system in one higher dimension. We provide detailed implementations of these two methods and conduct a comprehensive complexity analysis in terms of queries to the time evolution input oracle.</description>

      <title>A new Representation of $\alpha$-Bernstein Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\alpha$-Bernstein operators were initially introduced in the paper by Chen, X., Tan, J., Liu, Z., Xie, J. (2017) titled "Approximation of Functions by a New Family of Generalized Bernstein Operators" (Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications, 450(1), 244-261). Since their introduction, these operators have served as a source of inspiration for numerous research endeavors. In this study, we propose a novel technique, founded on a recursive relation, for constructing Bernstein-like bases. A special case of this new representation yields a novel portrayal of Chen's operators. This innovative representation enables the discovery of additional properties of $\alpha$-Bernstein operators and facilitates alternative and more straightforward proofs for certain theorems.</description>

      <title>Optimal experimental design: Formulations and computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Questions of `how best to acquire data' are essential to modeling and prediction in the natural and social sciences, engineering applications, and beyond. Optimal experimental design (OED) formalizes these questions and creates computational methods to answer them. This article presents a systematic survey of modern OED, from its foundations in classical design theory to current research involving OED for complex models. We begin by reviewing criteria used to formulate an OED problem and thus to encode the goal of performing an experiment. We emphasize the flexibility of the Bayesian and decision-theoretic approach, which encompasses information-based criteria that are well-suited to nonlinear and non-Gaussian statistical models. We then discuss methods for estimating or bounding the values of these design criteria; this endeavor can be quite challenging due to strong nonlinearities, high parameter dimension, large per-sample costs, or settings where the model is implicit. A complementary set of computational issues involves optimization methods used to find a design; we discuss such methods in the discrete (combinatorial) setting of observation selection and in settings where an exact design can be continuously parameterized. Finally we present emerging methods for sequential OED that build non-myopic design policies, rather than explicit designs; these methods naturally adapt to the outcomes of past experiments in proposing new experiments, while seeking coordination among all experiments to be performed. Throughout, we highlight important open questions and challenges.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic properties for a general class of Szasz-Mirakjan-Durrmeyer operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a general family of Sz\'asz--Mirakjan--Durrmeyer type operators depending on an integer parameter $j \in \mathbb{Z}$. They can be viewed as a generalization of the Sz\'asz--Mirakjan--Durrmeyer operators [9], Phillips operators [11] and corresponding Kantorovich modifications of higher order.
  For $j\in {\mathbb{N}}$, these operators possess the exceptional property to preserve constants and the monomial $x^{j}$. It turns out, that an extension of this family covers certain well-known operators studied before, so that the outcoming results could be unified.
  We present the complete asymptotic expansion for the sequence of these operators. All its coefficients are given in a concise form. In order to prove the expansions for the class of locally integrable functions of exponential growth on the positive half-axis, we derive a localization result which is interesting in itself.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.04709v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a Keller-Segel model for chemotaxis in two spatial dimensions we consider a modification of a positivity preserving fully discrete scheme using a local extremum diminishing flux limiter. We discretize space using piecewise linear finite elements on an quasiuniform triangulation of acute type and time by the backward Euler method. We assume that initial data are sufficiently small in order not to have a blow-up of the solution. Under appropriate assumptions on the regularity of the exact solution and the time step parameter we show existence of the fully discrete approximation and derive error bounds in $L^2$ for the cell density and $H^1$ for the chemical concentration. We also present numerical experiments to illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Iterative solution to the biharmonic equation in mixed form discretized by the Hybrid High-Order method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10748v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the solution to the biharmonic equation in mixed form discretized by the Hybrid High-Order (HHO) methods. The two resulting second-order elliptic problems can be decoupled via the introduction of a new unknown, corresponding to the boundary value of the solution of the first Laplacian problem. This technique yields a global linear problem that can be solved iteratively via a Krylov-type method. More precisely, at each iteration of the scheme, two second-order elliptic problems have to be solved, and a normal derivative on the boundary has to be computed. In this work, we specialize this scheme for the HHO discretization. To this aim, an explicit technique to compute the discrete normal derivative of an HHO solution of a Laplacian problem is proposed. Moreover, we show that the resulting discrete scheme is well-posed. Finally, a new preconditioner is designed to speed up the convergence of the Krylov method. Numerical experiments assessing the performance of the proposed iterative algorithm on both two- and three-dimensional test cases are presented.</description>

      <title>First-order greedy invariant-domain preserving approximation for hyperbolic problems: scalar conservation laws, and p-system</title>

Abstract: The paper focuses on first-order invariant-domain preserving approximations of hyperbolic systems. We propose a new way to estimate the artificial viscosity that has to be added to make explicit, conservative, consistent numerical methods invariant-domain preserving and entropy inequality compliant. Instead of computing an upper bound on the maximum wave speed in Riemann problems, we estimate a minimum wave speed in the said Riemann problems such that the approximation satisfies predefined invariant-domain properties and predefined entropy inequalities. This technique eliminates non-essential fast waves from the construction of the artificial viscosity, while preserving pre-assigned invariant-domain properties and entropy inequalities.</description>

      <title>Generalized Optimal AMG Convergence Theory for Nonsymmetric and Indefinite Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algebraic multigrid (AMG) is known to be an effective solver for many sparse symmetric positive definite (SPD) linear systems. For SPD systems, the convergence theory of AMG is well-understood in terms of the $A$-norm, but in a nonsymmetric setting, such an energy norm is non-existent. For this reason, convergence of AMG for nonsymmetric systems of equations remains an open area of research. A particular aspect missing from theory of nonsymmetric and indefinite AMG is the incorporation of general relaxation schemes. In the SPD setting, the classical form of optimal AMG interpolation provides a useful insight in determining the best possible two-grid convergence rate of a method based on an arbitrary symmetrized relaxation scheme. In this work, we discuss a generalization of the optimal AMG convergence theory targeting nonsymmetric problems, using a certain matrix-induced orthogonality of the left and right eigenvectors of a generalized eigenvalue problem relating the system matrix and relaxation operator. We show that using this generalization of the optimal convergence theory, one can obtain a measure of the spectral radius of the two grid error transfer operator that is mathematically equivalent to the derivation in the SPD setting for optimal interpolation, which instead uses norms. In addition, this generalization of the optimal AMG convergence theory can be further extended for symmetric indefinite problems, such as those arising from saddle point systems so that one can obtain a precise convergence rate of the resulting two-grid method based on optimal interpolation. We provide supporting numerical examples of the convergence theory for nonsymmetric advection-diffusion problems, two-dimensional Dirac equation motivated by $\gamma_5$-symmetry, and the mixed Darcy flow problem corresponding to a saddle point system.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we consider a fully dynamic Biot model that includes memory effects due to evolving permeability. Time integrals are used to account for the change in structure. We propose an iterative splitting scheme for this model, extending the fixed-stress split for the quasi-static Biot. We use finite elements in space and a backward Euler discretization in time. The performance of the method is demonstrated through a numerical experiment</description>

      <title>Representations of the symmetric group are decomposable in polynomial time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an algorithm to decompose orthogonal matrix representations of the symmetric group over the reals into irreducible representations, which as a by-product also computes the multiplicities of the irreducible representations. The algorithm applied to a $d$-dimensional representation of $S_n$ is shown to have a complexity of $O(n^2 d^3)$ operations for determining which irreducible representations are present and their corresponding multiplicities and a further $O(n d^4)$ operations to fully decompose representations with non-trivial multiplicities. These complexity bounds are pessimistic and in a practical implementation using floating point arithmetic and exploiting sparsity we observe better complexity. We demonstrate this algorithm on the problem of computing multiplicities of two tensor products of irreducible representations (the Kronecker coefficients problem) as well as higher order tensor products. For hook and hook-like irreducible representations the algorithm has polynomial complexity as $n$ increases. We also demonstrate an application to constructing a basis of multivariate orthogonal polynomials with respect to a tensor product weight so that applying a permutation of variables induces an irreducible representation.</description>

      <title>Restarts subject to approximate sharpness: A parameter-free and optimal scheme for first-order methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sharpness is an almost generic assumption in continuous optimization that bounds the distance from minima by objective function suboptimality. It facilitates the acceleration of first-order methods through restarts. However, sharpness involves problem-specific constants that are typically unknown, and restart schemes typically reduce convergence rates. Moreover, these schemes are challenging to apply in the presence of noise or with approximate model classes (e.g., in compressive imaging or learning problems), and they generally assume that the first-order method used produces feasible iterates. We consider the assumption of approximate sharpness, a generalization of sharpness that incorporates an unknown constant perturbation to the objective function error. This constant offers greater robustness (e.g., with respect to noise or relaxation of model classes) for finding approximate minimizers. By employing a new type of search over the unknown constants, we design a restart scheme that applies to general first-order methods and does not require the first-order method to produce feasible iterates. Our scheme maintains the same convergence rate as when the constants are known. The convergence rates we achieve for various first-order methods match the optimal rates or improve on previously established rates for a wide range of problems. We showcase our restart scheme in several examples and highlight potential future applications and developments of our framework and theory.</description>

      <title>Sharp Convergence Rates for Matching Pursuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fundamental limits of matching pursuit, or the pure greedy algorithm, for approximating a target function $ f $ by a linear combination $f_n$ of $n$ elements from a dictionary. When the target function is contained in the variation space corresponding to the dictionary, many impressive works over the past few decades have obtained upper and lower bounds on the error $\|f-f_n\|$ of matching pursuit, but they do not match. The main contribution of this paper is to close this gap and obtain a sharp characterization of the decay rate, $n^{-\alpha}$, of matching pursuit. Specifically, we construct a worst case dictionary which shows that the existing best upper bound cannot be significantly improved. It turns out that, unlike other greedy algorithm variants which converge at the optimal rate $ n^{-1/2}$, the convergence rate $n^{-\alpha}$ is suboptimal. Here, $\alpha \approx 0.182$ is determined by the solution to a certain non-linear equation.</description>

      <title>Nearly self-similar blowup of generalized axisymmetric Navier-Stokes and Boussinesq equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform numerical investigation of nearly self-similar blowup of generalized axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations and Boussinesq system with a time-dependent fractional dimension. The dynamic change of the space dimension is proportional to the ratio R(t)/Z(t), where (R(t),Z(t)) is the position at which the maximum vorticity achieves its global maximum. This choice of space dimension is to ensure that the advection along the r-direction has the same scaling as that along the z-direction, thus preventing formation of two-scale solution structure. For the generalized axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations with solution dependent viscosity, we show that the solution develops a self-similar blowup with dimension equal to 3.188 and the self-similar profile satisfies the axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations with constant viscosity. We also study the nearly self-similar blowup of the axisymmetric Boussinesq system with constant viscosity. The generalized axisymmetric Boussinesq system preserves almost all the known properties of the 3D Navier-Stokes equations except for the conservation of angular momentum. We present convincing numerical evidence that the generalized axisymmetric Boussinesq system develops a stable nearly self-similar blowup solution with maximum vorticity increased by O(10^{30}).</description>
