      <title>Detection of Temporal Variability in U.S. Climate Using Harmonic and Wavelet Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates temporal variability in U.S. climate using harmonic decomposition techniques, specifically Fourier and wavelet transforms. Monthly temperature, precipitation, and drought index data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) U.S. Climate Divisional Dataset (nClimDiv, 1895--2024) were analyzed to detect periodic structures and their evolution over time. By comparing harmonic-based models with linear regression trends, this research evaluates the explanatory power of cyclic components in reproducing and predicting observed variability. Results show that U.S. climate records exhibit dominant periodicities near one year (seasonal) and 2--7 years (associated with the El Nino--Southern Oscillation, ENSO), and that incorporating harmonic terms significantly improves model performance across most states and variables. The findings indicate that U.S. climate fluctuations are characterized by quasi-stationary oscillations rather than purely monotonic trends. Overall, the main implication is that frequency-aware models provide measurably better predictive skill than trend-only approaches and should be incorporated into seasonal outlooks, drought monitoring, and resource planning.</description>

      <title>Resolving Thermospheric Vertical Wind Ambiguities and Energy Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study applies a generalized vertical coordinate system approach alongside thermodynamic control volume analysis to explore the nuanced interpretations of energy transfer processes associated with vertical motion in the thermosphere. Using simulations from the TIEGCM V3.0 model, a key finding reveals that transforming vertical winds in height coordinates onto constant pressure surfaces contain a substantial lifting component; an aspect often overlooked in previous research. This distinction is critical for internal energy assessments, as vertical winds defined in pressure coordinates directly contribute to the adiabatic heating or cooling rates while only a portion of the vertical wind in height coordinates contributes to these energy changes. These differences are demonstrated through schematic representations of thermodynamic control volumes that model a column of thermospheric gas undergoing various energy transfer processes. Accurately determining the portion of observed vertical winds that affect internal energy requires clear understanding between height and pressure surfaces; a nontrivial challenge in observational contexts. Furthermore, applying the generalized vertical coordinate framework to airglow emissions in the upper thermosphere uncovers an inherent ambiguity: vertical winds inferred from airglow observations may not align with those defined on pressure or altitude surfaces. This insight suggests that discrepancies in the behavior and magnitude of vertical winds derived from FPI observations of red-line emissions in the upper thermosphere are due to poorly known relations between the emission structure relative to pressure or height surfaces.</description>

      <title>A high-resolution prediction dataset for solar energy across China (2015-2060)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A high spatiotemporal resolution and accurate middle-to-long-term prediction data is essential to support China's dual-carbon targets under global warming scenarios. In this study, we simulated hourly solar radiation at a 10 km* 10 km resolution in January, April, July, and October at five-year intervals from 2015 to 2060 across China using the WRF-Chem model driven by bias-corrected CMIP datasets and future emission inventories. We further calculated the monthly photovoltaic power potentials based on an improved assessment model. Results indicate that the WRF-Chem model can reproduce the spatiotemporal evolution of solar radiation with small simulation errors. GHI in 2030 and 2060 over China are characterized by a pronounced west-to-east gradient. The interannual fluctuations of GHI from 2015 to 2060 over China's major PV power generation bases are small, and the interannual variability of GHI is mainly dominated by TCC and the influence of AOD is limited. National averaged PV power generation in China shows a significant growth trend and increases from 68.7 TWh in 2015 to 129.7 TWh in 2060, which is approximately twice the 2015 value. The dataset will provide an important scientific basis for renewable energy planning and grid security under China's dual-carbon strategy.</description>

      <title>Acoustic pulse propagation in a non-ideal shallow-water model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study develops a theoretical framework for modeling acoustic pulse propagation in a non-ideal shallow-water waveguide. We derive an {\epsilon}-pseudodifferential operator ({\epsilon}-PDO) formulation from the general three-dimensional wave equation, that accounts for vertical stratification, bottom interaction, and slow horizontal inhomogeneity. Using the operator separation of variables method and the WKB-ansatz, we obtain single-mode equations describing the evolution of amplitude and phase along rays. The approach incorporates non-self-adjoint operators to model energy leakage through the bottom and introduces a Hamiltonian formalism for eikonal and transport equations, enabling the computation of amplitude, time, and phase fronts. Analytical and numerical examples are provided for different boundary conditions, including Neumann (ideal), self-adjoint, and partially reflecting interfaces. The results extend previous semiclassical and ray-based theories of wave propagation by including dissipative effects and improving the physical realism of shallow-water acoustic modeling.</description>

      <title>Generative AI models capture realistic sea-ice evolution from days to decades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sea ice plays an important role in stabilising the Earth system. Yet, representing its dynamics remains a major challenge for models, as the underlying processes are scale-invariant and highly anisotropic. This poses a dilemma: physics-based models that faithfully reproduce the observed dynamics are computationally costly, while efficient AI models sacrifice realism. Here, to resolve this dilemma, we introduce GenSIM, the first generative AI model to predict the evolution of the full Arctic sea-ice state at 12-hour increments. Trained for sub-daily forecasting on 20 years of sea-ice-ocean simulation data, GenSIM makes realistic predictions for 30 years, while reproducing the dynamical properties of sea ice with its leads and ridges and capturing long-term trends in the sea-ice volume. Notably, although solely driven by atmospheric reanalysis, GenSIM implicitly learns hidden signatures of multi-year ice-ocean interaction. Therefore, generative AI can extrapolate from sub-daily forecasts to decadal simulations, while retaining physical consistency.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Constrained Neural Differential Equation Framework for Data-Driven Snowpack Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06819v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a physics-constrained neural differential equation framework for parameterization, and employs it to model the time evolution of seasonal snow depth given hydrometeorological forcings. When trained on data from multiple SNOTEL sites, the parameterization predicts daily snow depth with under 9% median error and Nash Sutcliffe Efficiencies over 0.94 across a wide variety of snow climates. The parameterization also generalizes to new sites not seen during training, which is not often true for calibrated snow models. Requiring the parameterization to predict snow water equivalent in addition to snow depth only increases error to ~12%. The structure of the approach guarantees the satisfaction of physical constraints, enables these constraints during model training, and allows modeling at different temporal resolutions without additional retraining of the parameterization. These benefits hold potential in climate modeling, and could extend to other dynamical systems with physical constraints.</description>

      <title>Probing forced responses and causality in data-driven climate emulators: conceptual limitations and the role of reduced-order models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22552v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central challenge in climate science and applied mathematics is developing data-driven models of multiscale systems that capture both stationary statistics and responses to external perturbations. Current neural climate emulators aim to resolve the atmosphere-ocean system in all its complexity but often struggle to reproduce forced responses, limiting their use in causal studies such as Green's function experiments. To investigate the origin of these limitations, we first examine a simplified dynamical system that retains key features of climate variability. We interpret the results through linear response theory, providing a rigorous framework to evaluate neural models beyond stationary statistics and probe causal mechanisms. We argue that the ability of multiscale systems' emulators to reproduce perturbed statistics depends critically on (i) identifying an appropriate coarse-grained representation and (ii) careful parameterizations of unresolved processes. For low-frequency climate dynamics, these insights highlight reduced-order models, tailored to specific processes and scales, as valuable alternatives to general-purpose emulators. We next consider a real-world application, developing a neural model to investigate the joint variability of the surface temperature field and radiative fluxes. The model infers a multiplicative noise process directly from data, largely reproduces the system's probability distribution, and enables causal studies through forced responses. We discuss its limitations and outline directions for future work. These results expose key challenges in data-driven modeling of multiscale physical systems and underscore the value of coarse-grained, stochastic approaches, with response theory as a principled framework to guide model design.</description>
