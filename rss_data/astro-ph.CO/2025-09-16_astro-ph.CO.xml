      <title>Gravitational Recoil and Suppression of Super Massive Black Hole Seeds in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of gravitational-wave (GW) recoil on the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early Universe. Forming ~10^9 Msun SMBHs by z ~ 6 is challenging and may require hierarchical mergers of smaller seed black holes. We extend a semi-analytic seed model (Sassano et al. 2021) by explicitly incorporating GW recoil physics. Our model includes: (1) recoil velocity formulae calibrated to numerical relativity for spinning, unequal-mass BH binaries (Campanelli et al. 2007; Lousto et al. 2012); (2) assignment of spin magnitudes and orientations based on seed type (Pop III remnant, stellar cluster, or direct-collapse); and (3) a retention probability scheme comparing the recoil speed to the host halo escape velocity. We find that including GW recoil reduces final SMBH masses by ~20-30% by z = 6 and creates a population of off-nuclear ("wandering") BHs amounting to a few percent of the total. Observable consequences include spatial offsets ~0.1 arcsec and line-of-sight velocity shifts ~10^2-10^3 km/s in a few percent of high-z quasars.

      <title>CMB component-separated power spectrum estimation by Spectral Internal Linear Combination (SpILC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Component separation methods mitigate the cross-contamination between different extragalactic and galactic contributions to cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. This is often done by linearly combining CMB maps from different frequency channels using internal linear combination (ILC) methods. We demonstrate that deriving power spectrum estimators directly by linearly combining auto- and cross-spectra instead of maps allows us to obtain a different constrained-optimization problem that allows fewer (deprojection) constraint equations than combining at map level using the constrained ILC method. Through simulations, we show that our Spectral internal linear combination (SpILC) produces CMB power spectrum estimators with more than 7 times smaller errorbars than constrained ILC (with thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and cosmic infrared background deprojections) at $\ell\gtrsim 4000$ for Simons Observatory-like observations. Spectral ILC outperforms constrained ILC methods when some modeled components are spatially uncorrelated, e.g. the primary CMB is uncorrelated with foregrounds, and the difference in performance is most significant at noise-dominated scales. More generally, our work shows that component-separated maps with foreground deprojections do not necessarily produce minimum-variance two-or-higher-point estimators.</description>

      <title>Bias in the tensor-to-scalar ratio from self-interacting dark radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological imprint of self-interacting dark radiation (DR) on the primordial $B$-mode angular power spectrum and its impact on the estimation of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We consider a minimal model in which DR is described as an effectively massless axion-like particle with quartic self-interactions. These interactions are incorporated into the Einstein-Boltzmann equations using the relaxation time approximation and implemented in the $\texttt{CLASS}$ code. We show that increasing the strength of DR self-interactions suppresses anisotropic stress, thereby reducing the damping of gravitational waves and leading to an enhancement of the primordial $B$-mode signal relative to the free-streaming case. Using mock CMB data and Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses, we show that neglecting DR self-interactions may bias the inferred value of $r$ by an amount comparable to the uncertainty expected in forthcoming CMB polarization experiments, such as the ground-based $\textit{Simons Observatory}$ and the satellite missions $\textit{LiteBIRD}$ and PICO. Our results emphasize the importance of properly modeling DR interactions in future precision searches for primordial $B$-modes in order to obtain unbiased constraints on inflationary gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Measuring neutrino masses with joint JWST and DESI DR2 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early JWST observations reveal an unexpectedly abundant population of high-redshift candidate massive galaxies at $z \gtrsim 7$, and recent DESI measurements show a preference for dynamical dark energy, which together present a significant challenge to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In this work, we jointly analyze high-redshift galaxy data from JWST, baryon acoustic oscillations data from DESI DR2, and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and ACT, measuring the total neutrino mass $\sum m_{\nu}$. We consider three dark energy models ($\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_0w_a$CDM) and three mass hierarchies. Our results indicate that in the $w_0w_a$CDM model, adding JWST data to CMB+DESI tightens the upper limit of $\sum m_{\nu}$ by about $5.8\%-10.2\%$, and we obtain $\sum m_{\nu} &lt; 0.167~\mathrm{eV}$ ($2\sigma$) in the normal hierarchy (NH) case. Furthermore, JWST also offers indicative lower limits on star formation efficiency parameter of $f_{*,10} \gtrsim 0.146-0.161$. Bayesian evidence weakly favors the $w_0w_a$CDM+$\sum m_{\nu}$(NH) model relative to the $\Lambda$CDM+$\sum m_{\nu}$(NH) model using CMB+DESI+JWST data. These results suggest that the joint analysis of high-redshift JWST data and low-redshift DESI data provides compelling constraints on neutrino mass and merits further investigation.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and The Signatures of Cosmic Non-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) provide a unique probe of the small-scale primordial Universe and may constitute a fraction of the dark matter. Their formation is highly sensitive to non-Gaussian features in the primordial curvature perturbation $\zeta$. In this work we investigate PBH production in the curvaton scenario, where the decay of a late-time light scalar field imprints large, inherently non-Gaussian fluctuations on small scales. Using the exact non-linear mapping between the Gaussian curvaton field perturbations and $\zeta$, we compute the full non-perturbative probability distribution functions of $\zeta$ and derive the PBH formation fraction $\beta$ without relying on a truncated non-Gaussian expansion. We show that the enhanced tail of the distribution dramatically amplifies PBH production, leading to an exponential sensitivity of $\beta$ to the curvaton decay fraction $\Omega_{\chi,\rm dec}$. By modeling the scale dependence of curvaton fluctuations with a lognormal profile, we obtain realistic, extended PBH mass spectra rather than monochromatic peaks. We further highlight the associated stochastic gravitational-wave background induced at second order, whose peak frequency correlates directly with the PBH mass scale. Our results demonstrate that the curvaton scenario naturally produces a rich phenomenology of PBHs and gravitational waves, sharply distinct from Gaussian single-field inflation models, and provide a framework for connecting small-scale non-Gaussian physics to upcoming gravitational-wave and PBH observations.</description>

      <title>The Signature of Sub-galactic Dark Matter Clumping in the Global 21-cm Signal of Hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is thought that the Universe went through an early period known as the Dark Ages, during which primeval density fluctuations grew to form the first luminous objects, marking the beginning of Cosmic Dawn around 100 million years after the Big Bang. The 21-cm line of hydrogen atoms is the most promising probe of these epochs, with extensive observational efforts underway. We combine hydrodynamical simulations with a large-scale grid in order to precisely calculate the effect of non-linear structure formation on the global (sky-averaged) 21-cm radio intensity. We show that it presents a potential opportunity to probe the properties of dark matter in a new regime, corresponding to a length-scale of only 150,000 light years and a mass-scale of 20 million Solar masses. This effect can in principle be detected unambiguously during the Dark Ages, where the weak signal requires an array of global signal antennae. During Cosmic Dawn, when stellar radiation boosts the signal, a single global antenna suffices, but the clumping effect must then be separated from the effect of the stars. Our findings open new avenues for testing the nature of dark matter as well as non-standard cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Dust Attenuation of Lyman-Werner Feedback: Reassessing Early Super Massive Black Holes Seed Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of dust shielding on Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation fields and its implications for supermassive black hole (SMBH) seed formation at high redshift. Using an updated version of the GAMETE/QSOdust semi-analytical model, we implement a simple dust shielding prescription that accounts for the absorption of LW photons by dust grains. We find that even modest dust enrichment can significantly reduce the effective LW radiation field, allowing H2 cooling to persist in regions previously thought to be affected by LW feedback. This changes the conditions for seed formation, particularly for heavy seeds which require suppression of H2 cooling. Our results suggest that dust shielding extends the redshift range and volume where heavy seeds can form, and significantly alters the relative importance of different seed populations. We discuss the implications for the formation of high-redshift SMBHs and future observations.</description>

      <title>A Dark Matter Model with Quadratic Equation of State: Background Evolution and Structure Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that dark matter (DM) possesses a quadratic equation of state, which becomes significant at high densities, altering the Universe's evolution during its early stages. We derive the modified background evolution equations for the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and the DM density parameter $\Omega_{\text{dm}}(z)$. We then perturb the governing equations to study the linear growth of matter fluctuations, computing the observable growth factor $f\sigma_8(z)$. Finally, we compare the model with the latest cosmological data, including Hubble parameter $H(z)$ measurements, and growth factor $f\sigma_8(z)$ data, up to $z=3$. Our results indicate that the quadratic model, while remaining consistent with background observations, offers a distinct imprint on the growth of structure, providing not only a new phenomenological avenue to address cosmological tensions but also shedding light on the nature of DM.</description>

      <title>Probing small-scale dark matter clumping with the large-scale 21-cm power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 21-cm line of hydrogen is the most promising probe of the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn. We combine hydrodynamical simulations with a large-scale grid in order to calculate the effect of non-linear structure formation on the large-scale 21-cm power spectrum, focusing on redshifts $z=20-40$. As the clumping effect arises from small-scale density fluctuations, it offers a unique opportunity to probe the standard cold dark matter model in a new regime and thus potentially investigate the properties of dark matter. To this end, we also study a warm dark matter $-$ like model with a Gaussian cutoff on a scale of 50 kpc. We find that clumping has a significant impact on the large-scale 21-cm power spectrum. For example, for the Dark Ages case at $z=30$ and wavenumber $k=0.05$ Mpc$^{-1}$, small-scale clustering enhances the 21-cm power spectrum by $13\%$. Once Lyman-$\alpha$ coupling kicks in due to the first stars, the 21-cm signal strengthens, and the effect of clumping grows; it suppresses the observable power spectrum at $z=20$ by a factor of two, while the cutoff model has less than half the clumping impact. The clumping effect is significantly higher than the sensitivity of the planned Square Kilometre Array (SKA) AA$^\star$ configuration, by up to a factor of 20 for standard cold dark matter, though detection will require separation from foregrounds and from astrophysical contributions to the 21-cm power spectrum.</description>

      <title>Analytic Model for Scattered Ly$\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ Emission in the Post-reionization Intergalactic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ly$\alpha$ intensity mapping is emerging as a new probe of faint galaxies consisting the cosmic web that elude traditional surveys. However, the resonant nature of Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer complicates the interpretation of observed data. In this study, we develop a fast and accurate analytic prescription for computing the Ly$\alpha$ intensity field on Mpc scales in the post-reionization Universe. Motivated by insights from Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) experiments, we exploit the fact that in a highly ionized intergalactic medium (IGM) with negligible damping-wing opacity, cosmological redshifting quickly drives Ly$\alpha$ photons out of resonance, terminating the scattering process and simplifying their large-scale behavior. Photons emitted blueward of the Ly$\alpha$ line center tend to scatter on a thin, nearly spherical surface of last scattering, with a radius determined by the redshifting distance to resonance. Based on this behavior, we derive closed-form expressions for the scattered emissivity and projected surface brightness that depend only on the source spectrum, the HI density, and the peculiar velocity field. When applied to a source in a realistically simulated IGM at $z = 3$, our model shows mild discrepancies with MCRT results within a physical Mpc of the host halo, where strong gravitational infall redistributes the scattered photons, but achieves better than 5% accuracy beyond that distance in both raw and cumulative surface brightness. Our prescription offers a computationally efficient alternative to MCRT for forward-modeling Ly$\alpha$ intensity maps from cosmological simulations, enabling the inference of underlying cosmological and astrophysical parameters from future observations.</description>

      <title>Tracing correlations between galaxy properties across the Cosmic Web: An IllustrisTNG-based study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the impact of cosmic web environments on galaxy properties such as $(u-r)\,$colour, stellar mass, star formation rate, and stellar metallicity, using a stellar mass-matched sample of simulated galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulation. We use Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) to quantify correlations among galaxy properties and apply Student's t-test to assess the statistical significance of their differences across cosmic web environments. In every case, the null hypothesis is rejected at $&gt; 99.99\%$ confidence, providing strong evidence that correlations among galaxy properties are strongly dependent on cosmic web environments.</description>

      <title>The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey $J$-Band Follow-Up Observations for Selected High-Redshift Galaxy Cluster Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We select galaxy cluster candidates from the high-redshift (BEST_Z &gt; 0.9) end of the first SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) galaxy cluster catalogue, for which we obtain moderately deep J-band imaging data with the OMEGA2000 camera at the 3.5m telescope of the Calar Alto Observatory. We include J-band data of four additional targets obtained with the three-channel camera at the 2m Fraunhofer telescope at the Wendelstein Observatory. We complement the new J-band photometric catalogue with forced photometry in the i- and z-bands of the tenth data release of the Legacy Survey (LSDR10) to derive the radial colour distribution around the eRASS1 clusters. Without assuming a priori to find a cluster red sequence at a specific colour, we try to find a radially weighted colour over-density to confirm the presence of high-redshift optical counterparts for the X-ray emission. We compare our confirmation with optical properties derived in earlier works based on LSDR10 data to refine the existing high-redshift cluster confirmation of eROSITA-selected clusters. We attempt to calibrate the colour-redshift-relation including the new J-band data by comparing our obtained photometric redshift estimate with the spectroscopic redshift of a confirmed, optically selected, high-redshift galaxy cluster. We confirm 9 out of 18 of the selected galaxy cluster candidates with a radial over-density of similar coloured galaxies for which we provide a photometric redshift estimate. We can report an increase in the relative colour measurement precision from 8% to 4% when including J-band data. In conclusion, our findings indicate a not insignificant spurious contaminant fraction at the high-redshift end (BEST_Z &gt; 0.9) of the eROSITA/eRASS1 galaxy cluster catalogue, as well as it underlines the necessity for wide and deep near infrared imaging data for confirmation and characterisation of high-$z$ galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Precise Measurement of the Absolute Sky Brightness at 60 to 350 MHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise measurement of the sky radio brightness below 1 GHz and estimation of any unaccounted-for extragalactic brightness is required to understand the Galactic cosmic ray electron spectrum, to constrain populations of nanojansky radio sources, and to constrain dark matter annihilation or decay. The foreground radio brightness must also be accurately accounted for when measuring the cosmic background radiation and departures from its Planck spectrum that trace astrophysical processes in the early Universe, cosmic dark ages, cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionisation. Here we report a new, precision measurement of the sky spectral brightness over radio frequencies from 60 MHz to 350 MHz. Our measurement motivates a significant correction to previous all-sky images made in this band and the Global Sky Model (GSM) that is constructed from these and other sky images made at radio wavelengths. We find that the GSM requires subtraction of an offset exceeding 100K below 100 MHz and scaling up by a factor of approximately 1.2 below 200 MHz rising to a factor of 1.5 at 350 MHz, thus significantly enhancing previous estimates of unaccounted excess in radio sky brightness. Our measurements were made with a new receiver architecture that dynamically self-calibrates for receiver noise and bandpass in situ, while connected to an antenna. We used a single, accurately modelled, wideband logperiodic antenna placed on a 40m diameter ground mesh. Our accurate measurement requires upward revision of sky brightness and motivates revisiting models for source populations and dark matter decay. Additionally, sky models scaled to our measurements serve as a stable reference in calibrating the absolute flux density scale for low-frequency radio telescopes. This will be important for calibration accuracy of the SKA-Low telescope, that will operate at the frequencies of our measurements.</description>

      <title>Testing CCC+TL Cosmology with Galaxy Rotation Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to explore whether astrophysical observations, primarily galaxy rotation curves, result from covarying coupling constants (CCC) rather than from dark matter. We have shown in earlier papers that cosmological observations, such as supernovae type 1a (Pantheon+), the small size of galaxies at cosmic dawn, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), the sound horizon in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and time dilation effect, can be easily accounted for without requiring dark energy and dark matter when coupling constants are permitted to evolve in an expanding Universe, as predicted by Dirac, and the redshift is considered jointly due to the Universe's expansion and Zwicky's tired light (TL) effect. Here, we show that the CCC parameter {\alpha} is responsible for generating the illusion of dark matter and dark energy, which we call {\alpha}-matter and {\alpha}-energy, and is influenced by the baryonic matter density distribution. While cosmologically {\alpha} is a constant determined for the homogenous and isotropic Universe, e.g., by fitting Pantheon+ data, it can vary locally due to the extreme anisotropy of the matter distribution. Thus, in high baryonic density regions, one expects {\alpha}-matter and {\alpha}-energy densities to be relatively low and vice versa. We present its application to a few galaxy rotation curves from the SPARC database and find the results promising.</description>

      <title>Testing $n_s=1$ in light of the latest ACT and SPT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is commonly recognized that the primordial scalar spectral index $n_s$ is approximately $0.96-0.975$, depending on the dataset. However, this view is being completely altered by the early dark energy (EDE) resolutions of the Hubble tension, known as the most prominent tension the standard $\Lambda$CDM model is suffering from. In corresponding models with pre-recombination EDE, resolving the Hubble tension (i.e., achieving $H_0\sim 73$km/s/Mpc) must be accompanied by a shift of $n_s$ towards unity to maintain consistency with the cosmological data, which thus implies a scale invariant Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum with $n_s=1$ $(|n_s-1|\simeq {\cal O}(0.001))$. In this work, we strengthen and reconfirm this result with the latest ground-based CMB data from ACT DR6 and SPT-3G D1, the precise measurements at high multipoles beyond the Planck angular resolution and sensitivity. Our work again highlights the importance of re-examining our understanding on the very early Universe within the broader context of cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>STRAWBERRY: Finding haloes in the gravitational potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we present a novel algorithm that discriminates between bound and unbound particles by consideration of the gravitational potential from an accelerated reference frame -- also referred to as `the boosted potential'. Particles are considered bound if their energy does not exceed the escape energy of a potential well -- given by the closest saddle-point that connects to a deeper potential minimum. This approach has core benefits over previous approaches, since it does not require any ad-hoc thresholds (such as over-density criteria), it includes the gravitational effect of all particles in the binding criterion (improving over widely used self-potential binding checks) and it only operates with instantaneous information (making it simpler than approaches based on dynamical histories). We show that particles typically become bound between their first peri- and apo-centeric passage and that bound and unbound populations show very distinct characteristics through their distribution in phase space, their density profiles, their virial ratios, and their redshift evolution. Our findings suggest that it is possible to understand haloes as two-component systems, with one component being bound, virialized, of finite extent and evolving slowly in quasi-equilibrium and the other component being unbound, unvirialized and evolving rapidly.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Signatures of Axion Dark Matter via Parity-Violating Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate axion-like particles coupled to gravity through a parity-violating Chern-Simons (CS) interaction. In this framework, axion dark matter (DM) can decay into pairs of circularly polarized gravitons, producing a persistent, nearly monochromatic GW signal. We compute the expected signal at Earth assuming a Navarro-Frenk-White Galactic halo model with the corresponding velocity distribution, and compare it with the narrowband sensitivities of the LIGO O4 run and the projected reach of the Einstein Telescope. The resulting bounds on the axion-graviton coupling $\alpha$ improve upon the cosmological stability requirement for axion masses $m_\phi \lesssim 10^{-11}$ eV, excluding values up to four orders of magnitude below the stability limit. This constitutes a robust direct terrestrial constraint on the axion-gravity CS coupling. We also discuss distinctive observational signatures, such as circular polarization asymmetries, annual modulation, and potential enhancements from DM substructures, which could serve as smoking-gun evidence for parity-violating gravitational interactions.</description>

      <title>A Short Introduction to Cosmology and its Current Status</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current cosmological model, known as the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter model (or $\Lambda$CDM for short) is one of the most astonishing accomplishments of contemporary theoretical physics. It is a well-defined mathematical model which depends on very few ingredients and parameters and is able to make a range of predictions and postdictions with astonishing accuracy. It is built out of well-known physics - general relativity, quantum mechanics and atomic physics, statistical mechanics and thermodynamics - and predicts the existence of new, unseen components. Again and again it has been shown to fit new data sets with remarkable precision. Despite these successes, we have yet to understand the unseen components of the Universe and there has been evidence for inconsistencies in the model. In these lectures, we lay the foundations of modern cosmology.</description>

      <title>Deriving accurate galaxy cluster masses using X-ray thermodynamic profiles and graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise determination of galaxy cluster masses is crucial for establishing reliable mass-observable scaling relations in cluster cosmology. We employ graph neural networks (GNNs) to estimate galaxy cluster masses from radially sampled profiles of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) inferred from X-ray observations. GNNs naturally handle inputs of variable length and resolution by representing each ICM profile as a graph, enabling accurate and flexible modeling across diverse observational conditions. We trained and tested GNN model using state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters from The Three Hundred Project. The mass estimates using our method exhibit no systematic bias compared to the true cluster masses in the simulations. Additionally, we achieve a scatter in recovered mass versus true mass of about 6\%, which is a factor of six smaller than obtained from a standard hydrostatic equilibrium approach. Our algorithm is robust to both data quality and cluster morphology and it is capable of incorporating model uncertainties alongside observational uncertainties. Finally, we apply our technique to XMM-Newton observed galaxy cluster samples and compare the GNN derived mass estimates with those obtained with $Y_{\rm SZ}$-M$_{500}$ scaling relations. Our results provide strong evidence, at 5$\sigma$ level, for a mass-dependent bias in SZ derived masses, with higher mass clusters exhibiting a greater degree of deviation. Furthermore, we find the median bias to be $(1-b)=0.85_{-14}^{+34}$, albeit with significant dispersion due to its mass dependence. This work takes a significant step towards establishing unbiased observable mass scaling relations by integrating X-ray, SZ and optical datasets using deep learning techniques, thereby enhancing the role of galaxy clusters in precision cosmology.</description>

      <title>Breaking Dark: Hunting Heavy Decaying Dark Matter with Tibet AS$_\gamma$ and LHAASO-KM2A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements of diffuse sub-PeV gamma-rays by the Tibet AS$_\gamma$ and LHAASO collaborations have reshaped our understanding of the gamma-ray sky. Besides uncovering the nature of `PeVatrons', these measurements can also be used to probe the non-gravitational nature of dark matter. PeV-scale decaying dark matter can produce high-energy gamma rays in the final state and contribute to the measurements made by extensive air-shower detectors like Tibet AS$_\gamma$ and LHAASO. Using the latest Tibet AS$_\gamma$ upper limits on diffuse gamma rays away from the Galactic plane and the LHAASO-KM2A measurements of diffuse gamma rays from the Galactic plane, we put stringent constraints on lifetimes of decaying DM for masses $\sim 10^6 - 10^9$ GeV. Future observations of high-energy diffuse gamma-ray emission can thus provide stronger limits or potentially discover heavy decaying dark matter.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Galactic Center Expansion from Gaia DR3 Stars along the South North Axis: Implications for the JWST Early Galaxy Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed massive, evolved galaxies only a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, challenging standard cosmological models. To test the hypothesis that the Galactic nucleus may act as a source of matter and energy capable of accelerating galaxy formation, we examined whether the Milky Way itself shows signs of central activity. Expansion of the Galactic center would imply such activity in its nuclear region. To investigate this possibility, we analyzed stellar motions along the south north axis of the Galaxy using Gaia DR3 data. Average Galactocentric radial velocities were computed in 50 control points, spaced by 0.1 kpc with a sampling radius of 0.05 kpc, up to 5 kpc from the Galactic center. The results show a strong symmetry: in the northern region, 36 of 50 points have positive velocities, with an average of 19.15 +/- 10.80 km/s (N = 50), while in the southern region, 37 of 50 points have negative velocities, with an average of - 19.24 +/- 8.22 km/s (N = 50). A Students t test confirms that the two distributions differ significantly (0.003).
  The combination of positive average velocities in the north and negative average velocities in the south indicates a symmetric outflow of stars away from the Galactic center, consistent with expansion in its central region.
  These Galactocentric radial velocities are consistent with the formation of massive, evolved galaxies within 300 My, as observed by JWST. If extended to other galaxies, the results (together with earlier findings on globular cluster motions) suggest that aspects of standard galaxy formation models may require refinement. This interpretation, however, remains preliminary and requires further study.</description>

      <title>Sign-Flipping Axion Potentials via Kapitza-Type Modulation by Heavy Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the potential of a light axion can flip sign, or even nearly vanish, as a result of coherent oscillations of a heavier axion with which it mixes. This phenomenon is analogous to the Kapitza pendulum, where a high-frequency external force stabilizes an otherwise unstable configuration, but here it arises naturally from the inherent mass hierarchy and mixing among axions in the axiverse, without the need for any externally imposed modulation. We further show that a late-time sign flip of the potential can significantly enhance the abundance of the light axion, which has important cosmological and observational consequences.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from $\textit{Type-I}$ Strings in a Neutrino Mass Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel realization of $\textit{type-I}$ cosmic strings arising from the spontaneous breaking of an extended gauge symmetry $SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{B-L}$ in the context of a low-scale split seesaw mechanism for neutrino mass generation. We demonstrate that the split seesaw framework, which explains the smallness of neutrino masses, naturally motivates a small scalar self-coupling $\lambda$. This intrinsically links the neutrino mass generation mechanism to the formation of $\textit{type-I}$ cosmic strings, where the gauge coupling dominates over the scalar self-coupling ($\beta\equiv\lambda/2g^2&lt;1$). We explore the cosmological implications of these strings, including their gravitational wave signatures that are testable in current and future experiments. Our findings establish a compelling and testable connection between neutrino mass generation and cosmic string phenomenology in an underexplored region of parameter space.</description>

      <title>Inflationary trispectrum of gauge fields from scalar and tensor exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the inflationary trispectrum of primordial gauge fields generated through the scalar and tensor exchanges in models with spectator $U(1)$ gauge fields which are kinetically coupled to the inflaton. Focusing on the connected four-point autocorrelation function of gauge fields, we derive exact analytical expressions for the full trispectrum of both electric and magnetic fields using the in-in formalism and cosmological diagrammatic rules, and explore their respective contributions in specific momentum configurations. For the scalar exchange, we find that the trispectrum signal in the equisided configuration grows with the exchange momentum and reaches its maximum in the flattened limit. However, in the counter collinear limit, we show that the non-linearity parameter associated with the trispectrum scales quadratically with the corresponding parameter of the cross-correlation bispectrum of magnetic fields and curvature perturbations, thereby establishing a hierarchical relation between the higher- and lower-order correlation functions. For the tensor exchange, the trispectrum displays a richer angular dependence, reflecting the sensitivity to the orientation of the momentum quadrilateral with respect to the tensor polarisation, producing characteristic angular modulations in the trispectrum. Detecting such angular signatures in future high-precision cosmological observations would provide a novel window into tensor-mediated interactions in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Solving the Trans-Planckian Censorship Problem with a Power-law Tail in $R^2$ Inflation: A Dynamical System Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we elaborate on solving the trans-Planckian censorship problem of standard slow-roll inflation by using a power-law inflationary tail generated by a scalar field with an exponential potential. We use a quantitative approach by studying in detail the phase space of a combined $F(R,\phi)$ cosmological system, focusing on the de Sitter and power-law subspaces of the total phase space. As we show, the de Sitter subspace of the $F(R,\phi)$ system shares the same fixed points as the vacuum $F(R)$ gravity system and the trajectories in the phase space tend to these fixed points. However, the power-law subspace is not stable and cannot be realized by the combined $F(R,\phi)$ system. To this end, we propose a well-motivated phenomenological $F(R)$ gravity model for which the $R^2$ term is switched off below a critical curvature near the end of the $R^2$ slow-roll inflationary era, and below that critical curvature, only the Einstein-Hilbert gravity term and the scalar field remain in the effective inflationary Lagrangian. The remaining system can successfully realize a power-law tail of the $R^2$ slow-roll era.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Impact of Lunar and Planetary Occultation on Experimental Global 21 cm Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global 21 cm signal from the hyperfine transition of cosmic atomic hydrogen is theorised to track the state of the early Universe via the analysis of its absorption and emission with respect to the radio background. Detecting this signal has been a challenge for astronomers since it was first postulated due to the presence of strong galactic foregrounds obfuscating the transition. Forward modelling techniques that aim to simulate and then remove these foregrounds have been suggested as a workaround to this problem. This technique, however, requires a precise and accurate understanding of the foregrounds in question. As we move into the next major lunar standstill, the moon will be able to occult high power areas of the sky in ways that are unaccounted for by maps used to simulate these foregrounds, and thereby disrupt signal recovery. We show that in toy cases an occultation from the moon, or other proximate object, leading to a mismatch in our expected and actual foregrounds of 15 parts per million increases the error in signal recovery of up to 20\%. We show that this level of disruption can happen when the moon is found towards the centre of the galaxy and is amplified when this alignment happens at high directivity regions of the antenna beam, causing a disruption of up to 180 parts per million, leading to a signal recovery error of 115\%. This allows us to identify lunar alignment scenarios that should be actively avoided to preserve signal fidelity. We also demonstrate that a body with a smaller apparent size than the moon, such as Venus, is unlikely to cause any signal disruption due to occultation, giving a base map error of &lt;2 parts per million.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Measurement of D($\gamma$, $n$)$p$ Photodisintegration Reaction and Implications for Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a high-precision measurement of the D($\gamma$, $n$)$p$ photodisintegration reaction at the newly commissioned Shanghai Laser Electron Gamma Source (SLEGS), employing a quasi-monochromatic $\gamma$-ray beam from Laser Compton Scattering. The cross sections were determined over $E_\gamma$=2.327-7.089 MeV, achieving up to a factor of 2.2 improvement in precision near the neutron separation threshold. Combined with previous data in a global Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using dibaryon effective field theory, we obtained the unprecedentedly precise $p$($n$, $\gamma$)D cross sections and thermonuclear rate, with a precision up to 3.8 times higher than previous evaluations. Implemented in a standard Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) framework, this new rate decreases uncertainty of the key cosmological parameter of baryon density $\Omega_b h^2$ by up to $\approx$16% relative to the LUNA result. A residual $\approx$1.2$\sigma$ tension between $\Omega_b h^2$ constrained from primordial D/H observations and CMB measurements persists, highlighting the need for improved $dd$ reaction rates and offering potential hints of new physics beyond the standard model of cosmology.</description>

      <title>Bayesian recalibration of flux scale factors in diffuse radio maps using low-resolution absolute radiometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Haslam 408 MHz all-sky map is widely used as a template to model the diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission at radio and microwave frequencies. Recent studies have suggested that there are large uncorrected flux scale errors in this map, however. We investigate the possibility of statistically recalibrating the Haslam map using absolutely-calibrated (but low angular resolution) radio experiments designed to measure the 21cm global signal at low frequencies. We construct a Gibbs sampling scheme to recover the full joint posterior distribution of $\sim 50,000$ parameters, representing the true sky brightness temperature field, as-yet uncorrected flux scale factors, and synchrotron power-law spectral indices. Using idealised full-sky simulated data, we perform a joint analysis of a $1^\circ$ resolution diffuse map at 408 MHz and multi-band 21cm global signal data with $30^\circ$ resolution under different assumptions about 1) noise levels in the maps, 2) sky coverage, and 3) synchrotron spectral index information. For our fiducial scenario in which the global signal experiment has a 50 mK noise rms per coarse pixel in each of 20 frequency bins between 50 -- 150 MHz, we find that the notional Haslam flux scale factors can be recovered in most (but not all) sub-regions of the sky to an accuracy of $\pm 2 \%$. In all cases we are able to rectify the sky map to within $\sim 5$ K of the true brightness temperature.</description>

      <title>Revealing Event Rate of Repeating Fast Radio Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How the event rate of fast radio bursts (FRBs) evolves with redshift is a hot topic to explore their cosmological origin and the circum-burst environment. Particularly, it is urgent to know what the difference of event rates between repeating and non-repeating FRBs is. For the first time, we calculate the event rates of repeating FRBs detected by diverse telescopes at frequencies higher/lower than 1 GHz in this work. Luminosity and redshift are found to be positively correlated with a power law form for both high- and low-frequency FRBs, showing an obvious evolution of luminosity with redshift. Furthermore, we compare the differential luminosity and local event rate distributions of high- and low-luminosity FRBs at different frequencies. It is found that the event rates of these sub-samples of repeating FRBs similarly exceed the star formation rate at lower redshift than 1. Interestingly, we confirm with bootstrap method that the event rates of low-frequency FRBs exhibit different evolution patterns and are higher than that of high-frequency ones.</description>

      <title>The dependence of the Type Ia Supernova colour-luminosity relation on their host galaxy properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Dark Energy Survey 5-year sample, we determine the properties of type Ia supernova (SN Ia) host galaxies across a wide multi-wavelength range - from the optical to far-infrared - including data from the $Herschel$ and $Spitzer$ space telescopes. We categorise the SNe Ia into three distinct groups according to the distribution of their host galaxies on the star-formation rate (SFR) - stellar mass ($M_\star$) plane. Each region comprises host galaxies at distinct stages in their evolutionary pathways: Region 1 - low-mass hosts; Region 2 - high-mass, star-forming hosts and Region 3 - high-mass, passive hosts. We find SNe Ia in host galaxies located in Region 1 have the steepest slope (quantified by $\beta$) between their colours and luminosities, with $\beta_{\mathrm{R_1}} = 3.51 \pm 0.16$. This differs at the ${\sim}6\sigma$ significance level to SNe Ia in Region 3, which have the shallowest colour-luminosity slope with $\beta_{\mathrm{R_3}} = 2.12 \pm 0.16$. After correcting SNe Ia in each subsample by their respective $\beta$, events in Region 3 (high-mass, passive hosts) are $0.07 - 0.12$ mag ($&gt;3\sigma$) brighter, post-standardisation. We conclude that future cosmological analyses should apply standardisation relations to SNe Ia based upon the region in which the SN host galaxy lies in the SFR-$M_\star$ plane. Alternatively, cosmological analyses should restrict the SN Ia sample to events whose host galaxies occupy a single region of this plane.</description>

      <title>Negative gas-phase metallicity gradients in the narrow line region and galactic disc of local AGN-host galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gas-phase metallicity distribution in galaxies provides significant information on their evolution. We report the discovery of negative radial gradients in the gas-phase metallicity of the narrow-line region of the nine galaxies in the Measuring Active Galactic Nuclei Under MUSE Microscope (MAGNUM) galaxies: Centaurus A, Circinus, IC 5063, NGC 1068, NGC 1365, NGC 1386, NGC 2992, NGC 4945, NGC 5643. From strong-line abundance relations for active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming regions, along with emission-line ratio diagnostics, we determine spatially resolved gas-phase metallicities for the kinematic components, galaxy disc and outflow. These relations involve sensitive strong emission lines, specifically [O III]5007, [N II]6584, H{\alpha}, H\b{eta}, [S II]6716, and [S II]6731. The existence of predominantly negative radial metallicity gradients in these AGN host galaxies indicates that metals are not necessarily moved from the central regions to the outskirts by AGN activity and that the gas-phase metallicity in galaxies may follow the general inside-out star formation scenario.</description>

      <title>Globally Stable Dark Energy in $F(R)$ Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $F(R)$ models for dark energy generally exhibit a weak curvature singularity, which can be cured by adding an $R^2$ term. This correction allows for a unified description of primordial and late-time accelerated expansions. However, most existing models struggle to achieve this, as they become unstable over certain negative ranges of the Ricci scalar, where either the first or second derivative of $F(R)$ turns negative. These instabilities may disrupt the post-inflationary evolution when the Ricci scalar oscillates about the vacuum state after the $R^2$ inflation. In this work, we introduce a new model-building to guarantee global stability, i.e., the first and second derivatives are positive for all real Ricci scalars. By extending the idea from Appleby and Battye, we demonstrate that viable models can be constructed by imposing a positive, bounded first derivative of $F(R)$ with a sigmoid shape. As examples, we first reformulate and generalize the original Appleby-Battye model. Then, we propose a new dark energy model, which successfully explains the acceleration of cosmic expansion and passes local gravity tests.</description>

      <title>Systematic bias in dark siren statistical methods and its impact on Hubble constant measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of multimessenger cosmology, marked by the detection of GW170817, demonstrated that standard sirens are a valuable cosmological probe. In the absence of an electromagnetic counterpart identification, gravitational waves carry valuable information through the dark siren approach, where the source redshift is estimated using galaxy catalogs of potential hosts within the localisation volume. However, the DS analysis can be affected by galaxy catalog incompleteness at the limits of gravitational-wave detectability, potentially introducing biases in the constraints on cosmological parameters. Focusing on GWs from binary black holes detected by the LVK collaboration, we explore the possible systematic biases in the measurement of the $H_0$. These biases may arise from (1) the incompleteness of catalogs due to the apparent magnitude thresholds of optical telescope sensitivity, and (2) the use of incorrect weighting schemes for each potential host. We found that an unbiased estimate of $H_0$ can be obtained when the corrected weighting scheme is applied to a complete or volume-limited catalog. We use a complete galaxy catalog covering 90% of the localisation probability for each GW detection, employing stellar mass as a tracer. Our results show that a sample of 100 binary black hole events with $A_{90\%}$&lt;10 deg$^2$ and measured luminosity distances below 1600(2500) Mpc, detected by the LVK at O4(O5) sensitivity, can provide a percent-level measurement of $H_0$, with a precision of 3%(1%). This number of detections is expected to be accumulated after approximately 8 and 3 years of observations with the LVK at O4 and O5 sensitivity, respectively. The O5 run provides a reduction in the $H_0$ uncertainty by 1.34 km/s/Mpc compared to the O4-like configuration. The $H_0$ precision increases to approximately 6% when it is assumed that every galaxy has an equal probability of being the host.</description>

      <title>Starlight from JWST: Implications for star formation and dark matter models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We confront the star formation rate in different dark matter (DM) models with UV luminosity data from JWST up to $z\simeq25$ and legacy data from HST. We find that a transition from a Salpeter population to top-heavy Pop-III stars is likely at $z\simeq10$ and that beyond $z=10-15$ the feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei is progressively reduced, so that at $z\simeq25$ the production of stars is almost free from any feedback. We compare fuzzy and warm DM models that suppress small-scale structures with the CDM paradigm, finding that the fuzzy DM mass $&gt; 4.5 \times 10^{-22}{\rm eV}$ and the warm DM mass $&gt; 1.5\, {\rm keV}$ at the 95\% CL. The fits of the star formation rate parametrization do not depend strongly on the DM properties within the allowed range. We find no preference over CDM for enhanced matter perturbations associated with axion miniclusters or primordial black holes. The scale of the enhancement of the power spectrum should be $&gt; 27\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ at the 95\% CL, excluding axion miniclusters produced for $m_a &lt; 7.5 \times 10^{-17}\,{\rm eV}$ or heavy primordial black holes that constitute a fraction $f_{\rm PBH} &gt; {\rm Max}[88 M_{\odot}/m_{\rm PBH}, 10^{-4} (m_{\rm PBH}/10^4 M_{\odot})^{-0.09}]$ of DM.</description>

      <title>Addressing the too-big-to-fail problem and the void phenomenon through a modified initial power spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of early-time initial conditions on nonlinear structure formation and evolution within the framework of the semi-analytical Excursion Set Theory (EST). Our analysis reveals that adding a Gaussian bump to the initial curvature power spectrum at small scales enhances the abundance of massive halos while sharply reducing the number of small-mass halos, and consequently, satellite galaxies. Moreover, this modification increases the frequency of major mergers while suppressing high-mass-ratio minor mergers. These features may offer resolutions to the missing satellite and Too Big to Fail (TBTF) problems. In underdense regions -- voids -- the same modifications increase the likelihood of finding massive halos embedded in voids while similarly decreasing the small-halo population, and consequently, faint galaxies. This behavior suggests a potential solution to the void phenomenon, in which embedded halos, despite being too massive, were too rare to be noticed. More precisely, our results indicate that an excess of massive structures emerges at mass scales near the center of the Gaussian bump: $k_* = 1.85 \,\rm{h/Mpc}$ and $k_* = 3.95 \,\rm{h/Mpc}$. These scales correspond to mass scales of $M_* = 10^{11}$ and $M_* = 10^{10}$, respectively. This modification extends up to two orders of magnitude in higher mass scales, while reducing the abundance of halos below $M_*$ by two to three orders of magnitude. Additionally, we find that evolutionary conditions, halo-in-halo, and particularly halo-in-void statistics serve as more sensitive and complementary probes for differentiating among cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Calibrating baryonic effects in cosmic shear with external data in the LSST era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological constraints derived from weak lensing (WL) surveys are limited by baryonic effects, which suppress the non-linear matter power spectrum on small scales. By combining WL measurements with data from external tracers of the gas around massive structures, it is possible to calibrate baryonic effects and, therefore, obtain more precise cosmological constraints. In this study, we generate mock data for a Stage-IV weak lensing survey such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), X-ray gas fractions, and stacked kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) measurements, to jointly constrain cosmological and astrophysical parameters describing baryonic effects (using the Baryon Correction Model - BCM). First, using WL data alone, we quantify the level to which the BCM parameters will need to be constrained to recover the cosmological constraints obtained under the assumption of perfect knowledge of baryonic feedback. We identify the most relevant baryonic parameters and determine that they must be calibrated to a precision of $\sim 10$-$20\%$ to avoid significant degradation of the fiducial WL constraints. We forecast that long-term X-ray data from $\sim 5000$ clusters should be able to reach this threshold for the parameters that characterise the abundance of hot virialised gas. Constraining the distribution of ejected gas presents a greater challenge, however, but we forecast that long-term kSZ data from a CMB-S4-like experiment should achieve the level of precision required for full self-calibration.</description>

Abstract: We reassess the realistic discovery reach of Solar System experiments for dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) and quantify their complementarity to dedicated cosmological probes, such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and Euclid mission. In scalar-tensor frameworks with universal conformal coupling A(\phi), screening (chameleon/symmetron, Vainshtein) suppresses fifth forces in deep Solar potentials, consistent with the gravitational-wave speed bound $|c_T/c - 1| &lt; 10^{-15}$. We treat Solar-System tests as hypothesis-driven probes: we assemble quantitative guardrails (MICROSCOPE \eta, Cassini \gamma, LLR \dot G/G and SEP, ephemeris limits on \rho_DM and Yukawa \alpha(\lambda), and clock-network searches for ultralight DM), place them alongside current cosmology posteriors, and provide an explicit map from cosmology-level linear response (e.g., $\mu_{lin,0}$) to local residuals using the screening relations (thin-shell and Vainshtein). Guided by systematics-gated criteria, we outline a near-term program -- solar-conjunction Shapiro-delay and Doppler/range tests, sustained millimeter-class LLR, global optical-clock links, refined ephemerides, and spaceborne atom interferometry (AIS) -- with realistic sensitivities $|\gamma-1|&lt; (2-5) \times 10^{-6}$ per conjunction, $\eta_{EEP} \sim 10^{-16}$-$10^{-17}$ (AIS), $|\dot{G}/G| &lt; (1-3) \times 10^{-14}$ yr$^{-1}$ (near-term; with LLR next-gen stations and CCRs, few x $10^{-15}$), a uniform ~2x tightening of AU-scale Yukawa/DM-density bounds, and (3-10)x gains in ultralight-DM couplings from clock networks. Primary discovery potential for late-time dark energy lies with multi-probe cosmology (geometry and growth), while a hypothesis-driven Solar System program supplies high-leverage falsification and selective discovery windows for dark matter with ultralight mediators or long-range forces.</description>

      <title>Sub-GeV dark matter and nano-Hertz gravitational waves from a classically conformal dark sector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19478v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong first-order phase transitions in a dark sector offer a compelling explanation for the stochastic gravitational wave background in the nano-Hertz range recently detected by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). We explore the possibility that such a phase transition at the same time gives mass to a stable fermion that accounts for the observed dark matter abundance and leads to testable effects in laboratory experiments. Concretely, we consider a classically conformal dark sector with a hidden $U(1)^\prime$ gauge symmetry that couples to the Standard Model via kinetic mixing. Since the PTA signal requires a phase transition in the MeV temperature range, spontaneous symmetry breaking gives rise to a sub-GeV dark matter candidate that couples to the Standard Model via a dark photon mediator and obtains its relic abundance via annihilations into electrons and dark Higgs bosons. Such a scenario is tightly constrained by laboratory searches for dark photons and cosmological constraints on the decays of dark Higgs bosons after the phase transition. We show that viable parameter regions can be found both for the case that the dark Higgs bosons remain in equilibrium with the Standard Model and that they decouple and only decay much later. In the latter case, the parameter regions preferred by the PTA signal and the dark matter relic abundance can be fully explored by future beam-dump experiments searching for missing energy.</description>

      <title>Using the antenna impedance to estimate soil electrical parameters for the MIST global 21-cm experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radio experiments trying to detect the global $21$~cm signal from the early Universe are very sensitive to the electrical properties of their environment. For ground-based experiments with the antenna above the soil it is critical to characterize the effect from the soil on the sky observations. This characterization requires estimating the soil's electrical conductivity and relative permittivity in the same frequency range as the observations. Here we present our initial effort to estimate the conductivity and relative permittivity of the soil using the impedance of an antenna mounted at a distance above the surface. In this technique, the antenna used for soil characterization is the same as the antenna used for sky observations. To demonstrate the technique we use the antenna of the MIST global $21$~cm experiment. We measured the antenna impedance at three sites in the Greater Concepci\'on area, Chile. The measurements were done between $25$ and $125$~MHz, matching the range used by MIST for sky observations. The soil parameters were estimated by fitting the impedance measurements with electromagnetic simulations of the antenna and soil. In this initial effort the soil was modeled as homogeneous. The conductivity at the three sites was found to be between $0.007$ and $0.049$~Sm$^{-1}$, and the relative permittivity between $1.6$ and $12.7$. The percent precision of the estimates at $68\%$ probability is, with one exception, better (lower) than $33\%$. The best-fit simulations have a better than $10\%$ agreement with the measurements relative to the peak values of the resistance and reactance across our frequency range. For MIST, these results represent a successful proof of concept of the use of the antenna impedance for soil characterization, and are expected to significantly improve in future implementations.</description>

      <title>What KM3-230213A events may tell us about the neutrino mass and dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of general $U(1)$ scenario, we demonstrate that the ultra high energy neutrinos recently detected by KM3NeT could originate from a decaying right handed neutrino dark matter (DM), with a mass of 440 PeV. Considering DM production via freeze-in, we delineate the parameter space that satisfies the observed relic abundance and also lies within the reach of multiple gravitational wave detectors. Our study provides a testable new physics scenario, enabled by multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Cosmic Curvature: from Local Structures to Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study tackles the impact Dark Energy (DE) in different systems by a simple unifying formalism. We introduce a parameter space that compare gravity across all cosmic scales, using the McVittie spacetime (McV) and connects spherically symmetric solutions with cosmological solutions. By analyzing the invariant scalars: the Ricci, Weyl, and Kretschmann scalars, we develop a phase-space description that predicts the dominance of the Cosmological Constant. We explore three cases: (1) the local Hubble flow around galaxy groups and clusters, (2) spherical density distributions and (3) binary motion. Our results show that the Kretschmann scalar of galaxy groups and clusters in their turnaround is $2\Lambda^2$ which is three times the Kretschmann scalar of the Cosmological Consonant. This quantifies the DE domination in local structures.</description>

      <title>t-channel dark matter at the LHC -- a whitepaper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report, summarising work achieved in the context of the LHC Dark Matter Working Group, investigates the phenomenology of $t$-channel dark matter models, spanning minimal setups with a single dark matter candidate and mediator to more complex constructions closer to UV-complete models. For each considered class of models, we examine collider, cosmological and astrophysical implications. In addition, we explore scenarios with either promptly decaying or long-lived particles, as well as featuring diverse dark matter production mechanisms in the early universe. By providing a unified analysis framework, numerical tools and guidelines, this work aims to support future experimental and theoretical efforts in exploring $t$-channel dark matter models at colliders and in cosmology.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes and magnetic fields in conformal neutrino mass models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sufficiently strong and long-lasting first-order phase transitions can produce primordial black holes (PBHs) that contribute substantially to the dark matter abundance of the Universe, and can produce large-scale primordial magnetic fields. We study these mechanisms in a generic class of conformal $\mathrm{U(1)}^\prime$ models that also explain active neutrino oscillation data via the type-I seesaw mechanism. We find that phase transitions that occur at seesaw scales between $10^4$ GeV and $10^{11}$ GeV produce gravitational wave signals (from the dynamics of the phase transition and from the decay of cosmic string loops) at LISA/ET that can be correlated with microlensing signals of PBHs at the Roman Space Telescope, while scales near $10^{11}$ GeV can be correlated with Hawking evaporation signals at future gamma-ray telescopes. LISA can probe the entire range of PBH masses between $1\times 10^{-16}M_\odot$ and $8\times 10^{-11}M_\odot$ if PBHs fully account for the dark matter abundance. For Z' masses between 40 TeV and $10^4$ TeV, and 10 TeV right-handed neutrinos, helical magnetic fields can be produced with magnitudes $\gtrsim 0.5$ pG and coherence lengths $\gtrsim 0.008$ Mpc, above current blazar lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Inflationary power spectrum from the Lanczos algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generalized Lanczos algorithm can provide a universal method for constructing the wave function under the group structure of Hamiltonian. Based on this fact, we obtain an open two-mode squeezed state as the quantum origin for the curvature perturbation. In light of this wave function in the open system, we successfully develop a new method to calculate its corresponding power spectrum by using the Bogoliubov transformation. Unlike traditional approaches, we explicitly retain the Bogoliubov coefficients in terms of the squeezing amplitude \( r_k \) and the squeezing rotation angle \( \phi_k \). As a result, the power spectrum of the open two-mode squeezed state will match that of the Bunch-Davies vacuum numerically. Furthermore, the derivation of the open two-mode squeezed state relies on the second kind Meixner polynomial (equivalent to the generalized Lanczos algorithm) and the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. Therefore, our research may offer a new insight into the calculation of the correlation functions through a group-theoretic perspective.</description>

      <title>A two-phase model of galaxy formation: IV. Seeding and growing supermassive black holes in dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for seeding and growing supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in dark matter halos along their assembly histories. Seeds are bred out of Pop-III stars formed during the first collapse of pristine gas in mini-halos that have reached the ${\rm H}_2$-cooling limit, modulated by UV radiation from star formation and dynamical heating from fast halo assembly. Such breeding persists until the enrichment of the intergalactic medium (IGM) enables Pop-II stars to form. Post-seeding growth of black holes (BHs) is driven by distinct channels, starting with episodic super-Eddington accretion associated with nuclear bursts induced by global disturbances of galaxies, followed by sustained sub-Eddington accretion via capturing sub-clouds formed in self-gravitating gas clouds (SGCs) in halos of fast assembly, and ending with merger-dominated, quiescent growth. We implement the model in subhalo merger trees to build a coherent framework to follow the SMBH-galaxy-halo co-evolution over their full lives in the full structure hierarchy. BH seeds are bred with a broad mass spectrum of $M_{\rm BH} = 10$--$10^5\,{\rm M}_\odot$ at $z \approx 20$--$30$ in mini-halos with masses of $10^5$--$10^8\,{\rm M}_\odot$. Nuclear bursts provide the key condition for seeds to grow into SMBHs. The $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_*$ relation is a multi-piece, redshift-dependent function shaped by the interplay among different growth channels. Our model predictions are broadly consistent with existing observations; especially, a population of BHs reminiscent of 'little red dots' (LRDs) discovered by JWST naturally results from the seeding and growing processes. Potential future tests of the model are discussed.</description>
