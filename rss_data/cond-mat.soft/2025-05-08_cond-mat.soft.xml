      <title>Statistical method for A-RNA and B-DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nucleic acids have been regarded as stiff polymers with long-range flexibility and generally modeled using elastic rod models of polymer physics. Notwithstanding, investigations carried out over the past few years on single fragments of order $\sim 100$ base pairs have revealed remarkable flexibility properties at short scales and called for theoretical approaches that emphasize the role of the bending fluctuations at single sites along the molecule stack. Here, we review a three dimensional mesoscopic Hamiltonian model which assumes a discrete representation of the double stranded (ds) molecules at the level of the nucleotides. The model captures the fundamental local interactions between adjacent sugar-phosphate groups and the pairwise interactions between complementary base pair mates. A statistical method based on the path integral formalism sets the ensemble of the base pair breathing fluctuations which are included in the partition function and permits to derive the thermodynamics and the elastic response of single molecules to external forces. We apply the model to the computation of the twist-stretch relations for fragments of ds-DNA and ds-RNA, showing that the obtained opposite pattern (DNA overtwists whereas RNA untwists versus force) follows from the different structural features of the two helices. Moreover, we focus on the DNA stretching due to the confinement in nano-pores and, finally, on the computation of the cyclization probability of open ends molecules of $\sim 100$ base pairs under physiological conditions. The mesoscopic model shows a distinct advantage over the elastic rod model in estimating the molecule bendability at short length scale.</description>

      <title>Bulldozing an immersed granular material in a confined channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motion of an immersed granular material in a channel is characterised by complex interactions among the grains, between the grains and the permeating liquid, and between the grains and the channel walls. Here, we develop a reduced-order continuum model for the bulldozing of an immersed, sedimented granular material by a piston in a channel. In our continuum approach, the granular pile and the overlying fluid layer evolve as a system of coupled thin films. We model the granular phase as a dense, porous, visco-plastic material that experiences Coulomb-like friction with the walls. Conservation of mass and momentum under a thin-film approximation leads to an elliptic equation for the velocity of the grains that is coupled with an evolution equation for the height of the granular pile. We solve our model numerically for a variety of different scenarios to explore the interactions between wall friction, internal viscous-like stresses, and fluid flow above and through the pile. We complement our numerical results with a series of experiments that provide insight into the validity and limitations of the model.</description>

      <title>Partitioning Law of Polymer Chains into Flexible Polymer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equilibrium partitioning of linear polymer chains into flexible polymer networks is governed by intricate entropic constraints arising from configurational degrees of freedom of both chains and network, yet a quantitative understanding remains elusive. Using model hydrogels with precisely defined network structures, we experimentally reveal a universal law governing linear polymer partitioning into flexible polymer networks. We establish a novel label-free, contactless method to measure partition ratio, based on the increase in osmotic pressure induced by external polymer chains partitioning into the network. Moreover, we find a universal law in which the partition constant is solely determined by the squared ratio $(R_g / l_\mathrm{cycle})^2$, where $R_g$ is the gyration radius of the polymer chain and $l_\mathrm{cycle}$ is the characteristic mesh size of the network, as defined by the cycle length.</description>

      <title>Robust Critical Connectivity Threshold in Ranked Percolation of Granular Packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of sintering bridges in amorphous powders affects both flow behavior and perceived material quality. When sintering is driven by surface tension, bridges emerge sequentially, favoring contacts between smaller particles first. Predicting the connectivity percolation threshold is key to understanding and controlling the onset of sintering. We investigate ranked percolation in granular packings, where particles connect based on contact number. While the percolation threshold defined by the fraction of connected particles is non-universal and highly sensitive to particle size dispersion, we find that the critical number of sintered bridges per particle provides a robust estimator across different size distributions. Through numerical simulations and a mean-field approach, we link this robustness to the spatial distribution of contacts. Our results have broader implications for understanding the resilience of spatially embedded networks under targeted attacks.</description>

      <title>Salt-induced gelation of nonionic sucrose ester dispersions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dispersions of nonionic sucrose ester surfactants in water exhibit a highly negative zeta-potential, though its origin remains controversial. The addition of electrolytes to these dispersions may influence their zeta-potential, thus potentially affecting their physicochemical properties. The electrolyte- and pH- driven gelation of aqueous dispersions of commercial sucrose stearate (S970) containing ca. 1:1 monoesters and diesters was studied using optical microscopy, rheological and zeta-potential measurements, and small-angle X-ray scattering techniques. At low electrolyte concentrations and pH $\gtrapprox$ 5, 0.5-5 wt. % S970 dispersions exhibited low viscosities and behaved as freely flowing liquids. The addition of electrolytes of low concentrations, e.g. 9 mM NaCl or 1.5 mM MgCl$_2$, induced the formation of a non-flowing gels. This sol-gel transition occurred due to the partial screening of the diesters particles charge, allowing the formation of an attractive gel network, spanning across the dispersion volume. Complete charge screening, however, led to a gel-sol transition and phase separation. Gel formation was observed also by pH variation without electrolyte addition, whereas the addition of free fatty acids had negligible impact on dispersion properties. These findings support the hypothesis that the negative charge in sucrose ester dispersions arises from hydroxyl anions adsorption on particles surfaces. Gels were formed using just 1.3 wt. % surfactant, and the critical electrolyte concentration for gelation was found to scale approximately with the square of the cation charge, in agreement with the low surface charge density theory. The biodegradable sucrose esters gels offer a sustainable alternative for structuring personal and home care products, replacing the wormlike micelles of synthetic surfactants typically used at much higher surfactant and salt concentrations.</description>

      <title>Peak Broadening in Photoelectron Spectroscopy of Amorphous Polymers: the Leading Role of the Electrostatic Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The broadening in photoelectron spectra of polymers can be attributed to several factors, such as light source spread, spectrometer resolution, finite lifetime of the hole state, and solid-state effects. Here, for the first time, we set up a computational protocol to assess the peak broadening induced for both core and valence levels by solid-state effects in four amorphous polymers by using a combination of density functional theory, many-body perturbation theory, and classical polarizable embedding. We show that intrinsic local inhomogeneities in the electrostatic environment induce a Gaussian broadening of $0.2$-$0.7$~eV in the binding energies of both core and semi-valence electrons, corresponding to a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $0.5$-$1.7$~eV for the investigated systems. The induced broadening is larger in acrylate- than in styrene- based polymers, revealing the crucial role of polar groups in controlling the roughness of the electrostatic landscape in the solid matrix.</description>

      <title>General Hamiltonian description of nonreciprocal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a vast class of systems, which includes members as diverse as active colloids and bird flocks, interactions do not stem from a potential, and are in general nonreciprocal. Thus, it is not possible to define a conventional energy function, nor to use analytical or numerical tools that rely on it. Here, we overcome these limitations by constructing a Hamiltonian that includes auxiliary degrees of freedom; when subject to a constraint, this Hamiltonian yields the original non-reciprocal dynamics. We show that Glauber dynamics based on the constrained Hamiltonian reproduces the steady states of the original Langevin dynamics, as we explicitly illustrate for dissipative XY spins with vision-cone interactions. Further, the symplectic structure inherent to our construction allows us to apply the well-developed notions of Hamiltonian engineering, which we demonstrate by varying the amplitude of a periodic drive to tune the spin interactions between those of a square and a chain lattice geometry. Overall, our framework for generic nonreciprocal pairwise interactions paves the way for bringing to bear the full conceptual and methodological power of conventional statistical mechanics and Hamiltonian dynamics to nonreciprocal systems.</description>

      <title>SmartTrap: Automated Precision Experiments with Optical Tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a trend in research towards more automation using smart systems powered by artificial
  intelligence. While experiments are often challenging to automate, they can greatly benefit from
  automation by reducing labor and increasing reproducibility. For example, optical tweezers are
  widely employed in single-molecule biophysics, cell biomechanics, and soft matter physics, but they
  still require a human operator, resulting in low throughput and limited repeatability. Here, we
  present a smart optical tweezers platform, which we name SmartTrap, capable of performing complex
  experiments completely autonomously. SmartTrap integrates real-time 3D particle tracking using
  deep learning, custom electronics for precise feedback control, and a microfluidic setup for particle
  handling. We demonstrate the ability of SmartTrap to operate continuously, acquiring high-precision
  data over extended periods of time, through a series of experiments. By bridging the gap between
  manual experimentation and autonomous operation, SmartTrap establishes a robust and open source
  framework for the next generation of optical tweezers research, capable of performing large-scale
  studies in single-molecule biophysics, cell mechanics, and colloidal science with reduced experimental
  overhead and operator bias.</description>

      <title>Robustly optimal dynamics for active matter reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the information processing abilities of active matter in the reservoir computing (RC) paradigm, using a model that is externally driven to infer the future state of a chaotic signal. The simulated system closely follows a previously reported model. We uncover an exceptional dynamical regime of agent dynamics that has been overlooked heretofore. It appears robustly optimal across varying physical parameters and inference tasks, thus providing valuable insights into computation and inference with physical systems more generally. The ability to form effective mechanisms for information processing are primarily determined by the system's own intrinsic relaxation abilities. These are identifiable when probing the system without a specific inference goal and manifest when testing minimalistic single-particle reservoirs. The regime that achieves optimal computation is situated just below the critical damping threshold, involving a microscopic dynamical relaxation with multiple stages. The optimal system is adaptable under chaotic external driving, due to a diversity in response mechanisms that emerge like rapid alternations between quasi-stationary and highly nonlinear dynamical states. Both coherent and incoherent dynamics contribute to their operation, partly at dissimilar scales of space and delay time. Correlations on agent dynamics can indicate the best-performing regimes and onsets of tight relationships between the responding system and the fluctuating driver. As this model of computation is interpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding learning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body physics out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Cell size heterogeneity controls crystallization of the developing fruit fly wing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental question in Biology is to understand how patterns and shapes emerge from the collective interplay of large numbers of cells. Cells forming two-dimensional epithelial tissues behave as active materials that undergo remodeling and spontaneous shape changes. Focussing on the fly wing as a model system, we find that the cellular packing in the wing epithelium transitions from a disordered packing to an ordered, crystalline packing. We investigate biophysical mechanisms controlling this crystallization process. While previous studies propose a role of tissue shear flow in establishing the ordered cell packing in the fly wing, we reveal a role of cell size heterogeneity. Indeed, we find that even if tissue shear have been inhibited, cell packings in the fruit fly wing epithelium transition from disordered to an ordered packing. We propose that the transition is controlled by the cell size heterogeneity, which is quantified by the cell size polydispersity. We use the vertex model of epithelial tissues to show that there is a critical value of cell size polydispersity above which cellular packings are disordered and below which they form a crystalline packing. By analyzing experimental data we find that cell size polydispersity decreases during fly wing development. The observed dynamics of tissue crystallisation is consistent with the slow ordering kinetics we observe in the vertex model. Therefore, although tissue shear does not control the transition, it significantly enhances the rate of tissue scale ordering by facilitating alingment of locally ordered crystallites.</description>

      <title>The Decrease of Static Friction Coefficient with Interface Growth from Single to Multiasperity Contact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The key parameter for describing frictional strength at the onset of sliding is the static friction coefficient. Yet, how the static friction coefficient emerges at the macroscale from contacting asperities at the microscale is still an open problem. Here, we present friction experiments in which the normal load was varied over more than 3 orders of magnitude, so that a transition from a single asperity contact at low loads to multiasperity contacts at high loads was achieved. We find a remarkable reduction in the friction drop (the ratio of the static friction force to the dynamic friction force) with increasing normal load. Using a simple stick-slip transition model we identify the presence of presliding and subcritical contact points as the cause of smaller static friction coefficient at increased normal loads. Our measurements and model bridge the gap between friction behavior commonly observed in atomic force microscopy experiments at microscopic forces, and industrially relevant multiasperity contact interfaces loaded with macroscopic forces.</description>

      <title>The origin of strings and rings in the atomic dynamics of disordered systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has long been believed that the atomic dynamics in disordered structures, such as undercooled liquids and pre-melted interfaces, are characterized by collective atomic rearrangements in the form of quasi-one-dimensional chains of atomic displacements (strings) and their closed forms (rings). Here, we show by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that strings involving more than a few atoms do not form by a single collective event. Instead, they represent trajectories of propagating local density perturbations, which we call densitons. The atoms on this trajectory are almost indistinguishable from their environments except for the moving head of the string (densiton). A densiton migrates by either single-atom jumps or a concerted rearrangement of 2-3 atoms. The simulations reveal a remarkable similarity between the strings in disordered and crystalline structures, in which the densitons localize into point defects. This work calls for a significant reinterpretation of the string concept and instead proposes a densiton model of the atomic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Collecting Particles in Confined Spaces by Active Filamentous Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biological and robotic systems often operate in confined environments where material must be gathered without centralized control. Inspired by the effective collection strategies of aquatic worms (Lumbriculus variegatus and Tubifex tubifex), we investigate how active filaments autonomously aggregate dispersed particles. We study this process across four platforms: living worms, a robotic chain, Brownian dynamics simulations of active polymers, and a coarse-grained toy model. We show that aggregation emerges from repeated contact and body deformation, and demonstrate that clustering dynamics are governed by filament length and bending stiffness. Across systems, particle gathering follows a shared aggregation-fragmentation process, with the steady-state average cluster size scaling as $\langle s\rangle_L\sim W/D^2$, where W is the effective width of the path cleared by the filament and D the domain size. We find that filament flexibility modulates W, enabling more flexible filaments to sweep larger areas and collect more particles. These results establish a unifying framework for understanding how shape and flexibility influence transport and organization in active filament systems and filamentous robots.</description>

      <title>Emergent Complexity in a Light-Driven Self-Oscillatory Crystal: A Molecular Perspective on Autonomous Behavior and Stimulus-Modulated Motion</title>

Abstract: Living organisms are molecular systems with self-sustained dynamics via energy conversion through molecular cooperation, resulting in highly complex macroscopic behaviors. Construction of such autonomous macroscopic dynamics at a molecular system level remains one of the central challenges in the field of chemistry. Looking further ahead, constructing motile systems that can receive external information and adapt their autonomous behavior represents the next frontier towards newly functional molecular devices such as microrobots. In this study, we focused on a light-driven self-oscillatory crystal that exhibits continuous flipping motion under constant light irradiation. We experimentally evaluated the oscillation frequency of the crystal under polarized light and confirmed the validity of our previously proposed mechanism, and clarified the requirements for self-oscillation. Based on this mechanism, we constructed a mathematical model that demonstrates the motion of the crystal itself. The model revealed that diverse oscillatory behaviors at the macroscopic level can emerge due to small differences in conditions even when the underlying molecular-level processes are identical. Furthermore, we found that the oscillatory behavior depended on the state generated by the previously applied light. This suggests that a memory effect contributes to the complex motion of the crystal.</description>

      <title>Universal Correlations in Local Measurements Directly Probe Effective Diffusivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring transport coefficients at the microscale remains challenging, often relying on indirect methods that require modeling and calibration. This Letter derives universal asymptotic forms for the autocorrelation and relative uncertainty of local probe measurements in dilute diffusive systems. Valid both at and far from equilibrium, these forms directly connect microscopic measurements to the effective diffusivity. Indirect methods such as dynamic light scattering and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy are thereby elevated to asymptotically direct probes. They become capable of measuring the effective diffusivity of active and other microscopically nondiffusive systems. Simulations across several models confirm the broad applicability of these predictions.</description>

      <title>How individual vs shared coordination governs the degree of correlation in rotational vs residence times in a high-viscosity lithium electrolyte</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02457</link>

Abstract: Commercially used carbonate-based electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries are susceptible to many challenges, including flammability, volatility, and lower thermal stability. Solvated ionic liquids of LiTFSI salt (lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-amide) and glyme-based solvents are potential alternative candidates for commonly used electrolytes. We perform classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations study the effect of concentration and temperature on the translational and rotational dynamics. The radial distribution function shows stronger coordination of Li$^+$ ions with tetraglyme(G4), as shown in earlier studies, and forms a stable [Li(G4)]$^+$ cation complex. The self-diffusion coefficients are lower than the values experimentally observed but show better improvement over other classical force fields. An increase in the salt concentrations leads to a higher viscosity of the system and reduces the overall ionic mobility of Li$^{+}$ ions. Diluting the system with a larger number of glyme molecules leads to shorter rotational relaxation times for both TFSI and tetraglyme. Ion-residence times show that Li$^+$ ions form stable and long-lasting complexes with G4 molecules than TFSI anions. The residence time of [Li(G4)]$^+$ complex increases at higher salt concentrations due to the availability of fewer G4 molecules to coordinate with a Li$^+$ ion. G4 is also seen to form polydentate complexes with Li$^+$ without a shared coordination, allowing rotation without breaking coordination, unlike TFSI, which requires coordination disruption for rotation. This distinction explains the poor correlation between rotation and residence time for G4 and the strong correlation for TFSI.</description>

      <title>Barrier induced stalemate-consensus transition of self-propelled participants subject to majority rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03464</link>

Abstract: Natural or artificial barriers, such as the Himalayas, the Berlin Wall, or the Korean Demilitarized Zone, can significantly impede human migration. As a consequence, they may also hinder the dissemination of opinions within society, thereby contributing to divergent geopolitical landscapes and cultural developments. This raises a fundamental question: how do such barriers influence the opinion dynamics of mobile agents, such as human beings? In particular, can a barrier induce transitions in collective opinion states among spatially segregated groups? Here, we investigate the opinion dynamics governed by majority rule in a minimal model comprising self-propelled agents with binary opinions performing random walks within a closed space divided by a barrier. We focus on the conditions under which initially segregated clusters of agents with opposing opinions can reach consensus. Our results reveal the existence of a critical barrier size that marks a transition between stalemate and consensus states. Near this critical point, the relaxation time to reach consensus from an initial stalemate exhibits a power-law divergence. This barrier-induced stalemate-consensus transition in a simple agent-based model offers new insights into the role of physical or social barriers in shaping opinion dynamics and social structures.</description>
