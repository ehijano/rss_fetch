      <title>Cutting Corners on Uncertainty: Zonotope Abstractions for Stream-based Runtime Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stream-based monitoring assesses the health of safety-critical systems by transforming input streams of sensor measurements into output streams that determine a verdict. These inputs are often treated as accurate representations of the physical state, although real sensors introduce calibration and measurement errors. Such errors propagate through the monitor's computations and can distort the final verdict. Affine arithmetic with symbolic slack variables can track these errors precisely, but independent measurement noise introduces a fresh slack variable upon each measurement event, causing the monitor's state representation to grow without bound over time. Therefore, any bounded-memory monitoring algorithm must unify slack variables at runtime in a way that generates a sound approximation.
  This paper introduces zonotopes as an abstract domain for online monitoring of RLola specifications. We demonstrate that zonotopes precisely capture the affine state of the monitor and that their over-approximation produces a sound bounded-memory monitor. We present a comparison of different zonotope over-approximation strategies in the context of runtime monitoring, evaluating their performance and false-positive rates.</description>

      <title>Qihe: A General-Purpose Static Analysis Framework for Verilog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decades, static analysis has thrived in software, facilitating applications in bug detection, security, and program understanding. These advanced analyses are largely underpinned by general-purpose static analysis frameworks, which offer essential infrastructure to streamline their development. Conversely, hardware lacks such a framework, which overshadows the promising opportunities for sophisticated static analysis in hardware, hindering achievements akin to those witnessed in software. We thus introduce Qihe, the first general-purpose static analysis framework for Verilog -- a highly challenging endeavor given the absence of precedents in hardware. Qihe features an analysis-oriented front end, a Verilog-specific IR, and a suite of diverse fundamental analyses that capture essential hardware-specific characteristics -- such as bit-vector arithmetic, register synchronization, and digital component concurrency -- and enable the examination of intricate hardware data and control flows. These fundamental analyses are designed to support a wide array of hardware analysis clients. To validate Qihe's utility, we further developed a set of clients spanning bug detection, security, and program understanding. Our preliminary experimental results are highly promising; for example, Qihe uncovered 9 previously unknown bugs in popular real-world hardware projects (averaging 1.5K+ GitHub stars), all of which were confirmed by developers; moreover, Qihe successfully identified 18 bugs beyond the capabilities of existing static analyses for Verilog bug detection (i.e., linters), and detected 16 vulnerabilities in real-world hardware programs. By open-sourcing Qihe, which comprises over 100K lines of code, we aim to inspire further innovation and applications of sophisticated static analysis for hardware, aspiring to foster a similarly vibrant ecosystem that software analysis enjoys.</description>

      <title>Representing Molecules with Algebraic Data Types: Beyond SMILES and SELFIES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13633v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Benchmarks of molecular machine learning models often treat the molecular representation as a neutral input format, yet the representation defines the syntax of validity, edit operations, and invariances that models implicitly learn. We propose MolADT, a typed intermediate representation (IR) for molecules expressed as a family of algebraic data types that separates (i) constitution via Dietz-style bonding systems, (ii) 3D geometry and stereochemistry, and (iii) optional electronic annotations. By shifting from string edits to operations over structured values, MolADT makes representational assumptions explicit, supports deterministic validation and localized transformations, and provides hooks for symmetry-aware and Bayesian workflows. We provide a reference implementation in Haskell (open-source, archived with DOI) and worked examples demonstrating delocalised/multicentre bonding, validation invariants, reaction extensions, and group actions relevant to geometric learning.</description>

      <title>Optimism in Equality Saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Equality saturation is a technique for program optimization based on non-destructive rewriting and a form of program analysis called e-class analysis. The current form of e-class analysis is pessimistic and therefore ineffective at analyzing cyclic programs, such as those in SSA form. We propose an abstract interpretation algorithm that can precisely analyze cycles during equality saturation. This results in a unified algorithm for optimistic analysis and non-destructive rewriting. We instantiate this approach on a prototype abstract interpreter for SSA programs using a new semantics of SSA. Our prototype can analyze simple example programs more precisely than clang and gcc.</description>

      <title>Towards Industrial-scale Product Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of product configuration in the context of increasing customer demand for diverse and complex products. We propose a solution through a curated selection of product model benchmarks formulated in the COOM language, divided into three fragments of increasing complexity. Each fragment is accompanied by a corresponding bike model example, and additional scalable product models are included in the COOM suite, along with relevant resources. We outline an ASP-based workflow for solving COOM-based configuration problems, highlighting its adaptability to different paradigms and alternative ASP solutions. The COOM Suite aims to provide a comprehensive, accessible, and representative set of examples that can serve as a common ground for stakeholders in the field of product configuration.</description>
