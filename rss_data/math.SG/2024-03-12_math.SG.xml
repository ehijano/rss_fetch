      <title>A symplectic Hilbert-Smith conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove new cases of the Hilbert-Smith conjecture for actions by natural homeomorphisms in symplectic topology. Specifically, we prove that the group of $p$-adic integers $\mathbb Z_p$ does not admit non-trivial continuous actions by Hamiltonian homeomorphisms, the $C^0$ limits of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms, on symplectically aspherical symplectic manifolds. For a class of symplectic manifolds, including all standard symplectic tori, we deduce that a locally compact group acting faithfully by homeomorphisms in the $C^0$ closure of time-one maps of symplectic isotopies must be a Lie group. Our methods of proof differ from prior approaches to the question and involve barcodes and power operations in Floer cohomology. They also apply to other natural metrics in symplectic topology, notably Hofer's metric. An appendix by Leonid Polterovich uses this to deduce obstructions on Hamiltonian actions by semi-simple $p$-adic analytic groups.</description>

      <title>Spectral invariants for non-compactly supported Hamiltonians on the disc, and an application to the mean action spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a symplectic isotopy on the two-dimensional disc we show that the classical spectral invariants of Viterbo [20] can be extended in a meaningful way to {\it non-compactly} supported Hamiltonians. We establish some basic properties of these extended invariants and as an application we show that Hutchings' inequality in [8] between the Calabi invariant and the mean action spectrum holds without any assumptions on the isotopy; in [8] it is assumed that the Calabi invariant is less than the rotation number (or action) on the boundary.</description>

      <title>Chern Characteristics and Todd-Hirzebruch Identities for Transpolar Pairs of Toric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard toric geometry methods used to construct Calabi-Yau varieties may be extended to complete intersections in non-Fano varieties encoded by star triangulating non-convex polytopes. Similarly, mirror symmetry is conjectured to hold in terms of a transpolar duality generalizing the original construction of Batyrev and Borisov. The associated mirror pairs naturally include certain flip-folded, multi-layered multihedral objects, inclusively named VEX multitopes, and a correspondingly generalized transpolar duality. These self-overlaying VEX multitopes, long since known in pre-symplectic geometry, are found to correspond to certain non-algebraic but smooth toric spaces with Chern classes that satisfy the standard Todd-Hirzebruch identities. The computation of diffeomorphism invariants, including characteristic submanifold intersection numbers, corroborates their recent inclusion in the connected web of Calabi-Yau spaces and associated string compactifications: They arise together with the standard (Fano/reflexive polytope) constructions, within deformation families of generalized complete intersections in products of projective spaces.</description>

      <title>Shelukhin's Hofer distance and a symplectic cohomology barcode for contactomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper constructs a persistence module of Floer cohomology groups associated to a contactomorphism of the ideal boundary of a Liouville manifold. The barcode (or, bottleneck) distance between the persistence modules is bounded from above by Shelukhin's Hofer distance. Moreover, the barcode is supported (i.e., has spectrum) on the lengths of translated points of the contactomorphism. We use this structure to prove various existence results for translated points and to construct spectral invariants for contactomorphisms which are monotone with respect to positive paths and continuous with respect to Shelukhin's Hofer distance. While this paper was nearing completion, the author was made aware of similar upcoming work by Djordjevi\'c, Uljarevi\'c, Zhang.</description>

      <title>Recovering contact forms from boundary data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact connected smooth manifold with boundary. The paper deals with contact $1$-forms $\beta$ on $X$, whose Reeb vector fields $v_\beta$ admit Lyapunov functions $f$. We prove that any odd-dimensional $X$ admits such a contact form.
  We tackle the question: how to recover $X$ and $\beta$ from the appropriate data along the boundary $\partial X$? We describe such boundary data and prove that they allow for a reconstruction of the pair $(X, \beta)$, up to a diffeomorphism of $X$. We use the term ``holography" for the reconstruction. We say that objects or structures inside $X$ are {\it holographic}, if they can be reconstructed from their $v_\beta$-flow induced ``shadows" on the boundary $\partial X$.
  We also introduce numerical invariants that measure how ``wrinkled" the boundary $\partial X$ is with respect to the $v_\beta$-flow and study their holographic properties under the contact forms preserving embeddings of equidimensional contact manifolds with boundary. We get some ``non-squeezing results" about such contact embedding, which are reminiscent of Gromov's non-squeezing theorem in symplectic geometry.</description>

      <title>Extensible positive loops and vanishing of symplectic cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The symplectic cohomology of certain symplectic manifolds $W$ with non-compact ends modelled on the positive symplectization of a compact contact manifold $Y$ is shown to vanish whenever there is a positive loop of contactomorphisms of $Y$ which extends to a loop of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of $W$. An open string version of this result is also proved: the wrapped Floer cohomology of a Lagrangian $L$ with ideal Legendrian boundary $\Lambda$ is shown to vanish if there is a positive loop $\Lambda_{t}$ based at $\Lambda$ which extends to an exact loop of Lagrangians based at $L$. Various examples of such loops are considered. Applications include the construction of exotic compactly supported symplectomorphisms and exotic fillings of $\Lambda$.</description>
