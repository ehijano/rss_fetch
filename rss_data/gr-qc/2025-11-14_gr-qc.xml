      <title>A new regularization scheme for the wave function of the Universe in the Lorentzian path integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lorentzian path integral for the wave function of the Universe is only conditionally convergent and thus requires a well-defined prescription. The Picard-Lefschetz approach ensures convergence through contour deformation, but it has been argued that this leads to unsuppressed perturbations due to relevant saddle points residing in the region ${\rm Im}N&gt;0$. As an alternative, we propose a simple regulator for the lapse integral in minisuperspace. Specifically, we impose the vanishing initial size of the Universe via a delta function, represented as a narrow Gaussian of width $\sigma$, and take the limit $\sigma \to 0$ only after performing the functional integrations. This regulator has a clear physical interpretation: it corresponds to a vanishingly small quantum uncertainty in the initial size of the Universe. For any fixed $\sigma &gt; 0$, the lapse integral is absolutely convergent along (or slightly below) the real axis, and no excursion into the region ${\rm Im}N&gt;0$ is required. We further argue that the initial wave function for scalar and tensor perturbations should be incorporated in the Lorentzian path integral formalism, and we show that these perturbations are then appropriately suppressed. A purely Lorentzian path integral thus yields the tunneling wave function with suppressed perturbations. We also demonstrate that the Hartle-Hawking wave function can be reproduced by choosing a contour for the lapse integral extending from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$ that passes below the singularity near the origin.</description>

      <title>Dark matter by design: $Q$-balls, neural networks and galaxy rotation curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can a dynamically robust (\textit{aka} stable) $Q$-ball reproduce the rotation curve of a disk galaxy? In an astrophysical environment, $Q$-balls are non-topological solitons that are transparent and only perceived by their gravitational effects. Traditionally, scalar $Q$-balls are modelled with a polynomial potential, but axion-like periodic potentials are also expected to support such solitonic configurations. In the presence of angular momentum, $Q$-balls acquire a toroidal structure with a central density void, qualitatively resembling the structure of disk galaxies. Motivated by this similarity, we investigate whether rotating scalar $Q$-balls can reproduce the observed galactic rotation curves. In this work, we use a recently developed hybrid numerical framework that combines a high-accuracy pseudo-spectral method with a physics-informed neural network approach to construct both static and rotating $Q$-ball solutions. We then assess their ability to act as the dark matter halos in galaxies by fitting the observed rotation curves of a sample of disk galaxies from the SPARC catalogue. Our simplified model provides an overall good agreement with observational data; we have further found an average constraint on the scalar field particle's mass $m\sim 10^{-27}$ eV, in agreement with similar galactic-scale soliton solutions.</description>

      <title>Hybrid model for inspiral-merger-ringdown gravitational waveforms from comparable-mass, nonspinning binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from comparable-mass binary-black-hole mergers are often described in terms of three stages: inspiral, merger and ringdown. Post-Newtonian and black-hole perturbation theories are used to model the inspiral and ringdown parts of the waveform, respectively, while the merger phase has been modeled most accurately using numerical relativity (NR). Nevertheless, there have been several approaches used to model the merger phase using analytical methods. In this paper, we adapt a hybrid approximation method that applies post-Newtonian and black-hole perturbation theories at the same times in different spatial regions of a binary-black-hole waveform (and which are matched at a boundary region with prescribed dynamics). Prior work with the hybrid method used leading post-Newtonian theory and the perturbation theory of nonrotating black holes, which led to errors during the late inspiral and disagreement with the dominant quasinormal-mode frequency extracted from NR simulations during the ringdown. To obtain a better match with NR waveforms of binary-black-hole mergers, we made several phenomenological modifications to the hybrid method. Specifically, to better capture the inspiral dynamics, we use the effective-one-body method for modeling the trajectory of the boundary between the two spatial regions. The waveform is determined by evolving a Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli-type equation for an effective black-hole perturbation theory problem with a modified Poschl-Teller potential. By tuning the potential to match the dominant quasinormal-mode frequency of the remnant black hole and also optimizing the boundary data on the matching region, we could match NR waveforms from nonspinning, comparable-mass binary black holes with mass ratios between one and eight, with a relative error of order $10^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Photon counting readout for detection and inference of gravitational waves from neutron star merger remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves emitted after neutron star binary coalescences and the information they carry about dense matter are a high-priority target for next-generation detectors. Even though such detectors are expected to observe millions of signals, detectable post-merger emission will remain rare. In this work, we explore post-merger detectability and inference through an alternative detector readout scheme for data dominated by quantum-noise, which is the case above $1$\,kHz: photon-counting. In such a readout, signals and noise become quantized into discrete distributions corresponding to the detection of single photons measured in a chosen basis of modes. Through simulated data, we demonstrate that photon counting can be efficient even for weak signals. We find ${\sim}1$ in 100 signals with a post-merger signal-to-noise ratio of 0.2 can result in a single photon and thus be detected. Furthermore, after $2\times10^4$ signals -- equivalent to $10^{-2}$ to $1.5$ years of observation -- photon counting results in a twofold improvement in the measurement of the radius of a $1.6\,M_\odot$ neutron star. Constraints can be further tightened if the detector classical noise is reduced. Photon counting offers a promising alternative to traditional homodyne readout techniques for extracting information from low signal-to-noise ratio post-merger signals.</description>

      <title>Finite Populations &amp; Finite Time: The Non-Gaussianity of a Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong evidence for an isotropic, Gaussian gravitational wave background (GWB) has been found by multiple pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). The GWB is expected to be sourced by a finite population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) emitting in the PTA sensitivity band, and astrophysical inference of PTA data sets suggests a GWB signal that is at the higher end of GWB spectral amplitude estimates. However, current inference analyses make simplifying assumptions, such as modeling the GWB as Gaussian, assuming that all SMBHBs only emit at frequencies that are integer multiples of the total observing time, and ignoring the interference between the signals of different SMBHBs. In this paper, we build analytical and numerical models of an astrophysical GWB without the above approximations, and compare the statistical properties of its induced PTA signal to those of a signal produced by a Gaussian GWB. We show that interference effects introduce non-Gaussianities in the PTA signal, which are currently unmodeled in PTA analyses.</description>

      <title>Ladder Symmetry: The Necessary and Sufficient Condition for Vanishing Love Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes in four-dimensional, asymptotically flat general relativity have vanishing static tidal Love numbers (TLNs), a property tied to a hidden symmetry of the perturbation equations. Within the Konoplya-Rezzolla-Zhidenko (KRZ) parametrization, a subclass of spacetimes was previously shown to admit such Ladder symmetry, which enforces the absence of static scalar TLNs. In this work, we introduce parametric deformations to such Ladder-symmetric spacetimes and analyze the resultant linear tidal response. Using the parametrized formalism for TLNs, we show that any deviation from a Ladder-symmetric background leads to non-zero static scalar TLNs. This establishes Ladder symmetry as a necessary, as well as sufficient condition, for the vanishing of static TLNs in static, spherically symmetric black holes and in rotating black holes of the KRZ class.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbits and observational accretion disk around a Schwarzschild-like black hole surrounded by dark matter halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the dynamics of periodic orbits and the properties of accretion disks around a Schwarzschild-like black hole (BH) immersed in a King-type dark matter (DM) halo. Our analysis focuses on how the presence of the King DM halo influences both the behavior of periodic orbits and the radiative characteristics of the accretion disk. We begin by examining time-like periodic geodesic orbits for various configurations characterized by different energy and angular momentum values, represented by the integers $(z, w, v)$. Furthermore, we explore the effects of the King DM halo on time-like periodic geodesics, marginally bound orbits, and innermost stable circular orbits, thereby providing a deeper understanding of how the DM halo environment modifies the behavior of these stable orbits and timelike particle geodesics. Finally, we analyze the null geodesics and the accretion disk properties by studying their direct and secondary images, redshift distributions, and radiation fluxes as observed at infinity for a range of inclination angles. This approach allows us to gain valuable insights into the spacetime geometry of a Schwarzschild-like BH within the King-type DM halo, its physical and radiative properties in the accretion disk, and the corresponding observational implications.</description>

      <title>Veiled Singularities in Einstein-Weyl Gravity: Stability and Physical Interpretation of Horizonless Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a class of horizonless solutions in Einstein-Weyl gravity, corresponding to the so-called attractive naked singularities of the (-2,2) type. In contrast to General Relativity, where naked singularities are generically unstable and excluded by the cosmic censorship conjecture, we show that these configurations are linearly stable under tensor perturbations. By numerically evolving the perturbation equations in the time domain, we find that all modes decay with characteristic oscillatory tails, a behavior consistent with the dynamics of massive field perturbations in quadratic gravity. This establishes that attractive naked singularities in Einstein-Weyl gravity are dynamically stable and can persist as stationary configurations. We argue that these horizonless configurations are observationally concealed, and therefore we refer to them as veiled singularities. Their stability and phenomenological similarity to black holes suggest that they may represent viable horizonless alternatives in higher-derivative theories of gravity, offering a novel perspective on the interplay between singularity resolution, stability, and effective field dynamics beyond Einstein's theory.</description>

      <title>Black-hole scattering with numerical relativity: Self-force extraction and post-Minkowskian validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The asymptotic nature of unbound binary-black-hole encounters provides a clean method for comparing different approaches for modeling the two-body problem in general relativity. In this work, we use numerical relativity simulations of black-hole scattering, generated using the Spectral Einstein Code, to explore the self-force and post-Minkowskian expansions of the scattering angle. First, we use a set of unequal-mass simulations to extract the self-force contributions to the scattering angle. Our main result is that using information up to second-order in the symmetric mass ratio (2SF) reproduces numerical relativity within the error bars across the full range of mass-ratios, including equal mass. Next, we compare our numerical relativity results to state-of-the-art post-Minkowskian predictions at larger impact parameters than previously explored. We find good agreement in the weak-field regime and discuss the relative importance of higher-order terms.</description>

      <title>Confronting dark energy in Harada's Conformal Killing Gravity with observational data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a comprehensive analysis of recent observational data-a combination of DESI DR1, Planck CMB, and Pantheon+ SN Ia-this study critically evaluates the two dark energy (DE) proposals within Harada's Conformal Killing Gravity (CKG) model. The model in question predicts either a dominant phantom-type effective DE component with EoS $\omega = -5/3$ or a hybrid scenario combining a cosmological constant ($\omega = -1$) with a subdominant $\omega = -5/3$ fluid (around $5\%$) to address the Hubble tension (HT) and late-time acceleration. An analysis based on the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC) demonstrates that the pure CKG fluid scenario $\omega = -5/3$ is excluded, whereas the hybrid model remains only marginally compatible. Our Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis constrains the effective DE density parameter to $\Omega_{\text{eff}} = 0.009^{+0.006}_{-0.007}$ ($68\%$ CL), consistent with zero and ruling out the around $5\%$ contribution required by Harada's CKG. The resulting Hubble expansion history $H(z)$ and effective EoS $\omega_{\text{eff}}(z)$ are indistinguishable from those of $\Lambda$CDM. Bayesian model comparison via the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) shows no statistical preference for CKG over $\Lambda$CDM ($\Delta \text{AIC} = +2.6$), disfavoring the additional complexity of the CKG model. The key output of this study is that both DE proposals in Harada's CKG are ruled out by current cosmological data, and HT remains unresolved.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Atoms from Topological Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the bound states of a massive scalar field around a topological star, and show that these are strictly normal modes. This yields a genuine gravitational atom, sharply distinguishing horizonless objects from black holes. It is shown that the modes are controlled by the field's Compton wavelength compared to the size of the star. When the Compton wavelength is large, the field forms a cloud with a hydrogen-like spectrum, while in the opposite regime it localizes along timelike trajectories. When the two scales are comparable the spectrum becomes richer, and we characterize it in detail allowing the field to carry electric charge and Kaluza--Klein momentum.</description>

      <title>Generating optimal Gravitational-Wave template banks with metric-preserving autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a geometric placement algorithm for constructing template banks. We specialize in the case of Gravitational Wave searches, and use autoencoders for non-linear compression of the space of waveforms after these have been represented by a finite number of basis functions using an SVD decomposition. To ensure that the autoencoder is suitable for geometric placement we try to find a coordinate system describing the manifold of SVD coefficients such that distances in the latent and embedding space are equal. We show that the curvature of the banks is negligible and that such a system can be found. We then show that a geometric placement algorithm via a uniform grid in the latent space combined with rejection of unphysical points using a normalizing flow results in templates that, while slightly less in number than the similar construction using random forests of Ref.~\cite{Wadekar:2023kym}, perform slightly better in the effectualness tests, especially for high-mass binary systems. We discuss briefly how these dimensionality reduction techniques might be used in the context of cosmology, and a simple toy example where the periodicity of a flat manifold slightly complicates finding a distance-preserving coordinate system.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical and mathematical properties of the composed Reissner-Nordstr\"om-black-hole-massive-scalar-field system are studied {\it analytically} in the dimensionless large-mass $M\mu\gg1$ regime [here $\{M,\mu\}$ are respectively the mass of the central black hole and the proper mass of the scalar field]. It is proved that, for a given value ${\bar Q}\equiv Q/M$ of the dimensionless charge parameter of the central black hole, the system is characterized by the presence of quasi-resonances, linearized perturbation modes with arbitrarily long lifetimes. In particular, using analytical techniques, we determine the black-hole-field critical mass spectrum $\{M\mu_{\text{crit}}({\bar Q})\}$ which characterizes the long-lived resonances of the composed physical system.</description>

      <title>Learning Post-Newtonian Corrections from Numerical Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of gravitational waveforms from compact binary coalescences remains central to gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy. Post-Newtonian (PN) approximations capture the early inspiral dynamics analytically but break down near merger, while numerical relativity (NR) provides the accurate yet computationally expensive waveforms over limited parameter ranges. We develop a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework that learns corrections mapping PN dynamics and waveforms to their NR counterparts. As a demonstration of the approach, we use the TaylorT4 PN model as the baseline, and train the network on hybridized NR surrogate data (NRHybSur3dq8) to learn higher-order corrections to the orbital dynamics and waveform modes for nonspinning noneccentric systems. Physically motivated loss terms enforce known limits and symmetries, such as vanishing corrections in the Newtonian limit and suppression of odd-$m$ modes in equal-mass systems, promoting consistent and reliable extrapolation beyond the training region. We simultaneously incorporate corrections that account for the different meaning of mass parameters in PN and NR descriptions. The learned corrections significantly reduce the phase and amplitude error through the inspiral up to about $200M$ before the merger. This approach provides a differentiable and computationally efficient bridge between PN and NR, offering a path toward waveform models that generalize more robustly beyond existing NR datasets.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave polarization modes and the kinematical tensors in general relativity and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interrelationships between the expansion, the shear, and the vorticity -- the kinematical tensors -- on the one hand, and the polarization modes of gravitational waves on the other hand, are studied by considering freely falling test particles. After studying exact relations, we consider slowly moving particles under the influence of a weak gravitational field. Linearized plane waves of metric theories of gravity representative of those determined by a general second order Lagrangian, including General Relativity, are shown to exemplify the following interconnections: between the transverse components of the shear and the transverse tensor polarization mode; between the expansion, and both the transverse scalar and the longitudinal polarization modes; and between the longitudinal-transverse components of the shear and the vorticity, and the vector polarization mode.</description>

      <title>Straight and Wiggly Cosmic Strings in Horndeski Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, the behavior of a straight cosmic string is studied for the linearized version of Horndeski theory in cases where the scalar field is massless or massive. Several physical properties of such solutions are discussed in detail regarding the effects of the scalar field of this theory. The mass of the scalar field induces a screening effect such that, in the massive theory, the string solution approaches to the general relativistic one. We also consider wiggly cosmic strings, obtain the solutions for both massless and massive cases, discuss their properties and observe similar screening effects.</description>

      <title>Non-stationary noise in gravitational wave analyses: The wavelet domain noise covariance matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave detectors produce time series of the gravitational wave strain co-added with instrument noise. For evenly sampled data, such as from laser interferometers, it has been traditional to Fourier transform the data and perform analyses in the frequency domain. The motivation being that the Fourier domain noise covariance matrix will be diagonal if the noise properties are constant in time, which greatly simplifies and accelerates the analysis. However, if the noise is non-stationary this advantage is lost. It has been proposed that the time-frequency or wavelet domain is better suited for studying non-stationary noise, at least when the time variation is suitably slow, since then the wavelet domain noise covariance matrix is, to a good approximation, diagonal. Here we investigate the conditions under which the diagonal approximation is appropriate for the case of the Wilson-Daubechies-Meyer (WDM) wavelet packet basis, which is seeing increased use in gravitational wave data analysis. We show that so long as the noise varies slowly across a wavelet pixel, in both time {\em and} frequency, the WDM noise correlation matrix is well approximated as diagonal. The off-diagonal terms are proportional to the time and frequency derivatives of the dynamic spectral model. The same general picture should apply to other discrete wavelet transforms with wavelet filters that are suitably compact in time and frequency. Strategies for handling data with rapidly varying noise that violate these assumptions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Evading the BBN bound with a soft stiff period</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic inflation is the leading theory to explain early Universe history and structure formation. Non-oscillatory inflation is a class of models which can naturally introduce a post-inflationary stiff period of the Universe's evolution which boosts the signal of primordial gravitational waves (GWs), making it possible to observe them in forthcoming GW experiments. However, this pushes the GW energy density high enough to destabilise the process of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). This problem can be overcome by "softening" the stiff period, so that the field is gradually tending towards freefall from a frozen start. Here, we consider a modified hybrid inflation model where the stiff period is driven by the waterfall field, allowing the barotropic parameter of the Universe to vary, so that it does not violate the BBN constraint but produces a characteristic gravitational wave spectrum soon to be observable.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Limits on Strong Dark Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We showcase cosmology's ability to constrain long-range forces between dark matter particles. Specifically, we consider a fermionic dark matter interacting via a Yukawa-coupled light scalar, focusing on regimes where the dark forces are stronger than gravitational and yet unconstrained. We show that the dark sector dynamics, both at the background and perturbation levels, is far richer than what can be captured with just the static interparticle Yukawa potential. The background dynamics includes an attractor that funnels a wide range of initial conditions onto an evolution unique to each parameter space. In a large swath of parameter space beyond existing limits, the dark sector deviates drastically from cold dark matter in observable epochs. We rule out this parameter space using existing constraints on dark-sector equation of state and small-scale cosmic perturbations, thus setting the strongest constraints yet on dark matter self-interactions at length scales shorter than 100 kpc. In addition, we briefly discuss repulsive dark forces and place cosmological limits that are stricter than in the attractive case.</description>

      <title>Full spectrum of Love numbers of Reissner-Nordstrom black hole in D-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the full spectrum of tidal Love numbers for Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black holes in general spacetime dimensions. By perturbing the Einstein-Maxwell theory around the $D$-dimensional RN background, we derive an effective two dimensional quadratic action encompassing tensor, vector, and scalar-type perturbation sectors. Through diagonalization, we obtain master equations governing each sector and extract the corresponding Love numbers from the asymptotic behavior of the solutions. Our results confirm that all Love numbers vanish for four-dimensional RN black holes. In higher dimensions, the tensor and vector Love numbers reproduce previously known results. For the previously unknown scalar-type Love numbers, we show also they vanish for integer valued effective multipolar indices and display logarithmic running behavior when the corresponding indices are half integers.</description>

      <title>Fractional Dynamics in Galactic Nuclei: Non-Local Transport, Transient Phenomena and the Nullification of the Schwarzschild Barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the necessity of fractional calculus for modeling anomalous diffusion in stellar dynamics, specifically Resonant Relaxation (RR) near a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Standard transport theories rely on the local Fokker-Planck (FP) equation, a formalism restricted to Gaussian processes governed by the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). This approach fails for RR, which is a superdiffusive L\'{e}vy flight characterized by non-local transport and governed by the Generalized Central Limit Theorem (GCLT). We apply the space-fractional Fokker-Planck equation (FFPE), utilizing non-local Riemann-Liouville operators, to resolve major discrepancies between local theory and observations. In transient regimes, the FFPE predicts an immediate, linear flux ($\Gamma(t) \propto t$), consistent with high Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) rates in post-starburst galaxies, whereas local FP models predict an unphysical exponential delay ($\Gamma(t) \propto \exp(-C/t)$). Furthermore, we prove mathematically that the non-local integral operators permit ``barrier jumping''. This mechanism nullifies transport bottlenecks like the proposed Schwarzschild Barrier (SB). Local models incorrectly interpret the SB as severely suppressing Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspiral (EMRI) rates. We validate our theoretical findings using direct-summation $N$-body simulations incorporating relativistic corrections. The simulations confirm that particle flux remains continuous across the SB in the regime where RR dominates, demonstrating that the barrier does not inhibit EMRI production. The fractional framework provides the correct physical description for non-local transport, resolving long-standing problems concerning TDE and EMRI rates.</description>

      <title>Towards a Machine Learning Solution for Hubble Tension: Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) Analysis of Tsallis Holographic Dark Energy in Presence of Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework for reconstructing the redshift-dependent Hubble parameter \(H(z)\) within the Tsallis Holographic Dark Energy (THDE) model extended by massive neutrinos. In this approach, the modified Friedmann equation is incorporated into the neural network loss function, enabling training on Cosmic Chronometers data up to \(z \leq 2\). The framework allows for the simultaneous estimation of the Hubble constant \(H_0\), the neutrino density parameter \(\Omega_\nu\), and the Tsallis non-extensivity index \(\delta\). Uncertainty quantification is performed through dropout simulations, resulting in statistically consistent \(1\sigma\) confidence bands. Our results show that the THDE+$\nu$ model, reconstructed via PINN, alleviates the statistical Hubble tension from the canonical \(\sim 5\sigma\) level down to a range of \(0.5\sigma \leq T \leq 2.2\sigma\), depending on the redshift sampling. Additionally, we constrain the total neutrino mass to \(\Sigma m_\nu &lt; 0.11\,\text{eV}\). A detailed comparison with the traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis demonstrates the consistency of both methods, while highlighting the competitiveness of the PINN-based THDE framework as a robust, data-driven approach for non-parametric cosmological inference within generalized thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Searching for screened scalar forces with long-baseline atom interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Screened scalars are ubiquitous in many dark-sector models. They give rise to non-trivial fifth forces whilst evading experimental constraints through density-dependent screening mechanisms. We propose equipping a 10\,m-scale long-baseline atom interferometer with an annular planar source mass inside the vacuum chamber to search for such screened fifth forces. Two key challenges arise: distinguishing the static fifth force from backgrounds, and isolating it from the plate's Newtonian gravity. We introduce the `$Q$-flip protocol', which alternates between interferometry sequences to induce controllable time-dependence, aiding signal extraction and de-trending of transient noise. We further develop an \emph{in situ} calibration procedure to characterise the plate's Newtonian gravity and reach shot-noise-limited sensitivity. We show that our proposal could test theoretically motivated parameter space, advancing existing bounds in chameleon and symmetron screened scalar models by $1$ to $1.5$ orders of magnitude. Our proposal is directly applicable to forthcoming experiments, such as AION-10 or VLBAI, and is readily extensible to broader theoretical models and longer baselines.</description>

      <title>Traversable wormhole with double trace deformations via gravitational shear and sound channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how non-local gravitational couplings from double-trace deformation between two asymptotic boundaries of an AdS$_5$ black brane can lead to the violation of the Averaged Null Energy Condition (ANEC). The first-order gravitational perturbations backreact with the background metric at second-order, creating a wormhole opening. The wormhole becomes traversable in both the gravitational shear and sound channels within the hydrodynamic approximation. This shows that dynamical metric perturbations can facilitate information transfer in a purely gravitational setting, with the emergence of $G_N$ indicating the gravitational origin. For the shear channel, we consider three different coupling configurations, whereas for the sound channel, we vary both the speed of sound and the attenuation constant, as these parameters control the wormhole traversability. Furthermore, we obtain late-time power-law behavior in the ANEC using fitting function and present a generalization that applies to both shear and sound channels. Due to its propagating nature, the sound channel exhibits late-time power-law remnants at low sound speed similar to the vector diffusive probes, but it prefers an exponential decay at higher sound speed similar to the scalar non-diffusive probes, as the power-law exponent weakened with increasing sound speed. For superluminal sound channels, the wormhole opens for an extremely brief duration at late insertion times, rendering it non-traversable.</description>

      <title>Composite Dissipation in Warm Inflation: Implications for the Primordial Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Warm inflation is a well-motivated and generalized framework of inflation, describing a coupled inflaton-radiation bath. In this work, we investigate a warm inflation model with a quartic potential and a composite dissipation coefficient $\Upsilon(\phi, T) = C_1 \frac{T^3}{M_{\text{Pl}}^2} + C_2 \frac{T^3}{\phi^2}.$ The two terms in $\Upsilon$ dominate at different scales: the first term governs the early inflationary dynamics at large (CMB) scales, while the second term becomes significant at smaller scales. The model features two distinct stages of inflation: an initial phase where strong dissipation ($Q \gg 1$) generates a red-tilted primordial spectrum consistent with CMB observations (from ACT), followed by a second phase producing a blue-tilted spectrum with a significant amplification of power at small scales, leading to primordial black hole formation. We analyze the effects of key parameters -- like the duration of each inflationary phase, the slow-roll parameter at the end of the first phase, the dissipation strength at the pivot scale, and the choice of the growth function -- on the primordial power spectrum and its spectral index. Additionally, we examine the consistency of the model with the swampland distance conjecture and trans-Planckian conjecture, needed for embedding these models with some UV complete theories. This work highlights the potential of warm inflation with a composite dissipation coefficient to reconcile large-scale CMB measurements with small-scale structure formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a conceptual parallel between the black hole information problem and Zeno's paradox, highlighting the role of limiting procedures that turn formally infinite constructions into finite physical observables. Building on the replica--wormhole paradigm, we move beyond unitarity restoration to formulate a quantitative notion of irreversibility in Hawking radiation. Our main result is a modular thermodynamic framework for black-hole evaporation, in which modular entropy, entanglement capacity, and relative entropy assume thermodynamic roles. The monotonicity of relative entropy furnishes a generalized second law that determines the arrow of evolution in replica space. We further resolve the apparent tension between the replica method and the quantum no-cloning theorem by interpreting replicas as ensemble representations rather than physical copies of an unknown state, thereby clarifying the operational meaning of gravitational path integrals. A key message of this work is that non-additivity in Tsallis statistics provides an information-theoretic analogue of the correlations induced by replica wormholes.</description>

      <title>Probing AGN Disks Density Profiles through Gravitational Wave Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive black holes surrounded by a gaseous disk have been a prevailing model to explain a wide spectrum of astrophysical phenomena related to active galactic nucle (AGNs). However, direct and precise measurements of the disk density profiles remain elusive for current telescopes. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to pinpoint the gas density if an inspiralling stellar mass binary black hole is embedded in the AGN disk. Furthermore, if the barycenter of the pair follows an eccentric orbit around an AGN, then space-borne gravitational wave detectors can measure the density of the surrounding disk with multi-year observations by tracking the gravitational wave evolution. The error between the inferred density profile and the injected truth can be constrained to below $2\times10^{-11}\rm g/cm^3$. Our work opens up an exciting new channel to investigate the very center of galaxies, where disk gas density distributions $\rho(r)$ can be recovered by analyzing time-dependent environmental imprints in gravitational waveforms.</description>

Abstract: We study Dirac fields on AdS$_n$ in both global and Poincar\'e charts and, for each mass window, we classify the boundary conditions at conformal infinity that ensure the existence of advanced and retarded propagators. We distinguish the well-known MIT--bag class from a generalized family, thereby extending to arbitrary dimensions the procedure initiated by Blanco. As in the scalar case, we show that suitable generalized boundary data can support bound states. In four dimensions we work out two explicit examples: (i) the MIT case, for which we construct the advanced/retarded propagators and the two-point function of the associated ground state and (ii) a representative generalized boundary condition, for which we construct the propagators and exhibit a normalizable bound state.</description>

Abstract: Lee-Yang zero theory plays a crucial role in phase transition theory and is widely employed in the critical behavior of statistical thermodynamics. The supercritical regime of black hole thermodynamics remains a relatively unexplored area, and recent applications of this theory to charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes have initiated probes into this regime, revealing a simple structure partitioned by a single Widom line. In this paper, we apply Lee-Yang theory to charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes, which feature complex phase diagrams (e.g., triple points), to determine how such structures are reflected in the supercritical regime. Notably, we observe a key dimensional difference in that the five-dimensional (5d) system, which lacks a triple point, confirms the known single Widom line structure, while the six-dimensional (6d) system, which admits a triple point, generates two distinct Widom lines. These lines partition the supercritical domain into three sectors (small-, intermediate-, and large- black hole-like phases), corresponding to the three phases coexisting at the triple point. Our results reveal a direct correspondence between the number of coexisting phases at a triple point and the number of distinct supercritical sectors separated by Widom lines.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter from Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous studies have examined the holographic principle as a means of producing dark energy. Here we propose instead the possibility of holographic dark matter. In this case, dark matter does not arise in the framework of particle physics but is derived from the infrared cutoff set by the horizon scale. Using the Ricci cutoff, and a universe containing only baryons and radiation, we can account for the dark matter and naturally explain the coincidence between baryonic and nonbaryonic contributions to the density. In the presence of a pre-existing vacuum energy density our model reverses the sign of this density, thus accounting for the fact that certain string theories generically predict a negative vacuum energy, but observations require a positive value.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Simplicity and Scattering in General Relativity from Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fate of asymptotic simplicity in physically relevant settings of compact-object scattering. Using the stress tensor of a two-body system as a source, we compute the spacetime metric in General Relativity at finite observer distance in an asymptotic expansion. To do so, we relate the metric to the final-state graviton one-point function in momentum space, which is computed using perturbative QFT techniques. Both the simple pole and the infrared-related logarithmic branch cut in the virtuality of the external graviton contribute nontrivially. We focus on determining the fall-off behavior of the Newman-Penrose scalars, confirming previous predictions that Sachs's peeling property is violated at leading order in the post-Minkowski expansion. Our analysis at higher orders in the post-Minkowskian expansion reveals a significantly stronger breakdown of the peeling property than previously recognized, which is the result of nonlinear, long-range interactions between localized sources and the surrounding gravitational field.</description>

      <title>Analytical approximations for curved primordial tensor spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build upon previous analytical treatments of scalar perturbations in curved inflationary universes to obtain analytical templates for the primordial tensor power spectrum in models with non-zero primordial spatial curvature. These templates are derived without assuming a particular inflaton potential, thereby isolating the universal imprints of curvature on tensor modes. Our results predict characteristic large-scale features -- including low-$\ell$ cut-offs and oscillatory patterns -- that are consistent with numerical solutions and provide a clear physical interpretation of how curvature modifies the underlying dynamics. In particular, we show that curvature effects manifest mathematically as systematic shifts in the dynamically relevant wavevectors, mirroring the behaviour previously identified in the scalar power spectrum. These features translate into distinctive signatures in the large-angle $B$-mode polarisation spectrum, offering a potential discriminant for spatial curvature in forthcoming CMB observations.</description>

      <title>Tests of General Relativity with GWTC-3</title>

Abstract: The ever-increasing number of detections of gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binaries by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors allows us to perform ever-more sensitive tests of general relativity (GR) in the dynamical and strong-field regime of gravity. We perform a suite of tests of GR using the compact binary signals observed during the second half of the third observing run of those detectors. We restrict our analysis to the 15 confident signals that have false alarm rates $\leq 10^{-3}\, {\rm yr}^{-1}$. In addition to signals consistent with binary black hole (BH) mergers, the new events include GW200115_042309, a signal consistent with a neutron star--BH merger. We find the residual power, after subtracting the best fit waveform from the data for each event, to be consistent with the detector noise. Additionally, we find all the post-Newtonian deformation coefficients to be consistent with the predictions from GR, with an improvement by a factor of ~2 in the -1PN parameter. We also find that the spin-induced quadrupole moments of the binary BH constituents are consistent with those of Kerr BHs in GR. We find no evidence for dispersion of GWs, non-GR modes of polarization, or post-merger echoes in the events that were analyzed. We update the bound on the mass of the graviton, at 90% credibility, to $m_g \leq 1.27 \times 10^{-23} \mathrm{eV}/c^2$. The final mass and final spin as inferred from the pre-merger and post-merger parts of the waveform are consistent with each other. The studies of the properties of the remnant BHs, including deviations of the quasi-normal mode frequencies and damping times, show consistency with the predictions of GR. In addition to considering signals individually, we also combine results from the catalog of GW signals to calculate more precise population constraints. We find no evidence in support of physics beyond GR.</description>

      <title>Spinning particles near Kerr black holes: Orbits and gravitational-wave fluxes through the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals are among the key sources of gravitational waves for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna space-based gravitational-wave detector. Achieving sufficient accuracy in the gravitational-wave template for these binaries requires modeling the effects of the spin of the comparably light secondary compact object. In this work, we employ the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equations for the motion of spinning bodies in Kerr space-time for the first time to obtain general bound orbits. Specifically, we implement a new solver for the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations of motion reduced to first-order form. Our approach provide novel semianalytical expressions for the spin corrections to the orbital motion and frequencies, valid for any choice of referential geodesics, and new analytic expressions for the constants of motion shifts. Then, using the Teukolsky formalism, we compute gravitational-wave energy and angular-momentum fluxes sourced by these orbits valid to linear order in secondary spin and provide waveform snapshots corresponding to the motion. The solver and the novel method we have developed substantially improve on previous studies in terms of speed and accuracy. Additionally, we include the full effect of a general precessing secondary spin in the waveform for the first time. As such, it provides a breakthrough building block for the modeling of waveforms of precessing compact binaries at large mass ratios.</description>

      <title>Numerical gravitational backreaction on cosmic string loops from simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the results of performing computational gravitational backreaction on cosmic string loops taken from a network simulation. The principal effect of backreaction is to smooth out small-scale structure on loops, which we demonstrate by various measures including the average loop power spectrum and the distribution of kink angles on the loops. Backreaction does lead to self-intersections in most cases, but these are typically small. An important effect discussed in prior work is the rounding off of kinks to form cusps, but we find that the cusps produced by that process are very weak and do not significantly contribute to the total gravitational-wave radiation of the loop. We comment briefly on extrapolating our results to loops as they would be found in nature.</description>

      <title>Detectability of Massive Boson Stars using Gravitational Waves from Fundamental Oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boson Stars are macroscopic self-gravitating configurations made of complex scalar fields. These exotic compact objects would manifest as dark Boson stars and, in the absence of electromagnetic signatures, could mimic properties of compact stars in the gravitational wave spectrum. In a recent study, using the simplest potential for massive Boson stars, we demonstrated that fundamental non-radial oscillations ($f$-modes) obey scaling relations that allow them to be distinguished from neutron stars and black holes. In this work, we provide analytical fits for these scaling relations, valid for the dark matter parameter space compatible with current astrophysical and cosmological data, that can be directly incorporated into future studies of massive Boson stars in the strong coupling regime, avoiding the need for numerical calculations. We also provide analytical fits for empirical and universal relations for gravitational wave asteroseismology, which can be used to infer microscopic dark matter properties following a successful detection. Further, we investigate the possibility of detection of $f$-modes and the dark matter parameter space that can be probed with current and future gravitational wave detectors across multiple frequency bands. Assuming a burst gravitational wave model and demanding a signal-to-noise ratio of 5, we show that the current and future detectors can, in principle, probe Boson star $f$-modes up to cosmological distances: 1 Mpc with aLIGO, 30 Mpc with Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope, and in the best case scenario, about 300 Mpc with LISA.</description>

      <title>How gravitational waves change photon orbital angular momentum quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the evolution of vortex light in the presence of gravitational waves (GWs) and demonstrate that the quantized orbital angular momentum (OAM) states can make transitions to other states due to the GWs. The interaction is calculated based on the framework of the wave propagation in linearized gravity theory and canonical quantization of the light field in curved spacetime. It is found that when a photon possessing OAM of $l$ interacts with GWs, the OAM modes of $l\pm1$ and $l\pm2$ may be excited with probabilities of $P_{l\pm1}\sim 10^{-17}$ and $P_{l\pm2}\sim 10^{-20}$, respectively. Higher probabilities of the transitions can be achieved when the photon radial wave vector or the propagation distance is increased, or when the photons encounter GWs with stronger amplitudes or smaller frequencies. Thus, a new GW detection technique is proposed, which may exhibit good performance in a wide range of GW frequencies. Furthermore, the detector is insensitive to seismic noise and is more advantageous for determining the distance of the source compared to current interferometer detectors.</description>

      <title>Effects of bumblebee gravity on neutrino motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02290v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores how the spontaneous violation of Lorentz symmetry -- modeled through a black hole solution in the context of bumblebee gravity -- affects the propagation and dynamics of neutrinos. The investigation centers on three distinct aspects: the rate of energy deposition due to neutrino-antineutrino pair annihilation, modifications to the neutrino oscillation phase driven by the underlying spacetime structure, and the influence of gravitational lensing on flavor conversion probabilities. To support the theoretical considerations, numerical simulations are conducted for oscillation probabilities in a two-flavor framework, taking into account both normal and inverted mass orderings. For comparison, the outcomes are juxtaposed with those obtained in a different Lorentz-violating background, namely, a black hole solution within Kalb-Ramond gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18892v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate $g$-mode oscillations in dark matter admixed neutron stars employing a relativistic mean field model to describe hadronic matter and a model for self-interacting fermionic dark matter motivated by the neutron decay anomaly. Following the construction of such admixed configurations, we derive the equilibrium and adiabatic speeds of sound therein, leading to a computation of the star's $g$-mode spectrum in the Cowling approximation. In particular, we explore the effect of dark matter self-interaction, the nucleon effective mass and dark matter fraction on the principal $g$-mode frequency, and its first overtone. We show that the effect on $g$-mode frequency depends predominantly on the dark matter fraction, and demonstrate an equation of state-independent constraint for the latter. Prospects of identifying the presence of dark matter in neutron stars using $g$-mode are discussed.</description>

      <title>Peaking into the abyss: Characterizing the merger of equatorial-eccentric-geodesic plunges in rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05870v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the gravitational waveforms generated by critical, equatorial plunging geodesics of the Kerr metric that start from an unstable-circular-orbit, which describe the test-mass limit of spin-aligned eccentric black-hole mergers. The waveforms are generated employing a time-domain Teukolsky code. We span different values of the Kerr spin $-0.99 \le a \le 0.99 $ and of the critical eccentricity $e_c$, for bound ($0 \le e_c&lt;1$) and unbound plunges ($e_c \ge 1$). We find that, contrary to expectations, the waveform modes $h_{\ell m}$ do not always manifest a peak for high eccentricities or spins. In case of the dominant $h_{22}$ mode, we determine the precise region of the parameter space in which its peak exists. In this region, we provide a characterization of the merger quantities of the $h_{22}$ mode and of the higher-order modes, providing the merger structure of the equatorial eccentric plunges of the Kerr spacetime in the test-mass limit.</description>

      <title>The Tension of Space as Dark Energy: A No Geometric Sequestering Theorem for Minimal Sequesters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model space as an elastic membrane and identify its uniform tension $T_s$ with the vacuum energy density of space. The central result is a no geometric sequestering theorem. In any minimal matter vacuum sequester framework where a global constraint cancels constant contributions from the matter sector by adjusting a global variable, a purely geometric unit operator remains intact. Concretely a volume term of the form $S_s = - T_s \int \sqrt{-g} \, d^4 x$ does not couple to the global variable that enforces the matter cancellation and it survives unchanged in the local field equations. We establish this result within a covariant effective field theory using the background field method. The analysis shows that the coefficient $T_s$ is renormalized by graviton loops and in general by mixed matter-graviton loops and therefore runs with the renormalization scale $\mu$. The running defines an effective cosmological term $T_s(\mu)$ that is present even after the matter vacuum energy has been neutralized by the sequester constraint. In particular we find that $T_s(\mu)$ sources $G_{\mu \nu} = - T_s(\mu) \, g_{\mu \nu} + \cdots$. The tension term $T_s(\mu)$ can then be understood as residual dark energy in the minimal sequestering framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A nonlinear Lorentz invariant kinetic diffusion equation is introduced, which is consistent with the conservation laws of particles number, energy and momentum. The equilibrium solution converges to the Maxwellian density in the Newtonian limit, but it is not given by the J\"uttner distribution commonly employed in relativistic kinetic theory. The nonlinear kinetic diffusion equation on a general Lorentzian manifold is consistent with the contracted Bianchi identities and therefore can be coupled to the Einstein equations of general relativity.</description>

      <title>On the fate of spacetime singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I investigate spacetime singularities from the point of view of the wavefunction of the universe. In order to extend the classical notion of geodesic incompleteness one has to include the proper time of an observer as a degree of freedom in the Wheeler DeWitt equation. This leads to a Schr\"odinger equation along the observer worldline. Near the singularity, as in the classical BLK treatment, I ignore spatial gradients and effectively describe the spacetime around the worldline in the mini-superspace approximation. Then the problem proves identical to a spherically symmetric scattering of a quantum particle off a central potential and singularity avoidance is tantamount to unitary evolution for this system. Standard types of matter (dust, radiation) correspond to regular potentials and thus lead to a bounce. The most singular component, spatial anisotropy, is associated to a conserved charge and yields a negative inverse-square potential -- like standard angular momentum, but with opposite sign. This potential is critical, in that the unitarity of the evolution depends on the actual numerical factor in front of it, i.e., on the anisotropy charge.</description>

      <title>Is the $\Lambda$CDM Model in Crisis?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17124v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present strong evidence for dynamical dark energy that challenges the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Several dark energy scenarios are explored, including $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, logarithmic, exponential, JBP, and BA parameterizations, along with non-flat cosmologies allowing for spatial curvature ($\Omega_k \neq 0$). Our analysis supports a flat Universe with $\Omega_k \approx 0$. Using MCMC techniques, we constrain these models with observational data from DESI~DR2 baryon acoustic oscillations, Type~Ia supernovae, and compressed CMB likelihoods. The results provide strong statistical evidence that $\omega \neq -1$, favoring dynamical dark-energy behavior consistent with a Quintom-B scenario ($\omega_0 &gt; -1$, $\omega_a &lt; 0$, and $\omega_0 + \omega_a &lt; -1$). We also derive upper bounds on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu$, using CMB + DESI~DR2 data: $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.066~\mathrm{eV}$ for $\Lambda$CDM and $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.075~\mathrm{eV}$ for $\omega$CDM. In the non-flat extensions, o$\Lambda$CDM and o$\omega$CDM, the limits relax to $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.263~\mathrm{eV}$ and $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.520~\mathrm{eV}$, respectively. For the other models $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, logarithmic, exponential, JBP, BA, and GEDE the constraints range between $&lt;0.043$ and $&lt;0.127~\mathrm{eV}$. The effective number of relativistic species remains consistent with the standard value, $N_{\mathrm{eff}} = 3.044$, across all models. Bayesian evidence further shows that combining DES-SN5Y or Union3 supernova samples with CMB + DESI~DR2 produces measurable deviations from $\Lambda$CDM. Although no model reaches the $5\sigma$ significance threshold, several exhibit tensions exceeding $3\sigma$, suggesting emerging cracks in the cosmological constant paradigm.</description>

      <title>Localized five-dimensional rotating brane-world black hole Analytically Connected to an to an AdS$_5$ boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a method to describe the geometry of an analytic, exponentially localized $5D$ rotating braneworld black hole, using the $5D$ Janis Newman algorithm in Hopf coordinates. The induced metric on the brane matches the standard $4D$ Kerr spacetime. Two curvature singularities arise: one confined to the $3$-brane at $z = r = 0$, and another that, on the brane, reproduces the Kerr singularity at $r = 0$, $\bar{\theta} = \pi/2$. The inner and event horizons, together with the stationary limit hypersurfaces, extend into the extra dimension in a pancake-like shape. We describe their behavior in the bulk.
  The energy momentum tensor represents a source transitioning from an anisotropic, non diagonal structure to a vacuum with negative cosmological constant. Thus, the localized black hole connects to an AdS$_5$ boundary. The geometry is supported by a non-diagonal anisotropic fluid in the bulk, requiring no matter on the brane. To evaluate the energy conditions, we use a one form from the dual basis that yields a diagonal energy momentum tensor.</description>

      <title>Invariant property of matter Lagrangian $\mathcal{L_{M}}$ from thermodynamic point of view and its astrophysical implications in $f(R,T)$ theory of gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The correct choice for the matter Lagrangian $(\mathcal{L_{M}})$ in the framework of $f(R,T)$ theory of gravity, has been a fundamental yet often overlooked ambiguity. It has been a long-standing issue, whether to choose $\mathcal{L_{M}}=p$ or $-\rho$ as the proper definition of matter sector. In this work, we show that both choices lead to the same energy-momentum tensor, from thermodynamic point of view. However, for these two choices, the structure of the TOV equations are different. We construct and solve TOV equations using MIT bag model equation of state for $\mathcal{L_{M}}=p$ and $-\rho$, and study the impact of the choices for matter Lagrangian on the maximum mass limit as well as M-R plot of compact stars. It is interesting to note that allowed range of gravity-matter coupling coefficient $(\alpha_{c})$ is also different for $\mathcal{L_{M}}=p$ and $\mathcal{L_{M}}=-\rho$, i.e., $\alpha_{c}$ can not be taken arbitrarily. Notably, through $\mathcal{L_{M}}=p$, we achieve a maximum mass of $2.78~M_{\odot}$, whereas for $\mathcal{L_{M}}=-\rho$, we obtain a maximum mass of $2.41~M_{\odot}$. So, despite the same energy-momentum tensor for different choices of $\mathcal{L_{M}}$, the upper limit of maximum mass is significantly modified.</description>

Abstract: We extend the conformal dimensional-derivative regularization of four-dimensional Gauss- Bonnet gravity to Riemann-Cartan geometry, obtaining a regularized action whose torsionless limit equals the well-known regularized four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet model. Varying independently with respect to the scalar, tetrad, and spin connection yields field equations that remain strictly second order in covariant derivatives, thereby avoiding Ostrogradsky-type instabil- ities. Within this framework we obtain static, spherically symmetric black holes carrying torsion hair, showing that the regularized Gauss-Bonnet interaction can support long-range torsion hair without invoking extra dimensions.</description>

      <title>Extracting Properties of Dark Dense Environments around Black Holes from Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) can form dense condensates around black holes (BHs), such as superradiant clouds and ultracompact mini halos, which can significantly affect the orbital evolution of their companion objects through dynamical friction (DF). In this work, we define a novel quantity to quantify such effects in the emitted gravitational waves (GWs) in terms of GW amplitude, frequency, and their time derivatives. The information about the density profile can be extracted from this quantity, which characterizes the type of condensate and, therefore, the corresponding DM property. This quantity allows us to probe the dark dense environment by multi-wavelength GW observation with existing ground-based and future space-based GW detectors, potentially revealing the properties of the dark sector and shedding light on the primordial origin of the stellar mass BHs. A null detection can place strong constraints on the relevant DM parameters.</description>

Abstract: By studying the Raychaudhuri equation for the gravitational force resulting from a string T-duality modified propagator, we present an analysis of the geodesic compression beyond the conventional classical limit. The result is that gravity on short length scales is subject to a screening effect similar to the Debye screening in electrostatics, which prevents the formation of curvature singularities. Using model-independent arguments, we conclude that the conventional attractive nature of gravity is only a low-energy effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18695v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical hydrodynamics simulations of gases dominated by ideal, nondegenerate matter pressure and thermal radiation pressure in equilibrium entail finding the temperature as part of the evolution. Since the temperature is not typically a variable that is evolved independently, it must be extracted from the the evolved variables (e.g. the rest-mass density and specific internal energy). This extraction requires solving a quartic equation, which, in many applications, is done numerically using an iterative root-finding method. Here we show instead how the equation can be solved analytically and provide explicit expressions for the solution. We also derive Taylor expansions in limiting regimes and discuss the respective advantages and disadvantages of the iterative versus analytic approaches to solving the quartic.</description>

      <title>Loops in inflation with strongly non-geodesic motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study loop corrections in the effective field theory of inflation with imaginary speed of sound, which has been shown to provide an effective description of multi-field inflationary models characterized by strongly non-geodesic motion and heavy entropic perturbations. We focus on the one-loop corrections to the scalar and tensor power spectra, taking into account all relevant vertices at leading order in derivatives and in slow-roll. We find a power-law dependence of the scalar two-point function on the scale that defines the range of validity of the effective theory, analogous to the enhancement observed in tree-level correlation functions. Even more dramatic, the relative correction to the tensor spectrum is exponentially enhanced, albeit also suppressed in the slow-roll limit. In spite of these large effects, our results show that this class of models can satisfy the requirement of perturbative control and a consistent loop expansion within a range of parameters of phenomenological interest. On the other hand, models predicting large values of the power spectrum on small scales are found to be under strong tension. As a technical bonus, we carefully explain the prescription for the regularization and manipulation of loop integrals in this set-up, where one has a non-trivial domain of integration for time and momentum integrals owing to the regime of validity of the effective field theory. This procedure is general enough to be of potential applicability in other contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20943v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the broad landscape of holographic complexity measures for theories dual to two-dimensional (2D) dilaton gravity. Previous studies have largely focused on the complexity=volume and complexity=action proposals for holographic complexity. Here we systematically construct and analyze a wide class of generalized complexity functionals, focusing on codimension-one bulk observables. Two complementary approaches are presented: one inspired by dimensional reduction of codimension-one observables from higher-dimensional gravity, and another that adopts a purely 2D perspective. We verify the resulting observables exhibit hallmark features of complexity, such as linear growth at late times and the switchback effect. We further offer heuristic interpretations of the role of multiple extremal surfaces when they appear. Finally, we comment on the bulk-to-boundary dictionary via the covariant Peierls bracket in 2D gravity. Our work lays the groundwork for a richer understanding of quantum complexity in low-dimensional holographic dualities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological perturbation theory provides a fundamental framework for analyzing the evolution of density fluctuations and gravitational potentials in the Universe. It plays a crucial role in understanding large-scale structure formation and cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. In this study, we apply perturbation theory to the minimally extended varying speed of light (meVSL) model to investigate the effects of a varying speed of light on the matter density contrast and the Newtonian gravitational potential. Unlike conventional models with a constant speed of light, the meVSL model introduces modifications to the cosmological evolution equations, leading to potential deviations in structure formation and gravitational interactions. By deriving and analyzing the perturbed equations within this framework, we explore how a varying speed of light affects the growth of density perturbations and the evolution of gravitational potentials. Compared to the standard constant speed of the light model, we find deviations of approximately $2$\% in the subhorizon modes of both quantities. Although detecting these effects observationally remains a significant challenge, our results provide new theoretical insights into the meVSL model and its potential observational signatures, such as the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect and gravitational lensing of the CMB.</description>

      <title>Fast and accurate parameter estimation of high-redshift sources with the Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Einstein Telescope (ET), along with other third-generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors, will be a key instrument for detecting GWs in the coming decades. However, analyzing the data and estimating source parameters will be challenging, especially given the large number of expected detections-on the order of $10^5$ per year-which makes current methods based on stochastic sampling impractical. In this work, we use Dingo-IS to perform neural posterior estimation (NPE) of high-redshift events detectable with ET in its triangular configuration. NPE is a likelihood-free inference technique that leverages normalizing flows to approximate posterior distributions. After training, inference is fast, requiring only a few minutes per source, and accurate, as corrected through importance sampling and validated against standard Bayesian inference methods. To confirm previous findings on the ability to estimate parameters for high-redshift sources with ET, we compare NPE results with predictions from the Fisher information matrix (FIM) approximation. We find that NPE correctly recovers the eight degenerate sky modes induced by the triangular detector geometry, missed by the FIM analysis, resulting in an underestimation of sky localization uncertainties for most sources. FIM also overestimates the uncertainty in luminosity distance by a factor of $\sim 3$ on average when the injected luminosity distance is $d^{\mathrm{inj}}_{\mathrm{L}} &gt; 10^5~$Mpc, further confirming that ET will be particularly well suited for studying the early Universe.</description>

Abstract: Alexei Starobinsky is one of the main authors of inflationary cosmology. Here I will discuss the Starobinsky model and its generalizations, including the theory of $\alpha$-attractors. I will then describe the current status of these models in light of the latest observational results from ACT, SPT, and DESI.</description>

      <title>Can "premature collapse" form black holes in the upper and lower mass gaps?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers, including the recent signals GW231123 and GW230529, have revealed multiple progenitor black holes in the so-called upper and lower mass gaps, respectively. It is generally assumed that massive stars cannot form black holes in the upper mass gap because pair instabilities in the late stage of stellar evolution disrupt the stars, whereas the lower mass gap refers to the gap between the maximum allowed neutron star mass and the smallest black hole mass expected to form in supernova explosions. Here we explore a "premature collapse" scenario in which upper mass gap stars collapse and form black holes before they reach the late stage of stellar evolution. The mechanism for triggering a premature collapse is the capture of a smaller black hole, possibly primordial in nature. A similar capture scenario can occur to produce black holes in the lower mass gap. At least for massive stars, typical stellar rotation rates would likely result in rapidly rotating black holes in such a scenario, naturally explaining the rapid spins inferred from GW231123. Even though our estimates hinge on several parameters with rather large uncertainties, they suggest that, at least in galactic disks, the likelihood of such a capture is small for stars in the upper mass gap, but may lead to a significant population of black holes in the lower mass gap and, in fact, even below the lower mass gap.</description>

      <title>On the Field Excursion Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent work, Herderschee and Wall (HW) proved a bound on scalar field excursions in spatially flat FRW cosmologies. In this note, we give an alternate proof of their bound using the Friedmann equations, and we prove that it can be saturated only in universes with vanishing acceleration, $\ddot a =0$. We argue that in a realistic (eternal) inflation scenario, the bound is robust against quantum corrections and spacetime curvature, and it can be violated by higher-derivative corrections only at the expense of a superluminal speed of sound. We further speculate on possible connections between the swampland program and the vacuum estimates given in the work of HW.</description>

      <title>Direct multi-model dark-matter search with gravitational-wave interferometers using data from the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27022v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave detectors can probe the existence of dark matter with exquisite sensitivity. Here, we perform a search for three kinds of dark matter -- dilatons (spin-0), dark photons (spin-1) and tensor bosons (spin-2) -- using three independent methods on the first part of the most recent data from the fourth observing run of LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA. Each form of dark matter could have interacted with different standard-model particles in the instruments, causing unique differential strains on the interferometers. While we do not find any evidence for a signal, we place the most stringent upper limits to-date on each of these models. For scalars with masses between $[4\times 10^{-14},1.5\times 10^{-13}]$ eV that couple to photons or electrons, our constraints improve upon those from the third observing run by one order of magnitude, with the tightest limit of $\sim 10^{-20}\,\text{GeV}^{-1}$ at a mass of $\sim2\times 10^{-13}\text{ eV}$. For vectors with masses between $[7\times 10^{-13},8.47\times 10^{-12}]$ eV that couple to baryons, our constraints supersede those from MICROSCOPE and E\"ot-Wash by one to two orders of magnitude, reaching a minimum of $\sim 5\times 10^{-24}$ at a mass of $\sim 10^{-12}$ eV. For tensors with masses of $[4\times 10^{-14},8.47\times 10^{-12}]$ eV (the full mass range analyzed) that couple via a Yukawa interaction, our constraints surpass those from fifth-force experiments by four to five orders of magnitude, achieving a limit as low as $\sim 8\times 10^{-9}$ at $\sim2\times 10^{-13}$ eV. Our results show that gravitational-wave interferometers have become frontiers for new physics and laboratories for direct multi-model dark-matter detection.</description>
