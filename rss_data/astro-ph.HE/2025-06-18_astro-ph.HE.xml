      <title>A NICER view of the 1.4 solar-mass edge-on pulsar PSR J0614--3329</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Four neutron star radius measurements have already been obtained by modeling the X-ray pulses of rotation-powered millisecond pulsars observed by the Neutron Star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER). We report here the radius measurement of PSR J0614$-$3329 employing the same method with NICER and XMM-Newton data using Bayesian Inference. For all different models tested, including one with unrestricted inclination prior, we retrieve very similar non-antipodal hot regions geometries and radii. For the preferred model, we infer an equatorial radius of $R_{\rm eq}=10.29^{+1.01}_{-0.86}\,$km for a mass of $M=1.44^{+0.06}_{-0.07} \, M_{\odot}$ (median values with equal-tailed $68\%$ credible interval), the latter being essentially constrained from radio timing priors obtained by MeerKAT. We find that, for all different models, the pulse emission originates from two hot regions, one at the pole and the other at the equator. The resulting radius constraint is consistent with previous X-ray and gravitational wave measurements of neutron stars in the same mass range. Equation of state inferences, including previous NICER and gravitational wave results, slightly soften the equation of state with PSR J0614$-$3329 included and shift the allowed mass-radius region toward lower radii by $\sim 300\,$m.</description>

      <title>Detection of over 37,000 giant pulses per hour from PSR J1823$-$3021A with UHF baseband observations from MeerKAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant pulses (GPs) occur in high magnetic-field millisecond pulsars (MSPs) and young Crab-like pulsars. Motivated by the fast radio bursts (FRBs) discovered in a globular cluster (GC) in the M81, we undertook baseband observations of PSR J1823$-$3021A, the most active GP emitter in a GC with the MeerKAT UHF band receiver (544-1088 MHz). The steep spectral index of the pulsar yields a GP rate of over 37,000 GPs/hr with $S/N&gt;7$, significantly higher than the 3000 GPs/hr rate detected by Abbate et al. 2020 with the L-band (856-1712 MHz) receiver. Similarly to Abbate et al 2020, we find that the GPs are (1) strongly clustered in 2 particular phases of its rotation, (2) well described by a power-law in terms of energies, (3) typically broadband, and have steep spectral indices of $\approx-3$. Although the integrated pulse profile is not significantly polarised ($&lt;1\%$ linear and $&lt;3\%$ circular), one of the brightest GPs displays notable polarisation of $7\%$ (linear) and $8\%$ (circular). The high-time resolution data reveals the GPs have a range of single-peak and multi-peak morphologies, including GPs with three distinct peaks. For the first time, we measured the temporal scattering of the pulsar using 49 bright, narrow, single-pulse GPs, obtaining a mean value of $5.5\pm0.6$ $\mu$s at 1 GHz. The distinct periodicity and low polarisation of GPs differentiate them from typical FRBs, although potential quasi-periodicity substructures in some GPs may suggest a connection to magnetars/FRBs.</description>

      <title>Gamma rays as a signature of r-process producing supernovae: remnants and future Galactic explosions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the question of whether core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) can produce rapid neutron capture process (r-process) elements and how future MeV gamma-ray observations could address this. Rare types of CCSNe characterized by substantial magnetic fields and rotation, known as magnetorotational supernovae (MR-SNe), are theoretically predicted to produce these elements, although direct observational evidence is lacking. We suggest that this critical question be addressed through the study of some of the eleven CCSN remnants located within 10 kpc, as well as through the detection of gamma-ray emission from a future Galactic supernova. We use a two-dimensional MR-SN model to estimate the expected gamma flux stemming from nuclear decays in the range of a few tens of keV to a few MeV. Our results indicate that an observation of Sn-126 (Sb-126) in a remnant stands out as a signature of an r-process-producing supernova. Since the neutron-rich conditions that lead to the production of the r-process could also enhance the production of Fe-60, the detection of substantial Fe-60 (Co-60) would be indicative of favorable conditions for the r-process. In the case of a future supernova explosion, when the evolution of the spectrum is studied over ten days to a few years, a rich picture emerges. At various epochs, second peak r-process isotopes such as Sb-125, I-131, Te-132, I-132 and La-140 produce gamma-ray signals that emerge above the background from explosive burning products and electron-positron annihilation. The weak r-process isotopes Nb-95, Ru-103, Rh-106 also have periods of prominence. While MR-SNe are predicted to have a relatively small main r-process contribution, third peak isotopes like Ir-194 could still be above next-generation MeV gamma instrument sensitivities.</description>

      <title>Studying the diffusion mechanism of cosmic-ray particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: More and more observations have indicated the existence of slow diffusion phenomena in astrophysical environments, such as around the supernova remnants and pulsar $\gamma$-ray halos, where the diffusion coefficient of cosmic rays (CRs) near the source region is significantly smaller than that far away from the source region. The inhomogeneous diffusion indicates the existence of multiple diffusion mechanisms.Comparing the CR mirror diffusion with the scattering one, we aim to explore their diffusion characteristics in different magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence regimes and understand the effect of different MHD modes on mirror and scattering diffusion. We perform numerical simulations with the test particle method. Within the global frame of reference, we first measure parallel and perpendicular CR diffusion and then determine the mean free path of CRs with varying energies.Our main results demonstrate that: (1) CRs experience a transition from superdiffusion to normal diffusion; (2) mirror diffusion is more important than scattering diffusion in confining CRs; (3) CR diffusion strongly depends on the properties of MHD turbulence; and (4) magnetosonic and Alfv\'en modes dominate the parallel and perpendicular diffusion of CR particles, respectively. The diffusion of CRs is a complex problem of mixing the mirror diffusion and scattering diffusion. The property of turbulent magnetic fields influences CR diffusion. The CR slow diffusion due to the presence of magnetic mirrors in turbulence has important implications for explaining observations near a CR source.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Cosmic Dance of Repeated Nuclear Transient ASASSN-14ko: Insights from Multiwavelength Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ASASSN-14ko is a periodically repeating nuclear transient. We conducted high-cadence, multiwavelength observations of this source, revealing several recurrent early bumps and rebrightenings in its UV/optical light curves. The energy released during these bumps and rebrightenings shows a diminishing trend in recent UV/optical outbursts, which we monitored through multiwavelength observations. These features can be ascribed to the interaction between stream debris and the expanded disk in the repeated partial tidal disruption event. The X-ray light curve exhibits an inverse pattern compared to the UV/optical bands, displaying sporadic outbursts. Furthermore, our observations demonstrate that the blackbody temperature and radius in each outburst increase with the UV/optical luminosity, and such evolution resembles that observed in X-ray quasiperiodic eruptions, whereas distinguishing it from typical tidal disruption events.</description>

      <title>Study of a giant Large Magellanic Cloud Supernova Remnant, Veliki (J0450.4-7050)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a high-resolution radio-continuum view and a multi-frequency analysis of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) Supernova Remnant (SNR) J0450.4-7050, which we give the nickname Veliki. These high-resolution observations reveal a larger extent than previously measured, making J0450.4-7050 one of the largest SNRs that we know of. Additionally, we observe a higher than expected radio surface brightness and an unusually flat spectral index ($\alpha = -0.26 \pm 0.02$), with little spectral variation over the remnant. We observe a bright H$\alpha$ shell indicating significant cooling over the remnant, but also an excess of [Oiii] on the eastern shock front. We investigate several theoretical scenarios to explain the emission and radio evolution of J0450.4-7050 in the context of the LMC environment, and determine that this is most likely an older, predominantly radiative, SNR with a higher shock compression ratio, which gives a flatter non-thermal spectrum, in combination with a thermal (bremsstrahlung) emission contribution.</description>

      <title>Energy Spectrum and Mass Composition of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays Originating from Relativistic Jets of Nearby Radio Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic jets of radio galaxies (RGs) are possible sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). Recent studies combining relativistic hydrodynamic simulations with Monte Carlo particle transport have demonstrated that UHECRs can be accelerated to energies beyond $10^{20}$ eV through shocks, turbulence, and relativistic shear in jet-induced flows of Fanaroff-Riley (FR) type RGs. The resulting time-asymptotic UHECR spectrum is well modeled by a double power law with an ``extended'' exponential cutoff, primarily shaped by relativistic shear acceleration. In this study, we adopt this novel source spectrum and simulate the propagation of UHECRs from nearby RGs using the CRPropa code. We focus on Virgo A, Centaurus A, Fornax A, and Cygnus A, expected to be the most prominent UHECR sources among RGs. We then analyze the energy spectrum and mass composition of UHECRs arriving at Earth. We find that, due to the extended high-energy tail in the source spectrum, UHECRs from Virgo A, which has a higher Lorentz factor, exhibit a higher flux at the highest energies and a lighter mass composition at Earth, compared to those from Centaurus A and Fornax A with lower Lorentz factors. Despite Cygnus A having an even higher Lorentz factor, the large distance limits its contribution. With a small number of nearby prominent RGs, our findings suggest that if RGs are the major sources of UHECRs, the energy spectrum and mass composition of observed UHECRs would exhibit hemispheric differences between the Northern and Southern skies at the highest energies.</description>

      <title>Massive stars exploding in a He-rich circumstellar medium. XI. Diverse evolution of five Ibn SNe 2020nxt, 2020taz, 2021bbv, 2023utc and 2024aej</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the photometric and spectroscopic analysis of five Type Ibn supernovae (SNe): SN 2020nxt, SN 2020taz, SN 2021bbv, SN 2023utc, and SN 2024aej. These events share key observational features and belong to a family of objects similar to the prototypical Type Ibn SN 2006jc. The SNe exhibit rise times of approximately 10 days and peak absolute magnitudes ranging from $-$16.5 to $-$19 mag. Notably, SN 2023utc is the faintest Type Ibn supernova discovered to date, with an exceptionally low r-band absolute magnitude of $-16.4$ mag. The pseudo-bolometric light curves peak at $(1-10) \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, with total radiated energies on the order of $(1-10) \times 10^{48}$ erg. Spectroscopically, these SNe display relatively slow spectral evolution; the early spectra are characterised by a hot blue continuum and prominent He I emission lines. Early spectra show blackbody temperatures exceeding $10000~\mathrm{K}$, with a subsequent decline in temperature during later phases. Narrow He I lines, indicative of unshocked circumstellar material (CSM), show velocities of approximately $1000~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$. The spectra suggest that the progenitors of these SNe underwent significant mass loss prior to the explosion, resulting in a He-rich CSM. Light curve modelling yields estimates for the ejecta mass ($M_{\rm ej}$) in the range $1-3~M_{\odot}$, with kinetic energies ($E_{\rm Kin}$) of $(0.1-1) \times 10^{50}$ erg. The inferred CSM mass ranges from $0.2$ to $1~M_{\odot}$. These findings are consistent with expectations for core-collapse events arising from relatively massive, envelope-stripped progenitors.</description>

      <title>Low-metallicity nova explosions: a site for weak rp-process nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical novae are common cataclysmic events involving a binary system of a white dwarf and a main sequence or red giant companion star. In metal-poor environments, these explosions produce ejecta different from their solar counterparts due to the accretion of sub-solar metallicity material onto the white dwarf. In particular, it has been suggested that the nucleosynthesis flow in such low-metallicity nova explosions extends up to the Cu-Zn region, much beyond the expected endpoint, around Ca, predicted for solar-metallicity classical novae. This behavior resembles a weak rp-process, and such nuclear activity has never been observed in accreting white dwarf binaries with typical accretion flows. In this work, we study the characteristics of the weak rp-process for four nova models with metallicities $Z= 2\times 10^{-9}$, $10^{-7}$, $2\times 10^{-6}$, and $2\times 10^{-5}$, and explore the impact of the nuclear physics uncertainties via a Monte Carlo sensitivity study. We identify nuclear reactions whose uncertainties affect the production of intermediate-mass nuclei under these conditions. These reactions and relevant nuclear quantities are targets for measurements at stable or radioactive beam facilities to reduce their rate uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from b-EMRIs: Doppler shift and beaming, resonant excitation, helicity oscillations and self-lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study gravitational waves from a stellar-mass binary orbiting a spinning supermassive black hole, a system referred to as a binary extreme mass ratio inspiral (b-EMRI). We use Dixon's formalism to describe the stellar-mass binary as a particle with internal structure, and keep terms up to quadrupole order to capture the generation of gravitational waves by the inner motion of the stellar-mass binary. The problem of emission and propagation of waves is treated from first principles using black hole perturbation theory. In the gravitational waveform at future null infinity, we identify for the first time Doppler shifts and beaming due to the motion of the center of mass, as well as helicity breaking gravitational lensing, and resonances with ringdown modes of the supermassive black hole. We establish that previously proposed phenomenological models inadequately capture these effects.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the nanoHz gravitational wave sky: frequency-correlated anisotropy induced by eccentric supermassive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Revealing the nature of the nanoHz gravitational wave (GW) signal recently reported by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) collaborations around the world is the next goal of low-frequency GW astronomy. The signal likely originates from the incoherent superposition of GWs emitted by a cosmological population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). Those binaries can be highly eccentric and/or strongly coupled to their nuclear environment, resulting in an attenuation of the overall GW signal at low frequencies. In this paper, we propose to use the correlation properties of the distributed GW power in the sky across the frequency spectrum as a smoking gun for eccentric SMBHBs thus allowing to break the spectral degeneracy between eccentricity and environmental effect. The simple underlying idea is that, contrary to circular binaries, eccentric ones emit a broadband spectrum thus resulting in similar sky maps at different frequencies. We first demonstrate the applicability of this simple concept on sky maps constructed directly from the theoretical sky distribution of the GWB power induced by realistic populations of SMBHBs. We then demonstrate the viability of this analysis on simulated SKA-like PTA data. By statistically comparing sky maps reconstructed from hundreds injected circular and highly eccentric SMBHB populations, we find that eccentricity can be detected at $3\sigma$ in more than $50\%$ of cases.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent population synthesis of AGN from observational constraints in the X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmic X-ray background (CXB) is produced by the emission of unresolved active galactic nuclei (AGN), thus providing key information about the properties of the primary and reprocessed X-ray emission components of the AGN population. Equally important, studies of individual sources provide additional constraints on the properties of AGN, such as their luminosity and obscuration. Until now, these constraints have not been self-consistently addressed by intrinsically linking emission, absorption, and reflection. Here we perform numerical simulations with the ray-tracing code, RefleX, which allows us to self-consistently model the X-ray emission of AGN with flexible geometries for the circumnuclear medium. Using the RefleX-simulated emission of an AGN population, we attempt to simultaneously reproduce the CXB and absorption properties measured in the X-rays, namely the observed fraction of $N_{\mathrm{H}}$ in bins of log($N_{\mathrm{H}}$) and the fraction of absorbed AGN, including their redshift and luminosity evolution. We sample an intrinsic X-ray luminosity function and construct gradually more complex physically motivated geometrical models. We examine how well each model can match all observational constraints using a simulation-based inference (SBI) approach. We find that, while the simple unification model can reproduce the CXB, a luminosity dependent dusty torus is needed to reproduce the absorption properties. When adding an accretion disc, the model best matches all constraints simultaneously. Our synthetic population is able to reproduce the dependence of the covering factor on luminosity, the AGN number counts from several surveys, and the observed correlation between reflection and obscuration. Finally, we derive an intrinsic Compton-thick fraction of 21$\pm$7%, consistent with local observations.</description>

      <title>Detection of pure warm-hot intergalactic medium emission from a $7.2$ Mpc long filament in the Shapley supercluster using X-ray spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A significant fraction of the local Universe's baryonic content remains undetected. Cosmological simulations indicate that most of the missing baryons reside in cosmic filaments in the form of warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). The latter shows low surface brightness and soft X-ray emission, making it challenging to detect. Until now, X-ray WHIM emission has been detected only in very few individual filaments, whereas in even fewer filaments, WHIM has been spectroscopically analyzed. In this work, we used four Suzaku pointings to study the WHIM emission of a filament in the Shapley supercluster, connecting the galaxy cluster pairs A3530/32 and A3528-N/S. We additionally employ XMM-Newton observations to robustly account for point sources in the filament and to fully characterize the neighboring clusters and their signal contamination to the filament region. We report the direct imaging and spectroscopic detection of extended thermal WHIM emission from this single filament. Our imaging analysis confirms the existence of $(21\pm 3)\% $ excess X-ray emission throughout the filament compared to the sky background at a $6.1\sigma$ level. We constrain the filament gas temperature, electron density, and baryon overdensity to be $k_{\text{B}}T\approx (0.8-1.1)$ keV, $n_{\text{e}}\approx 10^{-5}$ cm$^{-3}$, and $\delta_{\text{b}}\approx (30-40)$, respectively, at a $&gt;3\sigma$ detection level, in agreement with cosmological simulations for the first time for a single filament. Independent of the X-ray analysis, we also identify a spectroscopic galaxy overdensity throughout the filament using the Shapley Supercluster velocity Database and constrain the filament's 3D length to be 7.2 Mpc. Overall, this is the first X-ray spectroscopic detection of pure WHIM emission from an individual, pristine filament without significant contamination from unresolved point sources and gas clumps.</description>

      <title>Revealing Limitation in the Standard Cosmological Model: A Redshift-Dependent Hubble Constant from Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major issue in contemporary cosmology is the persistent discrepancy, known as the Hubble tension, between the Hubble constant ($H_0$) estimates from local measurements and those inferred from early-Universe observations under the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm. Recent advances have identified fast radio bursts (FRBs), a class of extragalactic phenomena observable at considerable redshifts, as a promising observational tool for probing late-time cosmology. In this study, we incorporate two complementary methodologies, machine learning algorithms and Bayesian analysis, on a set of localized FRBs to rigorously test the consistency of the $\Lambda$CDM model at late cosmic epochs. Our results reveal a statistically significant redshift-dependent variation of $H_0$, which contradicts the core postulate of $\Lambda$CDM. We further validate that the redshift dependency of $H_0$ can be removed within the more flexible framework of $w_0w_a$CDM model. These findings highlight that the redshift evolution of $H_0$ is not merely an artifact of the standard model but an indication of a deeper inadequacy in the $\Lambda$CDM model, supporting the need for a more flexible cosmological framework.</description>

      <title>Shimmering Darkness: Mapping the Evolution of Supernova-Neutrino-Boosted Dark Matter within the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supernova-neutrino-boosted dark matter (SN$\nu$ BDM) has emerged as a promising portal for probing sub-GeV dark matter. In this work, we investigate the behavior of BDM signatures originating from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) within the Milky Way (MW) over the past one hundred thousand years, examining both their temporal evolution and present-day spatial distributions. We show that while the MW BDM signature is approximately diffuse in the nonrelativistic regime, it exhibits significant temporal variation and spatial localization when the BDM is relativistic. Importantly, we compare these local MW signatures with the previously proposed diffuse SN$\nu$ BDM (DBDM), which arises from the accumulated flux of all past SNe in the Universe [Y.-H. Lin and M.-R. Wu, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 111004 (2024)]. In the nonrelativistic limit, DBDM consistently dominates over the local diffuse MW BDM signature. Only when the MW BDM becomes ultrarelativistic and transitions into a transient, highly-localized signal, it can potentially surpass the DBDM background. This work thus reinforces the importance of DBDM for SN$\nu$ BDM searches until the next galactic SN offers new opportunities.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary models for the Very Massive Stars in the R136 cluster of 30 Doradus in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cluster R136 in the LMC contains a population of stars in excess of 100 M$_\odot$, including R136a1, the most massive star known. Very Massive Stars (VMSs) play an influential role in feedback processes and may potentially produce exotic supernova types and black holes of tens of solar masses. The evolutionary history and final fate of the three most luminous stars, R136a1, R136a2, and R136a3, has been a puzzling issue. We aim to resolve this by rotating single-star MESA models. We produce interpolated model grids and apply a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis to compare our models with observations. The nature of supernova progenitors strongly depends on mass loss and the AM coupling schemes. We predict no pair-instability and no GRB progenitors from our fiducial model grid at LMC metallicity. The onset of Wolf-Rayet-type mass-loss rates on the main sequence leads to a rapid decrease in stellar mass and luminosity. The mass turnover implies that the evolutionary history can only be inferred if additional constraints are available. We utilise the surface helium abundance, which poses a conundrum: R136a1, the most luminous star, is less enriched in helium than R136a2 and R136a3. We propose that this can be explained if both R136a2 and R136a3 were initially more massive than R136a1. From a rigorous confrontation of our models to spectroscopically-derived observables, we estimate an initial mass of 346$\pm41$ M$_\odot$ for R136a1, and $\gtrsim$500 M$_\odot$ for R136a2 and R136a3. Even though VMSs are only present in the youngest clusters below 2 Myr of age, our study strengthens their role in local and galaxy evolution. At LMC metallicity, they will be observable as helium-enriched massive stars after their drastic mass loss, produced via single-star evolution. If the core collapse leads to a supernova, it will be of Type Ib/c. [abridged]</description>

      <title>Distances of Supernova Remnants Associated with Neutron Stars in the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate distance measurements to supernova remnants (SNRs) are essential for determining their physical parameters, such as size, age, explosion energy, and for constraining the properties of associated neutron stars (NSs). We present an extinction--distance method that combines precise Gaia DR3 photometry, parallax, and stellar parameters from the SHBoost catalog to homogeneously construct extinction--distance profiles for 44 NS-associated Galactic SNRs. Applying a statistical model, we identify clear extinction jumps along each sightline, corresponding to probable SNR distances. We classify the results into three reliability levels (A, B, and C), primarily based on comparisons with previously reported kinematic distances, supplemented by independent estimates from other methods. Our results show that the majority of reliable distances (17 Level A and 8 Level B) are located within 5 kpc, predominantly in the Local Arm. This study presents an independent and effective method for determining distances to SNRs, particularly for those with small angular sizes or located in the second and third Galactic quadrants. Although the current method is limited to within 5 kpc due to the precision constraints of Gaia parallax and photometry, the upcoming Gaia DR4 release, combined with complementary infrared data, will extend its applicability to more distant and heavily obscured SNRs, and help resolve kinematic distance ambiguities.</description>

      <title>The Infinity Galaxy: a Candidate Direct-Collapse Supermassive Black Hole Between Two Massive, Ringed Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an unusual z=1.14 object, dubbed the $\infty$ galaxy, in JWST imaging of the COSMOS field. Its rest-frame near-IR light is dominated by two compact nuclei with stellar masses of $\sim 10^{11}$ Msun and a projected separation of 10 kpc. Both nuclei have a prominent ring or shell around them, giving the galaxy the appearance of a figure eight or an $\infty$ symbol. The morphology resembles that of the nearby system II Hz 4, where the head-on collision of two galaxies with parallel disks led to the formation of collisional rings around both of their bulges. Keck spectroscopy, VLA radio data, and Chandra X-ray data show that the $\infty$ galaxy hosts an actively accreting supermassive black hole (SMBH), with quasar-like radio and X-ray luminosity. Remarkably, the SMBH is not associated with either of the two nuclei, but is in between them in both position and radial velocity. Furthermore, from excess emission in the NIRCAM F150W filter we infer that the SMBH is embedded in an extended distribution of H$\alpha$-emitting gas, with a rest-frame equivalent width ranging from 400 - 2000 Angstrom. The gas spans the entire width of the system and was likely shocked and compressed at the collision site, in a galaxy-scale equivalent of what happened in the bullet cluster. We suggest that the SMBH formed within this gas in the immediate aftermath of the collision, when it was dense and highly turbulent. If corroborated with simulations and follow-up JWST spectroscopy, this would demonstrate that `direct' SMBH formation by a runaway gravitational collapse is possible in extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Further Evidence for a Direct-Collapse Origin of the Supermassive Black Hole at the Center of the Infinity Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The z=1.14 $\infty$ galaxy consists of two ringed nuclei with an active supermassive black hole (SMBH) in between them. The system is likely the result of a nearly face-on collision between two disk galaxies with massive bulges. In van Dokkum et al. (2025) we suggested that the SMBH may have formed from shocked and compressed gas at the collision site, in a runaway gravitational collapse. Here we test this hypothesis using newly obtained NIRSpec IFU observations. We first confirm that the system has a cloud of gas in between the nuclei that is photo-ionized by an AGN-like object near its center. Next, we constrain the origin of the SMBH from its radial velocity. If it formed in the cloud its velocity should be similar to the surrounding gas, whereas it would be offset if the SMBH had escaped from one of the nuclei or were associated with a faint galaxy. We find that the radial velocity of the SMBH is within $\sim 50$ km/s of that of the surrounding gas, as expected if the SMBH formed within the cloud. Unexpectedly, we find that both nuclei have active SMBHs as well, as inferred from very broad H$\alpha$ emission with FWHM $\sim 3000$ km/s. This rules out scenarios where the central SMBH was ejected from one of the nuclei in a gravitational recoil. Taken together, these results strengthen the hypothesis that the object at the center of the $\infty$ galaxy is a newly formed SMBH.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using open astronomical multifrequency databases, we constructed light curves and developed a comprehensive visualisation and sonification analysis for the blazars Mrk~501, Mrk~1501, Mrk~421, BL~Lacerta, AO~0235+164, 3C~66A, OJ~049, OJ~287, and PKS~J2134-0153. This study employed Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) and Parameter Mapping Sonification (PMSon) techniques to generate waveforms, spectrograms, and sonifications. These representations demonstrate that data visualisation and sonification are powerful tools for analysing astronomical objects like blazars, providing insights into their multifrequency variability. This work highlights how sonification and visualisation can aid in identifying potential patterns, power variations, regularities, and gaps in the data. This multimodal approach also underscores the importance of inclusivity in scientific communication, offering accessible methods for exploring the complex behaviour of blazars.</description>

      <title>Postmerger: a new and dominant contribution to the gravitational-wave background from binary neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) generated by the inspiral and merger of binary neutron stars is traditionally modelled assuming that the inspiral is promptly followed by the collapse of the merger remnant to a rotating black hole. While this is reasonable for the most massive binaries, it is not what is expected in general, as the remnant may survive for up to hundreds of milliseconds and radiate an amount of energy that is significantly larger than that lost during the whole inspiral. To account for this additional contribution to the SGWB, we consider a waveform model that includes both the inspiral and the postmerger emission. We show for the first time that for a large set of parameterized equations of state (EOSs) compatible with observational constraints, there is considerable spectral power in the $1-2\,{\rm kHz}$ range, distinct from that associated with the inspiral and leading to a dimensionless GW energy density $\Omega_{\rm GW} \simeq 10^{-10}-10^{-9}$. We discuss the enhanced detectability of the SGWB by third-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, and show how it depends on the signal-to-noise ratio of foreground binaries and on the remnant lifetime. Interestingly, even a non-detection of the high-frequency part of the SGWB could provide valuable constraints on the remnant lifetime, offering novel insights into the postmerger dynamics and the EOS of nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Polarization Position Angle Swing and the Rotating Vector Model of Repeating Fast Radio Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs), typically highly polarized, usually have a nearly constant polarization position angle (PA) during each burst. Some bursts show significant PA variations, and one of them was claimed to have a PA variation pattern consistent with the prediction of the rotating vector model (RVM) commonly adopted to fit the PA variations in radio pulsars. We systematically study the PA evolution pattern of 1727 bursts from three active repeating FRB sources monitored by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST). We identify 46 bursts whose PA variations are fully consistent with the RVM. However, the inferred geometrical parameters and rotation periods derived from these RVM fitting are inconsistent from each other. This suggests that the magnetosphere of the FRB central engine is constantly distorted by the FRB emitter, and the magnetic configuration is dynamically evolving.</description>

      <title>EP 250108a/SN 2025kg: Observations of the most nearby Broad-Line Type Ic Supernova following an Einstein Probe Fast X-ray Transient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08889v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With a small sample of fast X-ray transients (FXTs) with multi-wavelength counterparts discovered to date, the progenitors of FXTs and their connections to gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and supernovae (SNe) remain ambiguous. Here, we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2025kg, the supernova counterpart to the FXT EP 250108a. At $z=0.17641$, this is the closest known SN discovered following an Einstein Probe (EP) FXT. We show that SN 2025kg's optical spectra reveal the hallmark features of a broad-lined Type Ic SN. Its light curve evolution and expansion velocities are also comparable to those of GRB-SNe, including SN 1998bw, and several past FXT SNe. We present JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy taken around SN 2025kg's maximum light, and find weak absorption due to He I $\lambda 1.0830, \lambda 2.0581$ $\mu$m and a broad, unidentified feature at $\sim$ 4-4.5 $\mu$m. Further, we observe clear evidence for broadened H$\alpha$ in optical data at 42.5 days that is not detected at other epochs, indicating interaction with hydrogen-rich material. From its light curve, we derive a $^{56}$Ni mass of 0.2 - 0.6 $M_{\odot}$. Together with our companion paper (Eyles-Ferris et al. 2025), our broadband data of EP 250108a/SN 2025kg are consistent with a trapped or low energy ($\lesssim 10^{51}$ ergs) jet-driven explosion from a collapsar with a zero-age main sequence mass of 15-30 $M_{\odot}$. Finally, we show that the sample of EP FXT SNe support past rate estimates that low-luminosity jets seen through FXTs are more common than successful (GRB) jets, and that similar FXT-like signatures are likely present in at least a few percent of the brightest Ic-BL SNe.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic simulations of black hole evolution in AGN discs II: inclination damping for partially embedded satellites</title>

Abstract: We investigate the evolution of black holes on orbits with small inclinations ($i &lt; 2^\circ$) to the gaseous discs of active galactic nuclei. We perform 3D adiabatic hydrodynamic simulations within a shearing frame, studying the damping of inclination by black hole-gas gravitation. We find that for objects with $i&lt;3H_0R_0^{-1}$, where $H_0R_0^{-1}$ is the disc aspect ratio, the inclination lost per midplane crossing is proportional to the inclination preceding the crossing, resulting in a net exponential decay in inclination. For objects with $i&gt;3H_0R_0^{-1}$, damping efficiency decreases for higher inclinations. We consider a variety of different AGN environments, finding that damping is stronger for systems with a higher ambient Hill mass: the initial gas mass within the BH sphere-of-influence. We provide a fitting formula for the inclination changes as a function of Hill mass. We find reasonable agreement between the damping driven by gas gravity in the simulations and the damping driven by accretion under a Hill-limited Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton prescription. We find that gas dynamical friction consistently overestimates the strength of damping, especially for lower inclination systems, by at least an order of magnitude. For regions in the AGN disc where coplanar binary black hole formation by gas dissipation is efficient, we find that the simulated damping timescales are especially short with $\tau_d &lt; 10P_\mathrm{SMBH}$. We conclude that as the timescales for inclination damping are shorter than the expected interaction time between isolated black holes, the vast majority of binaries formed from gas capture should form from components with negligible inclination to the AGN disc.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Jet Dynamics and Collimation Characteristics of 0241+622 on Parsec Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conducted a detailed analysis of the jet structure and dynamics of the source 0241+622 on milliarcsecond (mas) scales. We stacked images from multiple epochs to better recover the crosssection of the jet. By analyzing the relationship between jet width and distance, we observed that the jet exhibits a parabolic shape from the core, spanning a region from 0.12 to 6.1 mas. This structure suggests the acceleration and collimation processes of the jet. Beyond 18 mas from the core, the jet adopts a conical shape, and the expansion speed of the jet becomes faster within the range from 4500 to 6500 mas. We obtained the core shift of this source using five pairs of data from VLBA at 1.6 GHz to 43 GHz. Based on previous studies, through proper motion analysis of the jet components, we estimated the angle between the jet and the line of sight to be approximately 65.7{\deg}, so 1 mas corresponds to 0.95 pc (de-projected distance). We then obtained the velocity field of the source within 3.14 mas from the central black hole and found that the jet exhibits accelerated motion within this range. At approximately 6.1 mas from the core, we observed that the jet width begins to decrease, which we identified as possibly corresponding to the Bondi radius of this source. The reduction in jet width may be related to changes in the external environmental pressure, particularly within the Bondi radius, indicating that the jet dynamics and collimation characteristics are strongly influenced by the surrounding medium conditions.</description>

      <title>Regularizing the Pulsar Timing Array likelihood: A path towards Fourier Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11894v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent announcement of evidence for a stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWB) in pulsar timing array (PTA) data has piqued interest across the scientific community. A combined analysis of all currently available data holds the promise of confirming the announced evidence as a solid detection of a GWB. However, the complexity of individual pulsar noise models and the variety of modeling tools used for different types of pulsars present significant challenges for a truly unified analysis. In this work we propose a novel approach to the analysis of PTA data: first a posterior distribution over Fourier modes is produced for each pulsar individually. Then, in a global analysis of all pulsars these posterior distributions can be re-used for a GWB search, which retains all information regarding the signals of interest without the added complexity of the underlying noise models or implementation differences. This approach facilitates combining radio and gamma-ray pulsar data, while reducing the complexity of the model and of its implementations when carrying out a GWB search with PTA data.</description>

      <title>Axion dissipation in conductive media and neutron star superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In axion electrodynamics, magnetic fields enable axion-photon mixing. Recent proposals suggest that rotating, conductive plasmas in neutron star magnetospheres could trigger axion superradiant instabilities -- an intriguing idea, given that such instabilities are typically associated with rotating black holes. In this work, we extend these investigations by properly incorporating plasma dynamics, particularly the plasma-induced photon effective mass, which suppresses the axion-photon mixing. Using two toy models for the conductive regions in the magnetosphere and accounting for fluid dynamics in both the frequency and time domain, we show that typical astrophysical plasma densities strongly inhibits the axionic instability. While our results assumes flat spacetime, the conclusions also apply to axion bound states in curved spacetimes, making neutron star superradiance less viable than previously thought. As a byproduct of our work, we provide a detailed description of axion electrodynamics in dissipative plasmas and uncover phenomena such as low-frequency axion "tails" and axion-induced electrostatic fields in dense plasmas.</description>
