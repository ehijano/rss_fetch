      <title>Lagrangian Skeleta and Koszul Duality on Bionic Symplectic Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the category of modules over sheaves of Deformation-Quantization (DQ) algebras on bionic symplectic varieties. These spaces are equipped with both an elliptic $\mathbb{G}_m$-action and a Hamiltonian $\mathbb{G}_m$-action, with finitely many fixed points. On these spaces one can consider geometric category $\mathcal{O}$: the category of (holonomic) modules supported on the Lagrangian attracting set of the Hamiltonian action. We show that there exists a local generator in geometric category $\mathcal{O}$ whose dg endomorphism ring, cohomologically supported on the Lagrangian attracting set, is derived equivalent to the category of all DQ-modules. This is a version of Koszul duality generalizing the equivalence between D-modules on a smooth variety and dg-modules over the de Rham complex.</description>

      <title>Multiplier ideals of normal surface singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the multiplier ideals and the corresponding jumping numbers and multiplicities $\{m(c)\}_{c\in \mathbb{R}}$ in the following context: $(X,o)$ is a complex analytic normal surface singularity, ${\mathfrak a}\subset \mathcal{O}_{X,o}$ is an ${\mathfrak m}_{X,o}$--primary ideal, $\phi:\widetilde{X}\to X$ is a log resolution of $\mathfrak{a}$ such that $\mathfrak{a}\mathcal{O}_{\widetilde{X}}=\mathcal{O}_{\widetilde{X}}(-F)$, for some nonzero effective divisor $F$ supported on $\phi^{-1}(0)$. We show that $\{m(c)\}_{c&gt;0}$ is combinatorially computable from $F$ and the resolution graph $\Gamma$ of $\phi$, and we provide several formulae. We also extend Budur's result (valid for $(X,o)=(\mathbb{C}^2,0)$), which makes an identification of $\sum_{c\in[0,1]}m(c)t^c$ with a certain Hodge spectrum. In our general case we use Hodge spectrum with coefficients in a mixed Hodge module. We show that $\{m(c)\}_{c\leq 0}$ usually depends on the analytic type of $(X,o)$. However, for some distinguished analytic types we determine it concretely. E.g., when $(X,o)$ is weighted homogeneous (and $F$ is associated with the central vertex), we recover $\sum_cm(c)t^c$ from the Poincar\'e series of $(X,o)$ and when $(X,o)$ is a splice quotient then we recover $\sum_cm(c)t^c$ from the multivariable topological Poincar\'e (zeta) function of $\Gamma$.</description>

      <title>Monodromy of the Prym map and semicanonical pencils in genus 6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Prym map $\mathcal{P}_6$ in genus 6 is dominant and generically finite of degree 27. When restricted to the divisor of curves with an odd semicanonical pencil $\mathcal{T}_6^o$, it is still generically finite, but of degree strictly smaller. In this paper, we prove that $\mathcal{P}_6$ restricted to $\mathcal{T}_6^o$ is birational and that the monodromy group over the image of $\mathcal{T}_6^o$ is the Weyl group $WD_5$. Thus, there are two other irreducible divisors in the moduli space of Prym curves $\mathcal{R}_6$ and the degree of $\mathcal{P}_6$ restricted to them is 10 and 16. Moreover, we study the geometry of the divisor where $\mathcal{P}_6$ has degree 10.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We refine and extend a result by Tuitman on the supports of a B\'ezout identity satisfied by a finite sequence of sparse Laurent polynomials without common zeroes in the toric variety associated to their supports. When the number of these polynomials is one more than the dimension of the ambient space, we obtain a formula for computing the sparse resultant as the determinant of a Koszul type complex.</description>

      <title>Real Poincar\'e series of a plane divisorial valuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earlier, there was computed the Poincar\'e series of a valuation or of a collection of valuations on the ring of germs of holomorphic functions in two variables. For a collection of several plane curve valuations it appeared to coincide with the Alexander polynomial of the corresponding algebraic link. Recently, the authors defined Poincar\'e series of a valuation or of a collection of valuations in the real setting. (Actually, there were defined three versions of them, however, one of them was found to be ``not computable''.) These two Poincar'e series were computed for one plane curve valuation. Here we compute them for a plane divisorial valuation.</description>

      <title>Intersection of irreducible curves and the Hermitian curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}_q$ denote the Hermitian curve in $\mathbb{P}^2$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ and $\mathcal{C}_d$ be an irreducible plane projective curve in $\mathbb{P}^2$ also defined over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ of degree $d$. Can $\mathcal{H}_q$ and $\mathcal{C}_d$ intersect in exactly $d(q+1)$ distinct $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$-rational points? B\'ezout's theorem immediately implies that $\mathcal{H}_q$ and $\mathcal{C}_d$ intersect in at most $d(q+1)$ points, but equality is not guaranteed over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. In this paper we prove that for many $d \le q^2-q+1$, the answer to this question is affirmative. The case $d=1$ is trivial: it is well known that any secant line of $\mathcal{H}_q$ defined over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ intersects $\mathcal{H}_q$ in $q+1$ rational points. Moreover, all possible intersections of conics and $\mathcal{H}_q$ were classified by Donati et al. in 2009 and their results imply that the answer to the question above is affirmative for $d=2$ and $q \ge 4$, as well. However, an exhaustive computer search quickly reveals that for $(q,d) \in \{(2,2),(3,2),(2,3)\}$, the answer is instead negative. We show that for $q \le d \le q^2-q+1$, $d=\lfloor(q+1)/2\rfloor$ and $d=3$, $q \geq 3$ the answer is again affirmative. Various partial results for the case $d$ small compared to $q$ are also provided.</description>

      <title>Analytical Identification of Design and Multidimensional Spaces Using R-Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design space (DS) is defined as the combination of materials and process conditions that guarantees the assurance of quality. This principle ensures that as long as a process operates within DS, it consistently produces a product that meets specifications. A novel DS identification method called the R-DS identifier has been developed. It makes no assumptions about the underlying model - the only requirement is that each model constraint (CQA) should be approximated by a multivariate polynomial model. The method utilizes the methodology of Rvachev's R-functions and allows for explicit analytical representation of the DS with only a limited number of model runs. R-functions provide a framework for representing complex geometric shapes and performing operations on them through implicit functions. The theory of R-functions enables the solution of geometric problem such as identification of DS through algebraic manipulation. It is more practical than traditional sampling or optimization-based methods. The method is illustrated using a batch reactor system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part of the paper, we prove a mirror symmetry isomorphism between integral tropical homology groups of a pair of mirror tropical Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces. We then apply this isomorphism to prove that a primitive patchworking of a central triangulation of a reflexive polytope gives a connected real Calabi-Yau hypersurface if and only if the corresponding divisor class on the mirror is not zero.</description>

      <title>Roos axiom holds for quasi-coherent sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Grothendieck abelian category $X\operatorname{\mathsf{--Qcoh}}$ of quasi-coherent sheaves on a quasi-compact semi-separated scheme $X$ satisfies the Roos axiom $\mathrm{AB}4^*$-$n$: the derived functors of infinite product have finite homological dimension in $X\operatorname{\mathsf{--Qcoh}}$, not exceeding the number $n$ of open subschemes in an affine open covering of $X$. The hereditary complete cotorsion pair (very flat quasi-coherent sheaves, contraadjusted quasi-coherent sheaves) in the abelian category $X\operatorname{\mathsf{--Qcoh}}$ plays the key role in our arguments. Simply put, a suitable very flat quasi-coherent sheaf (or alternatively, a suitable direct sum of locally countably presented flat quasi-coherent sheaves) on $X$ is a generator of finite projective dimension for the abelian category $X\operatorname{\mathsf{--Qcoh}}$.</description>

      <title>Highest weight category structures on $Rep(B)$ and full exceptional collections on flag varieties over $\mathbb Z$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper constructs full exceptional collections in the bounded derived categories of coherent sheaves of flag schemes of Chevalley group schemes over $\mathbb Z$. The ensuing semiorthogonal decompositions are compatible with the Bruhat order on Weyl groups. The terms of full exceptional collections are a priori complexes of coherent sheaves; the question whether they are actually coherent sheaves is to be investigated further. The construction builds upon the foundational results on $B$-modules from the works of Mathieu, Polo, and van der Kallen, and upon properties of the Steinberg basis of the $T$-equivariant $\sf K$-theory of $G/B$.</description>

Abstract: We study the curvature of a smooth algebraic surface $X\subset \mathbb R^3$ of degree $d$ from the point of view of algebraic geometry. More precisely, we consider umbilical points and points of critical curvature. We prove that the number of complex critical curvature points is of order $d^3$. For general quadrics, we fully characterize the number of real and complex umbilics and critical curvature points.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the only non-trivial finite subgroups of birational automorphism group of non-trivial Severi--Brauer surfaces over the field of rational numbers are~$\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$ and $(\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z})^2.$ Moreover, we show that $(\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z})^2$ is contained in $\mathrm{Bir}(V)$ for any Severi--Brauer surface $V$ over a field of characteristic zero, and $(\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z})^3$ is contained in $\mathrm{Bir}(V)$ for any Severi--Brauer surface~$V$ over a field of characteristic zero which contains a non-trivial cube root of unity. All the results of the paper hold for perfect fields of characteristic different from $2$ and $3.$</description>

Abstract: We construct a collection of families of higher Chow cycles of type $(2,1)$ on a 2-dimensional family of Kummer surfaces, and prove that for a very general member, they generate a subgroup of rank $\ge 18$ in the indecomposable part of the higher Chow group. Construction of the cycles uses a finite group action on the family, and the proof of their linear independence uses Picard-Fuchs differential operators.</description>

      <title>A transcendental approach to non-Archimedean metrics of pseudoeffective classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02541v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of non-Archimedean metrics attached to a transcendental pseudoeffective cohomology class on a compact K\"ahler manifold. This is obtained via extending the Ross-Witt Nystr\"om correspondence to the relative case, and we point out that our construction agrees with that of Boucksom-Jonsson when the class is induced by a pseudoeffective $\mathbb Q$-line bundle.
  We introduce the notion of a flag configuration attached to a transcendental big class, recovering the notion of a test configuration in the ample case. We show that non-Archimedean finite energy metrics are approximable by flag configurations, and very general versions of the radial Ding energy are continuous, a novel result even in the ample case. As applications, we characterize the delta invariant as the Ding semistability threshold of flag configurations and filtrations and prove a YTD type existence theorem in terms of flag configurations.</description>

      <title>Motivic distribution of rational curves and twisted products of toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07339v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work concerns asymptotical stabilisation phenomena occurring in the moduli space of sections of certain algebraic families over a smooth projective curve, whenever the generic fibre of the family is a smooth projective Fano variety, or not far from being Fano.
  We describe the expected behaviour of the class, in a ring of motivic integration, of the moduli space of sections of given numerical class. Up to an adequate normalisation, it should converge, when the class of the sections goes arbitrarily far from the boundary of the dual of the effective cone, to an effective element given by a motivic Euler product. Such a principle can be seen as an analogue for rational curves of the Batyrev-Manin-Peyre principle for rational points.
  The central tool of this article is the property of equidistribution of curves. We show that this notion does not depend on the choice of a model of the generic fibre, and that equidistribution of curves holds for smooth projective split toric varieties. As an application, we study the Batyrev-Manin-Peyre principle for curves on a certain kind of twisted products.</description>

      <title>Cyclic A-infinity Algebras and Calabi--Yau Structures in the Analytic Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers $A_\infty$-algebras whose higher products satisfy an analytic bound with respect to a fixed norm. We define a notion of right Calabi--Yau structures on such $A_\infty$-algebras and show that these give rise to cyclic minimal models satisfying the same analytic bound. This strengthens a theorem of Kontsevich--Soibelman, and yields a flexible method for obtaining analytic potentials of Hua-Keller.
  We apply these results to the endomorphism DGAs of polystable sheaves considered by Toda, for which we construct a family of such right CY structures obtained from analytic germs of holomorphic volume forms on a projective variety. As a result, we can define a canonical cyclic analytic $A_\infty$-structure on the Ext-algebra of a polystable sheaf, which depends only on the analytic-local geometry of its support. This shows that the results of Toda can be extended to the quasi-projective setting, and yields a new method for comparing cyclic $A_\infty$-structures of sheaves on different Calabi--Yau varieties.</description>

      <title>Seshadri constants of curve configurations on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a complex nonsingular projective surface and let $L$ be an ample line bundle on $X$. We study multi-point Seshadri constants of $L$ at singular points of certain arrangements of curves on $X$. We pose some questions about such Seshadri constants and prove some results in the case of star arrangements of curves. We also study the configurational Seshadri constants for curve arrangements on surfaces and compare them with the usual Seshadri constants. We give several examples illustrating the properties that we study.</description>

      <title>Klt degenerations of projective spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study degenerations of complex projective spaces $\mathbb P^n$ into normal projective klt varieties $X$. If the tangent sheaf of $X$ is semi-stable, we show that $X$ itself is a projective space. If $X$ is a threefold with canonical singularities, we show that there are only three varieties which satisfy all the conditions.</description>

      <title>Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality for log terminal K\"ahler threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10003v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we are concerned with two main themes revolving around compact K\"ahler spaces with log terminal singularities. The first one is the orbifold version of the Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality for stable $\mathbb Q$-sheaves on threefolds while the second one has to do with the construction of canonical metrics on such spaces and their properties.</description>

      <title>Moduli spaces of slope-semistable sheaves with reflexive Seshadri graduations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the moduli stacks of slope-semistable torsion-free coherent sheaves that admit reflexive, respectively locally free, Seshadri graduations on a smooth projective variety. We show that they are open in the stack of coherent sheaves and that they admit good moduli spaces when the field characteristic is zero. In addition, in the locally free case we prove that the resulting moduli space is a quasi-projective scheme.</description>

      <title>Motivic Steenrod problem away from the characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In topology, the Steenrod problem asks whether every singular homology class is the pushforward of the fundamental class of a closed oriented manifold. Here, we introduce an analogous question in algebraic geometry: is every element on the Chow line of the motivic cohomology of $X$ the pushforward of a fundamental class along a projective derived-lci morphism? If $X$ is a smooth variety over a field of characteristic $p \geq 0$, then a positive answer to this question follows up to $p$-torsion from resolution of singularities by alterations. However, if $X$ is singular, then this is no longer necessarily so: we give examples of motivic cohomology classes of a singular scheme $X$ that are not $p$-torsion and are not expressible as such pushforwards. A consequence of our result is that the Chow ring of a singular variety cannot be expressed as a quotient of its algebraic cobordism ring, as suggested by the first-named-author in his thesis.</description>

      <title>Gauge theory for string algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.11399v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a moment map picture for holomorphic string algebroids where the Hamiltonian gauge action is described by means of inner automorphisms of Courant algebroids. The zero locus of our moment map is given by the solutions of the Calabi system, a coupled system of equations which provides a unifying framework for the classical Calabi problem and the Hull-Strominger system. Our main results are concerned with the geometry of the moduli space of solutions, and assume a technical condition which is fulfilled in examples. We prove that the moduli space carries a pseudo-K\"ahler metric with K\"ahler potential given by the dilaton functional, a topological formula for the metric, and an infinitesimal Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau type theorem.</description>

      <title>On the Computation of the Zariski Closure of Finitely Generated Groups of Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.01853v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the complexity of computing the Zariski closure of a finitely generated group of matrices. The Zariski closure was previously shown to be computable by Derksen, Jeandel, and Koiran, but the termination argument for their algorithm appears not to yield any complexity bound. In this paper we follow a different approach and obtain a bound on the degree of the polynomials that define the closure. Our bound shows that the closure can be computed in elementary time. We also obtain upper bounds on the length of chains of linear algebraic groups, where all the groups are generated over a fixed number field.</description>

      <title>The Jacobian of a graph and graph automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.01469v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper we investigate the faithfulness of certain linear representations of groups of automorphisms of a graph $X$ in the group of symmetries of the Jacobian of $X$. As a consequence we show that if a $3$-edge-connected graph $X$ admits a nonabelian semiregular group of automorphims, then the Jacobian of $X$ cannot be cyclic. In particular, Cayley graphs of degree at least three arising from nonabelian groups have non-cyclic Jacobians. While the size of the Jacobian of $X$ is well-understood - it is equal to the number of spanning trees of $X$ - the combinatorial interpretation of the rank of Jacobian of a graph is unknown. Our paper presents a contribution in this direction.</description>
