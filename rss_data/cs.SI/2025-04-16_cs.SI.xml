      <title>Exposure to Content Written by Large Language Models Can Reduce Stigma Around Opioid Use Disorder in Online Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Widespread stigma, both in the offline and online spaces, acts as a barrier to harm reduction efforts in the context of opioid use disorder (OUD). This stigma is prominently directed towards clinically approved medications for addiction treatment (MAT), people with the condition, and the condition itself. Given the potential of artificial intelligence based technologies in promoting health equity, and facilitating empathic conversations, this work examines whether large language models (LLMs) can help abate OUD-related stigma in online communities. To answer this, we conducted a series of pre-registered randomized controlled experiments, where participants read LLM-generated, human-written, or no responses to help seeking OUD-related content in online communities. The experiment was conducted under two setups, i.e., participants read the responses either once (N = 2,141), or repeatedly for 14 days (N = 107). We found that participants reported the least stigmatized attitudes toward MAT after consuming LLM-generated responses under both the setups. This study offers insights into strategies that can foster inclusive online discourse on OUD, e.g., based on our findings LLMs can be used as an education-based intervention to promote positive attitudes and increase people's propensity toward MAT.</description>

      <title>WorldMove, a global open data for human mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality human mobility data is crucial for applications such as urban planning, transportation management, and public health, yet its collection is often hindered by privacy concerns and data scarcity-particularly in less-developed regions. To address this challenge, we introduce WorldMove, a large-scale synthetic mobility dataset covering over 1,600 cities across 179 countries and 6 continents. Our method leverages publicly available multi-source data, including gridded population distribution, point-of-interest (POI) maps, and commuting origin-destination (OD) flows-to generate realistic city-scale mobility trajectories using a diffusion-based generative model. The generation process involves defining city boundaries, collecting multi-source input features, and simulating individual-level movements that reflect plausible daily mobility behavior. Comprehensive validation demonstrates that the generated data closely aligns with real-world observations, both in terms of fine-grained individual mobility behavior and city-scale population flows. Alongside the pre-generated datasets, we release the trained model and a complete open-source pipeline, enabling researchers and practitioners to generate custom synthetic mobility data for any city worldwide. This work not only fills critical data gaps, but also lays a global foundation for scalable, privacy-preserving, and inclusive mobility research-empowering data-scarce regions and enabling universal access to human mobility insights.</description>

      <title>TrustMap: Mapping Truthfulness Stance of Social Media Posts on Factual Claims for Geographical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Factual claims and misinformation circulate widely on social media and affect how people form opinions and make decisions. This paper presents a truthfulness stance map (TrustMap), an application that identifies and maps public stances toward factual claims across U.S. regions. Each social media post is classified as positive, negative, or neutral/no stance, based on whether it believes a factual claim is true or false, expresses uncertainty about the truthfulness, or does not explicitly take a position on the claim's truthfulness. The tool uses a retrieval-augmented model with fine-tuned language models for automatic stance classification. The stance classification results and social media posts are grouped by location to show how stance patterns vary geographically. TrustMap allows users to explore these patterns by claim and region and connects stance detection with geographical analysis to better understand public engagement with factual claims.</description>

      <title>Integrating Emotion Distribution Networks and Textual Message Analysis for X User Emotional State Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the popularity and reach of social networks continue to surge, a vast reservoir of opinions and sentiments across various subjects inundates these platforms. Among these, X social network (formerly Twitter) stands as a juggernaut, boasting approximately 420 million active users. Extracting users' emotional and mental states from their expressed opinions on social media has become a common pursuit. While past methodologies predominantly focused on the textual content of messages to analyze user sentiment, the interactive nature of these platforms suggests a deeper complexity. This study employs hybrid methodologies, integrating textual analysis, profile examination, follower analysis, and emotion dissemination patterns. Initially, user interactions are leveraged to refine emotion classification within messages, encompassing exchanges where users respond to each other. Introducing the concept of a communication tree, a model is extracted to map these interactions. Subsequently, users' bios and interests from this tree are juxtaposed with message text to enrich analysis. Finally, influential figures are identified among users' followers in the communication tree, categorized into different topics to gauge interests. The study highlights that traditional sentiment analysis methodologies, focusing solely on textual content, are inadequate in discerning sentiment towards significant events, notably the presidential election. Comparative analysis with conventional methods reveals a substantial improvement in accuracy with the incorporation of emotion distribution patterns and user profiles. The proposed approach yields a 12% increase in accuracy with emotion distribution patterns and a 15% increase when considering user profiles, underscoring its efficacy in capturing nuanced sentiment dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Group Fairness in Community Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding community structures is crucial for analyzing networks, as nodes join communities that collectively shape large-scale networks. In real-world settings, the formation of communities is often impacted by several social factors, such as ethnicity, gender, wealth, or other attributes. These factors may introduce structural inequalities; for instance, real-world networks can have a few majority groups and many minority groups. Community detection algorithms, which identify communities based on network topology, may generate unfair outcomes if they fail to account for existing structural inequalities, particularly affecting underrepresented groups. In this work, we propose a set of novel group fairness metrics to assess the fairness of community detection methods. Additionally, we conduct a comparative evaluation of the most common community detection methods, analyzing the trade-off between performance and fairness. Experiments are performed on synthetic networks generated using LFR, ABCD, and HICH-BA benchmark models, as well as on real-world networks. Our results demonstrate that the fairness-performance trade-off varies widely across methods, with no single class of approaches consistently excelling in both aspects. We observe that Infomap and Significance methods are high-performing and fair with respect to different types of communities across most networks. The proposed metrics and findings provide valuable insights for designing fair and effective community detection algorithms.</description>

      <title>Towards global equity in political polarization research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a folk understanding that political polarization refers to socio-political divisions within a society, many have proclaimed that we are more divided than ever. In this account, polarization has been blamed for populism, the erosion of social cohesion, the loss of trust in the institutions of democracy, legislative dysfunction, and the collective failure to address existential risks such as Covid-19 or climate change. However, at a global scale there is surprisingly little academic literature which conclusively supports these claims, with half of all studies being U.S.-focused. Here, we provide an overview of the global state of research on polarization, highlighting insights that are robust across countries, those unique to specific contexts, and key gaps in the literature. We argue that addressing these gaps is urgent, but has been hindered thus far by systemic and cultural barriers, such as regionally stratified restrictions on data access and misaligned research incentives. If continued cross-disciplinary inertia means that these disparities are left unaddressed, we see a substantial risk that countries will adopt policies to tackle polarization based on inappropriate evidence, risking flawed decision-making and the weakening of democratic institutions.</description>

      <title>Influence Maximization in Temporal Social Networks with a Cold-Start Problem: A Supervised Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Influence Maximization (IM) in temporal graphs focuses on identifying influential "seeds" that are pivotal for maximizing network expansion. We advocate defining these seeds through Influence Propagation Paths (IPPs), which is essential for scaling up the network. Our focus lies in efficiently labeling IPPs and accurately predicting these seeds, while addressing the often-overlooked cold-start issue prevalent in temporal networks. Our strategy introduces a motif-based labeling method and a tensorized Temporal Graph Network (TGN) tailored for multi-relational temporal graphs, bolstering prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Moreover, we augment cold-start nodes with new neighbors from historical data sharing similar IPPs. The recommendation system within an online team-based gaming environment presents subtle impact on the social network, forming multi-relational (i.e., weak and strong) temporal graphs for our empirical IM study. We conduct offline experiments to assess prediction accuracy and model training efficiency, complemented by online A/B testing to validate practical network growth and the effectiveness in addressing the cold-start issue.</description>

      <title>Emotion Alignment: Discovering the Gap Between Social Media and Real-World Sentiments in Persian Tweets and Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In contemporary society, widespread social media usage is evident in people's daily lives. Nevertheless, disparities in emotional expressions between the real world and online platforms can manifest. We comprehensively analyzed Persian community on X to explore this phenomenon. An innovative pipeline was designed to measure the similarity between emotions in the real world compared to social media. Accordingly, recent tweets and images of participants were gathered and analyzed using Transformers-based text and image sentiment analysis modules. Each participant's friends also provided insights into the their real-world emotions. A distance criterion was used to compare real-world feelings with virtual experiences. Our study encompassed N=105 participants, 393 friends who contributed their perspectives, over 8,300 collected tweets, and 2,000 media images. Results indicated a 28.67% similarity between images and real-world emotions, while tweets exhibited a 75.88% alignment with real-world feelings. Additionally, the statistical significance confirmed that the observed disparities in sentiment proportions.</description>

      <title>BEACON: A Benchmark for Efficient and Accurate Counting of Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subgraph counting the task of determining the number of instances of a query pattern within a large graph lies at the heart of many critical applications, from analyzing financial networks and transportation systems to understanding biological interactions. Despite decades of work yielding efficient algorithmic (AL) solutions and, more recently, machine learning (ML) approaches, a clear comparative understanding is elusive. This gap stems from the absence of a unified evaluation framework, standardized datasets, and accessible ground truths, all of which hinder systematic analysis and fair benchmarking. To overcome these barriers, we introduce BEACON: a comprehensive benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate both AL and ML-based subgraph counting methods. BEACON provides a standardized dataset with verified ground truths, an integrated evaluation environment, and a public leaderboard, enabling reproducible and transparent comparisons across diverse approaches. Our extensive experiments reveal that while AL methods excel in efficiently counting subgraphs on very large graphs, they struggle with complex patterns (e.g., those exceeding six nodes). In contrast, ML methods are capable of handling larger patterns but demand massive graph data inputs and often yield suboptimal accuracy on small, dense graphs. These insights not only highlight the unique strengths and limitations of each approach but also pave the way for future advancements in subgraph counting techniques. Overall, BEACON represents a significant step towards unifying and accelerating research in subgraph counting, encouraging innovative solutions and fostering a deeper understanding of the trade-offs between algorithmic and machine learning paradigms.</description>

      <title>Why am I seeing this? Towards recognizing social media recommender systems with missing recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media plays a crucial role in shaping society, often amplifying polarization and spreading misinformation. These effects stem from complex dynamics involving user interactions, individual traits, and recommender algorithms driving content selection. Recommender systems, which significantly shape the content users see and decisions they make, offer an opportunity for intervention and regulation. However, assessing their impact is challenging due to algorithmic opacity and limited data availability. To effectively model user decision-making, it is crucial to recognize the recommender system adopted by the platform.
  This work introduces a method for Automatic Recommender Recognition using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), based solely on network structure and observed behavior. To infer the hidden recommender, we first train a Recommender Neutral User model (RNU) using a GNN and an adapted hindsight academic network recommender, aiming to reduce reliance on the actual recommender in the data. We then generate several Recommender Hypothesis-specific Synthetic Datasets (RHSD) by combining the RNU with different known recommenders, producing ground truths for testing. Finally, we train Recommender Hypothesis-specific User models (RHU) under various hypotheses and compare each candidate with the original used to generate the RHSD.
  Our approach enables accurate detection of hidden recommenders and their influence on user behavior. Unlike audit-based methods, it captures system behavior directly, without ad hoc experiments that often fail to reflect real platforms. This study provides insights into how recommenders shape behavior, aiding efforts to reduce polarization and misinformation.</description>

      <title>Evaluating DAO Sustainability and Longevity Through On-Chain Governance Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) automate governance and resource allocation through smart contracts, aiming to shift decision-making to distributed token holders. However, many DAOs face sustainability challenges linked to limited user participation, concentrated voting power, and technical design constraints. This paper addresses these issues by identifying research gaps in DAO evaluation and introducing a framework of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that capture governance efficiency, financial robustness, decentralisation, and community engagement. We apply the framework to a custom-built dataset of real-world DAOs constructed from on-chain data and analysed using non-parametric methods. The results reveal recurring governance patterns, including low participation rates and high proposer concentration, which may undermine long-term viability. The proposed KPIs offer a replicable, data-driven method for assessing DAO governance structures and identifying potential areas for improvement. These findings support a multidimensional approach to evaluating decentralised systems and provide practical tools for researchers and practitioners working to improve the resilience and effectiveness of DAO-based governance models.</description>

      <title>Masculine Defaults via Gendered Discourse in Podcasts and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Masculine defaults are widely recognized as a significant type of gender bias, but they are often unseen as they are under-researched. Masculine defaults involve three key parts: (i) the cultural context, (ii) the masculine characteristics or behaviors, and (iii) the reward for, or simply acceptance of, those masculine characteristics or behaviors. In this work, we study discourse-based masculine defaults, and propose a twofold framework for (i) the large-scale discovery and analysis of gendered discourse words in spoken content via our Gendered Discourse Correlation Framework (GDCF); and (ii) the measurement of the gender bias associated with these gendered discourse words in LLMs via our Discourse Word-Embedding Association Test (D-WEAT). We focus our study on podcasts, a popular and growing form of social media, analyzing 15,117 podcast episodes. We analyze correlations between gender and discourse words -- discovered via LDA and BERTopic -- to automatically form gendered discourse word lists. We then study the prevalence of these gendered discourse words in domain-specific contexts, and find that gendered discourse-based masculine defaults exist in the domains of business, technology/politics, and video games. Next, we study the representation of these gendered discourse words from a state-of-the-art LLM embedding model from OpenAI, and find that the masculine discourse words have a more stable and robust representation than the feminine discourse words, which may result in better system performance on downstream tasks for men. Hence, men are rewarded for their discourse patterns with better system performance by one of the state-of-the-art language models -- and this embedding disparity is a representational harm and a masculine default.</description>

      <title>Rank-Refining Seed Selection Methods for Budget Constrained Influence Maximisation in Multilayer Networks under Linear Threshold Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of selecting an optimal seed set to maximise influence in networks has been a subject of intense research in recent years. However, despite numerous works addressing this area, it remains a topic that requires further elaboration. Most often, it is considered within the scope of classically defined graphs with a spreading model in the form of Independent Cascades. In this work, we focus on the problem of budget-constrained influence maximisation in multilayer networks using a Linear Threshold Model. Both the graph model and the spreading process we employ are less prevalent in the literature, even though their application allows for a more precise representation of the opinion dynamics in social networks. This paper aims to answer which of the sixteen evaluated seed selection methods is the most effective and how similar they are. Additionally, we focus our analysis on the impact of spreading model parameters, network characteristics, a budget, and the seed selection methods on the diffusion effectiveness in multilayer networks. Our contribution also includes extending several centrality measures and heuristics to the case of such graphs. The results indicate that all the factors mentioned above collectively contribute to the effectiveness of influence maximisation. Moreover, there is no seed selection method which always provides the best results. However, the seeds chosen with VoteRank-based methods (especially with the $v-rnk-m$ variant we propose) usually provide the most extensive diffusion.</description>

Abstract: Rules are a critical component of the functioning of nearly every online community, yet it is challenging for community moderators to make data-driven decisions about what rules to set for their communities. The connection between a community's rules and how its membership feels about its governance is not well understood. In this work, we conduct the largest-to-date analysis of rules on Reddit, collecting a set of 67,545 unique rules across 5,225 communities which collectively account for more than 67% of all content on Reddit. More than just a point-in-time study, our work measures how communities change their rules over a 5+ year period. We develop a method to classify these rules using a taxonomy of 17 key attributes extended from previous work. We assess what types of rules are most prevalent, how rules are phrased, and how they vary across communities of different types. Using a dataset of communities' discussions about their governance, we are the first to identify the rules most strongly associated with positive community perceptions of governance: rules addressing who participates, how content is formatted and tagged, and rules about commercial activities. We conduct a longitudinal study to quantify the impact of adding new rules to communities, finding that after a rule is added, community perceptions of governance immediately improve, yet this effect diminishes after six months. Our results have important implications for platforms, moderators, and researchers. We make our classification model and rules datasets public to support future research on this topic.</description>

      <title>Niche Dynamics in Complex Online Community Ecosystems</title>

Abstract: Online communities are important organizational forms where members socialize and share information. Curiously, different online communities often overlap considerably in topic and membership. Recent research has investigated competition and mutualism among overlapping online communities through the lens of organizational ecology; however, it has not accounted for how the nonlinear dynamics of online attention may lead to episodic competition and mutualism. Neither has it explored the origins of competition and mutualism in the processes by which online communities select or adapt to their niches. This paper presents a large-scale study of 8,806 Reddit communities belonging to 1,919 clusters of high user overlap over a 5-year period. The method uses nonlinear time series methods to infer bursty, often short-lived ecological dynamics. Results reveal that mutualism episodes are longer lived and slightly more frequent than competition episodes. Next, it tests whether online communities find their niches by specializing to avoid competition using panel regression models. It finds that competitive ecological interactions lead to decreasing topic and user overlaps; however, changes that decrease such niche overlaps do not lead to mutualism. The discussion proposes that future designs may enable online community ecosystem management by informing online community leaders to organize "spin-off" communities or via feeds and recommendations.</description>

      <title>Inferring Communities of Interest in Collaborative Learning-based Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collaborative-learning-based recommender systems, such as those employing Federated Learning (FL) and Gossip Learning (GL), allow users to train models while keeping their history of liked items on their devices. While these methods were seen as promising for enhancing privacy, recent research has shown that collaborative learning can be vulnerable to various privacy attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel attack called Community Inference Attack (CIA), which enables an adversary to identify community members based on a set of target items. What sets CIA apart is its efficiency: it operates at low computational cost by eliminating the need for training surrogate models. Instead, it uses a comparison-based approach, inferring sensitive information by comparing users' models rather than targeting any specific individual model. To evaluate the effectiveness of CIA, we conduct experiments on three real-world recommendation datasets using two recommendation models under both Federated and Gossip-like settings. The results demonstrate that CIA can be up to 10 times more accurate than random guessing. Additionally, we evaluate two mitigation strategies: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) and a Share less policy, which involves sharing fewer, less sensitive model parameters. Our findings suggest that the Share less strategy offers a better privacy-utility trade-off, especially in GL.</description>

      <title>Epidemic-induced local awareness behavior inferred from surveys and genetic sequence data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09983v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Behavior-disease models suggest that pandemics can be contained cost-effectively if individuals take preventive actions when disease prevalence rises among their close contacts. However, assessing local awareness behavior in real-world datasets remains a challenge. Through the analysis of mutation patterns in clinical genetic sequence data, we propose an efficient approach to quantify the impact of local awareness by identifying superspreading events and assigning containment scores to them.
  We validate the proposed containment score as a proxy for local awareness in simulation experiments, and find that it was correlated positively with policy stringency during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we observe a temporary drop in the containment score during the Omicron wave in the United Kingdom, matching a survey experiment we carried out in Hungary during the corresponding period of the pandemic. Our findings bring important insight into the field of awareness modeling through the analysis of large-scale genetic sequence data, one of the most promising data sources in epidemics research.</description>

      <title>FairACE: Achieving Degree Fairness in Graph Neural Networks via Contrastive and Adversarial Group-Balanced Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fairness has been a significant challenge in graph neural networks (GNNs) since degree biases often result in un-equal prediction performance among nodes with varying degrees. Existing GNN models focus on prediction accuracy, frequently overlooking fairness across different degree groups. To addressthis issue, we propose a novel GNN framework, namely Fairness- Aware Asymmetric Contrastive Ensemble (FairACE), which inte-grates asymmetric contrastive learning with adversarial training to improve degree fairness. FairACE captures one-hop local neighborhood information and two-hop monophily similarity to create fairer node representations and employs a degree fairness regulator to balance performance between high-degree and low-degree nodes. During model training, a novel group-balanced fairness loss is proposed to minimize classification disparities across degree groups. In addition, we also propose a novel fairness metric, the Accuracy Distribution Gap (ADG), which can quantitatively assess and ensure equitable performance across different degree-based node groups. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FairACE significantly improves degree fairness metrics while maintaining competitive accuracy in comparison to the state-of-the-art GNN models.</description>
