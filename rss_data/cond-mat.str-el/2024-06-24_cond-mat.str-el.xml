      <title>Reducing dynamical fluctuations and enforcing self-averaging by opening many-body quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the dynamical fluctuations of many-body quantum systems out of equilibrium can be mitigated when they are opened to a dephasing environment. We consider the survival probability (spectral form factor with a filter) evolving under different kinds of random matrices and under a spin-1/2 model with weak and strong disorder. In isolated many-body quantum systems, the survival probability is non-self-averaging at any timescale, that is, the relative variance of its fluctuations does not decrease with system size. By opening the system, we find that the fluctuations are always reduced, but self-averaging can only be ensured away from critical points. Self-averaging is achieved for the long-time dynamics of full random matrices, power-law banded random matrices deep in the delocalized phase, and the Rosenzweig-Porter ensemble in all the phases except at the delocalization-localization transition point. For the spin model, the survival probability becomes self-averaging only in the chaotic regime provided the initial states are in the middle of the spectrum. Overall, a strongly non-self-averaging survival probability in open systems is an indicator of criticality.</description>

      <title>Absence of a bulk charge density wave signature in x-ray measurements of UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14688v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-sought pair density wave (PDW) is an exotic phase of matter in which charge density wave (CDW) order is intertwined with the amplitude or phase of coexisting, superconducting order \cite{Berg2009,Berg2009b}. Originally predicted to exist in copper-oxides, circumstantial evidence for PDW order now exists in a variety of materials. Recently, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies have reported evidence for a three-component charge density wave (CDW) at the surface of the heavy-fermion superconductor, UTe$_2$, persisting below its superconducting transition temperature. Here, we use hard x-ray diffraction measurements on crystals of UTe$_2$ at $T = 1.9$ K and $12$ K to search for a bulk signature of this CDW. Using STM measurements as a constraint, we calculate the expected locations of CDW superlattice peaks, and sweep a large volume of reciprocal space in search of a signature. We failed to find any evidence for a CDW near any of the expected superlattice positions in many Brillouin zones. We estimate an upper bound on the CDW lattice distortion of $u_{max} \lesssim 4 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{\AA}$. Our results suggest that the CDW observed in STM is either purely electronic, somehow lacking a signature in the structural lattice, or is restricted to the material surface.</description>

      <title>Absence of bulk charge density wave order in the normal state of UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14690v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A spatially modulated superconducting state at zero magnetic field, known as pair density wave (PDW), is a tantalizing state of matter with unique properties. PDWs have been observed in diverse spin-singlet superconductors ranging from high-temperature cuprate and Fe-based superconductors to kagome and two-dimensional chalcogenide compounds. Recent scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies reveal that spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$ hosts an unprecedented spin-triplet PDW whose wavevectors are indistinguishable from a preceding charge-density wave (CDW) order that survives to temperatures well above the superconducting critical temperature, $T_{c}$. Whether the PDW is the mother or a subordinate order remains unsettled. Here, based on a systematic search for bulk charge order above $T_{c}$ using resonant elastic X-ray scattering (REXS), we show that the structure factor of charge order previously identified by STM is absent in the bulk within the sensitivity of REXS, which implies that the reported CDW order in the normal state of UTe$_2$ is a surface phenomenon. Our results invite two scenarios: either the density-wave orders condense simultaneously at $T_{c}$ in the bulk, in which case PDW order is likely the mother phase, or these modulations are restricted to the surface.</description>

      <title>Absence of a Bulk Thermodynamic Phase Transition to a Density Wave Phase in UTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Competing and intertwined orders are ubiquitous in strongly correlated electron systems, such as the charge, spin, and superconducting orders in the high-Tc cuprates. Recent scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements provide evidence for a charge density wave (CDW) that coexists with superconductivity in the heavy Fermion metal UTe2. This CDW persists up to at least 7.5 K and, as a CDW breaks the translational symmetry of the lattice, its disappearance is necessarily accompanied by thermodynamic phase transition. Here, we report high-precision thermodynamic measurements of the elastic moduli of UTe2. We observe no signature of a phase transition in the elastic moduli down to a level of 1 part in 10^7, strongly implying the absence of bulk CDW order in UTe2. We suggest that the CDW and associated pair density wave (PDW) observed by STM may be confined to the surface of UTe2.</description>

      <title>A mechanism for quantum-critical Planckian metal phase in high-temperature cuprate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mysterious metallic phase showing perfect $T$-linear resistivity and a universal scattering rate $1/\tau = \alpha_P k_B T /\hbar$ with a universal prefactor $\alpha_P \sim 1$ and logarithmic-in-temperature singular specific heat coefficient, so-called Planckian metal phase was observed in various overdoped high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors over a finite range in doping. Here, we propose a microscopic mechanism for this exotic state based on quantum-critical bosonic charge Kondo fluctuations coupled to both spinon and a heavy conduction-electron Fermi surfaces within the heavy-fermion formulation of the slave-boson $t$-$J$ model. Using a controlled perturbative renormalization group (RG) analysis, we examine the competition between the pseudogap phase, characterized by Anderson's Resonating-Valence-Bond spin-liquid, and the Fermi-liquid state, characterized by the electron hoping (effective charge Kondo effect). We find a quantum-critical metallic phase with a universal Planckian $\hbar \omega/k_B T$ scaling in scattering rate near a localized-delocalized (pseudogap-to-Fermi liquid) charge Kondo breakdown transition. Our results are in excellent agreement with the recent experimental observations on optical conductivity (without fine-tuning) in Nat. Commun. 14, 3033 (2023), universal doping-independent field-to-temperature scaling in magnetoresistance in Nature 595, 661 (2021), and the marginal Fermi-liquid spectral function observed in ARPES (Science 366, 1099 (2019)) as well as Hall coefficient in various overdoped cuprates in Nature 595, 661 (2021) and Annu. Rev. Condens. Matter Phys. 10, 409 (2019). Our mechanism offers a microscopic understanding of the quantum-critical Planckian metal phase observed in cuprates d-wave superconducting, and Fermi liquid phases.</description>

      <title>Probing topological phase transitions in Aubry-Andre-Harper model via high-harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the high-harmonic generation in the Aubry-Andre-Harper (AAH) model. The modulating phase of the AAH model is used as a control parameter while preserving the chiral symmetry hosting the zero-energy edge states. The harmonic yield in a particular energy range exhibits a strong dependence on the control parameter with clear separation of the region of topologically trivial and nontrivial phases of the system. The threshold for the harmonic yield is found to serve as an all-optical tool for detecting topological phases. We extended our study with broken chiral symmetry by including the onsite potential. The introduction of the onsite potential lifts the degeneracy in the edge states, which affects the harmonic enhancement. Furthermore, it is also observed that the system's onsite strength can control the HHG yield.</description>

      <title>Thermal activated detection of dark particles in a weakly coupled quantum Ising ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ising$_h^2$ integrable field theory, which emerges when two quantum critical Ising chains are weakly coupled, possesses eight types of relativistic particles whose mass spectrum and scattering matrices are organized by the $\mathcal{D}_8^{(1)}$ algebra. It is predicted that all odd-parity particles are dark and cannot be directly excited from the ground state. This makes these dark particles hard to be detected. Here, we study the local dynamical spin structure factor of the model at low-frequencies and low-temperatures. In contrast to the invisibility of the dark particles in THz spectroscopy or inelastic neutron scattering measurement, we find that the lightest dark particle is detectable, manifested as a thermal activation gap in nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. Our results provide a practical criterion for verifying the existence of dark particles.</description>

      <title>Decoupled static and dynamical charge correlations in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relation between charge order, its quantum fluctuations and optical phonon modes in cuprate superconductors remains an unsolved problem. The exploration of these excitations is however complicated by the presence of twinned domains. Here, we use uniaxial strain in combination with ultra-high-resolution Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) at the oxygen K- and copper L3-edges to study the excitations stemming from the charge ordering wave vector in La1.875Sr0.125CuO4. By detwinning stripe ordering, we demonstrate that the optical phonon anomalies do not show any stripe anisotropy. The low-energy charge excitations also retain an in-plane four-fold symmetry. As such, we find that both phonon and charge excitations are decoupled entirely from the strength of static charge ordering. The almost isotropic character of charge excitations remains a possible source for the strange metal properties found in the normal state of cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Time-Domain Signatures of Distinct Correlated Insulators in a Moir\'e Superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among expanding discoveries of quantum phases in moir\'e superlattices, correlated insulators stand out as both the most stable and most commonly observed. Despite the central importance of these states in moir\'e physics, little is known about their underlying nature. Here, we use pump-probe spectroscopy to show distinct time-domain signatures of correlated insulators at fillings of one (v = -1) and two (v = -2) holes per moir\'e unit cell in the angle-aligned WSe2/WS2 system. Following photo-doping, we find that the disordering time of the v = -1 state is independent of excitation density (n_ex), as expected from the characteristic phonon response time associated with a polaronic state. In contrast, the disordering time of the v = -2 state scales with (n_ex)^-0.5, in agreement with plasmonic screening from free holons and doublons. These states display disparate reordering behavior dominated either by first order (v = -1) or second order (v = -2) recombination, suggesting the presence of Hubbard excitons and free carrier-like holons/doublons, respectively. Our work delineates the roles of electron-phonon (e-ph) versus electron-electron (e-e) interactions in correlated insulators on the moir\'e landscape and establishes non-equilibrium responses as mechanistic signatures for distinguishing and discovering quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Luttinger surface dominance and Fermi liquid behaviour of topological Kondo insulators SmB$_6$ and YbB$_{12}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defying the traditional classification into metals and insulators, several materials simultaneously display metallic thermal properties and insulating electric behaviour, as if they hosted quasiparticles carrying entropy but not charge. Among them, some materials also possess quantum oscillations in magnetic fields as if they had well-defined Fermi surfaces despite the insulating gap. This remarkable dichotomy has been observed in the topological Kondo insulators SmB$_6$ and YbB$_{12}$. Prompted by the peculiar mixed-valence nature of these compounds, involving $f$ and $d$ electrons of the lanthanide, we propose an explanation of their intriguing properties drawing inspiration from the physics of the pseudogap phase in underdoped cuprates. We argue that the $f$ and $d$ subsystems, when considered separately, act, respectively, as electron- and hole-doped Mott insulators, featuring Fermi pockets coexisting with Luttinger surfaces responsible for the pseudogap. When the two are coupled to each other a hybridisation gap opens up, and the whole turns into a topological insulator endowed with genuine chiral edge states. However, the Luttinger surfaces persist and support neutral quasiparticles. This scenario, supported by numerical simulations within the dynamical cluster approximation, effectively resolves the paradoxical phenomenology of SmB$_6$ and YbB$_{12}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The momentum space of topological insulators and topological superconductors is equipped with a quantum metric defined from the overlap of neighboring valence band states or quasihole states. We investigate the quantum geometrical properties of these materials within the framework of Dirac models and differential geometry. The Ricci scalar is found to be a constant throughout the whole Brillouin zone, and the vacuum Einstein equation is satisfied in 3D with a finite cosmological constant. For linear Dirac models, several geometrical properties are found to be independent of the band gap, including the straight line geodesic, constant volume of the curved momentum space, exponential decay form of the nonlocal topological marker, and unity Euler characteristic in 2D, indicating the peculiar yet universal quantum geometrical properties of these models.</description>

      <title>A Candidate for the Quantum Spin Liquid Ground-State in the Shastry-Sutherland Lattice Material Yb$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasi-2D Shastry-Sutherland model has remained topical in the field of condensed matter physics for the last two decades, following the experimental realization of the model in the material SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$. Since then, research into the Shastry-Sutherland system has revealed more nuanced physics than initially predicted; recent theoretical works have even predicted a quantum spin liquid phase may exist. Herein, we report on a new Shastry-Sutherland lattice material, Yb$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_7$, of the rare-earth melilite family RE$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_7$. We find, through SQUID magnetometry, powder neutron diffraction, specific heat capacity, and muon spin relaxation, that Yb$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_7$ lacks magnetic order and exhibits persistent spin dynamics to at least 17 mK. We propose the Shastry-Sutherland lattice material Yb$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_7$ as a candidate to host a quantum spin liquid ground-state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the phase diagrams of moir\'e materials in search of a new class of intervalley-coherent correlated insulating state: the Chern texture insulator (CTI). This phase of matter, proposed in a companion paper, breaks valley $U(1)$ symmetry in a nontrivial fashion wherein the valley order parameter is forced to texture in momentum space as a consequence of band topology. Using detailed Hartree-Fock studies, we establish that the CTI emerges as an energetically competitive intermediate-coupling ground state in several moir\'e systems which lack a twofold rotation symmetry that forbids the single-particle topology essential to the formation of the CTI valley texture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study new interacting topological states that arise in time-reversal symmetric bands with an underlying obstruction to forming localized states. If the $U(1)$ valley symmetry linked to independent charge conservation in each time-reversal sector is spontaneously broken, the corresponding `excitonic' order parameter is forced to form a topologically non-trivial texture across the Brillouin zone. We show that the resulting phase, which we dub a textured exciton insulator, cannot be given a local-moment description due to a form of delicate topology. Using toy models of bands with Chern or Euler obstructions to localization we construct explicit examples of the Chern or Euler texture insulators (CTIs or ETIs) they support, and demonstrate that these are generically competitive ground states at intermediate coupling. We construct field theories that capture the response properties of these new states. Finally, we identify the incommensurate Kekul\'e spiral phase observed in magic-angle bi- and trilayer graphene as a concrete realization of an ETI.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in moir\'e engineering motivate study of the behavior of strongly-correlated electrons subject to substantial orbital magnetic flux. We investigate the triangular lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard model at one-quarter flux quantum per plaquette and a density of one electron per site, where geometric frustration has been argued to stabilize a chiral spin liquid phase intermediate between the weak-coupling integer quantum Hall and strong-coupling 120deg antiferromagnetic phases. In this work, we use Density Matrix Renormalization Group methods and analytical arguments to analyze the compactification of the Hofstadter-Hubbard model to cylinders of finite radius. We introduce a glide particle-hole symmetry operation which for odd-circumference cylinders, we show, is spontaneously broken at the quantum Hall to spin liquid transition. We further demonstrate that the transition is associated with a diverging correlation length of a charge-neutral operator. For even-circumference cylinders the transition is associated with a dramatic quantitative enhancement in the correlation length upon threading external magnetic flux. Altogether, we argue that the 2+1D CSL-IQH transition is in fact continuous and features critical correlations of the charge density and other spin rotationally-invariant observables.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by a recent experiment reporting the fractional quantum spin Hall effect in twisted ${\rm MoTe}_2$, we investigate microscopically the prospects of realizing exotic topologically ordered states beyond conventional quantum Hall physics. We show that a non-Abelian spin Hall insulator, a state of two copies of the non-Abelian Moore-Read state, can be stabilized at half filling of time-reversal conjugate Chern bands. We elucidate that the existence of this phase relies on the reduction of opposite-spin interactions at short distances to overcome the Ising ferromagnetism. Moreover, we demonstrate that band mixing provides a generic mechanism for this reduction to be achieved. Quite remarkably, we find that a renormalization of opposite-spin interactions at short distances as small as 15 % of the moir\'e period is sufficient for a direct transition to a completely spin unpolarized phase which supports the non-Abelian spin Hall insulator. Furthermore, we show that the non-Abelian spin Hall insulator can either break time-reversal symmetry or preserve it depending on the underlying topological order.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization Priors for Efficient Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers currently rely on a hybrid quantum-classical approach known as Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) to solve problems. Still, there are several challenges with VQAs on the classical computing side: it corresponds to a black-box optimization problem that is generally non-convex, the observations from the quantum hardware are noisy, and the quantum computing time is expensive. The first point is inherent to the problem structure; as a result, it requires the classical part of VQAs to be solved using global optimization strategies. However, there is a trade-off between cost and accuracy; typically, quantum computers return a set of bit strings, where each bitstring is referred to as a shot. The probabilistic nature of quantum computing (QC) necessitates many shots to measure the circuit accurately. Since QC time is charged per shot, reducing the number of shots yields cheaper and less accurate observations. Recently, there has been increasing interest in using basic Bayesian optimization (BO) methods to globally optimize quantum circuit parameters. This work proposes two modifications to the basic BO framework to provide a shot-efficient optimization strategy for VQAs. Specifically, we provide a means to place a prior on the periodicity of the rotation angles and a framework to place a topological prior using few-shot quantum circuit observations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach through an ablation study, showing that using both proposed features statistically outperforms a standard BO implementation within VQAs for computational chemistry simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in engineering mesoscopic quantum devices have led to new material platforms where electronic transport can be achieved on foldable structures. In this respect, we study quantum phases and their transitions on a Kirigami structure, a Japanese craft form, where its individual building blocks are topologically non-trivial. In particular, we find that by mechanically deforming the Kirigami structure one can engineer topological phase transitions in the system. Using a multipronged approach, we show that the physics of the system can be captured within a transfer matrix formalism akin to Chalker-Coddington networks, where the junctions describe scattering between effective non-Hermitian one-dimensional edge channels. We further show that the nature of the Kirigami structure can affect the critical folding angles where the topological phase transitions occur. Our study shows the rich interplay between topological quantum phenomena and structural configuration of an underlying Kirigami network reflecting its potential as an intriguing platform.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale defects as probes of time reversal symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoscale defects such as Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) centers can serve as sensitive and non-invasive probes of electromagnetic fields and fluctuations from materials, which in turn can be used to characterize these systems. Here we specifically discuss how NV centers can directly probe time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) phenomena in low-dimensional conductors and magnetic insulators. We argue that the relaxation rate of NV centers can vary dramatically depending on whether its magnetic dipole points towards or away from the TRSB material. This effect arises from the difference in the fluctuation spectrum of left and right-polarized magnetic fields emanating from such materials. It is perhaps most dramatic in the quantum Hall setting where the NV center may experience no additional contribution to its relaxation due to the presence of the material when initialized in a particular spin state but a large decay rate when initialized in the opposite spin state. More generally, we show that the NV center relaxation rate is sensitive to the imaginary part of the wave-vector dependent Hall conductivity of a TRSB material. We argue that this can be used to determine the Hall viscosity, which can potentially distinguish candidate fractional quantum Hall states and pairing angular momentum in TRSB chiral superconductors. We also consider Wigner crystals realized in systems with large Berry curvature and discuss how the latter may be extracted from NV center relaxometry.</description>

      <title>Stirring the false vacuum via interacting quantized bubbles on a 5564-qubit quantum annealer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: False vacuum decay is a potential mechanism governing the evolution of the early Universe, with profound connections to non-equilibrium quantum physics, including quenched dynamics, the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, and dynamical metastability. The non-perturbative character of the false vacuum decay and the scarcity of its experimental probes make the effect notoriously difficult to study, with many basic open questions, such as how the bubbles of true vacuum form, move and interact with each other. Here we utilize a quantum annealer with 5564 superconducting flux qubits to directly observe quantized bubble formation in real time -- the hallmark of false vacuum decay dynamics. Moreover, we develop an effective model that describes the initial bubble creation and subsequent interaction effects. We demonstrate that the effective model remains accurate in the presence of dissipation, showing that our annealer can access coherent scaling laws in driven many-body dynamics of 5564 qubits for over $1\mu$s, i.e., more than 1000 intrinsic qubit time units. This work sets the stage for exploring late-time dynamics of the false vacuum at computationally intractable system sizes, dimensionality, and topology in quantum annealer platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The giant electro- and elasto-caloric effects in spin chain materials are predicted. The theory is based on the exact quantum mechanical solution of the problem. It is shown that the giant jumps in the entropy and the temperature caused by the caloric effect are weakly affected by the initial temperature. The effect can be used for the cooling of new quantum devices (like systems of qubits in quantum computers). On the other hand, since large changes are predicted in the narrow neighborhood of the critical point, the predicted effect can be used in ultra-sensitive electric and stress sensors for modern microelectronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pairing mechanism behind the monolayer FeSe is one essential question for iron-based superconductors. In this work, we show the sublattice degree of freedoms of monolayer FeSe plays a special role in its pairing properties, namely the sublattice dichotomy. The high-quality monolayer FeSe samples with atomic flat $1\times1$ topography on the SrTiO$_3$(001) substrates are grown by molecular beam epitaxy. By comparing the tunneling spectra at $\alpha$ and $\beta$ Fe sublattices, we find the coherence peak of $\alpha$-Fe at the inner gap $+V_i$ is higher than $\beta$-Fe while the coherence peak of $\beta$-Fe at $-V_i$ is higher than $\alpha$-Fe with a similar amount. We also observed a reversed effect at the outer gap $\pm V_o$. We propose the $\eta$-pairing mechanism between $k$ and $-k+Q$ is the key mechanism for this unconventional sublattice dichotomy effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a hydrodynamic description for the driven-dissipative dynamics of the entanglement negativity, which quantifies the genuine entanglement in mixed-state systems. We focus on quantum quenches in fermionic and bosonic systems subject to linear dissipation, as described by quadratic Lindblad master equations. In the spirit of hydrodynamics, we divide the system into mesoscopic cells. At early times, correlations are generated in each cell by the unitary component of the evolution. Correlations are then transported across different cells via ballistic quasiparticle propagation, while simultaneously evolving under the action of the environment. We show that in the hydrodynamic limit the negativity can be reconstructed from the correlations between the independently propagating quasiparticles. We benchmark our approach considering quenches from both homogeneous and inhomogeneous initial states in the Kitaev chain, the tight-binding chain, and the harmonic chain in the presence of gain/loss dissipation.</description>

      <title>Universal Aspects of High-Temperature Relaxation Dynamics in Random Spin Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Universality is a crucial concept in modern physics, allowing us to capture the essential features of a system's behavior using a small set of parameters. In this work, we unveil universal spin relaxation dynamics in anisotropic random Heisenberg models with infinite-range interactions at high temperatures. Starting from a polarized state, the total magnetization can relax monotonically or decay with long-lived oscillations, determined by the sign of a universal single function $A=-\xi_1^2+\xi_2^2-4\xi_2\xi_3+\xi_3^2$. Here $(\xi_1,\xi_3,\xi_3)$ characterizes the anisotropy of the Heisenberg interaction. Furthermore, the oscillation shows up only for $A&gt;0$, with frequency $\Omega \propto \sqrt{A}$. To validate our theory, we compare it to numerical simulations by solving the Kadanoff-Baym (KB) equation with a melon diagram approximation and the exact diagonalization (ED). The results show our theoretical prediction works in both cases, regardless of a small system size $N=8$ in ED simulations. Our study sheds light on the universal aspect of quantum many-body dynamics beyond low energy limit.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents two methods for topological analysis of the complex Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model using the quantum geometric tensor: Berry phase and topological data analysis. We demonstrate how both methods can effectively generate topological phase diagrams for the model, revealing two distinct regions based on the relative magnitudes of the parameters $|v|$ and $|w|$. Specifically, when $|v| &gt; |w|$, the system is found to be topologically trivial, whereas for $|v| &lt; |w|$, it exhibits topologically non-trivial behavior. Our results contribute to building the groundwork for topological analysis of more complicated SSH-type models.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependence of energy transport in the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ chiral clock model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00046v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ matrix product state simulations to study energy transport within the non-integrable regime of the one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_3$ chiral clock model. To induce a non-equilibrium steady state throughout the system, we consider open system dynamics with boundary driving featuring jump operators with adjustable temperature and footprint in the system. Given a steady state, we diagnose the effective local temperature by minimizing the trace distance between the true local state and the local state of a uniform thermal ensemble. Via a scaling analysis, we extract the transport coefficients of the model at relatively high temperatures above both its gapless and gapped low-temperature phases. In the medium-to-high temperature regime we consider, diffusive transport is observed regardless of the low-temperature physics. We calculate the temperature dependence of the energy diffusion constant as a function of model parameters, including in the regime where the model is quantum critical at the low temperature. Notably, even within the gapless regime, an analysis based on power series expansion implies that intermediate-temperature transport can be accessed within a relatively confined setup. Although we are not yet able to reach temperatures where quantum critical scaling would be observed, our approach is able to access the transport properties of the model over a broad range of temperatures and parameters. We conclude by discussing the limitations of our method and potential extensions that could expand its scope, for example, to even lower temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16660v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the low-energy properties of the one-dimensional spin-1/2 XXZ chain with time-reversal symmetry-breaking pseudo-scalar chiral interaction and propose a phase diagram for the model. In the integrable case of the isotropic Heisenberg model with the chiral interaction, we employ the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz to find "chiralization", the response of the ground state versus the strength of the pseudo-scalar chiral interaction of a chiral Heisenberg chain. Unlike the magnetization case, the chirality of the ground state remains zero until the transition point corresponding to critical coupling $\alpha_c=2J/\pi$ with $J$ being the antiferromagnetic spin-exchange interaction. The central-charge $c=1$ conformal field theories (CFTs) describe the two phases with zero and finite chirality. We show for this particular case and conjecture more generally for similar phase transitions that the difference between two emergent CFTs with identical central charges lies in the symmetry of their ground state (lightest weight) primary fields, i.e., the two phases are symmetry-enriched CFTs. At finite but small temperatures, the non-chiral Heisenberg phase acquires a finite chirality that scales with the temperature quadratically. We show that the finite-size effect around the transition point probes the transition.</description>

Abstract: We present muon spin rotation and relaxation ($\mu$SR) results for chalcogenide spinels CuCr$_2$X$_4$ with X= S and Se. Both compounds are known as ferromagnetic metals with high Curie temperatures. Our $\mu$SR and magnetization data show clear signatures for additional magnetic transitions far below the respective Curie temperatures. They can be related to changes in the Cr valence system from the mixed valence between Cr$^{3+}$ and Cr$^{4+}$ at high temperatures with collinear ferromagnetism to a charge-ordered state at low temperatures with a different ferromagnetic structure. Our results demonstrate that the electronic systems and the related spin structures of both compounds are more complex than assumed so far.</description>

Abstract: The time-evolving matrix product operator (TEMPO) method has become a very competitive numerical method for studying the real-time dynamics of quantum impurity problems. For small impurities, the most challenging calculation in TEMPO is to construct the matrix product state representation of the Feynman-Vernon influence functional. In this work we propose an efficient method for this task, which exploits the time-translationally invariant property of the influence functional. The required number of matrix product state multiplication in our method is almost independent of the total evolution time, as compared to the method originally used in TEMPO which requires a linearly scaling number of multiplications. The accuracy and efficiency of this method are demonstrated for the Toulouse model and the single impurity Anderson model.</description>

Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) at the filling factor with an even denominator, 5/2, occurs despite the expectation, due to the electron statistics, that the denominator must be an odd number. It is believed that the Cooper pairing of underlying quasiparticles, composite fermions (CFs), leads to the explanation of this effect. Such a state should have a Pfaffian form of the BCS wave function (due to the absence of spin) and non-Abelian statistics of possible vortex-like excitations (due to the $p$-wave nature of the pairing). Here we expose the origin of pairing by using the effective dipole representation of the problem and show that pairing is encoded in a Hamiltonian that describes the interaction of the charge density with dipoles i.e. the current of CFs. The necessary condition for the paired state to exist is the effective dipole physics at the Fermi level as a consequence of the non-trivial topology of the ideal band in which electrons live - a Landau level (LL); the paired state is a resolution of the unstable, critical behaviour characterized by the distancing of correlation hole with respect to electron (and thus dipole) at the Fermi level due to the topology. We describe analytically this deconfined critical point, at which deconfinement of Majorana neutral fermions takes place. In the presence of large, short-range repulsive interaction inside a LL, the critical behavior may be stabilized into a regularized Fermi-liquid-like (FLL) state, like the one that characterizes the physics in the lowest LL (LLL), but in general, for an interaction with slowly decaying pseudopotentials, the system is prone to pairing.</description>

      <title>Protecting coherence from the environment via Stark many-body localization in a Quantum-Dot Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.13354v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor platforms are emerging as a promising architecture for storing and processing quantum information, e.g., in quantum dot spin qubits. However, charge noise coming from interactions between the electrons is a major limiting factor, along with the scalability of many qubits, for a quantum computer. We show that a magnetic field gradient can be implemented in a semiconductor quantum dot array to induce a local quantum coherent dynamical $\ell-$bit exhibiting the potential to be used as logical qubits. These dynamical $\ell-$bits are responsible for the model being many-body localized. We show that these dynamical $\ell-$bits and the corresponding many-body localization are protected from all noises, including phonons, for sufficiently long times if electron-phonon interaction is not non-local. We further show the implementation of thermalization-based self-correcting logical gates. This thermalization-based error correction goes beyond the standard paradigm of decoherence-free and noiseless subsystems. Our work thus opens a new venue for passive quantum error correction in semiconductor-based quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative dynamics of flat-band systems with correlated disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a numerical method for the time evolution of Gaussian wave packets on flat-band lattices in the presence of correlated disorder. To achieve this, we introduce a method to generate random on-site energies with prescribed correlations. We verify this method with a one-dimensional (1D) cross-stitch model, and find good agreement with analytical results obtained from the disorder-dressed evolution equations. This allows us to reproduce previous findings, that disorder can mobilize 1D flat-band states which would otherwise remain localized. As explained by the corresponding disorder-dressed evolution equations, such mobilization requires an asymmetric disorder-induced coupling to dispersive bands, a condition that is generically not fulfilled when the flat-band is resonant with the dispersive bands at a Dirac point-like crossing. We exemplify this with the 1D Lieb lattice. While analytical expressions are not available for the two-dimensional (2D) system due to its complexity, we extend the numerical method to the 2D $\alpha-T_3$ model, and find that the initial flat-band wave packet preserves its localization when $\alpha = 0$, regardless of disorder and intersections. However, when $\alpha\neq 0$, the wave packet shifts in real space. We interpret this as a Berry phase controlled, disorder-induced wave-packet mobilization. In addition, we present density functional theory calculations of candidate materials, specifically $\rm Hg_{1-x}Cd_xTe$. The flat-band emerges near the $\Gamma$ point ($\bf{k}=$0) in the Brillouin zone.</description>

      <title>Programmable order by disorder effect and underlying phases through dipolar quantum simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00849v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study two different quantum simulators composed of molecules with dipole-dipole interaction through various theoretical and numerical tools. Our first result provides knowledge upon the quantum order by disorder effect of the $S=1/2$ system, which is programmable in a quantum simulator composed of circular Rydberg atoms in the triangular optical lattice with a controllable diagonal anisotropy. When the numbers of up spins and down spins are equal, a set of sub-extensive degenerate ground states is present in the classical limit, composed of continuous strings whose configuration enjoys a large degree of freedom. Adopting the the real space perturbation theory, our calculation demonstrates a lifting of the degeneracy, favoring the stripe configuration. When $J$ becomes larger, we adopt the infinite projected entangled-pair state~(iPEPS) and numerically check the effect of degeneracy lifting. The iPEPS results show that even when the spin exchange coupling is strong the stripe pattern is still favored. Next, we study the dipolar bosonic model with tilted polar angle which can be realized through a quantum simulator composed of cold atomic gas with dipole-dipole interaction in an optical lattice. By placing the atoms in a triangular lattice and tilting the polar angle, the diagonal anisotropy can also be realized in the bosonic system. With our cluster mean-field theory calculation, we provide various phase diagrams with different tilted angles, showing the abundant underlying phases including the supersolid. Our proposal indicates realizable scenarios through quantum simulators in studying the quantum effect as well as extraordinary phases. We believe that our results indicated here can also become a good benchmark for the two-dimensional quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Efficient Preparation of Nonabelian Topological Orders in the Doubled Hilbert Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realizing nonabelian topological orders and their anyon excitations is an esteemed objective. In this work, we propose a novel approach towards this goal: quantum simulating topological orders in the doubled Hilbert space - the space of density matrices. We show that ground states of all quantum double models (toric code being the simplest example) can be efficiently prepared in the doubled Hilbert space; only finite-depth local operations are needed. In contrast, this is not the case in the conventional Hilbert space: Ground states of only some of these models are known to be efficiently preparable. Additionally, we find that nontrivial anyon braiding effects, both abelian and nonabelian, can be realized in the doubled Hilbert space, although the intrinsic nature of density matrices restricts possible excitations.</description>

      <title>Holographic dual effective field theory for an SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12097v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive an emergent holographic dual description for an SYK model, where the renormalization group (RG) flows of collective bi-local fields appear manifestly in the bulk effective action with an emergent extradimension. This holographic dual effective field theory reproduces $1/N$ quantum corrections given by the Schwarzian action when we take the UV limit in the bulk effective action. Going into the IR regime in the extradimension, we observe that the field theoretic $1/N$, $1/N^{2}$, ... quantum corrections are resummed in the all-loop order and reorganized to form a holographic dual effective field theory in a large $N$ fashion living on the one-higher dimensional spacetime. Taking the large $N$ limit in the holographic dual effective field theory, we obtain nonlinearly coupled second-order bulk differential equations of motion for the three bi-local order-parameter fields of fermion self-energy, Green's function, and polarization function. Here, both UV and IR boundary conditions are derived self-consistently from the boundary effective action. We solve these highly intertwined nonlinear differential equations based on the so called matching method. Our ansatz for the bi-local order-parameter fields coincide with the conformally invariant solution of the field theoretic large $N$ limit in the UV limit, but their overall coefficients RG-flow along the extradimensional space, respectively, reflecting effects of higher-order quantum corrections. As a result, we find an insulating behavior, where the self-energy diverges at IR. To confirm this insulating physics, we investigate thermodynamics. We obtain an effective free energy functional in terms of such bi-local dual order-parameter fields, which satisfy the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of the holographic dual effective field theory. ...</description>

      <title>Magnetothermopower of nodal line semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for materials with large thermopower is of great practical interest. Dirac and Weyl semimetals have recently proven to exhibit superior thermoelectric properties, particularly when subjected to a quantizing magnetic field. Here we consider whether a similar enhancement arises in nodal line semimetals, for which the conduction and valence band meet at a line or ring in momentum space. We compute the Seebeck and Nernst coefficients for arbitrary temperature and magnetic field and we find a wealth of different scaling regimes. Most strikingly, when a sufficiently strong magnetic field is applied along the direction of a straight nodal line or in the plane of a nodal ring, the large degeneracy of states leads to a large, linear-in-$B$ thermopower that is temperature-independent even at low temperatures. Our results suggest that nodal line semimetals may offer significant opportunity for efficient, low-temperature thermoelectrics.</description>

      <title>General criterion for non-Hermitian skin effects and Application: Fock space skin effects in many body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity enables macroscopic accumulation of bulk states, named non-Hermitian skin effects. The non-Hermitian skin effects are well-established for single-particle systems, but their proper characterization for general systems is elusive. Here, we propose a general criterion of non-Hermitian skin effects, which works for any finite-dimensional system evolved by a linear operator. The applicable systems include many-body systems and network systems. A system meeting the criterion exhibits enhanced non-normality of the evolution operator, accompanied by exceptional characteristics intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems. Applying the criterion, we discover a new type of non-Hermitian skin effect in many-body systems, which we dub the Fock space skin effect. We also discuss the Fock space skin effect-induced slow dynamics, which gives an experimental signal for the Fock space skin effect.</description>

      <title>Emergence of spatial patterns and synchronization in superconducting time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify a time crystal phase characterized by a frequency half of the driving frequency in disordered superconductors by employing the time dependent Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism at zero temperature with a periodically driven coupling constant. After a period of exponential increase of spatial inhomogeneities and exponential suppression of the order parameter amplitude, the time crystal develops islands of different sizes. Each of these islands is a time crystal with the same frequency albeit with a phase shift $\pi$ with respect to the homogeneous time crystal. After its emergence, the island gradually becomes smaller, though the phase shift persists, until it is abruptly synchronized at a time that it depends on its initial size. We find a critical disorder strength, still deep in the metallic phase, at which the time crystal phase terminates. For even stronger disorder, the order parameter oscillates with the driving frequency in regions where localization effects are not important.</description>
