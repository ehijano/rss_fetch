      <title>Data-Driven Nonlinear Regulation: Gaussian Process Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article addresses the output regulation problem for a class of nonlinear systems using a data-driven approach. An output feedback controller is proposed that integrates a traditional control component with a data-driven learning algorithm based on Gaussian Process (GP) regression to learn the nonlinear internal model. Specifically, a data-driven technique is employed to directly approximate the unknown internal model steady-state map from observed input-output data online. Our method does not rely on model-based observers utilized in previous studies, making it robust and suitable for systems with modelling errors and model uncertainties. Finally, we demonstrate through numerical examples and detailed stability analysis that, under suitable conditions, the closed-loop system remains bounded and converges to a compact set, with the size of this set decreasing as the accuracy of the data-driven model improves over time.</description>

      <title>Proof of a conjecture on isolation of graphs with a universal vertex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A copy of a graph $F$ is called an $F$-copy. For any graph $G$, the $F$-isolation number of $G$, denoted by $\iota(G,F)$, is the size of a smallest subset $D$ of the vertex set of $G$ such that the closed neighbourhood $N[D]$ of $D$ in $G$ intersects the vertex sets of the $F$-copies contained by $G$ (equivalently, $G-N[D]$ contains no $F$-copy). Thus, $\iota(G,K_1)$ is the domination number $\gamma(G)$ of $G$, and $\iota(G,K_2)$ is the vertex-edge domination number of $G$. Settling a conjecture of Zhang and Wu, the first author proved that if $F$ is a $k$-edge graph, $\gamma(F) = 1$ (that is, $F$ has a vertex that is adjacent to all the other vertices of $F$), and $G$ is a connected $m$-edge graph, then $\iota(G,F) \leq \frac{m+1}{k+2} $ unless $G$ is an $F$-copy or $F$ is a $3$-path and $G$ is a $6$-cycle. We prove another conjecture of Zhang and Wu by determining the graphs that attain the bound.</description>

      <title>Immersions of large cliques in graphs with independence number 2 and bounded maximum degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An immersion of a graph $H$ in a graph $G$ is a minimal subgraph $I$ of $G$ for which there is an injection ${{\rm i}} \colon V(H) \to V(I)$ and a set of edge-disjoint paths $\{P_e: e \in E(H)\}$ in $I$ such that the end vertices of $P_{uv}$ are precisely ${{\rm i}}(u)$ and ${{\rm i}}(v)$. The immersion analogue of Hadwiger Conjecture (1943), posed by Lescure and Meyniel (1985), asks whether every graph $G$ contains an immersion of $K_{\chi(G)}$. Its restriction to graphs with independence number 2 has received some attention recently, and Vergara (2017) raised the weaker conjecture that every graph with independence number 2 has an immersion of $K_{\chi(G)}$. This implies that every graph with independence number 2 has an immersion of $K_{\lceil n/2 \rceil}$. In this paper, we verify Vergara Conjecture for graphs with bounded maximum degree. Specifically, we prove that if $G$ is a graph with independence number $2$, maximum degree less than $2n/3 - 1$ and clique covering number at most $3$, then $G$ contains an immersion of $K_{\chi(G)}$ (and thus of $K_{\lceil n/2 \rceil}$). Using a result of Jin (1995), this implies that if $G$ is a graph with independence number $2$ and maximum degree less than $19n/29 - 1$, then $G$ contains an immersion of $K_{\chi(G)}$ (and thus of $K_{\lceil n/2 \rceil}$).</description>

      <title>A Branch-and-Cut Algorithm for the Optimal Design of Parking Lots with One-way and Two-way Lanes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of maximizing the number of stalls in parking lots where vehicles park perpendicular to the driveways. Building on recent research, we first formulate a mixed integer program to maximize the number of parking stalls using a flow-based approach. Parking lots are rasterized into a grid, and the proposed MIP model optimizes them in a generic manner, adapting to the grid resolution and stall size without the need for custom formulations. The constraints ensure the connectivity of parking stalls and driveways to the entrance/exit. This formulation is then extended to the case of one-way driving lanes. We also propose valid inequalities and a branch-and-cut algorithm for the one-way and two-way lane configurations. This approach eliminates flow variables, big-M type constraints, and improves solution times for medium-sized instances. The effectiveness of the suggested models is showcased on 325 parking lots in New York City. For instances in which the flow version could be solved in 15 minutes, the branch-and-cut algorithm improved the median runtimes by 87.43% for the one-way case and by 79.36% for the two-way case and resulted in better optimality gaps for the other instances, compared to the baseline flow-based formulation. Similar advantages were observed when run with a time budget of two hours. One-way configurations accommodated up to 18.63% more vehicles on average than their two-way counterparts across all the instances. Modifications to the proposed formulations that consider the turning characteristics of vehicles and the presence of multiple entrances and exits are also examined.</description>

      <title>Tight Paths and Tight Pairs in Weighted Directed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We state the graph-theoretic computational problem of finding tight paths in a directed, edge-weighted graph, as well as its simplification of finding tight pairs. These problems are motivated by the need of algorithms that find so-called basic antecedents in closure spaces, in one specific approach to data analysis. We discuss and compare several algorithms to approach these problems.</description>

      <title>Crossing numbers of dense graphs on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide upper and lower bounds on the crossing numbers of dense graphs on surfaces, which match up to constant factors. First, we prove that if $G$ is a dense enough graph with $m$ edges and $\Sigma$ is a surface of genus $g$, then any drawing of $G$ on $\Sigma$ incurs at least $\Omega \left(\frac{m^2}{g} \log ^2 g\right)$ crossings. The poly-logarithmic factor in this lower bound is new even in the case of complete graphs and disproves a conjecture of Shahrokhi, Sz\'ekely and Vrt'o from 1996. Then we prove a geometric converse to this lower bound: we provide an explicit family of hyperbolic surfaces such that for any graph $G$, sampling the vertices uniformly at random on this surface and connecting them with shortest paths yields $O\left(\frac{m^2}{g} \log ^2 g\right)$ crossings in expectation.</description>

      <title>Logic-Constrained Shortest Paths for Flight Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13235v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The logic-constrained shortest path problem (LCSPP) combines a one-to-one shortest path problem with satisfiability constraints imposed on the routing graph. This setting arises in flight planning, where air traffic control (ATC) authorities are enforcing a set of traffic flow restrictions (TFRs) on aircraft routes in order to increase safety and throughput. We propose a new branch and bound-based algorithm for the LCSPP. The resulting algorithm has three main degrees of freedom: the node selection rule, the branching rule and the conflict. While node selection and branching rules have been long studied in the MIP and SAT communities, most of them cannot be applied out of the box for the LCSPP. We review the existing literature and develop tailored variants of the most prominent rules. The conflict, the set of variables to which the branching rule is applied, is unique to the LCSPP. We analyze its theoretical impact on the B&amp;B algorithm. In the second part of the paper, we show how to model the flight planning problem with TFRs as an LCSPP and solve it using the branch and bound algorithm. We demonstrate the algorithm's efficiency on a dataset consisting of a global flight graph and a set of around 20000 real TFRs obtained from our industry partner Lufthansa Systems GmbH. We make this dataset publicly available. Finally, we conduct an empirical in-depth analysis of dynamic shortest path algorithms, node selection rules, branching rules and conflicts. Carefully choosing an appropriate combination yields an improvement of an order of magnitude compared to an uninformed choice.</description>
