      <title>Why iCloud Fails: The Category Mistake of Cloud Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: iCloud Drive presents a filesystem interface but implements cloud synchronization semantics that diverge from POSIX in fundamental ways. This divergence is not an implementation bug; it is a Category Mistake -- the same one that pervades distributed computing wherever Forward-In-Time-Only (FITO) assumptions are embedded into protocol design. Parker et al. showed in 1983 that network partitioning destroys mutual consistency; iCloud adds a user interface that conceals this impossibility behind a facade of seamlessness. This document presents a unified analysis of why iCloud fails when composed with Time Machine, git, automated toolchains, and general-purpose developer workflows, supported by direct evidence including documented corruption events and a case study involving 366 GB of divergent state accumulated through normal use. We show that the failures arise from five interlocking incompatibilities rooted in a single structural error: the projection of a distributed causal graph onto a linear temporal chain. We then show how the same Category Mistake, when it occurs in network fabrics as link flapping, destroys topology knowledge through epistemic collapse. Finally, we argue that Open Atomic Ethernet (OAE) transactional semantics -- bilateral, reversible, and conservation-preserving -- provide the structural foundation for resolving these failures, not by defeating physics, but by aligning protocol behavior with physical reality.</description>

      <title>AgentCgroup: Understanding and Controlling OS Resources of AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09345</link>

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly deployed in multi-tenant cloud environments, where they execute diverse tool calls within sandboxed containers, each call with distinct resource demands and rapid fluctuations. We present a systematic characterization of OS-level resource dynamics in sandboxed AI coding agents, analyzing 144 software engineering tasks from the SWE-rebench benchmark across two LLM models. Our measurements reveal that (1) OS-level execution (tool calls, container and agent initialization) accounts for 56-74% of end-to-end task latency; (2) memory, not CPU, is the concurrency bottleneck; (3) memory spikes are tool-call-driven with a up to 15.4x peak-to-average ratio; and (4) resource demands are highly unpredictable across tasks, runs, and models. Comparing these characteristics against serverless, microservice, and batch workloads, we identify three mismatches in existing resource controls: a granularity mismatch (container-level policies vs. tool-call-level dynamics), a responsiveness mismatch (user-space reaction vs. sub-second unpredictable bursts), and an adaptability mismatch (history-based prediction vs. non-deterministic stateful execution). We propose AgentCgroup, an intent-driven eBPF-based resource controller that exploits agents ability to declare resource needs and reconstruct execution strategies, using hierarchical cgroup structures aligned with tool-call boundaries, in-kernel enforcement via sched_ext and memcg_bpf_ops, and runtime-adaptive policies. Preliminary evaluation demonstrates improved multi-tenant isolation and reduced resource waste. AgentCgroup is open-source at https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/agentcgroup</description>
