      <title>Chikungunya: The Silent Threat in the Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is one of the most relevant arboviruses affecting public health today. It belongs to the Togaviridae family and alphavirus genus, causing an arthritogenic disease known as Chikungunya fever (CHIKF). This multifaceted disease is distinguished from other arbovirus infections by intense arthralgia, which can persist for months or even years in some individuals. The virus has re-emerged as a global health threat in recent decades, originating in Africa and spreading across Asia and America, leading to widespread outbreaks affecting millions. Despite more than 50 years of research on CHIKV pathogenesis, no drugs or vaccines are available. Current management focuses on supportive care to alleviate symptoms and improve patient's quality of life. The ongoing threat posed by CHIKV highlights the need to understand its pathogenesis better. This review provides a comprehensive overview of CHIKV, focusing on host factors, vector-related factors, and complex viral genetic interactions. By exploring these intricate connections, we aim to offer insights that may lead to more effective strategies for preventing and managing this re-emerging global health threat.</description>
