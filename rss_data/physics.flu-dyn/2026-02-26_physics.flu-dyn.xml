      <title>Sorting prolate and oblate spheroids with a diatomic gas in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a gas of diatomic particles with a nonzero magnetic moment, the Senftleben-Beenakker effect says that transport can be affected by a magnetic field even when the particles are neutral. As a consequence of the Senftleben-Beenakker effect, two anisotropic odd viscosities become nonvanishing which for large magnetic field are of opposite sign. We solve for the anisotropic odd viscous Stokes flow around the spheroid using the Lorentz reciprocal theorem and show that the forces on oblate and prolate spheroids are such that they can be separated upon undergoing sedimentation in a diatomic gas with a background magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Dependent Magnetic modulation of deposition morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for magnetic modulation of deposition morphology in an evaporating ferrofluid droplet. The magnetic field strength and ferrofluid concentration are kept unchanged, while the actuation frequencies are varied from 0.016 Hz to 5 Hz. In the absence of a magnetic field, a coffee-ring formation is observed and consistent with previous studies\cite{deegan1997capillary,deegan2000contact,saroj2019drying}. The application of a time-dependent magnetic field significantly modifies the deposition morphology. The periodic magnetic field induces the formation of multiple concentric rings during evaporation. The number of rings initially increases with increasing actuation frequency of the electromagnet. However, beyond a critical actuation frequency ($f_c = 0.2\,\text{Hz}$), the number of rings decreases. At higher actuation frequencies, magnetic particles preferentially deposit in the central region of the droplet, resulting in suppression of the coffee-ring effect. Additionally, the thickness of the inner rings and the ring spacing decrease with increasing actuation frequency up to critical actuation frequency. The transition from multi-ring formation to coffee-ring suppression is governed by the competition among magnetic forcing, capillary flow, and particle diffusion. The underlying physical mechanisms responsible for droplet dynamics and deposition morphology under periodic magnetic fields are evaluated using scaling arguments. The results demonstrate that diffusive particle transport plays a dominant role in determining the deposition pattern. A non-dimensional magnetic switching number, based on the magnetic perturbation timescale, is introduced as a control parameter to characterize the frequency-dependent deposition behavior.</description>

      <title>Prandtl number dependence of rotating internally heated convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of the Prandtl number ($Pr$) on penetrative internally heated convection (IHC) in both non-rotating and rotating regimes using three-dimensional direct numerical simulations. By varying $Pr$ between 0.1 and 100, we show that the global mean temperature $\langle \overline{T} \rangle$ is not very sensitive to $Pr$, and is primarily controlled by the dynamics of the unstably stratified top boundary layer. In contrast, the Prandtl number dictates the behavior of the lower, stably stratified region and affects the vertical convective heat flux $\langle \overline{wT} \rangle$. In the non-rotating case, low $Pr$ fluids exhibit a ``symmetry recovery'' where turbulent stirring agitates the stable layer, whereas high $Pr$ fluids transition toward a ``dead zone'' of suppressed fluctuations. Under rotation, we find that $\langle \overline{wT} \rangle$ is enhanced across all Prandtl numbers, though global cooling efficiency, measured by the reduction in $\langle \overline{T} \rangle$, is only improved for $Pr\ge1$ due to the emergence of Ekman pumping. These results demonstrate that while IHC shares some scaling similarities with Rayleigh-B\'enard convection at the top boundary, the internal stratification creates a unique sensitivity to $Pr$ that is critical for understanding heat transport in planetary and stellar interiors.</description>

      <title>Large eddy simulation of turbulent swirl-stabilized flames using the front propagation formulation: impact of the resolved flame thickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work extends the front propagation formulation (FPF) combustion model to large eddy simulation (LES) of swirl-stabilized turbulent premixed flames and investigates the effects of resolved flame thickness on the predicted flame dynamics. The FPF method is designed to mitigate the spurious propagation of under-resolved flames while preserving the reaction characteristics of filtered flame fronts. In this study, the model is extended to account for non-adiabatic effects and is coupled with an improved sub-filter flame speed estimation that resolves the inconsistency arising from heat-release effects on local sub-filter turbulence. The performance of the extended FPF method is validated by LES of the TECFLAM swirl-stabilized burner, where the results agree well with experimental measurements. The simulations reveal that the stretching of vortical structures in the outer shear layer leads to the formation of trapped flame pockets, which are identified as the physical mechanism responsible for the secondary temperature peaks observed in the experiment. The prediction of this phenomenon is shown to be strongly dependent on the resolved flame thickness, when the filter size is used for modeling sub-filter flame wrinklings. Without proper modeling of the chemical steepening effects, the thickness of the resolved flame brush is over-predicted, causing the flame consumption rate to be under-estimated. Consequently, the flame brush detaches from the outer shear layer, resulting in a failure to capture the flame pockets and the associated secondary temperature peaks.</description>

      <title>Experimental study of turbulent thermal diffusion of inertial particles in a convective turbulence forced by oscillating grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of turbulent thermal diffusion of inertial solid particles in laboratory experiments with convective turbulence forced by one or two oscillating grids in the air flow. Turbulent thermal diffusion causes a non-diffusive contribution to turbulent flux of particles described in terms of an effective pumping velocity directed opposite to the gradient of the mean fluid temperature. For inertial particles, this effective pumping velocity depends on the Stokes and Reynolds numbers. In the experiments, fluid velocity and spatial distribution of inertial particles are measured using Particle Image Velocimetry system, and the temperature field is measured in many locations by a temperature probe equipped with 12 thermocouples. Measurements of temperature and particle number density spatial distributions have demonstrated formation of large-scale clusters of inertial particles in the vicinity of the mean temperature minimum due to turbulent thermal diffusion. In the experiments, the effective pumping velocity resulting in formation of large-scale clusters of inertial particles (having the diameter $10 \mu m$) is in 2.5 times larger than that for non-inertial particles (having the diameter $0.7 \mu m$). This is in an agreement with the theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Counterflow around a cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The incompressible flow around a circular cylinder, positioned at the center of an unconfined planar counterflow, is studied by means of numerical solutions of the conservation equations and linear stability analysis. The flow is completely defined by the Reynolds number ($\Rey$) -- based on the cylinder radius, the strain rate defining the counterflow, and the kinematic viscosity. For very low values of $\Rey$, the flow is steady, two-dimensional, and fully attached to the cylinder wall. Increasing $\Rey$ above $\Rey_s \approx 16.86$, the flow separates, giving rise to two symmetric, counter-rotating recirculation regions on each side of the cylinder. Further increasing $\Rey$ leads to a progressive enlargement of the recirculation regions and the appearance of multiple recirculation centers, akin to Moffatt eddies. However, the convective acceleration imposed by the counterflow limits their size. An oscillatory mode becomes linearly unstable for $\Rey_{c} \approx 4146$. This mode gives rise to a sinuous meandering of the wake flow, on each side of the cylinder, being analogous to the well-known von K\'arm\'an instability. The frequency of this mode is directly proportional to the strain rate defining the counterflow.</description>

      <title>A minimal wake-vortex model explains formation flight of flapping birds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective patterns of motion emerge across biological taxa: insects swarm, fish school, and birds flock. In particular, large migratory birds form strikingly ordered V-shaped formations, which experiments and direct numerical simulations have demonstrated provide substantial energetic benefits during long-distance flight. However, the precise aerodynamic and morphological mechanisms underlying these benefits remain unclear. In this work, we develop a reduced-order model of the wake-vortex interactions between two flapping birds flying in tandem. The model retains essential unsteady flapping dynamics while remaining computationally tractable. By optimizing over a six-dimensional state space, which comprises the follower's three-dimensional relative position and three independent flapping parameters, we identify the energetically optimal leader-follower configuration of northern bald ibises. The predicted optimum agrees quantitatively with live-bird measurements. Because of its simplicity, the model allows for direct interrogation of the physical mechanisms responsible for this optimum. In particular, it isolates precisely how the follower's wing kinematics interact with the leader's wake to enhance aerodynamic efficiency. The model predicts an 11% reduction in total mechanical power for a follower in formation flight -- consistent with experimental estimates -- and shows that this saving arises from reductions in both induced and profile power, dominated by decreased profile power enabled primarily through reduced flapping amplitude and, secondarily, reduced upstroke flexion. These results provide a mechanistic explanation for the structure of V-formations and offer new insight into the aerodynamic principles governing collective flight.</description>

      <title>Physics Constrained Neural Collision Operators for Variable Hard Sphere Surrogates and Ab Initio Angle Prediction in Direct Simulation Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method is the gold standard for non-equilibrium rarefied gas dynamics, yet its computational cost can be prohibitive, especially for near-continuum regimes and high-fidelity \emph{ab initio} potentials. This work develops a unified, physics-constrained neural-operator framework that accelerates DSMC while preserving physical invariants and stochasticity required for long-time kinetic simulations. First, we introduce a local neural collision kernel replacing the phenomenological Variable Hard Sphere (VHS) model. To overcome the variance suppression and artificial cooling inherent to purely deterministic regression surrogates, we augment inference with a physics-constrained stochastic layer. Controlled latent-noise injection restores thermal fluctuations, while cell-wise moment-matching strictly enforces momentum and kinetic-energy conservation. Remarkably, this operator exhibits zero-shot spatial and thermodynamic generalization: a model trained exclusively on 1D Couette flow accurately simulates a complex 2D lid-driven cavity, capturing high-order non-equilibrium moments without retraining.Second, to bypass the extreme cost of quantum-mechanical scattering, we develop a dedicated \emph{ab initio} neural operator for the J\"ager interaction potential. Trained via a \emph{physics harvesting} strategy on large-scale collision pairs, it efficiently captures the high-energy scattering dynamics dominating hypersonic regimes. Validated on a Mach~10 rarefied argon flow over a cylinder, the framework reproduces transport behaviors and shock features with high fidelity, achieving an approximate 20\% cost reduction relative to direct numerical integration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a two-dimensional fluid of hard disks undergoing chiral, energy- and momentum-conserving collisions. We show that despite the microscopic breaking of time-reversal symmetry, the H-theorem is obeyed, guaranteeing a relaxation towards equilibrium in the absence of external forces. In the dilute limit, a Chapman-Enskog expansion yields analytical expressions for the shear and odd viscosity and the thermal conductivity. Theoretical predictions are confirmed by nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Passive freeze-out of the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) poses a major challenge in inertial confinement fusion (ICF) due to its role in mixing and performance degradation. We report the first experimental observation of passive freeze-out of RMI in a low-pressure surrogate regime; an instability stagnation effect induced without modifying the driving pressure pulse or the target surface geometry. Using additively manufactured sub-surface voids in a sinusoidal target, we convert a single shock into a sequence of weaker shocks that suppress instability growth upstream of the surface by over 70%. High-speed X-ray imaging and hydrodynamic simulations suggest that this suppression arises primarily from temporal shaping, with lesser contributions from spatial curvature and shock weakening. Our results demonstrate a driver-independent pathway for controlling shock-driven hydrodynamic instabilities relevant to ICF and other high energy density systems.</description>

      <title>A CFD-Based Investigation of Local Luminal Curvature as a Primary Determinant of Hemodynamic Environments in Cerebral Aneurysms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between vascular morphology and hemodynamics is fundamental to understanding the natural history of cerebral aneurysms (CAs). While global geometric indices have been widely studied, the local interaction between luminal curvature and wall shear stress (WSS) remains poorly characterized. This study analyzed a large cohort of CAs to investigate how local surface morphology relates to hemodynamics. This was performed via CFD flow simulations of a set of 76 patient-specific CA geometries using the OpenFOAM library. Geometry and pulsatile inflow conditions were modeled based on patient arterial diameter and age. Blood was assumed to be a Newtonian incompressible fluid flowing in a laminar regime. We utilized a geometric framework to classify the aneurysm lumen into spherical-like and saddle-like patches based on Gaussian curvature. Our results demonstrate a robust, statistically significant correlation between these curvature types and hemodynamic metrics, regardless of rupture status or aneurysm type. Specifically, saddle-like patches, predominantly found at the aneurysm neck, are associated with high time-averaged WSS, a low oscillatory shear index, and intense near-wall vortical activity as identified by the lambda2-criterion. In contrast, spherical-like patches, dominant at the dome, correspond to regions of flow impingement characterized by lower time-averaged WSS and an elevated oscillatory shear index. These findings suggest that wall curvature is a primary determinant of local hemodynamics. By bridging the gap between local wall morphology and pathological wall markers, this work suggests that curvature-based mapping can serve as a powerful tool for identifying vulnerable regions susceptible to thinning and rupture. This objective geometric assessment offers valuable insights for risk stratification and the precision planning of endovascular interventions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection and turbulence are deeply intertwined in magnetohydrodynamic flows, yet how reconnection self-generates turbulence remains unclear. Using an ensemble of high-resolution three-dimensional direct numerical simulations of an unstable magnetised jet with an initially weak mean field, we demonstrate a self-sustained transition from laminar reconnection to fully developed turbulence in the absence of external forcing. We show that a three-dimensional current-sheet instability triggers stochastic reconnection, leading to persistent turbulent energy injection. Energy-budget analysis reveals that the coupling between the turbulent electromotive force and the magnetic mean shear dominates turbulent production, with magnetic fluctuations subsequently transferring energy to the kinetic field through a nonlinear cascade.</description>

      <title>Out-of-time-ordered correlators for turbulent fields: a quantum-classical correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An extended formulation of out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), which quantify noncommutative operator growth and information scrambling in quantum many-body systems, is developed for turbulence dynamics as a representative of non-canonical Hamiltonian systems. Based on the Wigner-Weyl transform and the Moyal bracket formalism, the semiclassical limit of OTOC for turbulent plasmas governed by the Hasegawa-Mima equation is derived as an ensemble-averaged squared Lie-Poisson bracket between two chosen functionals of the turbulent fields. The classical-limit OTOC provides a quantitative measure of how a variational perturbation applied to one functional propagates across scales in the turbulent dynamics and how it affects another functional at a later time, thereby capturing scale-dependent or field-dependent transfer processes. In a quasilinear approximation with a strong zonal flow, we derive an inverse-square decay of the OTOC with the time lag, indicating an algebraic suppression of the zonal-mode response to perturbations of the non-zonal fields. This behavior is attributed to zonal-flow shearing, which rapidly scrambles the non-zonal perturbation toward higher wavenumbers, and consequently reduces the low-wavenumber non-zonal content that can feed back onto large-scale zonal modes.</description>

      <title>Particle, kinetic and hydrodynamic models for sea ice floes. Part II: Rotating floes with nonlinear contact forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper extends the multiscale modeling framework introduced in Part I (Deng and Ha, Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena 483 (2025) 134951) for sea-ice floe dynamics with non-rotating floes to the case with rotational floes and nonlinear contact interactions. Building on the particle-kinetic-hydrodynamic hierarchy developed for non-rotating floes, we generalize the particle model to describe ice floes as rigid bodies characterized by position, linear velocity, angular velocity, size, and moment of inertia. The interaction rules now include nonlinear contact forces and torques arising from short-range compression, restitution, and tangential friction laws, together with hydrodynamic drag that couples translational and rotational motions. These particle descriptions lead to an enriched Vlasov-type kinetic equation posed on an extended phase space, whose moments yield a hydrodynamic system for mass, momentum, and angular-momentum balances. Compared with Part I, the resulting macroscopic equations feature additional stress contributions, rotational transport, and dissipative mechanisms stemming from nonlinear collisions. The proposed framework provides a more realistic description of sea-ice floe dynamics and offers a systematic pathway toward multiscale modeling of sea-ice rheology under complex environmental forcing.</description>

      <title>A consistent phase-averaged model of the interactions between surface gravity waves and currents</title>

Abstract: We formulate a model of the two-way interactions between surface gravity waves and ocean currents. The model couples the transport of wave action in the four-dimensional (horizontal) position--wavevector phase space with the Craik--Leibovich system for the currents. Coupling is via the Doppler shift in the dispersion relation governing action transport, and wave pseudomomentum in the Craik--Leibovich system. The velocity in the Doppler shift is a vertical integral of the Lagrangian mean velocity of the currents, with a weight that is consistent with the vertical structure of the pseudomomentum. This consistency ensures conservation of momentum and energy in the coupled wave--current system.
  The conservation properties of the wave--current model stem from an underlying variational structure. We derive this structure from that of the rotating Euler equations for an incompressible fluid with free surface by introducing a Lagrangian wave--mean decomposition, making simplifying approximations, and Whitham averaging.
  We apply the wave--current model to the problem of generation of inertial oscillations by surface waves originally considered by Hasselmann.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of Dense Active Fluids: Turbulence-Like States and the Role of Advected Activity</title>

Abstract: Dense suspensions of self-propelled bacteria and related active fluids exhibit spontaneous flow generation, vortex formation, and spatiotemporally chaotic dynamics despite operating at vanishingly small Reynolds numbers. These phenomena, commonly referred to as active turbulence, display striking visual and statistical similarities to classical inertial turbulence while arising from fundamentally different nonequilibrium mechanisms. In this article, we present a combined review and theoretical study of hydrodynamic models for dense active fluids, with particular emphasis on bacterial suspensions described by the Toner--Tu--Swift--Hohenberg (TTSH) framework. We review key experimental and theoretical developments underlying the analogy between active and inertial turbulence, highlighting the emergence of multiple dynamical regimes and the conditions under which universal spectral and intermittent behavior arises in homogeneous systems. Moving beyond the conventional assumption of spatially uniform activity, we introduce a minimal model in which the activity field is heterogeneous and dynamically advected by the flow it generates. Thus treating activity as a spatiotemporally evolving field coupled to the TTSH dynamics, we investigate how advection and diffusion lead to sharp activity fronts, confinement of turbulent motion, and complex interfacial morphologies. Our numerical results demonstrate that spatial variations in activity can induce transient coexistence of distinct spectral regimes and that universality in active turbulence is inherently local and time-dependent in heterogeneous systems. These findings underscore the importance of treating activity as a dynamical field in its own right and provide a framework for studying active turbulence in more realistic, spatially structured biological and synthetic active matter systems.</description>

      <title>Surrogate models for Rock-Fluid Interaction: A Grid-Size-Invariant Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modelling rock-fluid interaction requires solving a set of partial differential equations (PDEs) to predict the flow behaviour and the reactions of the fluid with the rock on the interfaces. Conventional high-fidelity numerical models require a high resolution to obtain reliable results, resulting in huge computational expense. This restricts the applicability of these models for multi-query problems, such as uncertainty quantification and optimisation, which require running numerous scenarios. As a cheaper alternative to high-fidelity models, this work develops eight surrogate models for predicting the fluid flow in porous media. Four of these are reduced-order models (ROM) based on one neural network for compression and another for prediction. The other four are single neural networks with the property of grid-size invariance; a term which we use to refer to image-to-image models that are capable of inferring on computational domains that are larger than those used during training. In addition to the novel grid-size-invariant framework for surrogate models, we compare the predictive performance of UNet and UNet++ architectures, and demonstrate that UNet++ outperforms UNet for surrogate models. Furthermore, we show that the grid-size-invariant approach is a reliable way to reduce memory consumption during training, resulting in good correlation between predicted and ground-truth values and outperforming the ROMs analysed. The application analysed is particularly challenging because fluid-induced rock dissolution results in a non-static solid field and, consequently, it cannot be used to help in adjustments of the future prediction.</description>

      <title>Using Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) and Neural Network (NN) to Improve a $k-\omega$ Turbulence Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12493</link>

Abstract: The Wilcox k-omega turbulence model predicts turbulent boundary layers well, both fully-developed channel flows and flat-plate boundary layers. However, it predicts too low a turbulent kinetic energy. This is a feature it shares with most other two-equation turbulence models. When comparing the terms in the k equations with DNS data it is found that the production and dissipation terms are well predicted but the turbulent diffusion is not. In the present work the poor modeling of the turbulent diffusion is improved using Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) and Neural Network (NN).The k equation is turned into an ordinary differential equation for the turbulent viscosity in the k equation, nu_{t,PINN}, which is solved using PINN. A new turbulent Prandtl number is then computed as sigma_{k} = nu_{t}/nu_{t,PINN} where nu_t = k/omega.To compensate for the new, larger turbulent kinetic energy, three coefficients in the new k-omega model are computed using three NN models. The new turbulence model, called the k-omega-PINN-NN model, is shown to produce excellent velocity, skin friction and turbulent kinetic profiles in channel flow at Re_tau = 2 000, 5 200 and Re_tau = 10 000 as well as in flat-plate boundary layer flow (slightly too large a k for the latter case). The k-omega-PINN-NN model is also used for predicting the flow over a periodic hill and the agreement with DNS is very good. At the end of the Conclusions, we give an example on how a NN model can be replaced with a Python symbolic regression (pySR); the latter may conveniently be imported in commercial CFD codes. All Python PINN, NN and pySR scripts as well as the Python CFD code can be downloaded (Davidson, 2025a).</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal Binary-fluid Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although effective non-reciprocal interactions have been investigated in a variety of fields, their consequences have not been explored in hydrodynamical turbulence. We initiate such an exploration by introducing non-reciprocal binary-fluid tubulence and uncover its properties by developing a two-dimensional (2D) Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (NRCHNS) model. We show that, as we increase the strength of the non-reciprocal terms, this model displays a hitherto unanticipated type of turbulence, with an inverse cascade of energy and an energy spectrum $E(k)\sim k^{-5/3}$, reminiscent of the well-known inverse cascade in forced, 2D fluid turbulence, but distinct from it, in so far as it develops a non-reciprocal flux $\mathbf J$. We demonstrate how NRCHNS turbulence suppresses $J(t) = |\mathbf J|$, as the Reynolds number increases. We compare and contrast 2D NRCHNS turbulence with its fluid-turbulence counterpart by examining spectra, fluxes, spectral balances, flow topologies, and signatures of multifractality.</description>

      <title>Conservation laws, fluxes, and symmetries: lessons from a perturbative approach for self-organized turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some turbulent flows self-organize into large-scale structures, rather than breaking up into ever-smaller scales. Underpinning this phenomenon is the existence of two sign-definite quantities which are conserved by the dynamics. Two-dimensional turbulence is a prime example, where large-scale mean flows, termed condensates, spontaneously emerge. We review a perturbative theoretical framework for the statistical description of such inhomogeneous turbulence, offering new perspectives on the role of the two conserved quantities. We illustrate the universal properties of the theory, comparing results from two-dimensional Navier-Stokes to those from the large-scale-quasi-geostrophic equation. These two models are limiting cases of the shallow water quasi-geostrophic equation, the former exhibiting long-range fluid element interactions, while the latter has local interactions. We then demonstrate these theoretical ideas in two new settings: first, in rotating three-dimensional turbulence, where two-dimensional condensates are known to form. Considering jet-type condensates, we derive the mean-flow profile and discuss a surprising symmetry breaking. Second, we vary the Rossby deformation radius in the shallow water quasi-geostrophic equation. We obtain novel domain-spanning condensates in all tested regimes and show that they follow two-dimensional Navier-Stokes for deformation radii above the forcing scale, and the large-scale quasi-geostrophic equation for those below, demonstrating the power of these asymptotic models.</description>
