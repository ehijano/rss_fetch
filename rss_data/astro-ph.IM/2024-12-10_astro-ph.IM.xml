      <title>Hydroxyl Lines and Moonlight: a High Spectral Resolution Investigation of NIR skylines from Maunakea to guide NIR spectroscopic surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subtracting the changing sky contribution from the near-infrared (NIR) spectra of faint astronomical objects is challenging and crucial to a wide range of science cases such as estimating the velocity dispersions of dwarf galaxies, studying the gas dynamics in faint galaxies, measuring accurate redshifts, and any spectroscopic studies of faint targets. Since the sky background varies with time and location, NIR spectral observations, especially those employing fiber spectrometers and targeting extended sources, require frequent sky-only observations for calibration. However, sky subtraction can be optimized with sufficient a priori knowledge of the sky's variability. In this work, we explore how to optimize sky subtraction by analyzing 1075 high-resolution NIR spectra from the CFHT's SPIRou on Maunakea, and we estimate the variability of 481 hydroxyl (OH) lines. These spectra were collected during two sets of three nights dedicated to obtaining sky observations every five and a half minutes. During the first set, we observed how the Moon affects the NIR, which has not been accurately measured at these wavelengths. We suggest accounting for the Moon contribution at separation distances less than 10 degrees when 1) reconstructing the sky using principal component analysis 2) observing targets at Y JHK mags fainter than ~15 and 3) attempting a sky subtraction better than 1%. We also identified 126 spectral doublets, or OH lines that split into at least two components, at SPIRou's resolution. In addition, we used Lomb-Scargle Periodograms and Gaussian process regression to estimate that most OH lines vary on similar timescales, which provides a valuable input for IR spectroscopic survey strategies. The data and code developed for this study are publicly available.</description>

      <title>A Novel Technosignature Search in the Breakthrough Listen Green Bank Telescope Archive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Breakthrough Listen program is, to date, the most extensive search for technological life beyond Earth. As part of this goal, over the past nine years it has surveyed thousands of nearby stars, close to 100 nearby galaxies, and a variety of exotic and solar system objects with telescopes around the world, including the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in West Virginia. The goal is to find evidence of technosignatures of other civilizations, such as narrowband Doppler drifting radio signals. Despite the GBT's location in a radio-quiet zone, the primary challenge of this search continues to be the high quantities of human-generated radio-frequency interference (RFI), and the ability to pick out genuinely promising candidates from it. Here we present a novel search method aimed at finding these `needle-in-a-haystack' type signals, applied to 9,684 observation cadences of 3,077 stars (each observed with one or more of the L, S, C, and X band receivers) from the GBT archive. We implement a low-complexity statistical process to vet out RFI and highlight signals that, upon visual inspection, appear more promising than those from previous analyses. Our work returns candidate signals found previously using both traditional and machine learning algorithms, as well as many promising ones not previously identified. This analysis represents the largest dataset searched for technosignatures to date, and highlights the efficacy that traditional (non-machine-learning) algorithms continue to have in these types of technosignature searches. We find that less than 1% of stars host transmitters brighter than 0.3 Arecibo radar equivalents broadcasting in our direction over the frequency band covered.</description>

      <title>Why Machine Learning Models Systematically Underestimate Extreme Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A persistent challenge in astronomical machine learning is a systematic bias where predictions compress the dynamic range of true values -- high values are consistently predicted too low while low values are predicted too high. Understanding this bias has important consequences for astronomical measurements and our understanding of physical processes in astronomical inference. Through analytical examination of linear regression, we show that this bias arises naturally from measurement uncertainties in input features and persists regardless of training sample size, label accuracy, or parameter distribution. In the univariate case, we demonstrate that attenuation becomes important when the ratio of intrinsic signal range to measurement uncertainty ($\sigma_{\text{range}}/\sigma_x$) is below O(10) -- a regime common in astronomy. We further extend the theoretical framework to multivariate linear regression and demonstrate its implications using stellar spectroscopy as a case study. Even under optimal conditions -- high-resolution APOGEE-like spectra (R=24,000) with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR=100) and multiple correlated features -- we find percent-level bias. The effect becomes even more severe for modern-day low-resolution surveys like LAMOST and DESI due to the lower SNR and resolution. These findings have broad implications, providing a theoretical framework for understanding and addressing this limitation in astronomical data analysis with machine learning.</description>

      <title>StarWhisper Telescope: Agent-Based Observation Assistant System to Approach AI Astrophysicist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have introduced convenient and user-friendly methods for leveraging tools across various domains. In the field of astronomical observation, the construction of new telescopes has significantly increased astronomers' workload. Deploying LLM-powered agents can effectively alleviate this burden and reduce the costs associated with training personnel. Within the Nearby Galaxy Supernovae Survey (NGSS) project, which encompasses eight telescopes across three observation sites, aiming to find the transients from the galaxies in 50 mpc, we have developed the \textbf{StarWhisper Telescope System} to manage the entire observation process. This system automates tasks such as generating observation lists, conducting observations, analyzing data, and providing feedback to the observer. Observation lists are customized for different sites and strategies to ensure comprehensive coverage of celestial objects. After manual verification, these lists are uploaded to the telescopes via the agents in the system, which initiates observations upon neutral language. The observed images are analyzed in real-time, and the transients are promptly communicated to the observer. The agent modifies them into a real-time follow-up observation proposal and send to the Xinglong observatory group chat, then add them to the next-day observation lists. Additionally, the integration of AI agents within the system provides online accessibility, saving astronomers' time and encouraging greater participation from amateur astronomers in the NGSS project.</description>

      <title>Indigenous knowledges and kinship as a model for our future in outer space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commercial endeavours have already compromised our relationship with space. The Artemis Accords are creating a framework that will commercialize the Moon and further impact that relation. To confront that impact, a number of organizations have begun to develop new principles of sustainability in space, many of which are borne out of the capitalist and colonial frameworks that have harmed water, nature, peoples and more on Earth. Indigenous methodologies and ways of knowing offer different paths for living in relationship with space and the Moon. While Indigenous knowledges are not homogeneous, there are lessons we can use from some of common methods. In this talk we will review some Indigenous methodologies, including the concept of kinship and discuss how kinship can inform our actions both on Earth and in space.</description>

      <title>Overview of Indigenous rights and outer space for the IAU-CPS Policy Hub</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of the mission of the International Astronomical Union Centre for the Protection of the Dark and Quiet Sky from Satellite Constellation Interference (IAU-CPS) Policy Hub to consider national and international regulations about the usage and sustainability in outer space, we also included discussion specific to the rights of Indigenous peoples with respect to outer space under the context of the United Nations Declaration for the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). In this work, we review how some of the articles of UNDRIP require various actors in the use and exploitation of outer space including satellite companies, nation states, and professional/academic astronomy to consult and support Indigenous peoples/nations and respect Indigenous sovereignties. This work is concluded with recommendations for consulting and collaborating with Indigenous peoples and recommendations for moving from the traditional colonial exploitation of outer space and building an anti-colonial future in relationship with outer space.</description>

      <title>Pulse Profile Variability of PSR J1022+1001 in NANOGrav Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulse profile stability is a central assumption of standard pulsar timing methods. Thus, it is important for pulsar timing array experiments such as the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) to account for any pulse profile variability present in their data sets. We show that in the NANOGrav 15-yr data set, the integrated pulse profile of PSR J1022+1001 as seen by the Arecibo radio telescope at 430, 1380, and 2030 MHz varies considerably in its shape from observation to observation. We investigate the possibility that this is due to the "ideal feed assumption" (IFA), on which NANOGrav's routine polarization calibration procedure relies. PSR J1022+1001 is $\sim 90\%$ polarized in one pulse profile component, and also has significant levels of circular polarization. Time-dependent deviations in the feed's polarimetric response (PR) could cause mixing between the intensity I and the other Stokes parameters, leading to the observed variability. We calibrate the PR using a mixture of Measurement Equation Modeling and Measurement Equation Template Matching techniques. The resulting profiles are no less variable than those calibrated using the IFA method, nor do they provide an improvement in the timing quality of this pulsar. We observe the pulse shape in 25-MHz bandwidths to vary consistently across the band, which cannot be explained by interstellar scintillation in combination with profile evolution with frequency. Instead, we favor phenomena intrinsic to the pulsar as the cause.</description>

      <title>113 km absolute ranging with nanometer precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate long-distance ranging is crucial for diverse applications, including satellite formation flying, very-long-baseline interferometry, gravitational-wave observatory, geographical research, etc. The integration of the time-of-flight mesurement with phase interference in dual-comb method enables high-precision ranging with a rapid update rate and an extended ambiguity range. Pioneering experiments have demonstrated unprecedented precision in ranging, achieving 5 nm @ 60 ms for 1.1 m and 200 nm @ 0.5 s for 25 m. However, long-distance ranging remains technically challenging due to high transmission loss and noise. In this letter, we propose a two-way dual-comb ranging (TWDCR) approach that enables successful ranging over a distance of 113 kilometers. We employ air dispersion analysis and synthetic repetition rate technique to extend the ambiguity range of the inherently noisy channel beyond 100 km. The achieved ranging precision is 11.5 $\mu$m @ 1.3 ms, 681 nm @ 1 s, and 82 nm @ 21 s, as confirmed through a comparative analysis of two independent systems. The advanced long-distance ranging technology is expected to have immediate implications for space research initiatives, such as the space telescope array and the satellite gravimetry.</description>

      <title>SoFT: Detecting and Tracking Magnetic Structures in the Solar Photosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present SoFT: Solar Feature Tracking, a novel feature-tracking tool developed in Python and designed to detect, identify, and track magnetic elements in the solar atmosphere. It relies on a watershed segmentation algorithm to effectively detect magnetic clumps within magnetograms, which are then associated across successive frames to follow the motion of magnetic structures in the photosphere. Here, we study its reliability in detecting and tracking features under different noise conditions starting with real-world data observed with SDO/HMI and followed with simulation data obtained from the Bifrost numerical code to better replicate the movements and shape of actual magnetic structures observed in the Sun's atmosphere within a controlled noise environment.</description>

      <title>On the detectability and parameterisation of binary stars through spectral energy distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the characterization of binary star systems using Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs), a technique increasingly essential with the rise of large-scale astronomical surveys. Binaries can emit flux at different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, making SEDs a valuable tool in identifying and characterising unresolved binary systems. However, fitting multi-component models to SEDs and recovering accurate stellar parameters remains challenging due to nonlinear fitting methods and inherent uncertainties in the data and the spectral models. In this work, a simplified approach was used to model stars as blackbodies and we tested the accuracy of parameter recovery from SEDs, particularly focusing on secondary stars. We explored a range of primary properties, filter sets and noise models. Special attention was given to two case studies: one examining the detection of unresolved binaries using Gaia XP spectra, and the other focusing on identifying hotter companions in binary systems using UV-IR SEDs. Although an analytic prescription for recoverability is not possible, we present a simplified model and the necessary Python tools to analyse any potential binary system. Finally, we propose using blackbody models as a baseline for error estimation in SED fitting, offering a potential method for measuring fitting errors and improving the precision of binary star characterisations.</description>

      <title>Spiking Neural Networks for Radio Frequency Interference Detection in Radio Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise efficient spatio-temporal data processing owing to their dynamic nature. This paper addresses a significant challenge in radio astronomy, Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) detection, by reformulating it as a time-series segmentation task inherently suited for SNN execution. Automated RFI detection systems capable of real-time operation with minimal energy consumption are increasingly important in modern radio telescopes. We explore several spectrogram-to-spike encoding methods and network parameters, applying first-order leaky integrate-and-fire SNNs to tackle RFI detection. To enhance the contrast between RFI and background information, we introduce a divisive normalisation-inspired pre-processing step, which improves detection performance across multiple encoding strategies. Our approach achieves competitive performance on a synthetic dataset and compelling results on real data from the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) instrument. To our knowledge, this work is the first to train SNNs on real radio astronomy data successfully. These findings highlight the potential of SNNs for performing complex time-series tasks, paving the way for efficient, real-time processing in radio astronomy and other data-intensive fields.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Stellar Systems J0946 and V723 Monocerotis: A Study of Mass Gap Black Hole Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2023, Rowan et al. reported the discovery of a black hole (BH) companion to J0946, following the misidentification of V723 Mon by Jayasinghe et al. as containing a "mass-gap" BH. This article reproduced Rowan and Jayasinghe's results on these systems by estimating stellar parameters via Markov Chain Monte Carlo solvers. We implemented Bayesian statistical modeling through the software ExoFit and PHysics of Eclipsing Binaries (PHOEBE). For J0946, we found a higher inclination of i = 72 degrees and a companion mass of 2.78 solar masses, lower than what Rowan estimated. V723 Mon's results aligned with recent estimates by El Badry et al., yielding an inclination of i = 74 degrees and a mass of 2.56 solar masses. We tested this method on stars from Gaia DR2 and the NASA Exoplanet Archive, agreeing with previous findings that these datasets do not exhibit strong indications of stellar-mass black hole systems.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Classical Cepheid's Physical Parameters from NIR Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent space-borne and ground-based observations provide photometric measurements as time series. The effect of interstellar dust extinction in the near-infrared range is only 10% of that measured in the V band. However, the sensitivity of the light curve shape to the physical parameters in the near-infrared is much lower. So, interpreting these types of data sets requires new approaches like the different large-scale surveys, which create similar problems with big data. Using a selected data set, we provide a method for applying routines implemented in R to extract most information of measurements to determine physical parameters, which can also be used in automatic classification schemes and pipeline processing. We made a multivariate classification of 131 Cepheid light curves (LC) in J, H, and K colors, where all the LCs were represented in 20D parameter space in these colors separately. Performing a Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we got an orthogonal coordinate system and squared Euclidean distances between LCs, with 6 significant eigenvalues, reducing the 20-dimension to 6. We also estimated the optimal number of partitions of similar objects and found it to be equal to 7 in each color; their dependence on the period, absolute magnitude, amplitude, and metallicity are also discussed. We computed the Spearman rank correlations, showing that periods and absolute magnitudes correlate with the first three PCs significantly. The first two PC are also found to have a relationship with the amplitude, but the metallicity effects are only marginal. The method shown can be generalized and implemented in unsupervised classification schemes and analysis of mixed and biased samples. The analysis of our Classical Cepheid near-infrared LC sample showed that the J, H, K curves are insufficient for determination of stellar metallicity, with mass being the key factor shaping them.</description>

      <title>A multi-technique detection of an eccentric giant planet around accelerating star HD 57625</title>

Abstract: The synergy between different detection methods is a key asset in exoplanetology, allowing for both precise characterization of detected exoplanets and robust constraints even in the case of non-detection. Recently, the interplay between imaging, radial velocities and astrometry has produced significant advancements in exoplanetary science. We report a first result of an ongoing survey performed with SHARK-NIR, the new high-contrast near-infrared imaging camera at the Large Binocular Telescope, in parallel with LBTI/LMIRCam in order to detect planetary companions around stars with significant proper motion anomaly. In this work we focus on HD 57625, a F8 star for which we determine a $4.8^{+3.7}_{-2.9}$Ga age, exhibiting significant astrometric acceleration and for which archival radial velocities hint at the presence of a previously undetected massive long-period companion. We analyse the imaging data we collected with SHARK-NIR and LMIRCam in synergy with the available public SOPHIE radial velocity time series and Hipparcos-Gaia proper motion anomaly. With this joint multi-technique analysis, we aim at characterizing the companion responsible for the astrometric and radial velocity signals. The imaging observations result in a non-detection, indicating the companion to be in the substellar regime. This is confirmed by the synergic analysis of archival radial velocity and astrometric measurements resulting in the detection of HD 57625 b, a ${8.43}_{-0.91}^{+1.10}$M$_{\rm Jup}$ planetary companion with an orbital separation of ${5.70}_{-0.13}^{+0.14}$au and ${0.52}_{-0.03}^{+0.04}$ eccentricity. HD 57625 b joins the small but growing population of giant planets in outer orbits with true mass determination provided by the synergic usage of multiple detection methods, proving once again the importance of multi-technique analysis in providing robust characterization of planetary companions.</description>

      <title>A geometric template bank for the detection of spinning low-mass compact binaries with moderate orbital eccentricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact binaries on eccentric orbits are another class of gravitational-wave (GW) sources that can provide a wealth of information on binary formation pathways and astrophysical environments. However, historically, eccentricity is often neglected in modelled GW searches for compact binaries. We show that currently used modelled searches that employ quasi-circular template banks are highly ineffectual in detecting binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star--black hole (NSBH) systems with orbital eccentricities in the range of $[10^{-5},0.15]$ at a GW frequency of $15$Hz. For populations of moderately eccentric BNS and NSBH binaries with (anti-)aligned component spins, we demonstrate that quasi-circular template banks fail to detect up to $\sim 40\%$ of such systems. To alleviate these inefficiencies, we develop the first \emph{geometric} template bank for the search of BNSs and NSBH binaries that includes masses, (anti-)aligned spins and moderate eccentricity. Utilising the post-Newtonian inspiral waveform {\tt TaylorF2Ecc} and a global coordinate transformation, we construct a globally flat metric to efficiently place eccentric templates. Our geometric template bank is highly effectual, and significantly improves the recovery of eccentric signals with less than $6\%$ of signals missed due to the finite template spacing in the bank.</description>

      <title>A signal discovery step in interstellar communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prior work using synchronized, geographically spaced radio telescopes, and a radio interferometer, suggests that narrow-bandwidth polarized pulse pair measurements repeatedly falsify a noise-cause hypothesis, given a prior celestial direction of interest. A four-step method was proposed, tested, and reported, using interferometer phase measurements, to seek common celestial directions among pulse pair components, during 92 days of observation. In the work reported here, the proposed four-step signal discovery method is simplified to have a single step. A 123.8 day interferometer experiment provides measurement evidence supporting a hypothesis that the prior direction of interest, and a second direction of interest, are associated with celestial coordinates. Each pointing direction measures statistical power at greater than six standard deviations, with some indications of associated interferometer-induced Right Ascension aliasing. Explanations are proposed and discussed.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen intensity mapping with MeerKAT: Preserving cosmological signal by optimising contaminant separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Removing contaminants is a delicate yet crucial step in neutral hydrogen (HI) intensity mapping, often considered the technique's greatest challenge. Here, we address this challenge by analysing HI intensity maps of about $100$ deg$^2$ at redshift $z\approx0.4$ collected by the MeerKAT radio telescope, a SKA Observatory (SKAO) precursor, with a combined 10.5-hour observation. Using unsupervised statistical methods, we remove the contaminating foreground emission and systematically test step-by-step common pre-processing choices to facilitate the cleaning process. We also introduce and test a novel multiscale approach, where data is redundantly decomposed into subsets referring to different spatial scales (large and small), and the cleaning procedure is performed independently. We confirm the detection of the HI cosmological signal in cross-correlation with an ancillary galactic data set without the need to correct for signal loss. In the best set-up reached, we constrain the HI distribution through the combination of its cosmic abundance ($\Omega_{\rm HI}$) and linear clustering bias ($b_{\rm HI}$) up to a cross-correlation coefficient ($r$) and measure $\Omega_{\rm HI}b_{\rm HI}r = [0.93 \pm 0.17]\,\times\,10^{-3}$ with $\approx6\sigma$ confidence. The measurement is independent of scale cuts at both edges of the probed scale range ($0.04 \lesssim k \lesssim 0.3 \,h$Mpc$^{-1}$), corroborating its robustness. Our new pipeline has successfully found an optimal compromise in separating contaminants without incurring a catastrophic signal loss, instilling more confidence in the outstanding science we can deliver with MeerKAT on the path towards HI intensity mapping surveys with the full SKAO.</description>

Abstract: Fluorescence telescopes are important instruments widely used in modern experiments for registering ultraviolet radiation from extensive air showers (EASs) generated by cosmic rays of ultra-high energies. We present a proof-of-concept convolutional neural network aimed at reconstruction of energy and arrival directions of primary particles using model data for two telescopes developed by the international JEM-EUSO collaboration. We also demonstrate how a simple convolutional encoder-decoder can be used for EAS track recognition. The approach is generic and can be adopted for other fluorescence telescopes.</description>

      <title>Beyond CCDs: Characterization of sCMOS detectors for optical astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern scientific complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (sCMOS) detectors provide a highly competitive alternative to charge-coupled devices (CCDs), the latter of which have historically been dominant in optical imaging. sCMOS boast comparable performances to CCDs with faster frame rates, lower read noise, and a higher dynamic range. Furthermore, their lower production costs are shifting the industry to abandon CCD support and production in favour of CMOS, making their characterization urgent. In this work, we characterized a variety of high-end commercially available sCMOS detectors to gauge the state of this technology in the context of applications in optical astronomy. We evaluated a range of sCMOS detectors, including larger pixel models such as the Teledyne Prime 95B and the Andor Sona-11, which are similar to CCDs in pixel size and suitable for wide-field astronomy. Additionally, we assessed smaller pixel detectors like the Ximea xiJ and Andor Sona-6, which are better suited for deep-sky imaging. Furthermore, high-sensitivity quantitative sCMOS detectors such as the Hamamatsu Orca-Quest C15550-20UP, capable of resolving individual photoelectrons, were also tested. In-lab testing showed low levels of dark current, read noise, faulty pixels, and fixed pattern noise, as well as linearity levels above $98\%$ across all detectors. The Orca-Quest had particularly low noise levels with a dark current of $0.0067 \pm 0.0003$ e$^-$/s (at $-20^\circ$C with air cooling) and a read noise of $0.37 \pm 0.09$ e$^-$ using its standard readout mode. Our tests revealed that the latest generation of sCMOS detectors excels in optical imaging performance, offering a more accessible alternative to CCDs for future optical astronomy instruments.</description>

      <title>PROSPECT: A profile likelihood code for frequentist cosmological parameter inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological parameter inference has been dominated by the Bayesian approach for the past two decades, primarily due to its computational efficiency. However, the Bayesian approach involves integration of the posterior probability and therefore depends on both the choice of model parametrisation and the choice of prior on the model parameter space. In some cases, this can lead to conclusions which are driven by choice of parametrisation and priors rather than by data. The profile likelihood method provides a complementary frequentist tool which can be used to investigate this effect.
  In this paper, we present the code PROSPECT for computing profile likelihoods in cosmology. We showcase the code using a phenomenological model for converting dark matter into dark radiation that suffers from large volume effects and prior dependence. PROSPECT is compatible with both cobaya and MontePython, and is publicly available at https://github.com/AarhusCosmology/prospect_public.</description>

      <title>Exploiting the diversity of modeling methods to probe systematic biases in strong lensing analyses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Challenges inherent to high-resolution and high signal-to-noise data as well as model degeneracies can cause systematic biases in analyses of strong lens systems. In the past decade, the number of lens modeling methods has significantly increased, from purely analytical methods, to pixelated and non-parametric ones, or ones based on deep learning. We embraced this diversity by selecting different software packages and use them to blindly model independently simulated Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging data. To overcome the difficulties arising from using different codes and conventions, we used the COde-independent Organized LEns STandard (COOLEST) to store, compare, and release all models in a self-consistent and human-readable manner. From an ensemble of six modeling methods, we studied the recovery of the lens potential parameters and properties of the reconstructed source. We find that, overall, both lens and source properties are recovered reasonably well, but systematic biases arise in all methods. Interestingly, we do not observe that a single method is significantly more accurate than others, and the amount of bias largely depends on the specific lens or source property of interest. By combining posterior distributions from individual methods using equal weights, the maximal systematic biases on lens model parameters inferred from individual models are reduced by a factor of 5.4 on average. We investigated a selection of modeling effects that partly explain the observed biases, such as the cuspy nature of the background source and the accuracy of the point spread function. This work introduces, for the first time, a generic framework to compare and ease the combination of models obtained from different codes and methods, which will be key to retain accuracy in future strong lensing analyses.</description>

      <title>A Unified Multi-Wavelength Data Analysis Workflow with gammapy. Constraining the Broadband Emission of FSRQ OP 313</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar OP~313 entered an enhanced activity phase in November 2023 and has undergone multiple flares since then which have motivated the organisation of several large multi-wavelength campaigns, including two deep observations from the hard X-ray telescope NuSTAR. The broadband emission from OP~313 during these two observations is investigated under a new unified analysis framework, with data spanning from optical to gamma rays. Traditional methods for analyzing blazar emissions often rely on proprietary software tailored to specific instruments, making it challenging to integrate and interpret data from multi-wavelength campaigns comprehensively. This study demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing gammapy, an open-source Python package, and common data formats originally developed for gamma-ray instrumentation, to perform a consistent multi-instrument analysis. This enables a forward folding approach that fully incorporates source observations, detector responses, and various instrumental and astrophysical backgrounds. The methodology is applied as an example to recent data collected from the distant quasar OP~313. We present a comprehensive data reconstruction and analysis for instruments including the Liverpool Telescope's IO:O detector, Swift-UVOT, Swift-XRT, NuSTAR, and Fermi-LAT. The resulting spectral analysis is validated against the native tools for each instrument. Additionally, a multi-wavelength phenomenological model of the source emission, encompassing optical to gamma-ray bands, is developed, incorporating absorption components across different energy regimes. We introduce and validate a new unified framework for multi-wavelength forward folding data analysis based on gammapy and open data formats, demonstrating its application to spectral data from the quasar OP~313.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Jupiter's interior using machine learning reveals four key structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The internal structure of Jupiter is constrained by the precise gravity field measurements by NASA's Juno mission, atmospheric data from the Galileo entry probe, and Voyager radio occultations. Not only are these observations few compared to the possible interior setups and their multiple controlling parameters, but they remain challenging to reconcile. As a complex, multidimensional problem, characterizing typical structures can help simplify the modeling process. We used NeuralCMS, a deep learning model based on the accurate concentric Maclaurin spheroid (CMS) method, coupled with a fully consistent wind model to efficiently explore a wide range of interior models without prior assumptions. We then identified those consistent with the measurements and clustered the plausible combinations of parameters controlling the interior. We determine the plausible ranges of internal structures and the dynamical contributions to Jupiter's gravity field. Four typical interior structures are identified, characterized by their envelope and core properties. This reduces the dimensionality of Jupiter's interior to only two effective parameters. Within the reduced 2D phase space, we show that the most observationally constrained structures fall within one of the key structures, but they require a higher 1 bar temperature than the observed value. We provide a robust framework for characterizing giant planet interiors with consistent wind treatment, demonstrating that for Jupiter, wind constraints strongly impact the gravity harmonics while the interior parameter distribution remains largely unchanged. Importantly, we find that Jupiter's interior can be described by two effective parameters that clearly distinguish the four characteristic structures and conclude that atmospheric measurements may not fully represent the entire envelope.</description>

      <title>The neutron veto of the XENONnT experiment: Results with demineralized water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiogenic neutrons emitted by detector materials are one of the most challenging backgrounds for the direct search of dark matter in the form of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). To mitigate this background, the XENONnT experiment is equipped with a novel gadolinium-doped water Cherenkov detector, which encloses the xenon dual-phase time projection chamber (TPC). The neutron veto (NV) tags neutrons via their capture on gadolinium or hydrogen, which release $\gamma$-rays that are subsequently detected as Cherenkov light. In this work, we present the key features and the first results of the XENONnT NV when operated with demineralized water in the initial phase of the experiment. Its efficiency for detecting neutrons is $(82\pm 1)\,\%$, the highest neutron detection efficiency achieved in a water Cherenkov detector. This enables a high efficiency of $(53\pm 3)\,\%$ for the tagging of WIMP-like neutron signals, inside a tagging time window of $250\,\mathrm{\mu s}$ between TPC and NV, leading to a livetime loss of $1.6\,\%$ during the first science run of XENONnT.</description>
