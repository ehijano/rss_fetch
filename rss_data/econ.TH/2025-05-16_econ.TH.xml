      <title>The Impact of Node Addition and Deletion on Network Production Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Production networks, dynamic systems of firms linked through input-output relationships, transmit microeconomic shocks into macroeconomic fluctuations. While prior studies often assume static networks, real-world economies feature continuous firm entry (node addition) and exit (node deletion). We develop a probabilistic model to analyze how these dynamics affect production volatility and network resilience. Integrating Leontief input-output frameworks with controllability theory. By quantifying fluctuations as expected values under probabilistic node dynamics, we identify trade-offs between adaptability and stability. Methodologically, we unify Kalman rank criteria and minimum input theory, offering policymakers insights to balance innovation-driven entry with safeguards against destabilizing exits.</description>

      <title>Mill's canons meet social ranking: A characterization of plurality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his book entitled ''A System of Logic, Ratiocinative and Inductive'' (1843), John Stuart Mill proposed principles of inductive reasoning in the form of five canons. To date, these canons are classic methods for causal reasoning: they are intended to single out the circumstances that are connected to the phenomenon under focus. The present paper reinterprets Mill's canons in the modern theory of social ranking solutions, which aims to estimate the power of individuals based on teams' performances. We first apply Mill's canons to determine the key success factors in cooperative performances and then characterize plurality using a strong version of Mill's first canon. Plurality is also compatible with most other canons. Thus, our results demonstrated a hidden link between classical causal reasoning and the theory of social ranking solutions.</description>

      <title>A decomposition from a many-to-one matching market with path-independent choice functions to a one-to-one matching market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a many-to-one market where firms are endowed with path-independent choice functions, based on the Aizerman-Malishevski decomposition, we define an associated one-to-one market. Given that the usual notion of stability for a one-to-one market does not fit well for this associated one-to-one market, we introduce a new notion of stability. This notion allows us to establish an isomorphism between the set of stable matchings in the many-to-one market and the matchings in an associated one-to-one market that meet this new stability criterion. Furthermore, we present an adaptation of the well-known deferred acceptance algorithm to compute a matching that satisfies this new notion of stability for the associated one-to-one market. Finally, as a byproduct of our isomorphism, we prove an adapted version of the so-called Rural Hospital Theorem.</description>
