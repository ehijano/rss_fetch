      <title>Forgive and Forget? An Industry 5.0 Approach to Trust-Fatigue Co-regulation in Human-Cobot Order Picking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the critical role of trust and fatigue in human-cobot collaborative order picking, framing the challenge within the scope of Logistics 5.0 -- the implementation of human-robot symbiosis in smart logistics. We propose a dynamic, leader-follower Stackelberg game to model this interaction, where utility functions explicitly account for human fatigue and trust. Through agent-based simulations, we demonstrate that while a naive model leads to a "trust death spiral," a refined trust model creates a "trust synergy cycle," increasing productivity by nearly 100 percent. Finally, we show that a cobot equipped with a proactive Trust-Repair Protocol can overcome system brittleness, reducing trust recovery time after a severe failure by over 75 percent compared to a non-adaptive model. Our findings provide a framework for designing intelligent cobot behaviors that fulfill the Industry 5.0 pillars of human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience.</description>

      <title>When Agents Break Down in Multiagent Path Finding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Multiagent Path Finding (MAPF), the goal is to compute efficient, collision-free paths for multiple agents navigating a network from their sources to targets, minimizing the schedule's makespan-the total time until all agents reach their destinations. We introduce a new variant that formally models scenarios where some agents may experience delays due to malfunctions, posing significant challenges for maintaining optimal schedules.
  Recomputing an entirely new schedule from scratch after each malfunction is often computationally infeasible. To address this, we propose a framework for dynamic schedule adaptation that does not rely on full replanning. Instead, we develop protocols enabling agents to locally coordinate and adjust their paths on the fly. We prove that following our primary communication protocol, the increase in makespan after k malfunctions is bounded by k additional turns, effectively limiting the impact of malfunctions on overall efficiency. Moreover, recognizing that agents may have limited computational capabilities, we also present a secondary protocol that shifts the necessary computations onto the network's nodes, ensuring robustness without requiring enhanced agent processing power. Our results demonstrate that these protocols provide a practical, scalable approach to resilient multiagent navigation in the face of agent failures.</description>

      <title>DRAMA: A Dynamic and Robust Allocation-based Multi-Agent System for Changing Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) have demonstrated significant effectiveness in addressing complex problems through coordinated collaboration among heterogeneous agents. However, real-world environments and task specifications are inherently dynamic, characterized by frequent changes, uncertainty, and variability. Despite this, most existing MAS frameworks rely on static architectures with fixed agent capabilities and rigid task allocation strategies, which greatly limits their adaptability to evolving conditions. This inflexibility poses substantial challenges for sustaining robust and efficient multi-agent cooperation in dynamic and unpredictable scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose DRAMA: a Dynamic and Robust Allocation-based Multi-Agent System designed to facilitate resilient collaboration in rapidly changing environments. DRAMA features a modular architecture with a clear separation between the control plane and the worker plane. Both agents and tasks are abstracted as resource objects with well-defined lifecycles, while task allocation is achieved via an affinity-based, loosely coupled mechanism. The control plane enables real-time monitoring and centralized planning, allowing flexible and efficient task reassignment as agents join, depart, or become unavailable, thereby ensuring continuous and robust task execution. The worker plane comprises a cluster of autonomous agents, each with local reasoning, task execution, the ability to collaborate, and the capability to take over unfinished tasks from other agents when needed.</description>

      <title>Position-Based Flocking for Robust Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a position-based flocking model for interacting agents, balancing cohesion-separation and alignment to achieve stable collective motion. The model modifies a velocity-based approach by approximating velocity differences using initial and current positions, introducing a threshold weight to ensure sustained alignment. Simulations with 50 agents in 2D demonstrate that the position-based model produces stronger alignment and more rigid and compact formations compared to the velocity-based model. The alignment metric and separation distances highlight the efficacy of the proposed model in achieving robust flocking behavior. The model's use of positions ensures robust alignment, with applications in robotics and collective dynamics.</description>

      <title>What Do Agents Think Others Would Do? Level-2 Inverse Games for Inferring Agents' Estimates of Others' Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effectively interpreting strategic interactions among multiple agents requires us to infer each agent's objective from limited information. Existing inverse game-theoretic approaches frame this challenge in terms of a "level-1" inference problem, in which we take the perspective of a third-party observer and assume that individual agents share complete knowledge of one another's objectives. However, this assumption breaks down in decentralized, real-world decision scenarios like urban driving and bargaining, in which agents may act based on conflicting views of one another's objectives. We demonstrate the necessity of inferring agents' heterogeneous estimates of each other's objectives through empirical examples, and by theoretically characterizing the prediction error of level-1 inference on fictitious gameplay data from linear-quadratic games. To address this fundamental issue, we propose a framework for level-2 inference to address the question: "What does each agent believe about all agents' objectives?" We prove that the level-2 inference problem is non-convex even in benign settings like linear-quadratic games, and we develop an efficient gradient-based approach for identifying local solutions. Experiments on a synthetic urban driving example show that our approach uncovers nuanced misalignments that level-1 methods miss.</description>

      <title>MI9 -- Agent Intelligence Protocol: Runtime Governance for Agentic AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic AI systems capable of reasoning, planning, and executing actions present fundamentally distinct governance challenges compared to traditional AI models. Unlike conventional AI, these systems exhibit emergent and unexpected behaviors during runtime, introducing novel agent-related risks that cannot be fully anticipated through pre-deployment governance alone. To address this critical gap, we introduce MI9, the first fully integrated runtime governance framework designed specifically for safety and alignment of agentic AI systems. MI9 introduces real-time controls through six integrated components: agency-risk index, agent-semantic telemetry capture, continuous authorization monitoring, Finite-State-Machine (FSM)-based conformance engines, goal-conditioned drift detection, and graduated containment strategies. Operating transparently across heterogeneous agent architectures, MI9 enables the systematic, safe, and responsible deployment of agentic systems in production environments where conventional governance approaches fall short, providing the foundational infrastructure for safe agentic AI deployment at scale. Detailed analysis through a diverse set of scenarios demonstrates MI9's systematic coverage of governance challenges that existing approaches fail to address, establishing the technical foundation for comprehensive agentic AI oversight.</description>

      <title>Generic-to-Specific Reasoning and Learning for Scalable Ad Hoc Teamwork</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI agents deployed in assistive roles often have to collaborate with other agents (humans, AI systems) without prior coordination. Methods considered state of the art for such ad hoc teamwork often pursue a data-driven approach that needs a large labeled dataset of prior observations, lacks transparency, and makes it difficult to rapidly revise existing knowledge in response to changes. As the number of agents increases, the complexity of decision-making makes it difficult to collaborate effectively. This paper advocates leveraging the complementary strengths of knowledge-based and data-driven methods for reasoning and learning for ad hoc teamwork. For any given goal, our architecture enables each ad hoc agent to determine its actions through non-monotonic logical reasoning with: (a) prior commonsense domain-specific knowledge; (b) models learned and revised rapidly to predict the behavior of other agents; and (c) anticipated abstract future goals based on generic knowledge of similar situations in an existing foundation model. We experimentally evaluate our architecture's capabilities in VirtualHome, a realistic physics-based 3D simulation environment.</description>

      <title>Chain of Questions: Guiding Multimodal Curiosity in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) have substantially advanced through methods such as chain-of-thought and explicit step-by-step explanations. However, these improvements have not yet fully transitioned to multimodal contexts, where models must proactively decide which sensory modalities such as vision, audio, or spatial perception to engage when interacting with complex real-world environments. In this paper, we introduce the Chain of Questions (CoQ) framework, a curiosity-driven reasoning approach that encourages multimodal language models to dynamically generate targeted questions regarding their surroundings. These generated questions guide the model to selectively activate relevant modalities, thereby gathering critical information necessary for accurate reasoning and response generation. We evaluate our framework on a novel multimodal benchmark dataset, assembled by integrating WebGPT, ScienceQA, AVSD, and ScanQA datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our CoQ method improves a foundation model's ability to effectively identify and integrate pertinent sensory information. This leads to improved accuracy, interpretability, and alignment of the reasoning process with diverse multimodal tasks.</description>

      <title>Think Before You Segment: An Object-aware Reasoning Agent for Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to segment target objects in audible videos based on given reference expressions. Prior works typically rely on learning latent embeddings via multimodal fusion to prompt a tunable SAM/SAM2 decoder for segmentation, which requires strong pixel-level supervision and lacks interpretability. From a novel perspective of explicit reference understanding, we propose TGS-Agent, which decomposes the task into a Think-Ground-Segment process, mimicking the human reasoning procedure by first identifying the referred object through multimodal analysis, followed by coarse-grained grounding and precise segmentation. To this end, we first propose Ref-Thinker, a multimodal language model capable of reasoning over textual, visual, and auditory cues. We construct an instruction-tuning dataset with explicit object-aware think-answer chains for Ref-Thinker fine-tuning. The object description inferred by Ref-Thinker is used as an explicit prompt for Grounding-DINO and SAM2, which perform grounding and segmentation without relying on pixel-level supervision. Additionally, we introduce R\textsuperscript{2}-AVSBench, a new benchmark with linguistically diverse and reasoning-intensive references for better evaluating model generalization. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on both standard Ref-AVSBench and proposed R\textsuperscript{2}-AVSBench. Code will be available at https://github.com/jasongief/TGS-Agent.</description>

      <title>Behaviorally Adaptive Multi-Robot Hazard Localization in Failure-Prone, Communication-Denied Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of multi-robot autonomous hazard mapping in high-risk, failure-prone, communication-denied environments such as post-disaster zones, underground mines, caves, and planetary surfaces. In these missions, robots must explore and map hazards while minimizing the risk of failure due to environmental threats or hardware limitations. We introduce a behavior-adaptive, information-theoretic planning framework for multi-robot teams grounded in the concept of Behavioral Entropy (BE), that generalizes Shannon entropy (SE) to capture diverse human-like uncertainty evaluations. Building on this formulation, we propose the Behavior-Adaptive Path Planning (BAPP) framework, which modulates information gathering strategies via a tunable risk-sensitivity parameter, and present two planning algorithms: BAPP-TID for intelligent triggering of high-fidelity robots, and BAPP-SIG for safe deployment under high risk. We provide theoretical insights on the informativeness of the proposed BAPP framework and validate its effectiveness through both single-robot and multi-robot simulations. Our results show that the BAPP stack consistently outperforms Shannon-based and random strategies: BAPP-TID accelerates entropy reduction, while BAPP-SIG improves robot survivability with minimal loss in information gain. In multi-agent deployments, BAPP scales effectively through spatial partitioning, mobile base relocation, and role-aware heterogeneity. These findings underscore the value of behavior-adaptive planning for robust, risk-sensitive exploration in complex, failure-prone environments.</description>

      <title>From MAS to MARS: Coordination Failures and Reasoning Trade-offs in Hierarchical Multi-Agent Robotic Systems within a Healthcare Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent robotic systems (MARS) build upon multi-agent systems by integrating physical and task-related constraints, increasing the complexity of action execution and agent coordination. However, despite the availability of advanced multi-agent frameworks, their real-world deployment on robots remains limited, hindering the advancement of MARS research in practice. To bridge this gap, we conducted two studies to investigate performance trade-offs of hierarchical multi-agent frameworks in a simulated real-world multi-robot healthcare scenario. In Study 1, using CrewAI, we iteratively refine the system's knowledge base, to systematically identify and categorize coordination failures (e.g., tool access violations, lack of timely handling of failure reports) not resolvable by providing contextual knowledge alone. In Study 2, using AutoGen, we evaluate a redesigned bidirectional communication structure and further measure the trade-offs between reasoning and non-reasoning models operating within the same robotic team setting. Drawing from our empirical findings, we emphasize the tension between autonomy and stability and the importance of edge-case testing to improve system reliability and safety for future real-world deployment. Supplementary materials, including codes, task agent setup, trace outputs, and annotated examples of coordination failures and reasoning behaviors, are available at: https://byc-sophie.github.io/mas-to-mars/.</description>

      <title>SEAgent: Self-Evolving Computer Use Agent with Autonomous Learning from Experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Repurposing large vision-language models (LVLMs) as computer use agents (CUAs) has led to substantial breakthroughs, primarily driven by human-labeled data. However, these models often struggle with novel and specialized software, particularly in scenarios lacking human annotations. To address this challenge, we propose SEAgent, an agentic self-evolving framework enabling CUAs to autonomously evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software. Specifically, SEAgent empowers computer-use agents to autonomously master novel software environments via experiential learning, where agents explore new software, learn through iterative trial-and-error, and progressively tackle auto-generated tasks organized from simple to complex. To achieve this goal, we design a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a Curriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks. The agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of adversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on successful ones. Furthermore, we introduce a specialist-to-generalist training strategy that integrates individual experiential insights from specialist agents, facilitating the development of a stronger generalist CUA capable of continuous autonomous evolution. This unified agent ultimately achieves performance surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on their specialized software. We validate the effectiveness of SEAgent across five novel software environments within OS-World. Our approach achieves a significant improvement of 23.2% in success rate, from 11.3% to 34.5%, over a competitive open-source CUA, i.e., UI-TARS.</description>

      <title>A Value Based Parallel Update MCTS Method for Multi-Agent Cooperative Decision Making of Connected and Automated Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To solve the problem of lateral and logitudinal joint decision-making of multi-vehicle cooperative driving for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), this paper proposes a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) method with parallel update for multi-agent Markov game with limited horizon and time discounted setting. By analyzing the parallel actions in the multi-vehicle joint action space in the partial-steady-state traffic flow, the parallel update method can quickly exclude potential dangerous actions, thereby increasing the search depth without sacrificing the search breadth. The proposed method is tested in a large number of randomly generated traffic flow. The experiment results show that the algorithm has good robustness and better performance than the SOTA reinforcement learning algorithms and heuristic methods. The vehicle driving strategy using the proposed algorithm shows rationality beyond human drivers, and has advantages in traffic efficiency and safety in the coordinating zone.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Focal Search in Multi-Agent Path Finding with Tighter Lower Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) involves finding collision-free paths for multiple agents while minimizing a cost function--an NP-hard problem. Bounded suboptimal methods like Enhanced Conflict-Based Search (ECBS) and Explicit Estimation CBS (EECBS) balance solution quality with computational efficiency using focal search mechanisms. While effective, traditional focal search faces a limitation: the lower bound (LB) value determining which nodes enter the FOCAL list often increases slowly in early search stages, resulting in a constrained search space that delays finding valid solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel bounded suboptimal algorithm, double-ECBS (DECBS), to address this issue by first determining the maximum LB value and then employing a best-first search guided by this LB to find a collision-free path. Experimental results demonstrate that DECBS outperforms ECBS in most test cases and is compatible with existing optimization techniques. DECBS can reduce nearly 30% high-level CT nodes and 50% low-level focal search nodes. When agent density is moderate to high, DECBS achieves a 23.5% average runtime improvement over ECBS with identical suboptimality bounds and optimizations.</description>

Abstract: City-scale traffic signal control (TSC) involves thousands of heterogeneous intersections with varying topologies, making cooperative decision-making across intersections particularly challenging. Given the prohibitive computational cost of learning individual policies for each intersection, some researchers explore learning a universal policy to control each intersection in a decentralized manner, where the key challenge is to construct a universal representation method for heterogeneous intersections. However, existing methods are limited to universally representing information of heterogeneous ego intersections, neglecting the essential representation of influence from their heterogeneous neighbors. Universally incorporating neighborhood information is nontrivial due to the intrinsic complexity of traffic flow interactions, as well as the challenge of modeling collective influences from neighbor intersections. To address these challenges, we propose CityLight, which learns a universal policy based on representations obtained with two major modules: a Neighbor Influence Encoder to explicitly model neighbor's influence with specified traffic flow relation and connectivity to the ego intersection; a Neighbor Influence Aggregator to attentively aggregate the influence of neighbors based on their mutual competitive relations. Extensive experiments on five city-scale datasets, ranging from 97 to 13,952 intersections, confirm the efficacy of CityLight, with an average throughput improvement of 11.68% and a lift of 22.59% for generalization.</description>
