      <title>On the Various Translations between Classical, Intuitionistic and Linear Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several different proof translations exist between classical and intuitionistic logic (negative translations), and intuitionistic and linear logic (Girard translations). Our aims in this paper are (1) to show that all these systems can be expressed as extensions of a basic logical system (essentially intuitionistic linear logic), and that (2) with this common logical basis, a common approach to devising and simplifying such proof translations can be formalised. Via this process of ``simplification'' we get the most well-known translations in the literature.</description>

      <title>Structurable equivalence relations and $\mathcal{L}_{\omega_1\omega}$ interpretations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the category of countable Borel equivalence relations (CBERs) is dually equivalent to the category of countable $\mathcal{L}_{\omega_1\omega}$ theories which admit a one-sorted interpretation of a particular theory we call $\mathcal{T}_\mathsf{LN} \sqcup \mathcal{T}_\mathsf{sep}$ that witnesses embeddability into $2^\mathbb{N}$ and the Lusin--Novikov uniformization theorem. This allows problems about Borel combinatorial structures on CBERs to be translated into syntactic definability problems in $\mathcal{L}_{\omega_1\omega}$, modulo the extra structure provided by $\mathcal{T}_\mathsf{LN} \sqcup \mathcal{T}_\mathsf{sep}$, thereby formalizing a folklore intuition in locally countable Borel combinatorics. We illustrate this with a catalogue of the precise interpretability relations between several standard classes of structures commonly used in Borel combinatorics, such as Feldman--Moore $\omega$-colorings and the Slaman--Steel marker lemma. We also generalize this correspondence to locally countable Borel groupoids and theories interpreting $\mathcal{T}_\mathsf{LN}$, which admit a characterization analogous to that of Hjorth--Kechris for essentially countable isomorphism relations.</description>

      <title>Cardinality of groups and rings via the idempotency of infinite cardinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important classical result in ZFC asserts that every infinite cardinal number is idempotent. Using this fact, we obtain several algebraic results in this article. The first result asserts that an infinite Abelian group has a proper subgroup with the same cardinality if and only if it is not a Pr\"ufer group. In the second result, the cardinality of any monoid-ring $R[M]$ (not necessarily commutative) is calculated. In particular, the cardinality of every polynomial ring with any number of variables (possibly infinite) is easily computed. Next, it is shown that every commutative ring and its total ring of fractions have the same cardinality. This set-theoretic observation leads us to a notion in ring theory that we call a balanced ring (i.e. a ring that is canonically isomorphic to its total ring of fractions). Every zero-dimensional ring is a balanced ring. Then we show that a Noetherian ring is a balanced ring if and only if its localization at every maximal ideal has zero depth. It is also proved that every self-injective ring (injective as a module over itself) is a balanced ring.</description>

      <title>Formalising inductive and coinductive containers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Containers capture the concept of strictly positive data types in programming. The original development of containers is done in the internal language of Locally Cartesian Closed Categories (LCCCs) with disjoint coproducts and W-types. Although it is claimed that these developments can also be interpreted in extensional Martin-L\"of type theory, this interpretation is not made explicit. Moreover, as a result of extensionality, these developments freely assume Uniqueness of Identity Proofs (UIP), so it is not clear whether this is a necessary condition. In this paper, we present a formalisation of the result that `containers preserve least and greatest fixed points' in Cubical Agda, thereby giving a formulation in intensional type theory, and showing that UIP is not necessary. Our main incentive for using Cubical Agda is that its path type restores the equivalence between bisimulation and coinductive equality. Thus, besides developing container theory in a more general setting, we also demonstrate the usefulness of Cubical Agda's path type to coinductive proofs.</description>

      <title>Uncountable Hyperfiniteness and The Random Ratio Ergodic Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the orbit equivalence relation of a free action of a locally compact group is hyperfinite (\`a la Connes-Feldman-Weiss) precisely when it is 'hypercompact'. This implies an uncountable version of the Ornstein-Weiss Theorem and that every locally compact group admitting a hypercompact probability preserving free action is amenable. We also establish an uncountable version of Danilenko's Random Ratio Ergodic Theorem. From this we deduce the 'Hopf dichotomy' for many nonsingular Bernoulli actions.</description>

      <title>Models of Abelian varieties over valued fields, using model theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15829v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an elliptic curve $E$ over a perfect defectless henselian valued field $(F,\mathrm{val})$ with perfect residue field $\textbf{k}_F$ and valuation ring $\mathcal{O}_F$, there exists an integral separated smooth group scheme $\mathcal{E}$ over $\mathcal{O}_F$ with $\mathcal{E}\times_{\text{Spec } \mathcal{O}_F}\text{Spec } F\cong E$. If $\text{char}(\textbf{k}_F)\neq 2,3$ then one can be found over $\mathcal{O}_{F^{alg}}$ such that the definable group $\mathcal{E}(\mathcal{O})$ is the maximal generically stable subgroup of $E$. We also give some partial results on general Abelian varieties over $F$.
  The construction of $\mathcal{E}$ is by means of generating a birational group law over $\mathcal{O}_F$ by the aid of a generically stable generic type of a definable subgroup of $E$.</description>

      <title>The equational theory of the Weihrauch lattice with multiplication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the equational theory of the Weihrauch lattice with multiplication, meaning the collection of equations between terms built from variables, the lattice operations $\sqcup$, $\sqcap$, the product $\times$, and the finite parallelization $(-)^*$ which are true however we substitute Weihrauch degrees for the variables. We provide a combinatorial description of these in terms of a reducibility between finite graphs, and moreover, show that deciding which equations are true in this sense is complete for the third level of the polynomial hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Categorical Framework for Typed Extensional and Intensional Models in Formal Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07058v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intensional computation derives concrete outputs from abstract function definitions; extensional computation defines functions through explicit input-output pairs. In formal semantics: intensional computation interprets expressions as context-dependent functions; extensional computation evaluates expressions based on their denotations in an otherwise fixed context. This paper reformulates typed extensional and intensional models of formal semantics within a category-theoretic framework and demonstrates their natural representation therein. We construct $\textbf{ModInt}$, the category of intensional models, building on the categories $\textbf{Set}$ of sets, $\textbf{Rel}$ of relations, and $\textbf{Kr}$ and $\textbf{Kr}_\textbf{b}$ of Kripke frames with monotone maps and bounded morphisms, respectively. We prove that trivial intensional models are equivalent to extensional models, providing a unified categorical representation of intensionality and extensionality in formal semantics. This approach reinterprets the relationship between intensions and extensions in a categorical framework and offers a modular, order-independent method for processing intensions and recovering extensions; contextualizing the relationship between content and reference in category-theoretic terms. We discuss implications for natural language semantics and propose future directions for contextual integration and exploring $\textbf{ModInt}$'s algebraic properties.</description>
