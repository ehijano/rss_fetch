      <title>Non-perturbative exciton transfer rate analysis of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson photosynthetic complex under reduced and oxidised conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional optical spectroscopy experiments have shown that exciton transfer pathways in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) photosynthetic complex differ drastically under reduced and oxidised conditions, suggesting a functional role for collective vibronic mechanisms that may be active in the reduced form but attenuated in the oxidised state. Higgins et al. [PNAS 118 (11) e2018240118 (2021)] used Redfield theory to link the experimental observations to altered exciton transfer rates due to oxidative onsite energy shifts that detune excitonic energy gaps from a specific vibrational frequency of the bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) a. Using a memory kernel formulation of the hierarchical equations of motion, we present non-perturbative estimations of transfer rates that yield a modified physical picture. Our findings indicate that onsite energy shifts alone cannot reproduce the observed rate changes in oxidative environments, either qualitatively or quantitatively. By systematically examining combined changes both in site energies and the local environment for the oxidised complex, while maintaining consistency with absorption spectra, our results suggest that vibronic tuning of transfer rates may indeed be active in the reduced complex. However, we achieve qualitative, but not quantitative, agreement with the experimentally measured rates. Our analysis indicates potential limitations of the FMO electronic Hamiltonian, which was originally derived by fitting spectra to second-order cumulant and Redfield theories. This suggests that reassessment of these electronic parameters with a non-perturbative scheme, or derived from first principles, is essential for a consistent and accurate understanding of exciton dynamics in FMO under varying redox conditions.</description>

      <title>Excited-State-Specific Kohn-Sham Formalism for the Asymmetric Hubbard Dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on our recent study [https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.3c02052, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 14, 8780 (2023)], we explore the generalization of the ground-state Kohn-Sham (KS) formalism of density-functional theory (DFT) to the (singlet) excited states of the asymmetric Hubbard dimer at half-filling. While we found that the KS-DFT framework can be straightforwardly generalized to the highest-lying doubly-excited state, the treatment of the first excited state presents significant challenges. Specifically, using a density-fixed adiabatic connection, we show that the density of the first excited state lacks non-interacting $v$-representability. However, by employing an analytic continuation of the adiabatic path, we demonstrate that the density of the first excited state can be generated by a complex-valued external potential in the non-interacting case. More practically, by performing state-specific KS calculations with exact and approximate correlation functionals -- each state possessing a distinct correlation functional -- we observe that spurious stationary solutions of the KS equations may arise due to the approximate nature of the functional.</description>

      <title>Identifying Band Inversions in Topological Materials Using Diffusion Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological insulators are characterized by insulating bulk states and robust metallic surface states. Band inversion is a hallmark of topological insulators: at time-reversal invariant points in the Brillouin zone, spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induces a swapping of orbital character at the bulk band edges. In this work, we develop a novel method to detect band inversion within continuum quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods that can accurately treat the electron correlation and spin-orbit coupling crucial to the physics of topological insulators. Our approach applies a momentum-space-resolved atomic population analysis throughout the first Brillouin zone utilizing the L\"owdin method and the one-body reduced density matrix produced with Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC). We integrate this method into QMCPACK, an open source ab initio QMC package, so that these ground state methods can be used to complement experimental studies and validate prior DFT work on predicting the band structures of correlated topological insulators. We demonstrate this new technique on the topological insulator bismuth telluride, which displays band inversion between its Bi-p and Te-p states at the $\Gamma$-point. We show an increase in charge on the bismuth p orbital and a decrease in charge on the tellurium p orbital when comparing band structures with and without SOC. Additionally, we use our method to compare the degree of band inversion present in monolayer Bi$_2$Te$_3$, which has no interlayer van der Waals interactions, to that seen in the bulk. The method presented here will enable future, many-body studies of band inversion that can shed light on the delicate interplay between correlation and topology in correlated topological materials.</description>

      <title>Time-Reversal Symmetry-Protected Coherent Control of Ultracold Molecular Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent control of atomic and molecular scattering relies on the preparation of colliding particles in superpositions of internal states, establishing interfering pathways that can be used to tune the outcome of a scattering process. However, incoherent addition of different partial wave contributions to the integral cross sections (partial wave scrambling), commonly encountered in systems with complex collisional dynamics, poses a significant challenge, often limiting control. This work demonstrates that time-reversal symmetry can overcome these limitations by constraining the relative phases of S-matrix elements, thereby protecting coherent control against partial wave scrambling, even for collisions mediated by highly anisotropic interactions. Using the example of ultracold O$_2$-O$_2$ scattering, we show that coherent control is robust against short-range dynamical complexity. Furthermore, the time-reversal symmetry also protects the control against a distribution of collisional energy. These findings show that ultracold scattering into the final states that are time-reversal-invariant, such as the J = 0, M = 0 rotational state, can always be optimally controlled by using time-reversal-invariant initial superpositions. Beyond the ultracold regime, we observe significant differences in the controllability of crossed-molecular beam vs. trap experiments with the former being easier to control, emphasizing the cooperative role of time-reversal and permutation symmetries in maintaining control at any temperature. These results open new avenues for the coherent control of complex inelastic collisions and chemical reactions both in and outside of the ultracold regime.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Charge Carrier Cooling on the Ultrafast Carrier Dynamics in Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ shows promise for solution-processable optoelectronics, such as photovoltaics, photocatalysis and X-ray detection. However, various spectroscopic studies report rapid charge carrier mobility loss in the first picosecond after photoexcitation, limiting carrier collection efficiencies. The origin of this rapid mobility loss is still unclear. Here, we directly compare hot excitation with excitation over the indirect fundamental bandgap, using transient absorption and THz spectroscopy on the same Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ thin film sample. From transient absorption spectroscopy, we find that hot carriers cool towards the band-edges with a cooling rate of 0.58 ps$^{-1}$, which coincides with the observed mobility loss rate from THz spectroscopy. Hence, our study establishes a direct link between the hot carrier cooling and ultrafast mobility loss on the picosecond timescale.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Effects in Quantum Rate Calculations of Hydrogen Diffusion with Electronic Friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of incorporating non-Markovian electronic friction effects in quantum-mechanical approximations of dynamical observables. A generalized Langevin equation (GLE) is formulated for ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) rate calculations, which combines electronic friction with a description of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) for adsorbates on metal surfaces. An efficient propagation algorithm is introduced that captures both the spatial dependence of friction strength and non-Markovian frictional memory. This framework is applied to a model of hydrogen diffusing on Cu(111) derived from ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations, revealing significant alterations in rate constants and tunnelling crossover temperatures due to non-Markovian effects. Our findings explain why previous classical molecular dynamics simulations with Markovian friction showed unexpectedly good agreement with experiment, highlighting the critical role of non-Markovian effects in first-principles atomistic simulations.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Circuits 4: Modeling chemical reaction networks with nonequilibrium conductance matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the nonequilibrium conductance matrix for open stationary Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs) described by a deterministic mass action kinetic equation. As an illustration, we determine the nonequilibrium conductance matrix of a CRN made of two sub-networks, called chemical modules, in two different ways: First by computing the nonequilibrium conductances of the modules that are then serially connected. Second by computing directly the nonequilibrium conductance of the CRN directly. The two approaches coincide, as expected from our theory of thermodynamic circuits. We end by discussing the advantages of splitting a CRN into smaller chemical modules.</description>

      <title>Velocity Jumps for Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Velocity Jumps approach, denoted as JUMP, a new class of Molecular dynamics integrators, replacing the Langevin dynamics by a hybrid model combining a classical Langevin diffusion and a piecewise deterministic Markov process, where the expensive computation of long-range pairwise interactions is replaced by a resampling of the velocities at random times. This framework allows for an acceleration in the simulation speed while preserving sampling and dynamical properties such as the diffusion constant. It can also be integrated in classical multi-timestep methods, pushing further the computational speedup, while avoiding some of the resonance issues of the latter thanks to the random nature of jumps. The JUMP, JUMP-RESPA and JUMP-RESPA1 integrators have been implemented in the GPU-accelerated version of the Tinker-HP package and are shown to provide significantly enhanced performances compared to their BAOAB, BAOAB-RESPA and BAOAB-RESPA1 counterparts respectively.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional quantum dynamics with explicitly correlated Gaussian wave packets using Rothe's method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a previous publication [J. Chem. Phys., 161, 044105 (2024)], it has been shown that Rothe's method can be used to solve the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) for the hydrogen atom in a strong laser field using time-dependent Gaussian wave packets. Here, we generalize these results, showing that Rothe's method can propagate arbitrary numbers of thawed, complex-valued, explicitly correlated Gaussian functions (ECGs) with dense correlation matrices for systems with varying dimensionality. We consider the multidimensional Henon-Heiles potential, and show that the dynamics can be quantitatively reproduced using only 30 Gaussians in 2D, and that accurate spectra can be obtained using 20 Gaussians in 2D and 30 to 40 Gaussians in 3D and 4D. Thus, the relevant multidimensional dynamics can be described at high quality using only a small number of ECGs that give a very compact representation of the wave function. This efficient representation, along with the demonstrated ability of Rothe's method to propagate Gaussian wave packets in strong fields and ECGs in complex potentials, paves the way for accurate molecular dynamics calculations beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in strong fields.</description>

      <title>Relevant, hidden, and frustrated information in high-dimensional analyses of complex dynamical systems with internal noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09412v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extracting from trajectory data meaningful information to understand complex systems might be non-trivial. High-dimensional analyses are typically assumed to be desirable, if not required, to prevent losing important information. However, to what extent such high-dimensionality is really needed/beneficial often remains not clear. Here we challenge such a fundamental general problem. As first representative cases of a system with internal dynamical complexity, we study atomistic molecular dynamics trajectories of liquid water and ice coexisting in dynamical equilibrium in correspondence of the solid/liquid transition temperature. To attain an intrinsically high-dimensional analysis, we use the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) descriptor, obtaining a large dataset containing 2.56e6 576-dimensional SOAP vectors that we analyze in various ways. Surprisingly, our results demonstrate how the time-series data contained in one single SOAP dimension accounting only for &lt;0.001% of the total variance (thus considered negligible and discarded in typical variance-based dimensionality reduction approaches) is as much, and even more descriptive than the entire high-dimensional dataset. Adding more dimensions to the analysis is found detrimental due to "frustrated information" phenomena that are proven general, and are observed also in the analysis of, e.g., experimental trajectories of collective convolutions of active microparticles (used as a second case study). This work explicitly demonstrates how high-dimensional analyses are not necessarily better than low-dimensional ones. These results also demonstrate the importance of considering the quality (relevance) over the quantity of information, especially when dealing with noisy high-dimensional datasets, where the noise of one dimension may have higher statistical weight than the relevant information contained into another.</description>

      <title>Exceptionally Large Fluctuations in Orientational Order: The Lessons of Large-Deviation Theory for Liquid Crystalline Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How condensed-matter simulations depend on the number of molecules being simulated ($N$) is sometimes itself a valuable piece of information. Liquid crystals provide a case in point. Light scattering and $2d$-IR experiments on isotropic-phase samples display increasingly large orientational fluctuations ("pseudo-nematic domains") as the samples approach their nematic phase. The growing length scale of those locally ordered domains is readily seen in simulation as an ever-slower convergence of the distribution of orientational order parameters with $N$. But the rare-event character and exceptionally slow time scales of the largest fluctuations make them difficult to sample accurately. We show in this paper how taking a large-deviation-theory perspective enables us to leverage simulation-derived information more effectively. A key insight of the theory is that finding quantities such as orientational order parameters (extensive variables), is completely equivalent to deducing the conjugate (intensive) thermodynamic field required to equilibrate that amount of order - and that knowing the relationship between the two (the "equation of state") can easily be turned into knowing the relative free energy of that degree of order. A variety of well-known thermodynamic integration strategies are already founded on this idea, but instead of applying an artificially imposed external field, we use a priori statistical mechanical insights into the small and large-field limits to construct a simulation-guided, interpolated, equation of state. The free energies that result mostly need information from the most probable configurations, making the simulation process far more efficient than waiting for (or artificially generating) large fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) often neglect long-range interactions, such as electrostatic and dispersion forces. In this work, we introduce a straightforward and efficient method to account for long-range interactions by learning a latent variable from local atomic descriptors and applying an Ewald summation to this variable. We demonstrate that in systems including charged and polar molecular dimers, bulk water, and water-vapor interface, standard short-ranged MLIPs can lead to unphysical predictions even when employing message passing. The long-range models effectively eliminate these artifacts, with only about twice the computational cost of short-range MLIPs.</description>

      <title>Machine Learned Potential for High-Throughput Phonon Calculations of Metal-Organic Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are highly porous and versatile materials studied extensively for applications such as carbon capture and water harvesting. However, computing phonon-mediated properties in MOFs, like thermal expansion and mechanical stability, remains challenging due to the large number of atoms per unit cell, making traditional Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods impractical for high-throughput screening. Recent advances in machine learning potentials have led to foundation atomistic models, such as MACE-MP-0, that accurately predict equilibrium structures but struggle with phonon properties of MOFs. In this work, we developed a workflow for computing phonons in MOFs within the quasi-harmonic approximation with a fine-tuned MACE model, MACE-MP-MOF0. The model was trained on a curated dataset of 127 representative and diverse MOFs. The fine-tuned MACE-MP-MOF0 improves the accuracy of phonon density of states and corrects the imaginary phonon modes of MACE-MP-0, enabling high-throughput phonon calculations with state-of-the-art precision. The model successfully predicts thermal expansion and bulk moduli in agreement with DFT and experimental data for several well-known MOFs. These results highlight the potential of MACE-MP-MOF0 in guiding MOF design for applications in energy storage and thermoelectrics.</description>

Abstract: Structure determination is essential to a mechanistic understanding of diseases and the development of novel therapeutics. Machine-learning-based structure prediction methods have made significant advancements by computationally predicting protein and bioassembly structures from sequences and molecular topology alone. Despite substantial progress in the field, challenges remain to deliver structure prediction models to real-world drug discovery. Here, we present NeuralPLexer3 -- a physics-inspired flow-based generative model that achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy on key biomolecular interaction types and improves training and sampling efficiency compared to its predecessors and alternative methodologies. Examined through newly developed benchmarking strategies, NeuralPLexer3 excels in vital areas that are crucial to structure-based drug design, such as physical validity and ligand-induced conformational changes.</description>
