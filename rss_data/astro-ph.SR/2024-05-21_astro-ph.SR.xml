      <title>Episodic mass loss in the very luminous red supergiant [W60] B90 in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into [W60] B90, one of the most luminous and extreme Red Supergiants (RSGs) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), aiming to search for evidence of episodic mass loss. Our discovery of a bar-like nebular structure at 1 pc, reminiscent of the bar around Betelgeuse, raised the question of whether [W60] B90 also has a bow shock. We collected and analyzed proper motion data from Gaia, as well as new multi-epoch spectroscopic and imaging data, and archival time-series photometry in the optical and mid-infrared. We found [W60] B90 to be a walkaway star, with a supersonic peculiar velocity in the direction of the bar. We detected shocked emission between the bar and the star, based on the [S II]/H$\alpha$ &gt; 0.4 criterion, providing strong evidence for a bow shock. The 30-year optical light curve revealed semi-regular variability, showing three similar dimming events with $\Delta V \sim 1$ mag, a recurrence of $\sim$12 yr, and a rise time of 400 d. We found the mid-IR light curve to vary by 0.51 mag and 0.37 mag in the WISE1 and WISE2 bands, respectively, and by 0.42 mag and 0.25 mag during the last dimming event. During this event, optical spectroscopy revealed spectral variability (M3I to M4I), a correlation between the $T_{\rm eff}$ and the brightness, increased extinction, and, after the minimum, spectral features incompatible with the models. We also found a difference of &gt;300 K between the $T_{\rm eff}$ measured from the TiO bands in the optical and the atomic lines from our $J$-band spectroscopy. We inferred that [W60] B90 is a more massive analog of Betelgeuse in the LMC and the first extragalactic single RSG with a suspected bow shock. Its high luminosity $\log(L/L_{\odot})=5.32$ dex, mass-loss rate, and mid-IR variability compared to other RSGs in the LMC, indicate that it is in an unstable evolutionary state undergoing episodes of mass loss.</description>

      <title>Hourglass Magnetic Field of a Protostellar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An hourglass-shaped magnetic field pattern arises naturally from the gravitational collapse of a star-forming gas cloud. Most studies have focused on the prestellar collapse phase, when the structure has a smooth and monotonic radial profile. However, most observations target dense clouds that already contain a central protostar, and possibly a circumstellar disk. We utilize an analytic treatment of the magnetic field along with insights gained from simulations to develop a more realistic magnetic field model for the protostellar phase. Key elements of the model are a strong radial magnetic field in the region of rapid collapse, an off-center peak in the magnetic field strength (a consequence of magnetic field dissipation in the circumstellar disk), and a strong toroidal field that is generated in the region of rapid collapse and outflow generation. A model with a highly pinched and twisted magnetic field pattern in the inner collapse zone facilitates the interpretation of magnetic field patterns observed in protostellar clouds.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Survey of Faint Planetary-Nebula Nuclei. V. The EGB 6-Type Central Star of Abell 57</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During our spectroscopic survey of central stars of faint planetary nebulae (PNe), we found that the nucleus of Abell 57 exhibits strong nebular emission lines. Using synthetic narrow-band images, we show that the emission arises from an unresolved compact emission knot (CEK) coinciding with the hot (90,000 K) central star. Thus Abell 57 belongs to the rare class of "EGB 6-type" PNe, characterized by dense emission cores. Photometric data show that the nucleus exhibits a near-IR excess, due to a dusty companion body with the luminosity of an M0 dwarf but a temperature of ~1800 K. Emission-line analysis reveals that the CEK is remarkably dense (electron density ~1.6x10**7 cm**-3), and has a radius of only ~4.5 AU. The CEK suffers considerably more reddening than the central star, which itself is more reddened than the surrounding PN. These puzzles may suggest an interaction between the knot and central star; however, Hubble Space Telescope imaging of EGB 6 itself shows that its CEK lies more than ~125 AU from the PN nucleus. We discuss a scenario in which a portion of the AGB wind that created the PN was captured into a dust cloud around a distant stellar companion; this cloud has survived to the present epoch, and has an atmosphere photoionized by radiation from the hot central star. However, in this picture EGB 6-type nuclei should be relatively common, yet they are actually extremely rare; thus they may arise from a different transitory phenomenon. We suggest future observations of Abell 57 that may help unravel its mysteries.</description>

      <title>Estimating Photometric Distances to Ultracool Dwarfs in Next Generation Space-based Infrared Surveys: Synthetic Photometry and New Absolute Magnitude Versus Spectral Type Relations for JWST, Euclid, and Roman Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We synthesize JWST NIRCam photometry for the F164N, F187N, F212N narrow filters, F140M, F162M, F182M, F210M medium filters, and F115W, F150W, F200W wide filters, Euclid Near Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) photometry for the $Y_E J_E H_E$ filters, and Roman Wide Field Instrument (WFI) photometry for the F106, F129, F146, F158, F184 and F213 filters using SpeX prism spectra and parallaxes of 688 field-age and 151 young ($\lesssim$ 200 Myr) ultracool dwarfs (spectral types M6-T9). We derive absolute magnitude-spectral type polynomial relations that enable the calculation of photometric distances for ultracool dwarfs observed with JWST, and to be observed with Euclid and Roman, in the absence of parallax measurements. Additionally, using the synthesized photometry to generate color-color figures can help distinguish high-redshift galaxies from brown dwarf interlopers in survey datasets. In particular, anticipating the upcoming Euclid Early Release Observations, we provide synthetic Euclid colors for ultracool dwarfs in our sample.</description>

      <title>The IACOB project: CVIII. Hunting for spectroscopic binaries in the O and B supergiant domain.The threat of pulsational variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations have definitively strengthened the long-standing assertion that binaries are crucial in massive star evolution. While the percentage of spectroscopic binary systems among main-sequence O stars is well-studied, other phases of massive star evolution remain less explored. We aim to estimate the spectroscopic binary fraction in Galactic late O- and B-type supergiants (OB-Sgs) and set empirical thresholds in radial velocity (RV) to avoid misidentifying pulsating stars as single-line spectroscopic binaries. Using over 4500 high-resolution spectra of 56 Galactic OB-Sgs (plus 13 O dwarfs/subgiants and 5 early-B giants) from the IACOB project (2008-2020), we apply Gaussian fitting and centroid computation techniques to measure RV for each spectrum. Our findings reveal that intrinsic variability in OB-Sgs can result in peak-to-peak RV amplitudes (RVpp) of up to 20-25 km/s, notably in late-O and early-B Sgs, and decreases to typical values of RVpp in the range of 1-5 km/s for O dwarfs and 2-15 km/s for late B-Sgs. Considering these results and evaluating line-profile variability in each star, we find that 10$\pm$4% of OB-Sgs are clearly single-line spectroscopic binaries. In addition, we find that the percentage of double-line spectroscopic binaries in late O- and early B-Sgs is ~6%, much lower than the ~30% in O-type dwarfs and giants. This study, along with prior research on B-Sgs in the 30 Doradus region of the LMC, indicates that the spectroscopic binary percentage decreases by a factor of 4-5 from O stars to B-Sgs. Our study underscores the need for a thorough characterization of spectroscopic variability due to intrinsic sources to reliably determine the spectroscopic binary fraction among OB-Sgs and O-type stars in general, offering valuable insights into the impact of binaries on massive star evolution.</description>

      <title>HCN as a probe of the inner disk in a candidate proto-brown dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of Keplerian rotation is rare among Class 0 protostellar systems. We have investigated the high-density tracer HCN as a probe of the inner disk in a Class 0 proto-brown dwarf candidate. Our ALMA high angular resolution observations show the peak in the HCN (3-2) line emission arises from a compact component near the proto-brown dwarf with a small bar-like structure and a deconvolved size of $\sim$50 au. Radiative transfer modelling indicates that this HCN feature is tracing the innermost, dense regions in the proto-brown dwarf where a small Keplerian disk is expected to be present. The limited velocity resolution of the observations, however, makes it difficult to confirm the rotational kinematics of this feature. A brightening in the HCN emission towards the core center suggests that HCN can survive in the gas phase in the inner, dense regions of the proto-brown dwarf. In contrast, modelling of the HCO$^{+}$ (3-2) line emission indicates that it originates from the outer pseudo-disk/envelope region and is centrally depleted. HCN line emission can reveal the small-scale structures and can be an efficient observational tool to study the inner disk properties in such faint compact objects where spatially resolving the disk is nearly impossible.</description>

      <title>PENELLOPE\,VI. -- Searching the PENELLOPE/UVES sample with spectro-astrometry: Two new microjets of Sz 103 and XX Cha</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of this study is to screen the PENELLOPE/UVES targets for outflow activity and find microjets via spectro-astrometry in, e.g., the [OI]$\lambda$6300 line. In total, 34 T\,Tauri stars of the PENELLOPE survey have been observed with the high resolution slit spectrograph UVES in three different slit positions rotated by $120^\text{o}$. Our spectro-astrometric analysis in the [OI]$\lambda$6300 wind line reveals two newly discovered microjets associated with Sz\,103 and XX\,Cha. Both microjets have an extent of about $0.04$ arcseconds, that is, $&lt;10\,\text{au}$, and we confined their orientation by the three slit observations. Furthermore, we confirm the binary nature of VW\,Cha and CVSO\,109. We present (further) evidence that DK\,Tau\,B and CVSO\,104\,A are spectroscopic binaries. Sz\,115 is tentatively a spectroscopic binary. The origin of the LVC, that is, MHD winds versus photoevaporative winds, of the Sz\,103 and XX\,Cha microjets remains unclear.</description>

      <title>Size of the accretion disc in the recurrent nova T CrB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high resolution (0.06 A/px) spectroscopic observations of the recurrent nova T Coronae Borealis obtained during the last 1.5 years (September 2022 -- January 2024), with the 2.0m RCC telecope of the Rozhen National Astronomical Observatory, Bulgaria. Double-peaked emission is visible in the H-alpha line after the end of the superactive state. We subtract the red giant contribution and measure the distance between the peaks ($\Delta v_a$) of the line. For the period July 2023 -- January 2024, we find that $\Delta v_a$ is in range $90 &lt; \Delta v_a &lt; 120$ km/s. Assuming that the emission is from the accretion disc around the white dwarf, we find average radius of the accretion disc $R_{disc} = 89 \pm 19$ R$_\odot$, which is approximately equal to the Roche lobe size of the white dwarf. Our results indicate that tidal torque plays an important role but that the disc can extend up to the Roche lobe of the accreting star.</description>

      <title>The population synthesis of Wolf-Rayet stars involving binary merger channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs) are very important massive stars. However, their origin and the observed binary fraction within the entire WR population are still debated. We investigate some possible merger channels for the formation of WRs, including main sequence (MS)/ Hertzsprung Gap (HG) + MS, He + HG/ Giant Branch (GB). We find that many products produced via binary merger can evolve into WRs, the MS/ HG + MS merger channel can explain WRs with luminosities higher than $\sim 10^{5.4}$\,L$_{\odot}$, while the He + HG/ GB merger channel can explain low-luminosity WRs in the range of $10^{4.7}$\,L$_{\odot}$\,$\sim$\,$10^{5.5}$\,L$_{\odot}$. In the population synthesis analysis of WRs, we assume an initial binary fraction ($f_{\rm ini,bin}$) of 50\% and 100\% for massive stars. We also assume that MS/ HG + MS merger products are non-rotating or rapidly rotating ($\omega/\omega_{\rm crit}=0.8$). In different cases, the calculated single fractions of WRs range from $22.2\%$ to $60.6\%$ in the Milky Way (MW) and from $8.3\%$ to $70.9\%$ in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The current observations fall within the range of our calculations. When the merger product of MS/HG+MS rotates rapidly, we estimate that there are approximately 1015 to 1396 WRs in the MW and 128 to 204 WRs in the LMC. Our model also roughly reproduces the observed single-peak luminosity distribution of WRs in the MW. However, the weak bimodal luminosity distribution observed in the LMC is not reproduced in our model. We assess that this may be due to the model underestimating the mass-loss rate in the LMC. In conclusion, we consider that the binary merger is significant formation channel for WR formation, and can explain the observed high fraction of the single WRs in the total population.</description>

      <title>Extreme Magnetic Field Modulus Variability of the Bp star HD 57372</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. In chemically peculiar Ap/Bp stars with large-scale organised magnetic fields with a simple centred dipole configuration, the ratio between the maximum and the minimum of the mean magnetic field modulus is of the order of 1.25. Values of 2 or more are observed only for very few Ap/Bp stars and are indicative of a very unusual magnetic field geometry. Aims. Determining the magnetic field structure of Ap/Bp stars is bound to provide a different insight into the physics and the origin of the magnetic fields in early-type stars. In this respect, the Bp star HD 57372 is of particular interest because strongly variable magnetically split lines are observed in HARPS and APOGEE spectra. Methods. We obtained and analysed measurements of the mean magnetic field modulus and of the mean longitudinal magnetic field using near-infrared spectra and optical polarimetric spectra distributed over the stellar rotation period. Results. The mean magnetic field modulus &lt;B&gt; of HD 57372, as estimated from absorption lines that are split via the Zeeman effect and resolved in both optical and near-infrared spectra, is found to vary by an extraordinary amount of about 10 kG. The exceptional value of 3 for the ratio between the maximum and the minimum of the field modulus is indicative of a very unusual geometry of HD 57372's magnetic field. All observable quantities are found to vary in phase with the photometric period of 7.889 days. This includes the longitudinal magnetic field &lt;Bz&gt;, which varies from -6 kG up to 1.7 kG in FORS2 spectra as well as the metal line strengths, whose equivalent widths change by up to 50% of their mean values over the course of the rotation period. The B8 temperature class of HD 57372 also places it among the hottest stars known to exhibit resolved, magnetically split lines.</description>

      <title>Photometric analysis of the dwarf nova SU UMa based on TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the photometric analysis of SU UMa based on the observations of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). TESS has released a large amount of data, which contains the light curves of a complete superoutburst and three normal outbursts of SU UMa. Based on the observations, the evolution of superhumps during the superoutburst was analyzed. By using the O - C method, the three stages were determined, and the superhump period for each stage was calculated. The mass ratio $q=0.137 (1)$ was estimated based on the stage A superhump method. A periodic oscillation with a period of 2.17(9) days was found in the superhump minimum O - C diagram, which is related to the precession of the accretion disk. We investigated the frequency information of quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) in the light curves. An ultralong period QPO of 0.18 days at the time of normal outburst and two ultralong periods QPOs of 0.19 days and 0.285 days in quiescence were found. No QPO was found in the superoutburst.</description>

      <title>Investigation of superhumps in SU UMa-type dwarf novae based on the observations of TESS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the superhumps analysis of seven SU UMa-type dwarf novae based on the observations of Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Superhumps are seen during superoutbursts of SU UMa-type dwarf novae. The month-long data sets of TESS are well suited for studying the variation of superhumps. We selected seven non-eclipsing SU UMa-type dwarf novae with superhumps in which TESS light curves are available and have not yet been studied. The stages A, B, and C of superhumps in superoutbursts were determined by O-C method. The results indicate that not all complete superoutbursts show obvious three stages, such as DT Oct and the second superoutburst of J1730+6247. We calculated the superhump periods for each stage and the mean periods for whole superoutbursts. Taking the stage A superhump method, the mass ratios (M2/M1) were estimated. According to the results, the seven stars are pre-bounce systems with mass ratios ranging from 0.1 to 0.2. By combining the orbital periods and the mean superhump periods, the precession periods were calculated. The results show that the precession periods of the seven SU UMa stars are about 2 days.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the stellar mass function and the binary fraction of 114 nearby open clusters (OCs) using the high-precision photometric data from Gaia Data Release 3 (Gaia DR3). We estimated the mass of member stars by using a ridge line (RL) that is better in line with the observed color-magnitude diagram (CMD), thus obtaining more accurate stellar mass and binary mass ratio ($q$) at the low-mass region. By analyzing the present-day mass function (PDMF) of star clusters, we found that 108 OCs follow a two-stage power-law distribution, whereas 6 OCs present a single power-law PDMF. Subsequently, we fitted the high(low)-mass index of PDMF ($dN/dm \propto m^{-\alpha}$), denoted as $\alpha_{\rm h}$($\alpha_{\rm l}$), and segmentation point $m_{\rm c}$. For our cluster sample, the median values of $\alpha_{\rm h}$ and $\alpha_{\rm l}$ are 2.65 and 0.95, respectively, which are approximately consistent with the initial mass function (IMF) results provided by Kroupa (2001). We utilized the cumulative radial number distribution of stars with different masses to quantify the degree of mass segregation. We found a significant positive correlation between the state of dynamical evolution and mass segregation in OCs. We also estimated the fraction of binary stars with $q \geq 0.5$, ranging from 6% to 34% with a median of 17%. Finally, we provided a catalog of 114 nearby cluster properties, including the total mass, the binary fraction, the PDMF, and the dynamical state.</description>

      <title>The global structure of astrospheres: effect of Knudsen number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between stellar winds and the partially ionized local interstellar medium (LISM) is quite common in astrophysics. However, the main difficulty in describing the neutral components lies in the fact that the mean free path of an interstellar atom, l, can be comparable to the characteristic size of an astrosphere, L (i.e., the Knudsen number, which is equal to l/L, is approximately equal to 1, as in the case of the heliosphere). In such cases, a single-fluid approximation becomes invalid, and a kinetic description must be used for the neutral component. In this study, we consider a general astrosphere and use a kinetic-gas dynamics model to investigate how the global structure of the astrosphere depends on the Knudsen number. We present numerical results covering an extremely wide range of Knudsen numbers (from 0.0001 to 100). Additionally, we explore the applicability of single-fluid approaches for modeling astrospheres of various sizes. We have excluded the influence of interstellar and stellar magnetic fields in our model to make parametric study of the kinetic effects feasible. The main conclusion of this work is that, for large astrospheres (with a distance to the bow shock greater than 600 AU) a heated rarefied plasma layer forms in the outer shock layer near the astropause. The formation of this layer is linked to localized heating of the plasma by atoms (specifically, ENAs) that undergo charge exchange again behind the astropause. This process significantly alters the flow structure in the outer shock layer and the location of the bow shock, and it cannot be described by a single-fluid model. Additionally, this paper discusses how atoms weaken the bow shocks at near-heliospheric conditions.</description>

      <title>Constraining the helium-to-metal enrichment ratio $\Delta Y/\Delta Z$ from main sequence binary stars. Theoretical analysis of the accuracy and precision of the age and helium abundance estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the theoretical possibility of accurately determining the helium-to-metal enrichment ratio $\Delta Y/\Delta Z$ from precise observations of double lined eclipsing binary systems. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we drew synthetic binary systems with masses between 0.85 and 1.00 $M_{\odot}$ from a grid of stellar models with $\Delta Y/\Delta Z = 2.0$ [...]. Subsequently, a broader grid with $\Delta Y/\Delta Z$ from 1.0 to 3.0 was used in the fitting process. To account for observational uncertainties, two scenarios were explored: S1 with realistic uncertainties of 100 K in temperature and 0.1 dex in [Fe/H], and S2 with halved uncertainties. We repeated the simulation at two baseline metallicities: [Fe/H] = 0.0 and -0.3. The posterior distributions of $\Delta Y/\Delta Z$ were severely biased towards the edge of the allowable range in the S1 errors scenario. The situation only marginally improved when considering the S2 scenario. The effect is due to the impact of changing $\Delta Y/\Delta Z$ in the stellar effective temperature and its interplay with [Fe/H] observational error, and it is therefore not restricted to the specific fitting method. Despite the presence of these systematic discrepancies, the age of the systems were recovered unbiased with 10% precision. Our findings indicate that the observational uncertainty in effective temperature and metallicity significantly hinders the accurate determination of the $\Delta Y/\Delta Z$ parameter from main sequence binary systems.</description>

      <title>SiO maser polarization and magnetic field in evolved cool stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both magnetic fields and photospheric/atmospheric dynamics can be involved in triggering the important mass loss observed in evolved cool stars. Previous works have revealed that these objects exhibit a magnetic field extending beyond their surface. The origin of this magnetic field is still under debate with mechanisms involving a turbulent dynamo, convection, stellar pulsation, and cool spots. Our goal is to estimate the magnetic field strength in the inner circumstellar envelope of six evolved cool stars (five Miras and one Red Supergiant). Combining this work with previous studies, we tentatively constrain the global magnetic field type observed and shed light on the mechanisms at its origin. Using the XPOL polarimeter installed at the IRAM-30 m telescope, we observed the 28 SiO v = 1, J = 2-1 maser line emission and obtained simultaneous spectroscopic measurements of the four Stokes parameters. Applying a careful calibration method for Stokes Q, U, and V, we derive estimates of the magnetic field strength from the circular and linear polarization fractions considering the saturated and unsaturated maser cases under the Zeeman hypothesis. Magnetic field strengths from several Gauss up to several tens of Gauss are derived. These new and more accurate measurements constraining the field strength in the 2-5 stellar radii region better than previous studies and seem to exclude a global poloidal magnetic field type. A combination of a toroidal and a poloidal field is nevertheless not excluded. A variation of the magnetic field strength over a two-months timescale is observed in one Mira star which suggests a possible link to the stellar phase, i.e. with pulsation/photospheric activity.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismic measurement of core and envelope rotation rates for 2006 red giant branch stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tens of thousands of red giant stars in the Kepler data exhibit solar-like oscillations. Their oscillations enable us to study the internal physics from core to surface, such as differential rotation. However, envelope rotation rates have been measured for only a dozen RGB stars so far. The limited sample hinders the theoretical interpretation of angular momentum transport in post-main-sequence phases. We apply a new approach to calculate the asymptotic frequencies of mixed modes, which accounts for the so-called near-degeneracy effects and leads to more proper measurements of envelope rotation rates. By fitting these asymptotic expressions to the observations, we obtain measurements of the properties of g modes and mean core and envelope rotation rates. Among 2495 stars with clear mixed-mode patterns, we found that 800 show doublets and 1206 show triplets, doubling the size of pre-existing catalogues. This led us to discover an over-density of stars that narrowly distribute around a well-defined ridge in the plane showing core rotation rate versus evolution along the RGB. With this work, we also increase the sample of stars with measured envelope rotation rates by two orders of magnitude. We find a decreasing trend between envelope rotation rates and evolution, implying that the envelopes slow down with expansion, as expected. We find 243 stars whose envelope rotation rates are significantly larger than zero. For these stars, the core-to-envelope rotation ratios are around 20 and show a large spread with evolution. Several stars show extremely mild differential rotations, with core-to-surface ratios between 1 and 2. These stars also have very slow core rotation rates, suggesting that they go through a peculiar rotational evolution. We also discovered more stars located below the degeneracy sequence, which will provide the opportunity to study the history of possible stellar mergers.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of Eclipsing Compact Hierarchical Triples I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eclipsing Compact Hierarchical Triples (ECHTs) are systems with the tertiary star orbiting an eclipsing binary (EB) in an orbit of fewer than 1000 days. In a CHT, all three stars exist in a space less than 5 AU in separation. A low-mass CHT is an interesting case to understand multiple star and planet formation at such small scales. In this study, we combine spectroscopy and photometry to estimate the orbital, stellar and atmospheric parameters of stars in a sample of CHTs. Using the complete set of parameters we aim to constrain the metallicity and age of the systems. We use time-series spectroscopy to obtain radial velocities (RVs) and disentangled spectra. Using RV modelling, EB light curve modelling, and spectral analysis, we estimated the metallicities and temperatures. Using isochrone fitting, we constrain the ages of the system. We then combine observations of masses, outer eccentricities (e_2), orbital periods and age estimates of the systems from the literature. We compare the distributions of e_2, and tertiary mass ratio, q_3 = M_3/(M_1+M_2), for three different metallicity ranges and two ranges of age. We estimate masses, radii, temperatures, metallicities and age of 12 stars in 4 CHTs. The CHT CD-32 6459 shows signs of von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations while CD-62 1257 can evolve to form a triple common envelope. The rest of the CHTs are old and have an M-dwarf tertiary. We find that the q_3 distribution for CHTs with sub-solar metallicity has a uniform distribution but the systems with solar and above-solar metallicity peak between 0.5 and 1. When dividing them according to their ages, we found the q_3 of old systems around 0.5. The eccentricity e_2 favours a value around 0.3 irrespective of metallicity or age. The distributions are biased by the lack of observations and observing methods and therefore call for more observations of low-mass CHT.</description>

      <title>Modeling Magnetic Flux Emergence in Bipolar Active Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active regions (ARs) appear in the solar atmosphere as a consequence of the emergence of magnetic flux-ropes (FR). In this study, we use Bayesian methods to analyze line-of-sight magnetograms of emerging ARs. We employ a FR model consisting of a half-torus field structure based on eight parameters. The goal is to derive constrained physical parameters of the originating FR which are consistent with the observations. Specifically, we aim to obtain a precise estimation of the AR tilt angle and magnetic twist at different stages of the emergence process. To achieve this, we propose four temporal methods that correlate the field parameter evolutions with a single coherent FR. These methods differ from each other in the size of the explored parameter space. We test the methods on four bipolar ARs observed with the Michelson Doppler Imager on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory. We find that tilt angles are typically consistent between the temporal methods, improving previous estimations at all stages of the emergence. The twist sign derived from the temporal methods is consistent with previous estimations. The standard errors of all the methods used are similar, indicating that they model the observations equally well. These results indicate that the proposed methods can be used to obtain global magnetic parameters of ARs during their early evolution. The derived parameters contribute to a better understanding of the formation of FRs, and the role of ARs in the magnetic recycling process along the solar cycle.</description>

      <title>Run-away transition to turbulent strong-field dynamo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planets and stars are able to generate coherent large-scale magnetic fields by helical convective motions in their interiors. This process, known as hydromagnetic dynamo, involves nonlinear interaction between the flow and magnetic field. Nonlinearity facilitates existence of bi-stable dynamo branches: a weak field branch where the magnetic field is not strong enough to enter into the leading order force balance in the momentum equation at large flow scales, and a strong field branch where the field enters into this balance. The transition between the two with enhancement of convection can be either subcritical or supercritical, depending on the strength of magnetic induction. In both cases, it is accompanied by topological changes in velocity field across the system; however, it is yet unclear how these changes are produced. In this work, we analyse transitions between the weak and strong dynamo regimes using a data-driven approach, separating different physical effects induced by dynamically active flow scales. Using Dynamic Mode Decomposition, we decompose the dynamo data from direct numerical simulations into different components (modes), identify the ones relevant for transition, and estimate relative magnitudes of their contributions Lorentz force and induction term. Our results suggest that subcritical transition to a strong dynamo is facilitated by a subharmonic instability, allowing for a more efficient mode of convection, and provide a modal basis for reduced-order models of this transition.</description>

      <title>Simulations of Interacting Binary Systems -- Pathways to Radio Bright GRB Progenitors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the association of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with massive stellar death is on firm footing, the nature of the progenitor system and the key ingredients required for a massive star to produce a gamma-ray burst remain open questions. Here, we investigate the evolution of a massive star with a closely orbiting compact object companion using the stellar evolution code MESA. In particular, we examine how the companion influences the angular momentum and circumstellar environment near the end of the massive star life. We find that tidal effects can cause the compact object companion to significantly increase the angular momentum of the massive star, for orbital periods in the range of up to $\sim 4$ days. We model the density profile evolution of the massive star and discuss how tidal interactions may also lead to stripping of the outer stellar envelope in a way that can create an environment around the binary system that deviates from a typical $1/r^{2}$ wind density profile. We show how our results depend on the metallicity of the system, initial spin of the star, mass ratio, as well as accretion and dynamo prescriptions in the simulations. We conclude that these systems may be viable progenitors for radio-bright, long gamma-ray bursts.</description>

Abstract: The paper utilizes data from the SuperKamiokande solar neutrino detection experiment and analyses them by diffusion entropy analysis and standard deviation analysis. The result indicates that solar neutrinos are subject to Levy flights (anomalous diffusion, superdiffusion). Subsequently, the paper derives the probability density function, represented as Fox H-function, and the governing fractional diffusion equation (fractional Fokker-Planck Equation) for solar neutrino Levy flights.</description>

      <title>The Empirical and Radiative Transfer Hybrid (EaRTH) Disk Model: Merging Analyses of Protoplanetary Dust Disk Mineralogy and Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our understanding of how exoplanets form and evolve relies on analyses of both the mineralogy of protoplanetary disks and their detailed structures; however, these key complementary aspects of disks are usually studied separately. We present initial results from a hybrid model that combines the empirical characterization of the mineralogy of a disk, as determined from its mid-infrared spectral features, with the MCFOST radiative transfer disk model, a combination we call the EaRTH Disk Model. With the results of the mineralogy detection serving as input to the radiative transfer model, we generate mid-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) that reflect both the mineralogical and structural parameters of the corresponding disk. Initial fits of the SED output by the resulting integrated model to Spitzer Space T elescope mid-infrared (IRS) spectra of the protoplanetary disk orbiting the nearby T Tauri star MP Mus demonstrate the potential advantages of this approach by revealing details like the dominance of micron-sized olivine and micron-sized forsterite in this dusty disk. The simultaneous insight into disk composition and structure provided by the EaRTH Disk methodology should be directly applicable to the interpretation of mid-infrared spectra of protoplanetary disks that will be produced by the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Spectral Difference method with a posteriori limiting: II- Application to low Mach number flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar convection poses two main gargantuan challenges for astrophysical fluid solvers: low-Mach number flows and minuscule perturbations over steeply stratified hydrostatic equilibria. Most methods exhibit excessive numerical diffusion and are unable to capture the correct solution due to large truncation errors. In this paper, we analyze the performance of the Spectral Difference (SD) method under these extreme conditions using an arbitrarily high-order shock capturing scheme with a posteriori limiting. We include both a modification to the HLLC Riemann solver adapted to low Mach number flows (L-HLLC) and a well-balanced scheme to properly evolve perturbations over steep equilibrium solutions. We evaluate the performance of our method using a series of test tailored specifically for stellar convection. We observe that our high-order SD method is capable of dealing with very subsonic flows without necessarily using the modified Riemann solver. We find however that the well-balanced framework is unavoidable if one wants to capture accurately small amplitude convective and acoustic modes. Analyzing the temporal and spatial evolution of the turbulent kinetic energy, we show that our fourth-order SD scheme seems to emerge as an optimal variant to solve this difficult numerical problem.</description>

      <title>Peculiarities of the chemical enrichment of metal-poor Stars in the Milky Way Galaxy</title>

Abstract: The oldest stars in the Milky Way are metal-poor with [Fe/H] &lt; -- 1.0, displaying peculiar elemental abundances compared to solar values. The relative variations in the chemical compositions among stars is also increasing with decreasing stellar metallicity, allowing for the pure signature of unique nucleosynthesis processes to be revealed. In this work, we report the atmospheric parameters, main dynamic properties, and the abundances of four metal-poor stars: HE 1523--0901, HD 6268, HD 121135, and HD 195636 (--1.5 &gt; [Fe/H] &gt;--3.0). The abundances were derived from spectra obtained with the HRS echelle spectrograph at the SALT, using both LTE and NLTE approaches. Based on their kinematical properties, we show that HE 1523--0901 and HD 195636 are halo stars with typical high velocities. In particular, HD 121135 displays a peculiar kinematical behaviour, making it unclear whether it is a halo or an accreted star. Furthermore, HD 6268 is possibly a rare prototype of very metal-poor thick disk stars. The abundances derived for our stars are compared with theoretical stellar models and with other stars with similar metallicity values from the literature. HD 121135 is Al-poor and Sc-poor, compared to stars observed in the same metallicity range (--1.62 &gt; [Fe/H] &gt;--1.12). The most metal-poor stars in our sample, HE 1523 -- 0901, HD 6268, and HD 195636, exhibit anomalies that are better explained by supernova models from fast-rotating stellar progenitors for elements up to the Fe group. Compared to other stars in the same metallicity range, their common biggest anomaly is represented by the low Sc abundances. If we consider the elements beyond Zn, HE 1523--0901 can be classified as an r-II star, HD 6268 as an r-I candidate, and HD 195636 and HD 121135 exhibiting a borderline r-process enrichment between limited-r and r-I star.</description>

Abstract: We present an analysis of the chemical compositions in high-redshift galaxies, with a focus on the nitrogen-enhanced galaxies GN-z11 and CEERS-1019. We use stellar models of massive stars with initial masses ranging from 9 to 120 Msol across various metallicities to deduce the chemical abundances of stellar ejecta for a few light elements (H, He, C, N, O). Our study reveals insights into the chemical processes and elemental synthesis in the early universe. We find that Population III stars, particularly at initial fast equatorial rotation and sampled from a top-heavy initial mass function, as well as stars at Z=10^{-5} with moderate rotation, align closely with observed abundance ratios in GN-z11 and CEERS-1019. These models demonstrate log(N/O) = -0.38, log(C/O) =-0.22 and log(O/H) + 12 = 7.82 at dilution factors of f = 20~100, indicating a good match with observational data. Models at higher metallicities do not match these observations, highlighting the unique role of Population III and extremely metal-poor stars in enhancing nitrogen abundance in high-redshift galaxies. Predictions for other abundance ratios, such as log(He/H) ranging from -1.077 to -1.059 and log{(^{12}C/^{13}C)} from 1.35 to 2.42, provide detailed benchmarks for future observational studies.</description>

Abstract: Needed for cosmological and stellar nucleosynthesis, we are studying the closed-form analytic evaluation of thermonuclear reaction rates. In this context, we undertake a comprehensive analysis of three distinct velocity distributions, namely the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, the pathway distribution, and the Mittag-Leffer distribution. We emphasize the utilization of Meijer G-function and Fox H-function which are special functions of mathematical physics.</description>

      <title>Strong magnetic field inside degenerate relativistic plasma and the impacts on the neutrino transport in Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impacts of magnetic field on the neutrino transport inside core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Magnetic field quantizes the momentum of electrons and positrons, resulting in the modification of weak-interaction cross sections and the chemical potentials of electrons and positrons. We include these changes in the leakage scheme of neutrino transport and perform 1D CCSN simulations with GR1D, assuming the postbounce magnetic field strength of $10^{16-17}$ G. The results show that the neutrino opacities are enhanced due to the amplified interaction rates, resulting in a larger neutrinosphere. This further reduces the peak value of neutrino luminosities and their decay rates since neutrinos stay longer inside the neutrinosphere. Meanwhile, the neutrino mean energies are smaller shortly after bounce and reach their peak values at later times. As these neutrino properties are crucial in subsequent nucleosynthesis processes, including the $\nu$p-process, $\nu$-process, and $r$-process, our findings suggest that the magnetic field may leave discernible marks on the abundance pattern of nucleosynthesis in CCSN.</description>

      <title>The efficiency of black hole formation via collisions in stellar systems: An analysis of data from simulations and observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the theoretical relation between star clusters and black holes within, focusing on the potential role of Nuclear Star Clusters (NSCs), Globular Clusters (GCs), and Ultra Compact Dwarf Galaxies (UCDs) as environments that lead to black hole formation through stellar collisions. The study aims to identify optimal conditions for stellar collisions in different stellar systems leading to the formation of very massive stars that subsequently collapse into black holes. Data from numerical simulations and observations of diverse stellar systems are analyzed, encompassing various initial conditions, initial mass functions, and stellar evolution scenarios. We compute a critical mass, determined by the interplay of collision time, system age, and initial properties of the star cluster. The efficiency of black hole formation ($\epsilon_{\mathrm{BH}}$) is defined as the ratio of initial stellar mass divided by critical mass. The study finds out that stellar systems with a ratio of initial stellar mass over critical mass above 1 exhibit high efficiencies of black hole formation, ranging from $30-100\%$. While there is some scatter, potentially attributed to complex system histories and the presence of gas, the results highlight the potential for achieving high efficiencies through a purely collisional channel in black hole formation. In conclusion, this theoretical exploration elucidates the connection between star clusters and black hole formation. The study underscores the significance of UCDs, GCs, and NSCs as environments conducive to stellar collisions leading to black hole formation. The defined black hole formation efficiency ($\epsilon_{\mathrm{BH}}$) is shown to be influenced by the ratio of initial stellar mass to critical mass.</description>

      <title>Investigating stellar activity through eight years of Sun-as-a-star observations</title>

Abstract: Stellar magnetic activity induces both distortions and Doppler-shifts in the absorption line profiles of Sun-like stars. Those effects produce apparent radial velocity (RV) signals which greatly hamper the search for potentially habitable, Earth-like planets. In this work, we investigate these distortions in the Sun using cross-correlation functions (CCFs), derived from intensive monitoring with the high-precision spectrograph HARPS-N. We show that the RV signal arising from line-shape variations on time-scales associated with the solar rotation and activity cycle can be robustly extracted from the data, reducing the RV dispersion by half. Once these have been corrected, activity-induced Doppler-shifts remain, that are modulated at the solar rotation period, and that are most effectively modelled in the time domain, using Gaussian Processes (GPs). Planet signatures are still best retrieved with multi-dimensonal GPs, when activity is jointly modelled from the raw RVs and indicators of the line width or of the Ca II H and K emission. After GP modelling, the residual RVs exhibit a dispersion of 0.6-0.8 m/s, likely to be dominated by signals induced by super-granulation. Finally, we find that the statistical properties of the RVs evolve significantly over time, and that this evolution is primarily driven by sunspots, which control the smoothness of the signal. Such evolution, which reduces the sensitivity to long-period planet signatures, is no longer seen in the activity-induced Doppler-shifts, which is promising for long term RV monitoring surveys such as the Terra Hunting Experiment or the PLATO follow-up campaign.</description>

      <title>Are Lithium-Rich Giants Binaries?: A Radial Velocity Variability Analysis of 1,400 Giants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-mass giants with large amounts of lithium (Li) have challenged stellar evolution for decades. One of the possibilities usually discussed to explain them involves the interaction with a close binary companion. This predicts that when compared against their non-enriched counterparts, Li-rich giants should preferentially be found as part of binary systems. In order to test this scenario, we assemble a sample of 1418 giants with radial velocities (RVs) from RAVE, GALAH, and Gaia, as well as stellar parameters and Li abundances from GALAH. Evolutionary states can be determined for 1030 of these giants. We develop a method that quantifies the degree of RV variability, which we use as a proxy for close binary companions. The method is tested and calibrated against samples of known RV standard stars and known spectroscopic binaries. We also compare the results of our RV variability analysis with binarity indicators from Gaia. We find that the accuracy of the classification is controlled by the precision of the RVs, which for the set of RVs available for the giants is 80-85%. Consistent with seismic studies, the resulting sample of giants contains a fraction of Li-rich objects in the red clump (RC) that is twice as large as that for first-ascent giants (RGB). Among RC giants, the fractions of Li-rich objects with high RV variability and with no RV variability are the same as those for Li-normal objects, which argues against a binary interaction scenario for the genesis of the bulk of Li-rich giants at that evolutionary stage. On the other hand, Li-rich giants in the RGB appear to have a small but detectable preference for higher RV variability, and thus possibly a larger close binary fraction, than the Li-normal giants at that stage. Additional measurements of the RVs of these giants at higher RV precision would greatly help confirm and more robustly quantify these results.</description>

      <title>Photo-ionization structures of Planetary Nebula IC 2003 with [WR] central star</title>

Abstract: We present ionization structures of IC 2003, a planetary nebula with [WR] central star, using a 1-D dusty photo-ionization code: "CLOUDY 17.03". The photo-ionization model is constrained by archival UV emission line fluxes, medium-resolution optical spectroscopy, $IRAS$ $25 \mu m$ flux, absolute $H\beta$ flux, and the mean angular size of the nearly spherical optical nebula. To constrain the carbon abundance and the effect of photo-electric heating in the ionized gas, we used UV emission lines. We considered an amorphous carbon dust grain with MRN and KMH size distributions to address the importance of photo-electric heating in the ionized nebula. We show that KMH grain size distribution with quantum dust heating reproduces the observations quite well. We construct the ionization structures of different elements at their different ionization stages in the nebula. We derive the physical properties of the planetary nebula and its chemical composition, as well as the parameters of its central star. The estimated nebular dust-to-gas mass ratio is $2.37\times 10^{-3}$, and the enhanced photo-electric heating yielded by small dust grains is $9.4\%$ of the total heating. We considered the H-poor model atmosphere for the central star; the effective temperature of the central star is 177kK, the specific gravity log(g) is 6, and its luminosity ($L_*$) is 6425 $L_\odot$. The derived central star parameters plotted on stellar evolutionary tracks correspond to a central star mass of 0.636$M_\odot $ and to a progenitor mass of 3.26$M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Stellar X-ray activity and habitability revealed by ROSAT sky survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the homogeneous X-ray catalog from ROSAT observations, we conducted a comprehensive investigation into stellar X-ray activity-rotation relations for both single and binary stars. Generally, the relation for single stars consists of two distinct regions: a weak decay region, indicating a continued dependence of the magnetic dynamo on stellar rotation rather than a saturation regime with constant activity, and a rapid decay region, where X-ray activity is strongly correlated with the Rossby number. Detailed analysis reveals more fine structures within the relation: in the extremely fast rotating regime, a decrease in X-ray activity was observed with increasing rotation rate, referred to as super-saturation, while in the extremely slow rotating region, the relation flattens, mainly due to the scattering of F stars. This scattering may result from intrinsic variability in stellar activities over one stellar cycle or the presence of different dynamo mechanisms. Binaries exhibit a similar relation to that of single stars while the limited sample size prevented the identification of fine structures in the relation for binaries. We calculated the mass loss rates of planetary atmosphere triggered by X-ray emissions from host stars. Our findings indicate that for an Earth-like planet within the stellar habitable zone, it would easily lose its entire primordial H/He envelope (equating to about 1% of the planetary mass).</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Waves Driving Variability and Cloud Modulation on a Planetary-Mass Object</title>

Abstract: Planetary-mass objects and brown dwarfs at the transition ($\rm{T}_{eff}\sim1300$\,K) from relatively red L dwarfs to bluer mid-T dwarfs show enhanced spectrophotometric variability. Multi-epoch observations support atmospheric planetary-scale (Kelvin or Rossby) waves as the primary source of this variability; however, large spots associated with the precipitation of silicate and metal clouds have also been theorized and suggested by Doppler imaging. We applied both wave and spotted models to fit near-infrared (NIR), multi-band ($Y$/$J$/$H$/$K$) photometry of SIMP\,J013656.5+093347 (hereafter SIMP0136), collected at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope using the Wide-field InfraRed Camera. SIMP0136 is a planetary-mass object (12.7$\pm1.0 \ \rm{M_J}$) at the L/T transition (T2$\pm0.5$) known to exhibit light curve evolution over multiple rotational periods. We measure the maximum peak-to-peak variability of $6.17\pm0.46\%$, $6.45\pm0.33\%$, $6.51\pm0.42\%$, and $4.33\pm0.38\%$ in the $Y$, $J$, $H$, and $K$ bands respectively, and find evidence that wave models are preferred for all four NIR bands. Furthermore, we determine the spot size necessary to reproduce the observed variations is larger than the Rossby deformation radius and Rhines scale, which is unphysical. Through the correlation between light curves produced by the waves and associated color variability, we find evidence of planetary-scale, wave-induced cloud modulation and breakup, similar to Jupiter's atmosphere and supported by general circulation models. We also detect a $93.8^{\circ}\pm7.4^{\circ}$ ($12.7\sigma$) phase shift between the $H-K$ and $J-H$ color time series, providing evidence for complex vertical cloud structure in SIMP0136's atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Observing the Galactic Underworld: Predicting photometry and astrometry from compact remnant microlensing events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14612v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Isolated black holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs) are largely undetectable across the electromagnetic spectrum. For this reason, our only real prospect of observing these isolated compact remnants is via microlensing; a feat recently performed for the first time. However, characterisation of the microlensing events caused by BHs and NSs is still in its infancy. In this work, we perform N-body simulations to explore the frequency and physical characteristics of microlensing events across the entire sky. Our simulations find that every year we can expect $88_{-6}^{+6}$ BH, $6.8_{-1.6}^{+1.7}$ NS and $20^{+30}_{-20}$ stellar microlensing events which cause an astrometric shift larger than 2~mas. Similarly, we can expect $21_{-3}^{+3}$ BH, $18_{-3}^{+3}$ NS and $7500_{-500}^{+500}$ stellar microlensing events which cause a bump magnitude larger than 1~mag. Leveraging a more comprehensive dynamical model than prior work, we predict the fraction of microlensing events caused by BHs as a function of Einstein time to be smaller than previously thought. Comparison of our microlensing simulations to events in Gaia finds good agreement. Finally, we predict that in the combination of Gaia and GaiaNIR data there will be $14700_{-900}^{+600}$ BH and $1600_{-200}^{+300}$ NS events creating a centroid shift larger than 1~mas and $330_{-120}^{+100}$ BH and $310_{-100}^{+110}$ NS events causing bump magnitudes $&gt; 1$. Of these, $&lt;10$ BH and $5_{-5}^{+10}$ NS events should be detectable using current analysis techniques. These results inform future astrometric mission design, such as GaiaNIR, as they indicate that, compared to stellar events, there are fewer observable BH events than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Remnant masses from 1D+ core-collapse supernovae simulations: bimodal neutron star mass distribution and black holes in the low-mass gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The explosion of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is an extremely challenging problem, and there are still large uncertainties regarding which stars lead to successful explosions that leave behind a neutron star, and which ones will form a black hole instead. In this paper, we simulate 341 progenitors at three different metallicities using spherically symmetric simulations that include neutrino-driven convection via a mixing-length theory. We use these simulations to improve previously derived explosion criteria based on the density and entropy profiles of the pre-supernova progenitor. We also provide numerical fits to calculate the final mass of neutron stars based on either compactness, the location of the Si/Si-O interface, or the Chandrasekhar mass. The neutron star birth mass distribution derived from our 1D+ simulations is bimodal, contrary to what the most popular 1D CCSN simulations have shown so far. We compare the theoretically derived neutron star mass distributions with the observed ones and discuss potential implications for population synthesis studies. We also analyze the black hole mass distribution predicted by our simulations. To be consistent with current models of matter ejection in failed SNe, a large fraction of the envelope must be expelled, leading to small black holes in the low-mass gap. One black hole in this mass region has recently been observed in the GW230529 event by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. Our results naturally agree with this detection, which the most popular prescriptions for explodability and remnant masses are not able to reproduce. In general, we find that the explosion outcome and mass of the remnant strongly depend on the pre-collapse structure of the progenitor. However, their dependence on the initial mass of the star and the mass of the CO core is highly uncertain and non-linear.</description>
