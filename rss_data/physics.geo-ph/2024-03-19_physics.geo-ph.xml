      <title>Mitigation and optimization of induced seismicity using physics-based forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid injection can induce seismicity by altering stresses on pre-existing faults. Here, we investigate minimizing induced seismic hazard by optimizing injection operations in a physics-based forecasting framework. We built a 3D finite element model of the poroelastic crust for the Raton Basin, Central US, and used it to estimate time dependent Coulomb stress changes due to ~25 years of wastewater injection in the region. Our finite element model is complemented by a statistical analysis of the seismogenic index (SI), a proxy for critically stressed faults affected by variations in the pore pressure. Forecasts of seismicity rate from our hybrid physics-based statistical model suggest that induced seismicity in the Raton Basin, from 2001 - 2022, is still driven by wastewater injection. Our model suggests that pore pressure diffusion is the dominant cause of Coulomb stress changes at seismogenic depth, with poroelastic stress changes contributing about 5% to the driving force. Linear programming optimization for the Raton Basin reveals that it is feasible to reduce seismic hazard for a given amount of injected fluid (safety objective) or maximize fluid injection for a prescribed seismic hazard (economic objective). The optimization tends to spread out high-rate injectors and shift them to regions of lower SI. The framework has practical importance as a tool to manage injection rate per unit field area to reduce induced seismic hazard. Our optimization framework is both flexible and adaptable to mitigate induced seismic hazard in other regions and for other types of subsurface fluid injection.</description>

      <title>Potential of Domain Adaptation in Machine Learning in Ecology and Hydrology to Improve Model Extrapolability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the heterogeneity of the global distribution of ecological and hydrological ground-truth observations, machine learning models can have limited adaptability when applied to unknown locations, which is referred to as weak extrapolability. Domain adaptation techniques have been widely used in machine learning domains such as image classification, which can improve the model generalization ability by adjusting the difference or inconsistency of the domain distribution between the training and test sets. However, this approach has rarely been used explicitly in machine learning models in ecology and hydrology at the global scale, although these models have often been questioned due to geographic extrapolability issues. This paper briefly describes the shortcomings of current machine learning models of ecology and hydrology in terms of the global representativeness of the distribution of observations and the resulting limitations of the lack of extrapolability and suggests that future related modelling efforts should consider the use of domain adaptation techniques to improve extrapolability.</description>

      <title>Pore pressure study in the Irpinia area (Southern Apennines, Italy)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subsurface pore pressure studies are crucial for understanding the geomechanical behaviours of the geological formations and for preventing the failure conditions of the rocks. Although the interplay between pore pressure changes and rock deformation is nowadays widely treated in the literature, the magnitude and the distribution of the fluid pressure regimes at depth is not completely clear, especially in those areas, such as the fold and thrust belts, characterised by a complex tectonostratigraphic setting. The proposed study deals with the subsurface fluid dynamics of the Irpinia region, located in the Southern Apennines (Italy) and marked by intense tectonic activity and seismicity. In that area, the most recent and notable Italian earthquake occurred in November 1980 (6.9 Mw) and caused significant damage and loss of life. Irpinia area is also a site of deep gas rising to the surface and exhibits clear correlations between crustal deformation and groundwater circulation. The pressure analysis herein proposed has been performed using direct and indirect pressure measurements collected from 13 hydrocarbon exploration wells available in open source. It provides a detailed description of the methodology used to identify where overpressures develop within the sediments of both autochthonous and allochthonous layers. It also investigates the relationship between pore pressures, gas occurrences found at well sites, and the possible sources of overpressures. The results show that the carbonate successions of the South-Apennines and Apulian Platforms are characterized by predominantly hydrostatic pressure regimes, while the shale-rich successions of the Lagonegrese pelagic basin and the Miocene-Pliocene foredeep basin locally demonstrate moderate overpressured gradients. Finally, the highest overpressures are observed in the evaporitic deposits and Pliocene shales.</description>

      <title>SeisFusion: Constrained Diffusion Model with Input Guidance for 3D Seismic Data Interpolation and Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geographical, physical, or economic constraints often result in missing traces within seismic data, making the reconstruction of complete seismic data a crucial step in seismic data processing. Traditional methods for seismic data reconstruction require the selection of multiple empirical parameters and struggle to handle large-scale continuous missing data. With the development of deep learning, various neural networks have demonstrated powerful reconstruction capabilities. However, these convolutional neural networks represent a point-to-point reconstruction approach that may not cover the entire distribution of the dataset. Consequently, when dealing with seismic data featuring complex missing patterns, such networks may experience varying degrees of performance degradation. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel diffusion model reconstruction framework tailored for 3D seismic data. To constrain the results generated by the diffusion model, we introduce conditional supervision constraints into the diffusion model, constraining the generated data of the diffusion model based on the input data to be reconstructed. We introduce a 3D neural network architecture into the diffusion model, successfully extending the 2D diffusion model to 3D space. Additionally, we refine the model's generation process by incorporating missing data into the generation process, resulting in reconstructions with higher consistency. Through ablation studies determining optimal parameter values, our method exhibits superior reconstruction accuracy when applied to both field datasets and synthetic datasets, effectively addressing a wide range of complex missing patterns. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/WAL-l/SeisFusion.</description>

      <title>Irradiation induced mineral changes of NWA10580 meteorite determined by infrared analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Identifying minerals on asteroid surfaces is difficult as space weathering modifies the minerals infrared spectra. This shouldbe better understood for proper interpretation.
  Aims. We simulated the space weathering effects on a meteorite and recorded the alterations of the crystalline structure, such as the change in peak positions and full width at half maximum values.
  Methods. We used proton irradiation to simulate the effects of solar wind on a sample of NWA 10580 CO3 chondrite meteorites. After irradiation in three gradually increased steps with 1 keV ion energy, we used infrared microscopic reflectance and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) to identify and understand the consequences of irradiation.
  Results. We find negative peak shifts after the first and second irradiations at pyroxene and feldspar minerals, similarly to the literature, and this shift was attributed to Mg loss. However, after the third irradiation a positive change in values in wavenumber emerged for silicates, which could come from the distortion of SiO4 tetrahedra, resembling shock deformation. The full width at half maximum values of major bands show a positive (increasing) trend after irradiations in the case of feldspars, using IR reflection measurements. Comparing DRIFTS and reflection infrared data, the peak positions of major mineral bands were at similar wavenumbers, but differences can be observed in minor bands.
  Conclusions. We measured the spectral changes of meteorite minerals after high doses of proton irradiation for several minerals. We show the first of these measurements for feldspars; previous works only presented pyroxene, olivine, and phyllosilicates.</description>
