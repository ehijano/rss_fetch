      <title>Impedance and Stability Targeted Adaptation for Aerial Manipulator with Unknown Coupling Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stable aerial manipulation during dynamic tasks such as object catching, perching, or contact with rigid surfaces necessarily requires compliant behavior, which is often achieved via impedance control. Successful manipulation depends on how effectively the impedance control can tackle the unavoidable coupling forces between the aerial vehicle and the manipulator. However, the existing impedance controllers for aerial manipulator either ignore these coupling forces (in partitioned system compliance methods) or require their precise knowledge (in complete system compliance methods). Unfortunately, such forces are very difficult to model, if at all possible. To solve this long-standing control challenge, we introduce an impedance controller for aerial manipulator which does not rely on a priori knowledge of the system dynamics and of the coupling forces. The impedance control design can address unknown coupling forces, along with system parametric uncertainties, via suitably designed adaptive laws. The closed-loop system stability is proved analytically and experimental results with a payload-catching scenario demonstrate significant improvements in overall stability and tracking over the state-of-the-art impedance controllers using either partitioned or complete system compliance.</description>

      <title>System Identification and Adaptive Input Estimation on the Jaiabot Micro Autonomous Underwater Vehicle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports an attempt to model the system dynamics and estimate both the unknown internal control input and the state of a recently developed marine autonomous vehicle, the Jaiabot. Although the Jaiabot has shown promise in many applications, process and sensor noise necessitates state estimation and noise filtering. In this work, we present the first surge and heading linear dynamical model for Jaiabots derived from real data collected during field testing. An adaptive input estimation algorithm is implemented to accurately estimate the control input and hence the state. For validation, this approach is compared to the classical Kalman filter, highlighting its advantages in handling unknown control inputs.</description>

      <title>Path planning with moving obstacles using stochastic optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigating a collision-free, optimal path for a robot poses a perpetual challenge, particularly in the presence of moving objects such as humans. In this study, we formulate the problem of finding an optimal path as a stochastic optimal control problem. However, obtaining a solution to this problem is nontrivial. Therefore, we consider a simplified problem, which is more tractable. For this simplified formulation, we are able to solve the corresponding Bellman equation. However, the solution obtained from the simplified problem does not sufficiently address the original problem of interest. To address the full problem, we propose a numerical procedure where we solve an optimization problem at each sampling instant. The solution to the simplified problem is integrated into the online formulation as a final-state penalty. We illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method using a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Distributed Resource Allocation for Human-Autonomy Teaming under Coupled Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the optimal resource allocation problem within a multi-agent network composed of both autonomous agents and humans. The main challenge lies in the globally coupled constraints that link the decisions of autonomous agents with those of humans. To address this, we propose a reformulation that transforms these coupled constraints into decoupled local constraints defined over the system's communication graph. Building on this reformulation and incorporating a human response model that captures human-robot interactions while accounting for individual preferences and biases, we develop a fully distributed algorithm. This algorithm guides the states of the autonomous agents to equilibrium points which, when combined with the human responses, yield a globally optimal resource allocation. We provide both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>An Integrated Transportation Network and Power Grid Simulation Approach for Assessing Environmental Impact of Electric Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study develops an integrated approach that includes EV charging and power generation to assess the complex cross-sector interactions of vehicle electrification and its environmental impact. The charging load from on-road EV operation is developed based on a regional-level transportation simulation and charging behavior simulation, considering different EV penetration levels, congestion levels, and charging strategies. The emissions from EGUs are estimated from a dispatch study in a power grid simulation using the charging load as a major input. A case study of Austin, Texas is performed to quantify the environmental impact of EV adoption on both on-road and EGU emission sources at the regional level. The results demonstrate the range of emission impact under a combination of factors.</description>

      <title>Orthodromic Routing and Forwarding for Large Satellite Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low earth orbit satellite constellations with intersatellite links (ISLs) are currently being developed and deployed. The availability of ISLs provides the capability to route across the satellite constellation, rather than using the satellite as a single hop in a bent-pipe configuration. We present a fully distributed solution to routing and forwarding which we call Orthodromic Routing (OR(r) ). OR(r) routing is built on a foundation of both geographic and link state routing to create a hybrid protocol which scales to enormous constellations with excellent failure handling. Our work includes an addressing and forwarding plane for OR(r)which can be implemented in hardware in a highly parallel manner to achieve line rates while only requiring a bounded number of forwarding table entries.</description>

      <title>Towards Enabling Learning for Time-Varying finite horizon Sequential Decision-Making Problems*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameterized Sequential Decision Making (Para-SDM) framework models a wide array of network design applications spanning supply-chain, transportation, and sensor networks. These problems entail sequential multi-stage optimization characterized by states, control actions, and cost functions dependent on designable parameters. The challenge is to determine both the sequential decision policy and parameters simultaneously to minimize cumulative stagewise costs. Many Para-SDM problems are NP-hard and often necessitate time-varying policies. Existing algorithms tackling finite-horizon time-varying Para-SDM problems struggle with scalability when faced with a large number of states. Conversely, the sole algorithm addressing infinite-horizon Para-SDM assumes time (stage)-invariance, yielding stationary policies. However, this approach proves scalable for time-invariant problems by leveraging deep neural networks to learn optimal stage-invariant state-action value functions, enabling handling of large-scale scenarios. This article proposes a novel approach that reinterprets finite-horizon, time-varying Para-SDM problems as equivalent time-invariant problems through topography lifting. Our method achieves nearly identical results to the time-varying solution while exhibiting improved performance times in various simulations, notably in the small cell network problem. This fresh perspective on Para-SDM problems expands the scope of addressable issues and holds promise for future scalability through the integration of learning methods.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Nonconvex Reachability Analysis using Exact Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses a fundamental challenge in data-driven reachability analysis: accurately representing and propagating non-convex reachable sets. We propose a novel approach using constrained polynomial zonotopes to describe reachable sets for unknown LTI systems. Unlike constrained zonotopes commonly used in existing literature, constrained polynomial zonotopes are closed under multiplication with constrained matrix zonotopes. We leverage this property to develop an exact multiplication method that preserves the non-convex geometry of reachable sets without resorting to approximations. We demonstrate that our approach provides tighter over-approximations of reachable sets for LTI systems compared to conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Error Analysis of Sampling Algorithms for Approximating Stochastic Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the error analysis of two types of sampling algorithms, namely model predictive path integral (MPPI) and an interacting particle system (\IPS) algorithm, that have been proposed in the literature for numerical approximation of the stochastic optimal control. The analysis is presented through the lens of Gibbs variational principle. For an illustrative example of a single-stage stochastic optimal control problem, analytical expressions for approximation error and scaling laws, with respect to the state dimension and sample size, are derived. The analytical results are illustrated with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Beyond Asymptotics: Targeted exploration with finite-sample guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a targeted exploration strategy for the non-asymptotic, finite-time case. The proposed strategy is applicable to uncertain linear time-invariant systems subject to sub-Gaussian disturbances. As the main result, the proposed approach provides a priori guarantees, ensuring that the optimized exploration inputs achieve a desired accuracy of the model parameters. The technical derivation of the strategy (i) leverages existing non-asymptotic identification bounds with self-normalized martingales, (ii) utilizes spectral lines to predict the effect of sinusoidal excitation, and (iii) effectively accounts for spectral transient error and parametric uncertainty. A numerical example illustrates how the finite exploration time influence the required exploration energy.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Simulation of Aircraft Descent via a Hybrid Physics-Data Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for generating probabilistic descent trajectories in simulations of real-world airspace. A dataset of 116,066 trajectories harvested from Mode S radar returns in UK airspace was used to train and test the model. Thirteen aircraft types with varying performance characteristics were investigated. It was found that the error in the mean prediction of time to reach the bottom of descent for the proposed method was less than that of the the Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) model by a factor of 10. Furthermore, the method was capable of generating a range of trajectories that were similar to the held out test dataset when analysed in distribution. The proposed method is hybrid, with aircraft drag and calibrated airspeed functions generated probabilistically to parameterise the BADA equations, ensuring the physical plausibility of generated trajectories.</description>

      <title>MAD: A Magnitude And Direction Policy Parametrization for Stability Constrained Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce magnitude and direction (MAD) policies, a policy parameterization for reinforcement learning (RL) that preserves Lp closed-loop stability for nonlinear dynamical systems. Although complete in their ability to describe all stabilizing controllers, methods based on nonlinear Youla and system-level synthesis are significantly affected by the difficulty of parameterizing Lp-stable operators. In contrast, MAD policies introduce explicit feedback on state-dependent features - a key element behind the success of RL pipelines - without compromising closed-loop stability. This is achieved by describing the magnitude of the control input with a disturbance-feedback Lp-stable operator, while selecting its direction based on state-dependent features through a universal function approximator. We further characterize the robust stability properties of MAD policies under model mismatch. Unlike existing disturbance-feedback policy parameterizations, MAD policies introduce state-feedback components compatible with model-free RL pipelines, ensuring closed-loop stability without requiring model information beyond open-loop stability. Numerical experiments show that MAD policies trained with deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) methods generalize to unseen scenarios, matching the performance of standard neural network policies while guaranteeing closed-loop stability by design.</description>

      <title>Assessing Geographical and Seasonal Influences on Energy Efficiency of Electric Drayage Trucks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrification of heavy-duty vehicles is a critical pathway towards improved energy efficiency of the freight sector. The current battery electric truck technology poses several challenges to the operations of commercial vehicles, such as limited driving range, sensitivity to climate conditions, and long recharging times. Estimating the energy consumption of heavy-duty electric trucks is crucial to assess the feasibility of the fleet electrification and its impact on the electric grid. This paper focuses on developing a model-based simulation approach to predict and analyze the energy consumption of drayage trucks used in ports logistic operations, considering seasonal climate variations and geographical characteristics. The paper includes results for three major container ports within the United States, providing region-specific insights into driving range, payload capacity, and charging infrastructure requirements, which will inform decision-makers in integrating electric trucks into the existing drayage operations and plan investments for electric grid development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the growing field of Shared Micromobility Systems, which holds great potential for shaping urban transportation, fairness-oriented approaches remain largely unexplored. This work addresses such a gap by investigating the balance between performance optimization and algorithmic fairness in Shared Micromobility Services using Reinforcement Learning. Our methodology achieves equitable outcomes, measured by the Gini index, across central, peripheral, and remote station categories. By strategically rebalancing vehicle distribution, it maximizes operator performance while upholding fairness principles. The efficacy of our approach is validated through a case study using synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Controlled Social Learning: Altruism vs. Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a model of sequential social learning in which a planner may pay a cost to adjust the private signal precision of some agents. This framework presents a new optimization problem for social learning that sheds light on practical policy questions, such as how the socially optimal level of ad personalization changes according to current beliefs or how a biased planner might derail social learning. We then characterize the optimal policies of an altruistic planner who maximizes social welfare and a biased planner who seeks to induce a specific action. Even for a planner who has equivalent knowledge to an individual, cannot lie or cherry-pick information, and is fully observable, we demonstrate that it can dramatically influence social welfare in both positive and negative directions. An important area for future exploration is how one might prevent these latter outcomes to protect against the manipulation of social learning.</description>

      <title>Online and Offline Space-Filling Input Design for Nonlinear System Identification: A Receding Horizon Control-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effectiveness of data-driven techniques heavily depends on the input signal used to generate the estimation data. However, a significant research gap exists in the field of input design for nonlinear dynamic system identification. In particular, existing methods largely overlook the minimization of the generalization error, i.e., model inaccuracies in regions not covered by the estimation dataset. This work addresses this gap by proposing an input design method that embeds a novel optimality criterion within a receding horizon control (RHC)-based optimization framework. The distance-based optimality criterion induces a space-filling design within a user-defined region of interest in a surrogate model's input space, requiring only minimal prior knowledge. Additionally, the method is applicable both online, where model parameters are continuously updated based on process observations, and offline, where a fixed model is employed. The space-filling performance of the proposed strategy is evaluated on an artificial example and compared to state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior efficiency in exploring process operating spaces.</description>

      <title>A Set-Theoretic Robust Control Approach for Linear Quadratic Games with Unknown Counterparts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring robust decision-making in multi-agent systems is challenging when agents have distinct, possibly conflicting objectives and lack full knowledge of each other s strategies. This is apparent in safety-critical applications such as human-robot interaction and assisted driving, where uncertainty arises not only from unknown adversary strategies but also from external disturbances. To address this, the paper proposes a robust adaptive control approach based on linear quadratic differential games. Our method allows a controlled agent to iteratively refine its belief about the adversary strategy and disturbances using a set-membership approach, while simultaneously adapting its policy to guarantee robustness against the uncertain adversary policy and improve performance over time. We formally derive theoretical guarantees on the robustness of the proposed control scheme and its convergence to epsilon-Nash strategies. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated in a numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Sequential Binary Hypothesis Testing with Competing Agents under Information Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns sequential hypothesis testing in competitive multi-agent systems where agents exchange potentially manipulated information. Specifically, a two-agent scenario is studied where each agent aims to correctly infer the true state of nature while optimizing decision speed and accuracy. At each iteration, agents collect private observations, update their beliefs, and share (possibly corrupted) belief signals with their counterparts before deciding whether to stop and declare a state, or continue gathering more information. The analysis yields three main results: (1)~when agents share information strategically, the optimal signaling policy involves equal-probability randomization between truthful and inverted beliefs; (2)~agents maximize performance by relying solely on their own observations for belief updating while using received information only to anticipate their counterpart's stopping decision; and (3)~the agent reaching their confidence threshold first cause the other agent to achieve a higher conditional probability of error. Numerical simulations further demonstrate that agents with higher KL divergence in their conditional distributions gain competitive advantage. Furthermore, our results establish that information sharing -- despite strategic manipulation -- reduces overall system stopping time compared to non-interactive scenarios, which highlights the inherent value of communication even in this competitive setup.</description>

      <title>On Composable and Parametric Uncertainty in Systems Co-Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing the design of complex systems requires navigating interdependent decisions, heterogeneous components, and multiple objectives. Our monotone theory of co-design offers a compositional framework for addressing this challenge, modeling systems as Design Problems (DPs), representing trade-offs between functionalities and resources within partially ordered sets. While current approaches model uncertainty using intervals, capturing worst- and best-case bounds, they fail to express probabilistic notions such as risk and confidence. These limitations hinder the applicability of co-design in domains where uncertainty plays a critical role. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework for composable uncertainty in co-design, capturing intervals, distributions, and parametrized models. This extension enables reasoning about risk-performance trade-offs and supports advanced queries such as experiment design, learning, and multi-stage decision making. We demonstrate the expressiveness and utility of the framework via a numerical case study on the uncertainty-aware co-design of task-driven Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).</description>

      <title>Differentiable Optimization for Deep Learning-Enhanced DC Approximation of AC Optimal Power Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing scale of power systems and the increasing uncertainty introduced by renewable energy sources necessitates novel optimization techniques that are significantly faster and more accurate than existing methods. The AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problem, a core component of power grid optimization, is often approximated using linearized DC Optimal Power Flow (DC-OPF) models for computational tractability, albeit at the cost of suboptimal and inefficient decisions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel deep learning-based framework for network equivalency that enhances DC-OPF to more closely mimic the behavior of AC-OPF. The approach utilizes recent advances in differentiable optimization, incorporating a neural network trained to predict adjusted nodal shunt conductances and branch susceptances in order to account for nonlinear power flow behavior. The model can be trained end-to-end using modern deep learning frameworks by leveraging the implicit function theorem. Results demonstrate the framework's ability to significantly improve prediction accuracy, paving the way for more reliable and efficient power systems.</description>

      <title>On Model Protection in Federated Learning against Eavesdropping Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the protection offered by federated learning algorithms against eavesdropping adversaries. In our model, the adversary is capable of intercepting model updates transmitted from clients to the server, enabling it to create its own estimate of the model. Unlike previous research, which predominantly focuses on safeguarding client data, our work shifts attention protecting the client model itself. Through a theoretical analysis, we examine how various factors, such as the probability of client selection, the structure of local objective functions, global aggregation at the server, and the eavesdropper's capabilities, impact the overall level of protection. We further validate our findings through numerical experiments, assessing the protection by evaluating the model accuracy achieved by the adversary. Finally, we compare our results with methods based on differential privacy, underscoring their limitations in this specific context.</description>

      <title>On the threshold of excitable systems: An energy-based perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental characteristic of excitable systems is their ability to exhibit distinct subthreshold and suprathreshold behaviors. Precisely quantifying this distinction requires a proper definition of the threshold, which has remained elusive in neurodynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel, energy-based threshold definition for excitable circuits grounded in dissipativity theory, specifically using the classical concept of required supply. According to our definition, the threshold corresponds to a local maximum of the required supply, clearly separating subthreshold passive responses from suprathreshold regenerative spikes. We illustrate and validate the proposed definition through analytical and numerical studies of three canonical systems: a simple RC circuit, the FitzHugh--Nagumo model, and the biophysically detailed Hodgkin--Huxley model.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control with Visibility Graphs for Humanoid Path Planning and Tracking Against Adversarial Opponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we detail the methods used for obstacle avoidance, path planning, and trajectory tracking that helped us win the adult-sized, autonomous humanoid soccer league in RoboCup 2024. Our team was undefeated for all seated matches and scored 45 goals over 6 games, winning the championship game 6 to 1. During the competition, a major challenge for collision avoidance was the measurement noise coming from bipedal locomotion and a limited field of view (FOV). Furthermore, obstacles would sporadically jump in and out of our planned trajectory. At times our estimator would place our robot inside a hard constraint. Any planner in this competition must also be be computationally efficient enough to re-plan and react in real time. This motivated our approach to trajectory generation and tracking. In many scenarios long-term and short-term planning is needed. To efficiently find a long-term general path that avoids all obstacles we developed DAVG (Dynamic Augmented Visibility Graphs). DAVG focuses on essential path planning by setting certain regions to be active based on obstacles and the desired goal pose. By augmenting the states in the graph, turning angles are considered, which is crucial for a large soccer playing robot as turning may be more costly. A trajectory is formed by linearly interpolating between discrete points generated by DAVG. A modified version of model predictive control (MPC) is used to then track this trajectory called cf-MPC (Collision-Free MPC). This ensures short-term planning. Without having to switch formulations cf-MPC takes into account the robot dynamics and collision free constraints. Without a hard switch the control input can smoothly transition in cases where the noise places our robot inside a constraint boundary. The nonlinear formulation runs at approximately 120 Hz, while the quadratic version achieves around 400 Hz.</description>

      <title>Bipedal Robust Walking on Uneven Footholds: Piecewise Slope LIPM with Discrete Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an enhanced theoretical formulation for bipedal hierarchical control frameworks under uneven terrain conditions. Specifically, owing to the inherent limitations of the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM) in handling terrain elevation variations, we develop a Piecewise Slope LIPM (PS-LIPM). This innovative model enables dynamic adjustment of the Center of Mass (CoM) height to align with topographical undulations during single-step cycles. Another contribution is proposed a generalized Angular Momentum-based LIPM (G-ALIP) for CoM velocity compensation using Centroidal Angular Momentum (CAM) regulation. Building upon these advancements, we derive the DCM step-to-step dynamics for Model Predictive Control MPC formulation, enabling simultaneous optimization of step position and step duration. A hierarchical control framework integrating MPC with a Whole-Body Controller (WBC) is implemented for bipedal locomotion across uneven stepping stones. The results validate the efficacy of the proposed hierarchical control framework and the theoretical formulation.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of MINLP and MPVC Formulations for Solving Complex Nonlinear Decision-Making Problems in Aerospace Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-level decision-making for dynamical systems often involves performance and safety specifications that are activated or deactivated depending on conditions related to the system state and commands. Such decision-making problems can be naturally formulated as optimization problems where these conditional activations are regulated by discrete variables. However, solving these problems can be challenging numerically, even on powerful computing platforms, especially when the dynamics are nonlinear. In this work, we consider decision-making for nonlinear systems where certain constraints, as well as possible terms in the cost function, are activated or deactivated depending on the system state and commands. We show that these problems can be formulated either as mixed-integer nonlinear programs (MINLPs) or as mathematical programs with vanishing constraints (MPVCs), where the former formulation involves discrete decision variables, whereas the latter relies on continuous variables subject to structured nonconvex constraints. We discuss the different solution methods available for both formulations and demonstrate them on optimal trajectory planning problems in various aerospace applications. Finally, we compare the strengths and weaknesses of the MINLP and MPVC approaches through a focused case study on powered descent guidance with divert-feasible regions.</description>

      <title>On learning racing policies with reinforcement learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fully autonomous vehicles promise enhanced safety and efficiency. However, ensuring reliable operation in challenging corner cases requires control algorithms capable of performing at the vehicle limits. We address this requirement by considering the task of autonomous racing and propose solving it by learning a racing policy using Reinforcement Learning (RL). Our approach leverages domain randomization, actuator dynamics modeling, and policy architecture design to enable reliable and safe zero-shot deployment on a real platform. Evaluated on the F1TENTH race car, our RL policy not only surpasses a state-of-the-art Model Predictive Control (MPC), but, to the best of our knowledge, also represents the first instance of an RL policy outperforming expert human drivers in RC racing. This work identifies the key factors driving this performance improvement, providing critical insights for the design of robust RL-based control strategies for autonomous vehicles.</description>

Abstract: We propose a decentralized reinforcement learning solution for multi-agent shepherding of non-cohesive targets using policy-gradient methods. Our architecture integrates target-selection with target-driving through Proximal Policy Optimization, overcoming discrete-action constraints of previous Deep Q-Network approaches and enabling smoother agent trajectories. This model-free framework effectively solves the shepherding problem without prior dynamics knowledge. Experiments demonstrate our method's effectiveness and scalability with increased target numbers and limited sensing capabilities.</description>

      <title>Secrecy Performance of a Keyhole-based Multi-user System with Multiple Eavesdroppers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the secrecy performance of a keyhole-aided multi-user communication network in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. The communication happens through the same keyhole for legitimate users and eavesdroppers. In this context, the secrecy performance is evaluated for a user scheduling technique by obtaining the exact closed-form expression of secrecy outage probability (SOP). Further, a simplified asymptotic SOP expression is derived assuming high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenario for a better understanding of the impact of system parameters. The effect of the keyhole parameters, number of users, number of eavesdroppers, and threshold secrecy rate on the SOP performance are also investigated for the considered system model. In the high-SNR regime, the asymptotic SOP saturates to a constant value and does not depend on the keyhole parameter and the channel parameter of the source-to-keyhole channel.</description>

      <title>Digital Twins for Internet of Battlespace Things (IoBT) Coalitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new framework for integrating Digital Twins (DTs) within Internet of battlespace Things (IoBT) coalitions. We introduce a novel three-tier architecture that enables efficient coordination and management of DT models across coalition partners while addressing key challenges in interoperability, security, and resource allocation. The architecture comprises specialized controllers at each tier: Digital Twin Coalition Partner (DTCP) controllers managing individual coalition partners' DT resources, a central Digital Twin Coalition(DTC) controller orchestrating cross-partner coordination, and Digital Twin Coalition Mission (DTCP) controllers handling mission-specific DT interactions. We propose a hybrid approach for DT model placement across edge devices, tactical nodes, and cloud infrastructure, optimizing performance while maintaining security and accessibility. The architecture leverages software-defined networking principles for dynamic resource allocation and slice management, enabling efficient sharing of computational and network resources between DT operations and primary IoBT functions. Our proposed framework aims to provide a robust foundation for deploying and managing Digital Twins in coalition warfare, enhancing situational awareness, decision-making capabilities, and operational effectiveness while ensuring secure and interoperable operations across diverse coalition partners.</description>

      <title>Learning Geometrically-Informed Lyapunov Functions with Deep Diffeomorphic RBF Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The practical deployment of learning-based autonomous systems would greatly benefit from tools that flexibly obtain safety guarantees in the form of certificate functions from data. While the geometrical properties of such certificate functions are well understood, synthesizing them using machine learning techniques still remains a challenge. To mitigate this issue, we propose a diffeomorphic function learning framework where prior structural knowledge of the desired output is encoded in the geometry of a simple surrogate function, which is subsequently augmented through an expressive, topology-preserving state-space transformation. Thereby, we achieve an indirect function approximation framework that is guaranteed to remain in the desired hypothesis space. To this end, we introduce a novel approach to construct diffeomorphic maps based on RBF networks, which facilitate precise, local transformations around data. Finally, we demonstrate our approach by learning diffeomorphic Lyapunov functions from real-world data and apply our method to different attractor systems.</description>

      <title>Incorporating the ChEES Criterion into Sequential Monte Carlo Samplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are a powerful but computationally expensive way of performing non-parametric Bayesian inference. MCMC proposals which utilise gradients, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), can better explore the parameter space of interest if the additional hyper-parameters are chosen well. The No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) is a variant of HMC which is extremely effective at selecting these hyper-parameters but is slow to run and is not suited to GPU architectures. An alternative to NUTS, Change in the Estimator of the Expected Square HMC (ChEES-HMC) was shown not only to run faster than NUTS on GPU but also sample from posteriors more efficiently. Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers are another sampling method which instead output weighted samples from the posterior. They are very amenable to parallelisation and therefore being run on GPUs while having additional flexibility in their choice of proposal over MCMC. We incorporate (ChEEs-HMC) as a proposal into SMC samplers and demonstrate competitive but faster performance than NUTS on a number of tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2012.12689v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We approach the debate on how ``intelligent'' artificial agents should be, by endowing the preys and predators of the Lotka-Volterra model with behavioural algorithms characterized by different levels of sophistication. We find that by endowing both preys and predators with the capability of making predictions based on linear extrapolation a novel sort of dynamic equilibrium appears, where both species co-exist while both populations grow indefinitely. While we confirm that, in general, simple agents favour the emergence of complex collective behaviour, we also suggest that the capability of individuals to take first-order derivatives of one other's behaviour may allow the collective computation of derivatives of any order.</description>

      <title>Harnessing On-Machine Metrology Data for Prints with a Surrogate Model for Laser Powder Directed Energy Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we leverage the massive amount of multi-modal on-machine metrology data generated from Laser Powder Directed Energy Deposition (LP-DED) to construct a comprehensive surrogate model of the 3D printing process. By employing Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control (DMDc), a data-driven technique, we capture the complex physics inherent in this extensive dataset. This physics-based surrogate model emphasizes thermodynamically significant quantities, enabling us to accurately predict key process outcomes. The model ingests 21 process parameters, including laser power, scan rate, and position, while providing outputs such as melt pool temperature, melt pool size, and other essential observables. Furthermore, it incorporates uncertainty quantification to provide bounds on these predictions, enhancing reliability and confidence in the results. We then deploy the surrogate model on a new, unseen part and monitor the printing process as validation of the method. Our experimental results demonstrate that the predictions align with actual measurements with high accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of our approach. This methodology not only facilitates real-time predictions but also operates at process-relevant speeds, establishing a basis for implementing feedback control in LP-DED.</description>

      <title>L4acados: Learning-based models for acados, applied to Gaussian process-based predictive control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incorporating learning-based models, such as artificial neural networks or Gaussian processes, into model predictive control (MPC) strategies can significantly improve control performance and online adaptation capabilities for real-world applications. Still, enabling state-of-the-art implementations of learning-based models for MPC is complicated by the challenge of interfacing machine learning frameworks with real-time optimal control software. This work aims at filling this gap by incorporating external sensitivities in sequential quadratic programming solvers for nonlinear optimal control. To this end, we provide L4acados, a general framework for incorporating Python-based residual models in the real-time optimal control software acados. By computing external sensitivities via a user-defined Python module, L4acados enables the implementation of MPC controllers with learning-based residual models in acados, while supporting parallelization of sensitivity computations when preparing the quadratic subproblems. We demonstrate significant speed-ups and superior scaling properties of L4acados compared to available software using a neural-network-based control example. Last, we provide an efficient and modular real-time implementation of Gaussian process-based MPC using L4acados, which is applied to two hardware examples: autonomous miniature racing, as well as motion control of a full-scale autonomous vehicle for an ISO lane change maneuver.</description>

      <title>Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fault Diagnosis of Induction Motors in Data-Scarce Environments with Varying Operating Conditions and Electric Drive Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable mechanical fault detection with limited data is crucial for the effective operation of induction machines, particularly given the real-world challenges present in industrial datasets, such as significant imbalances between healthy and faulty samples and the scarcity of data representing faulty conditions. This research introduces an innovative meta-learning approach to address these issues, focusing on mechanical fault detection in induction motors across diverse operating conditions while mitigating the adverse effects of drive noise in scenarios with limited data. The process of identifying faults under varying operating conditions is framed as a few-shot classification challenge and approached through a model-agnostic meta-learning strategy. Specifically, this approach begins with training a meta-learner across multiple interconnected fault-diagnosis tasks conducted under different operating conditions. In this stage, cross-entropy is utilized to optimize parameters and develop a robust representation of the tasks. Subsequently, the parameters of the meta-learner are fine-tuned for new tasks, enabling rapid adaptation using only a small number of samples. This method achieves excellent accuracy in fault detection across various conditions, even when data availability is restricted. The findings indicate that the proposed model outperforms other sophisticated techniques, providing enhanced generalization and quicker adaptation. The accuracy of fault diagnosis reaches a minimum of 99%, underscoring the model's effectiveness for reliable fault identification.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Role of the DSO in Electricity Trading of VPPs via a Stackelberg Game Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources has sparked interests in participating in power markets. Here, we consider two settings where Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) with some flexible resources participate in the electricity trading, either directly in the wholesale electricity market, or interfaced by the Distribution System Operator (DSO) who is the transaction organizer. In order to study the role of DSO as a stakeholder, a Stackelberg game is represented via a bi-level model: the DSO maximizes profits at the upper level, while the VPPs minimize operating costs at the lower level. To solve this problem, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of lower level is deduced to achieve a single-level problem. The results show that the role of the DSO as an intermediary agent leads to a decrease in operating costs of the VPPs by organizing lower-level trading, while making a profit for itself. However, this seemingly win-win result comes at the cost of losing wholesale market interests, which implies that stakeholders need to abide by regulatory constraints in the electricity market.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Neural Certificate Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of verifying different properties of discrete time dynamical systems, namely, reachability, safety and reach-while-avoid. To achieve this, we adopt a data driven perspective and using past systems' trajectories as data, we aim at learning a specific function termed \emph{certificate} for each property we wish to verify. The certificate construction problem is treated as a safety informed neural network training process, where we use a neural network to learn the parameterization of each certificate, while the loss function we seek to minimize is designed to encompass conditions on the certificate to be learned that encode the satisfaction of the associated property. Besides learning a certificate, we quantify probabilistically its generalization properties, namely, how likely it is for a certificate to be valid (and hence for the associated property to be satisfied) when it comes to a new system trajectory not included in the training data set. We view this problem under the realm of probably approximately correct (PAC) learning under the notion of compression, and use recent advancements of the so-called scenario approach to obtain scalable generalization bounds on the learned certificates. To achieve this, we design a novel algorithm that minimizes the loss function and hence constructs a certificate, and at the same time determines a quantity termed compression, which is instrumental in obtaining meaningful probabilistic guarantees. This process is novel per se and provides a constructive mechanism for compression set calculation, thus opening the road for its use to more general non-convex optimization problems. We verify the efficacy of our methodology on several numerical case studies, and compare it (both theoretically and numerically) with closely related results on data-driven property verification.</description>

      <title>Lessons learned from field demonstrations of model predictive control and reinforcement learning for residential and commercial HVAC: A review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A large body of simulation research suggests that model predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning (RL) for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) in residential and commercial buildings could reduce energy costs, pollutant emissions, and strain on power grids. Despite this potential, neither MPC nor RL has seen widespread industry adoption. Field demonstrations could accelerate MPC and RL adoption by providing real-world data that support the business case for deployment. Here we review 24 papers that document field demonstrations of MPC and RL in residential buildings and 80 in commercial buildings. After presenting demographic information -- such as experiment scopes, locations, and durations -- this paper analyzes experiment protocols and their influence on performance estimates. We find that 71% of the reviewed field demonstrations use experiment protocols that may lead to unreliable performance estimates. Over the remaining 29% that we view as reliable, the weighted-average cost savings, weighted by experiment duration, are 16% in residential buildings and 13% in commercial buildings. While these savings are potentially attractive, making the business case for MPC and RL also requires characterizing the costs of deployment, operation, and maintenance. Only 13 of the 104 reviewed papers report these costs or discuss related challenges. Based on these observations, we recommend directions for future field research, including: Improving experiment protocols; reporting deployment, operation, and maintenance costs; designing algorithms and instrumentation to reduce these costs; controlling HVAC equipment alongside other distributed energy resources; and pursuing emerging objectives such as peak shaving, arbitraging wholesale energy prices, and providing power grid reliability services.</description>

      <title>A nonlinear real time capable motion cueing algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10419v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In motion simulation, motion cueing algorithms are used for the trajectory planning of the motion simulator platform, where workspace limitations prevent direct reproduction of reference trajectories. Strategies such as motion washout, which return the platform to its center, are crucial in these settings. For serial robotic MSPs with highly nonlinear workspaces, it is essential to maximize the efficient utilization of the MSPs kinematic and dynamic capabilities. Traditional approaches, including classical washout filtering and linear model predictive control, fail to consider platform-specific, nonlinear properties, while nonlinear model predictive control, though comprehensive, imposes high computational demands that hinder real-time, pilot-in-the-loop application without further simplification. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning for motion cueing, demonstrated here for the first time in a 6-degree-of-freedom setting with full consideration of the MSPs kinematic nonlinearities. Previous work by the authors successfully demonstrated the application of DRL to a simplified 2-DOF setup, which did not consider kinematic or dynamic constraints. This approach has been extended to all 6 DOF by incorporating a complete kinematic model of the MSP into the algorithm, a crucial step for enabling its application on a real motion simulator. The training of the DRL-MCA is based on Proximal Policy Optimization in an actor-critic implementation combined with an automated hyperparameter optimization. After detailing the necessary training framework and the algorithm itself, we provide a comprehensive validation, demonstrating that the DRL MCA achieves competitive performance against established algorithms. Moreover, it generates feasible trajectories by respecting all system constraints and meets all real-time requirements with low...</description>

      <title>On-the-fly Surrogation for Complex Nonlinear Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-fidelity models are essential for accurately capturing nonlinear system dynamics. However, simulation of these models is often computationally too expensive and, due to their complexity, they are not directly suitable for analysis, control design or real-time applications. Surrogate modelling techniques seek to construct simplified representations of these systems with minimal complexity, but adequate information on the dynamics given a simulation, analysis or synthesis objective at hand. Despite the widespread availability of system linearizations and the growing computational potential of autograd methods, there is no established approach that systematically exploits them to capture the underlying global nonlinear dynamics. This work proposes a novel surrogate modelling approach that can efficiently build a global representation of the dynamics on-the-fly from local system linearizations without ever explicitly computing a model. Using radial basis function interpolation and the second fundamental theorem of calculus, the surrogate model is only computed at its evaluation, enabling rapid computation for simulation and analysis and seamless incorporation of new linearization data. The efficiency and modelling capabilities of the method are demonstrated on simulation examples.</description>

      <title>On Some Geometric Behavior of Value Iteration on the Orthant: Switching System Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05597v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the primary goal is to offer additional insights into the value iteration through the lens of switching system models in the control community. These models establish a connection between value iteration and switching system theory and reveal additional geometric behaviors of value iteration in solving discounted Markov decision problems. Specifically, the main contributions of this paper are twofold: 1) We provide a switching system model of value iteration and, based on it, offer a different proof for the contraction property of the value iteration. 2) Furthermore, from the additional insights, new geometric behaviors of value iteration are proven when the initial iterate lies in a special region. We anticipate that the proposed perspectives might have the potential to be a useful tool, applicable in various settings. Therefore, further development of these methods could be a valuable avenue for future research.</description>

Abstract: Addressing complex cooperative tasks in safety-critical environments poses significant challenges for multi-agent systems, especially under conditions of partial observability. We focus on a dynamic network bridging task, where agents must learn to maintain a communication path between two moving targets. To ensure safety during training and deployment, we integrate a control-theoretic safety filter that enforces collision avoidance through local setpoint updates. We develop and evaluate multi-agent reinforcement learning safety-informed message passing, showing that encoding safety filter activations as edge-level features improves coordination. The results suggest that local safety enforcement and decentralized learning can be effectively combined in distributed multi-agent tasks.</description>

      <title>Hybrid lunar ISRU plant: a comparative analysis with carbothermal reduction and water extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To establish a self-sustained human presence in space and to explore deeper into the solar system, extensive research has been conducted on In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) systems. Past studies have proposed and researched many technologies to produce oxygen from regolith, such as carbothermal reduction and water extraction from icy regolith, to utilize it for astronauts' life support and as the propellant of space systems. However, determining the most promising technology remains challenging due to uncertainties in the lunar environment and processing methods. To better understand the lunar environment and ISRU operations, it is crucial to gather more information. Motivated by this need for information gathering, this paper proposes a new ISRU plant architecture integrating carbothermal reduction of dry regolith and water extraction from icy regolith. Two different hybrid plant architectures integrating both technologies (1) in parallel and (2) in series are examined. The former involves mining and processing in both a Permanently Shadowed Region (PSR) and a peak of eternal light in parallel, while the latter solely mines in a PSR. In this series hybrid architecture, the dry regolith tailings from water extraction are further processed by carbothermal reduction. This paper conducts a comparative analysis of the landed mass and required power of each plant architecture utilizing subsystem-level models. Furthermore, based on uncertain parameters such as resource content in regolith, the potential performance range of each plant was discovered through Monte Carlo simulations. The result indicates the benefit of the series hybrid architecture in terms of regolith excavation rate, while its mass cost seems the highest among the studied architectures.</description>

      <title>Optimization of partially isolated quantum harmonic oscillator memory systems by mean square decoherence time criteria</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with open quantum harmonic oscillators with position-momentum system variables, whose internal dynamics and interaction with the environment are governed by linear quantum stochastic differential equations. A recently proposed approach to such systems as Heisenberg picture quantum memories exploits their ability to approximately retain initial conditions over a decoherence horizon. Using the quantum memory decoherence time defined previously in terms of a fidelity threshold on a weighted mean-square deviation of the system variables from their initial values, we apply this approach to a partially isolated subsystem of the oscillator, which is not directly affected by the external fields. The partial isolation leads to an appropriate system decomposition and a qualitatively different short-horizon asymptotic behaviour of the deviation, which yields a longer decoherence time in the high-fidelity limit. The resulting approximate decoherence time maximization over the energy parameters for improving the quantum memory performance is discussed for a coherent feedback interconnection of such systems.</description>
