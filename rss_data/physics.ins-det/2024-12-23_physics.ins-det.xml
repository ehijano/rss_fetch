      <title>Active nitrogen flux measurement during GaN growth based on the transmitted signal detected with a pyrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel approach for the measurement of the Nitrogen active species generated by a plasma source in the molecular beam epitaxy environment is here presented. The method is based on the analysis of the variations in the optical signal measured by a pyrometer during a two step, Gallium rich and Nitrogen controlled, growth modes. The method permits a precise, quantitative and direct measurement of the flux of active species as a function of the plasma generation parameters of the cell: nitrogen gas flux and RF-power.</description>

      <title>PALM -- Precision Attenuation Length Measurement in Liquid Scintillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future neutrino experiments at low energies such as JUNO or THEIA will use large volume homogeneous liquid scintillator detectors. The optical attenuation length of the liquid is of uttermost importance for the successful realization of these experiments. At TU Munich a new optical spectrometer (Precision Attenuation Length Measurement (PALM)) has been set up in order to measure the light attenuation of liquids which can be used for these types of experiments up to around 100 m in the wavelength region between 400 nm and 1000 nm. The setup features an optical imaging system with a long focal length, which allows for in-situ monitoring of the beam stability during the measurement. The setup capability as well as the reproducibility of its results has been demonstrated at two different wavelengths of 430 nm and 500 nm.</description>

      <title>Study of the Radiation Hardness of the ATLAS Tile Calorimeter Optical Instrumentation with Run 2 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a study of the radiation hardness of the hadronic Tile Calorimeter of the ATLAS experiment in the LHC Run 2. Both the plastic scintillators constituting the detector active media and the wavelength-shifting optical fibres collecting the scintillation light into the photodetector readout are elements susceptible to radiation damage. The dedicated calibration and monitoring systems of the detector (caesium radioactive sources, laser and minimum bias integrator) allow to assess the response of these optical components. Data collected with these systems between 2015 and 2018 are analysed to measure the degradation of the optical instrumentation across Run 2. Moreover, a simulation of the total ionising dose in the calorimeter is employed to study and model the degradation profile as a function of the exposure conditions, both integrated dose and dose rate. The measurement of the relative light output loss in Run 2 is presented and extrapolations to future scenarios are drawn based on current data. The impact of radiation damage on the cell response uniformity is also analysed.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency position resolved gamma ray detectors for 2D-measurements of the angular correlation of annihilation radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of the 2D-Angular Correlation of Electron Positron Annihilation Radiation (ACAR) provides unique information about the bulk electronic structure of single crystals. We set up a new prototype for 2D-ACAR measurements using two 24 x 24 (26.8 mm x 26.8 mm) pixelated LYSO scintillation crystals in combination with a glass light guide and 8 x 8 (24 mm x 24 mm) Multi Pixel Photon Counters (MPPCs). Compared to conventional Anger-cameras, typically comprising large NaI(Tl) scintillators read out with photomultiplier arrays a larger implementation of our prototype would drastically improve resolution and count rate by taking advantage of the small pixel size of the scintillator, its much higher attenuation coefficient for 511 keV {\gamma}-quanta and faster digital readout. With our prototype we achieved a detection efficiency of 45%, i.e. five times higher compared to NaI(Tl) used in our Anger cameras, leading to a 25 (!) times higher coincidence count rate in ACAR measurements. A spatial resolution of 1 mm was obtained, which is limited by the pixel size of the scintillator. We demonstrate the high performance of the setup by (i) imaging the local distribution of 22Na in a proton-irradiated aluminum target and (ii) determining the Fermi energy of Cu from 2D-ACAR spectra recorded for a polycrystalline copper sample.</description>

      <title>The HIBEAM Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The violation of baryon number is an essential ingredient for baryogenesis - the preferential creation of matter over antimatter - needed to account for the observed baryon asymmetry in the Universe. However, such a process has yet to be experimentally observed. The HIBEAM/NNBAR program is a proposed two-stage experiment at the European Spallation Source to search for baryon number violation. The program will include high-sensitivity searches for processes that violate baryon number by one or two units: free neutron-antineutron oscillation via mixing, neutron-antineutron oscillation via regeneration from a sterile neutron state and neutron disappearance; the effective process of neutron regeneration is also possible. The program can be used to discover and characterize mixing in the neutron, antineutron and sterile neutron sectors. The experiment addresses topical open questions such as the origins of baryogenesis and the nature of dark matter, and is sensitive to scales of new physics substantially in excess of those available at colliders. A goal of the program is to open a discovery window to neutron conversion probabilities (sensitivities) by up to three orders of magnitude compared with previous searches, which is a rare opportunity. A conceptual design report for NNBAR has recently been published.</description>

      <title>A Low-Cost, Low-Power Media Converter Solution for Next-Generation Detector Readout Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23173v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High Energy Physics (HEP) data acquisition systems are often built from high-end FPGAs. As such systems scale in the HL-LHC era, severe under-utilization of FPGA transceivers can occur because front-end links prioritize radiation hardness and power consumption over raw data bandwidth. This work evaluates recently introduced low-power, low-cost FPGA devices as an alternative building block for future readout architectures. This study presents the implementation of a readout back-End on FPGA where the front-end protocol is based on the Low-Power GigaBit Transceiver (lpGBT) and the readout protocol is based on 10 Gigabit Ethernet, using the LHCb Run 4 RICH detector as a practical case study.</description>

      <title>Functional Verification for Endcap Concentrator ASICs in the High-Granularity Calorimeter Upgrade of CMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The High-Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL) will replace the current CMS Endcap Calorimeter during Long-Shutdown 3. The Endcap Concentrator (ECON) ASICs represent key elements in the readout chain, processing trigger (ECON-T) and data (ECON-D) streams from the HGCROC to the lpGBT. The ECONs will operate in a radiation environment with a High-Energy Hadron (${E\geq20MeV}$) flux up to $2\cdot10^{7} cm^{-2}s^{-1}$. This contribution describes the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM)-based functional verification of the ECON ASICs focusing on the re-use of existing components to manage the complexity of the verification environment.</description>

      <title>A Review of NEST Models for Liquid Xenon and Exhaustive Comparison to Other Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.10726v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper will discuss the microphysical simulation of interactions in liquid xenon, the active detector medium in many leading rare-event searches for new physics, and describe experimental observables useful for understanding detector performance. The scintillation and ionization yield distributions for signal and background will be presented using the Noble Element Simulation Technique (NEST), which is a toolkit based on experimental data and simple, empirical formulae, which mimic previous microphysics modeling, but are guided by data. The NEST models for light and charge production as a function of the particle type, energy, and electric field will be reviewed, as well as models for energy resolution and final pulse areas. NEST will be compared to other models or sets of models, and vetted against real data, with several specific examples pulled from XENON, ZEPLIN, LUX, LZ, PandaX, and table-top experiments used for calibrations.</description>
