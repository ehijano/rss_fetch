      <title>CCD Photometry of Trapezia Stars I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present photometric CCD observations of stars in four stellar trapezia ADS 15184, ADS 4728, ADS 2843, and ADS 16795. This study is performed on images obtained at the Observatorio Astron\'omico Nacional at San Pedro M\'artir (OAN), Baja California, M\'exico. In this work we utilise aperture photometry to measure the $U$, $B$, $V$, $R$ and $I$ magnitudes of some of the stars in these dynamically unstable stellar clusters (trapezia).
  Using the $Q=(U-B)-0.72(B-V)$ parameter we obtained the spectral type of the studied stars as well as their distance to the Sun and their reddening. Slight differences between the $Q$-derived Spectral types and those listed in SIMBAD might be due to a different value, from $0.72$, for the slope of the reddening line on the two-colour diagram.</description>

      <title>Abundances of Neutron-Capture Elements in 62 Stars in the Globular Cluster Messier 15</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M15 is a globular cluster with a known spread in neutron-capture elements. This paper presents abundances of neutron-capture elements for 62 stars in M15. Spectra were obtained with the Michigan/Magellan Fiber System (M2FS) spectrograph, covering a wavelength range from ~4430-4630 A. Spectral lines from Fe I, Fe II, Sr I, Zr II, Ba II, La II, Ce II, Nd II, Sm II, Eu II, and Dy II, were measured, enabling classifications and neutron-capture abundance patterns for the stars. Of the 62 targets, 44 are found to be highly Eu-enhanced r-II stars, another 17 are moderately Eu-enhanced r-I stars, and one star is found to have an s-process signature. The neutron-capture patterns indicate that the majority of the stars are consistent with enrichment by the r-process. The 62 target stars are found to show significant star-to-star spreads in Sr, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Eu, and Dy, but no significant spread in Fe. The neutron-capture abundances are further found to have slight correlations with sodium abundances from the literature, unlike what has been previously found; follow-up studies are needed to verify this result. The findings in this paper suggest that the Eu-enhanced stars in M15 were enhanced by the same process, that the nucleosynthetic source of this Eu pollution was the r-process, and that the r-process source occurred as the first generation of cluster stars was forming.</description>

      <title>A spectroscopic investigation of thermal instability for cylindrical equilibria with background flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flows are omnipresent and govern the dynamics of plasma. Solar tornadoes are a class of apparently rotating prominences, that might be formed by thermal instability. In spectroscopic studies on thermal instability background flow is commonly neglected. We here determine the effect of background flow on thermal instability in cylindrical magnetic field configurations as the influence of various parameters on the MHD spectrum. We investigate discrete thermal modes. In an analytical study, we extend upon the literature by including a generic background flow in a cylindrical coordinate system. The non-adiabatic MHD equations are linearised, Fourier-analysed, and are examined to understand how a background flow changes the continua. An approximate expression for discrete thermal modes is derived using a WKB analysis. The analytical results are then verified for a benchmark equilibrium using the eigenvalue code Legolas. The eigenfunctions of discrete thermal modes are visualised in 2D and 3D. The thermal continuum is Doppler-shifted due to the background flow, just like the slow and Alfv\'en continua. Discrete modes are altered because the governing equations contain flow-related terms. An approximate expression to predict the appearance of discrete thermal modes based on the equilibrium parameters is derived. All analytical expressions match the numerical results. The distribution of the density perturbations of the discrete thermal modes is not a singular condensation. 3D visualisation of the total velocity field shows that the helical field is heavily influenced by the radial velocity perturbation. We derived analytic expressions for non-adiabatic MHD modes of a cylindrical equilibrium with background flow and verified them using a coronal equilibrium. However, the equations are valid for and can be applied in other astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Stellar Surface Magnetic Fields Impact Limb Darkening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars appear darker at their limbs than at their disk centers because at the limb we are viewing the higher and cooler layers of stellar photospheres. Limb darkening derived from state-of-the-art stellar atmosphere models systematically fails to reproduce recent transiting exoplanet light curves from the Kepler, TESS, and JWST telescopes -- stellar brightness obtained from measurements drops less steeply towards the limb than predicted by models. All previous models assumed atmosphere devoid of magnetic fields. Here we use our new stellar atmosphere models computed with the 3D radiative magneto-hydrodynamic code MURaM to show that small-scale concentration of magnetic fields on the stellar surface affect limb darkening at a level that allows us to explain the observations. Our findings provide a way forward to improve the determination of exoplanet radii and especially the transmission spectroscopy analysis for transiting planets, which relies on a very accurate description of stellar limb darkening from the visible through the infrared. Furthermore, our findings imply that limb darkening allows measuring the small-scale magnetic field on stars with transiting planets.</description>

      <title>Convective Mixing: The Formation Channel of Li-rich Giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing observed data indicate that part of giants has abnormally high lithium (Li) inside their surface, and their proportion is around 1%. Instead of pursuing the feasible mechanisms for extra Li enrichment, we focus on how to inhibit Li depletion from the main sequence (MS) phase of giants. With this in mind, we find that convective mixing is capable of achieving this goal and forming Li-rich giants, which is mainly attributed to the convection model with the convective boundary defined by the Ledoux criterion. Another factor in the formation of Li-rich giants in our convection models is related to the Li abundances of their progenitors. If the Li abundances of the progenitors exceed the meteoritic value (3.3 dex), then the majority of giants will be rich in Li. This is the general pattern of stellar Li abundance evolution without factoring in extra Li depletion. We propose that other Li depletion processes should also be adopted in the future, as they may be the key to the 1% puzzle.</description>

      <title>Magnetic flux in the Sun emerges unaffected by supergranular-scale surface flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic flux emergence from the convection zone into the photosphere and beyond is a critical component of the behaviour of large-scale solar magnetism. Flux rarely emerges amid field-free areas at the surface, but when it does, the interaction between magnetism and plasma flows can be reliably explored. Prior ensemble studies identified weak flows forming near emergence locations, but the low signal-to-noise required averaging over the entire dataset, erasing information about variation across the sample. Here, we apply deep learning to achieve improved signal-to-noise, enabling a case-by-case study. We find that these associated flows are dissimilar across instances of emergence and also occur frequently in the quiet convective background. Our analysis suggests diminished influence of supergranular-scale convective flows and magnetic buoyancy on flux rise. Consistent with numerical evidence, we speculate that small-scale surface turbulence and / or deep-convective processes play an outsize role in driving flux emergence.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Asymmetric Spike-like Structures of 10 au Disk around the Very Low-luminosity Protostar Embedded in the Taurus Dense Core MC 27/L1521F with ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent ALMA observations have revealed an increasing number of compact protostellar disks with radii of less than a few tens of au, and the young Class 0/I objects have an intrinsic size diversity. To deepen our understanding of the origin of such tiny disks, we performed the highest resolution configuration observations with ALMA at a beam size of $\sim$0$''$03 (4 au) on the very low luminosity Class 0 protostar embedded in the Taurus dense core MC 27/L1521F. The 1.3 mm continuum measurement successfully resolved a tiny, faint ($\sim$1 mJy) disk with a major axis length of $\sim$10 au, one of the smallest examples in the ALMA protostellar studies. In addition, we detected spike-like components in the northeastern direction at the disk edge. Gravitational instability or other fragmentation mechanisms cannot explain the structures, given the central stellar mass of $\sim$0.2 $M_{\odot}$ and the disk mass of $\gtrsim$10$^{-4}$ $M_{\odot}$. Instead, we propose that these small spike structures were formed by a recent dynamic magnetic flux transport event due to interchange instability that would be favorable to occur if the parental core has a strong magnetic field. The presence of complex arc-like structures on a larger ($\sim$2000 au) scale in the same direction as the spike structures suggests that the event was not single. Such episodic, dynamical events may play an important role in maintaining the compact nature of the protostellar disk in the complex gas envelope during the main accretion phase.</description>

      <title>Inferring solar differential rotation and viscosity via passive imaging with inertial waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of inertial waves on the surface of the Sun offers new possibilities to learn about the solar interior. These waves are long-lived with a period on the order of the Sun rotation period ($\sim$27 days) and are sensitive to parameters deep inside the Sun. They are excited by turbulent convection, leading to a passive imaging problem. In this work, we present the forward and inverse problem of reconstructing viscosity and differential rotation on the Sun from cross-covariance observations of these inertial waves.</description>

      <title>The Multi-layer Nature of Molecular Gas toward the Cygnus Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the physical properties and 3D distribution of molecular clouds (MCs) toward the Cygnus region using the MWISP CO survey and Gaia DR3 data. Based on Gaussian decomposition and clustering for $\rm ^{13}CO$ lines, over 70% of the fluxes are recovered. With the identification result of $\rm ^{13}CO$ structures, two models are designed to measure the distances of the molecular gas in velocity crowding regions. The distances of more than 200 large $\rm ^{13}CO$ structures are obtained toward the 150 square degree region. Additionally, tens of the identified MC structures coincide well with masers and/or intense mid-IR emission. We find multiple gas layers toward the region: (1) the extensive gas structures composing the Cygnus Rift from 700 pc to 1 kpc across the whole region; (2) the $\sim$ 1.3 kpc gas layer mainly in the Cygnus X South region; and (3) the 1.5 kpc dense filament at the Cygnus X North region and many cometary clouds shaped by Cygnus OB2. We also note that the spatial distribution of YSO candidates is generally consistent with the molecular gas structures. The total molecular mass of the Cygnus region is estimated to be $\sim 2.7\times10^{6}~M_{\odot}$ assuming an X-factor ratio $X_{\rm CO} = 2 \times 10^{20} \rm cm^{-2} (K\cdot km\cdot s^{-1})^{-1}$. The foreground Cygnus Rift contributes $\sim$25% of the molecular mass in the whole region. Our work presents a new 3D view of the MCs distribution toward the Cygnus X region, as well as the exact molecular gas mass distribution in the foreground Cygnus Rift.</description>

      <title>Validation of a Third Planet in the LHS 1678 System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nearby LHS 1678 (TOI-696) system contains two confirmed planets and a wide-orbit, likely-brown-dwarf companion, which orbit an M2 dwarf with a unique evolutionary history. The host star occupies a narrow "gap" in the HR diagram lower main sequence, associated with the M dwarf fully convective boundary and long-term luminosity fluctuations. This system is one of only about a dozen M dwarf multi-planet systems to date that hosts an ultra-short period planet (USP). Here we validate and characterize a third planet in the LHS 1678 system using TESS Cycle 1 and 3 data and a new ensemble of ground-based light curves. LHS 1678 d is a 0.98 +/-0.07 Earth radii planet in a 4.97-day orbit, with an insolation flux of 9.1 +0.9/-0.8 Earth insolations. These properties place it near 4:3 mean motion resonance with LHS 1678 c and in company with LHS 1678 c in the Venus zone. LHS 1678 c and d are also twins in size and predicted mass, making them a powerful duo for comparative exoplanet studies. LHS 1678 d joins its siblings as another compelling candidate for atmospheric measurements with the JWST and mass measurements using high-precision radial velocity techniques. Additionally, USP LHS 1678 b breaks the "peas-in-a-pod" trend in this system, although additional planets could fill in the "pod" beyond its orbit. LHS 1678's unique combination of system properties and their relative rarity among the ubiquity of compact multi-planet systems around M dwarfs makes the system a valuable benchmark for testing theories of planet formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Cloud properties across spatial scales in simulations of the interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular clouds (MC) are structures of dense gas in the interstellar medium (ISM), that extend from ten to a few hundred parsecs and form the main gas reservoir available for star formation. Hydrodynamical simulations of varying complexity are a promising way to investigate MC evolution and their properties. However, each simulation typically has a limited range in resolution and different cloud extraction algorithms are used, which complicates the comparison between simulations. In this work, we aim to extract clouds from different simulations covering a wide range of spatial scales. We compare their properties, such as size, shape, mass, internal velocity dispersion and virial state. We apply the Hop cloud detection algorithm on (M)HD numerical simulations of stratified ISM boxes and isolated galactic disk simulations that were produced using Flash Ramses and Arepo We find that the extracted clouds are complex in shape ranging from round objects to complex filamentary networks in all setups. Despite the wide range of scales, resolution, and sub-grid physics, we observe surprisingly robust trends in the investigated metrics. The mass spectrum matches in the overlap between simulations without rescaling and with a high-mass slope of $\mathrm{d} N/\mathrm{d}\ln M\propto-1$ in accordance with theoretical predictions. The internal velocity dispersion scales with the size of the cloud as $\sigma\propto R^{0.75}$ for large clouds ($R\gtrsim3\,\mathrm{pc}$). For small clouds we find larger sigma compared to the power-law scaling, as seen in observations, which is due to supernova-driven turbulence. Almost all clouds are gravitationally unbound with the virial parameter scaling as $\alpha_\mathrm{vir}\propto M^{-0.4}$, which is slightly flatter compared to observed scaling, but in agreement given the large scatter.</description>

      <title>A hands-on introduction to Physics-Informed Neural Networks for solving partial differential equations with benchmark tests taken from astrophysics and plasma physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I provide an introduction to the application of deep learning and neural networks for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). The approach, known as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), involves minimizing the residual of the equation evaluated at various points within the domain. Boundary conditions are incorporated either by introducing soft constraints with corresponding boundary data values in the minimization process or by strictly enforcing the solution with hard constraints. PINNs are tested on diverse PDEs extracted from two-dimensional physical/astrophysical problems. Specifically, we explore Grad-Shafranov-like equations that capture magnetohydrodynamic equilibria in magnetically dominated plasmas. Lane-Emden equations that model internal structure of stars in sef-gravitating hydrostatic equilibrium are also considered. The flexibility of the method to handle various boundary conditions is illustrated through various examples, as well as its ease in solving parametric and inverse problems. The corresponding Python codes based on PyTorch/TensorFlow libraries are made available.</description>

      <title>The solar cycle 25 multi-spacecraft solar energetic particle event catalog of the SERPENTINE project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Solar energetic particle analysis platform for the inner heliosphere (SERPENTINE) project presents it's new multi-spacecraft SEP event catalog for events observed in solar cycle 25. Observations from five different viewpoints are utilized, provided by Solar Orbiter, Parker Solar Probe, STEREO A, BepiColombo, and the near-Earth spacecraft Wind and SOHO. The catalog contains key SEP parameters for 25-40 MeV protons, 1 MeV electrons, and 100 keV electrons. Furthermore, basic parameters of the associated flare and type-II radio burst are listed, as well as the coordinates of the observer and solar source locations. SEP onset times are determined using the Poisson-CUSUM method. SEP peak times and intensities refer to the global intensity maximum. If different viewing directions are available, we use the one with the earliest onset for the onset determination and the one with the highest peak intensity for the peak identification. Associated flares are identified using observations from near Earth and Solar Orbiter. Associated type II radio bursts are determined from ground-based observations in the metric frequency range and from spacecraft observations in the decametric range. The current version of the catalog contains 45 multi-spacecraft events observed in the period from Nov 2020 until May 2023, of which 13 were widespread events and four were classified as narrow-spread events. Using X-ray observations by GOES/XRS and Solar Orbiter/STIX, we were able to identify the associated flare in all but four events. Using ground-based and space-borne radio observations, we found an associated type-II radio burst for 40 events. In total, the catalog contains 142 single event observations, of which 20 (45) have been observed at radial distances below 0.6 AU (0.8 AU).</description>

      <title>The role of carbon in red giant spectro-seismology</title>

Abstract: Although red clump stars function as reliable standard candles, their surface characteristics (i.e. $T_\text{eff}$, $\log g$, and [Fe/H]) overlap with those of red giant branch stars, which are not standard candles. Recent results have revealed that spectral features containing carbon (e.g. CN molecular bands) carry information correlating with the "gold-standard" asteroseismic classifiers that distinguish red clump from red giant branch stars. However, the underlying astrophysical processes driving the correlation between these spectroscopic and asteroseismic quantities in red giants remain inadequately explored. This study aims to enhance our understanding of this "spectro-seismic" effect, by refining the list of key spectral features predicting red giant evolutionary state. In addition, we conduct further investigation into those key spectral features to probe the astrophysical processes driving this connection. We employ the data-driven The Cannon algorithm to analyse high-resolution ($R\sim80,000$) Veloce Rosso spectra from the Anglo-Australian Telescope for 301 red giant stars (where asteroseismic classifications from the TESS mission are known for 123 of the stars). The results highlight molecular spectroscopic features, particularly those containing carbon (e.g. CN), as the primary indicators of the evolutionary states of red giant stars. Furthermore, by investigating CN isotopic pairs (that is, $^{12}$C$^{14}$N and $^{13}$C$^{14}$N) we find suggestions of statistically significant differences in the reduced equivalent widths of such lines, suggesting that physical processes that change the surface abundances and isotopic ratios in red giant stars, such as deep mixing, are the driving forces of the "spectro-seismic" connection of red giants.</description>

      <title>Ejecta, Rings, and Dust in SN 1987A with JWST MIRI/MRS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supernova (SN) 1987A is the nearest supernova in $\sim$400 years. Using the {\em JWST} MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrograph, we spatially resolved the ejecta, equatorial ring (ER) and outer rings in the mid-infrared 12,927 days after the explosion. The spectra are rich in line and dust continuum emission, both in the ejecta and the ring. Broad emission lines (280-380~km~s$^{-1}$ FWHM) seen from all singly-ionized species originate from the expanding ER, with properties consistent with dense post-shock cooling gas. Narrower emission lines (100-170~km~s$^{-1}$ FWHM) are seen from species originating from a more extended lower-density component whose high ionization may have been produced by shocks progressing through the ER, or by the UV radiation pulse associated with the original supernova event. The asymmetric east-west dust emission in the ER has continued to fade, with constant temperature, signifying a reduction in dust mass. Small grains in the ER are preferentially destroyed, with larger grains from the progenitor surviving the transition from SN into SNR. The ER is fit with a single set of optical constants, eliminating the need for a secondary featureless hot dust component. We find several broad ejecta emission lines from [Ne~{\sc ii}], [Ar~{\sc ii}], [Fe~{\sc ii}], and [Ni~{\sc ii}]. With the exception of [Fe~{\sc ii}]~25.99$\mu$m, these all originate from the ejecta close to the ring and are likely being excited by X-rays from the interaction. The [Fe~{\sc ii}]~5.34$\mu$m to 25.99$\mu$m line ratio indicates a temperature of only a few hundred K in the inner core, consistent with being powered by ${}^{44}$Ti decay.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent Conditions for $^{26}$Al Injection into Protosolar Disk from a Nearby Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01948v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The early solar system contained a short-lived radionuclide, $^{26}$Al (its half-life time $t_{1/2} = 0.7$ Myr). The decay energy $^{26}$Al is thought to have controlled the thermal evolution of planetesimals and, possibly, the water contents of planets. Many hypotheses have been proposed for the origin of $^{26}$Al in the solar system. One of the possible hypotheses is the `disk injection scenario'; when the protoplanetary disk of the solar system had already formed, a nearby $(&lt;1 \,\mathrm{pc})$ supernova injected radioactive material directly into the disk. Such a $^{26}$Al injection hypothesis has been tested so far with limited setups for disk structure and supernova distance, and treated disk disruption and $^{26}$Al injection separately. Here, we revisit this problem to investigate whether there are self-consistent conditions under which the surviving disk radius can receive enough $^{26}$Al which can account for the abundance in the early solar system. We also consider a range of disk mass and structure, $^{26}$Al yields from supernova, and a large dust mass fraction $\eta_\mathrm{d}$. We find that $^{26}$Al yields of supernova are required as $\gtrsim 2.1\times10^{-3}M_\odot(\eta_\mathrm{d}/0.2)^{-1}$, challenging to achieve with known possible $^{26}$Al ejection and dust mass fraction ranges. Furthermore, we find that even if the above conditions are met, the supernova flow changes the disk temperature, which may not be consistent with the solar-system record. Our results place a strong constraint on the disk injection scenario. Rather, we suggest that the fresh $^{26}$Al of the early solar system must have been synthesized/injected in other ways.</description>
