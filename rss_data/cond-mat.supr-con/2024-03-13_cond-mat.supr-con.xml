      <title>Nodal d-wave pairing from spin fluctuations in a thermally disordered anti-ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider electron pairing in a two-dimensional thermally disordered itinerant anti-ferromagnet. It is shown that transverse spin fluctuations in such a state can give rise to superconductivity with a sizeable critical temperature $T_c$. Below $T_c$ there is quasi-long-range spin-singlet and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ superconducting order, together with fluctuating triplet order at momentum $(\pi,\pi)$. The singlet pairs we find are tightly bound together, and the pair wavefunction has a purely inter-sublattice structure due to the U(1) spin rotation symmetry of the anti-ferromagnet.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Shiba spectrum and superconductivity induced magnetic interactions in materials with topological band inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Shiba states in materials with bulk band inversion such as iron-based topological superconductors or doped topological insulators. We show that the structure of the Shiba state spectrum depends on the doping level relative to the chemical potential at which the band-inversion occurs. Moreover, we demonstrate that the transition from ferro-magnetic to antiferromagnetic coupling and vice versa, which is caused by the coupling of magnetic impurities through the overlap of Shiba states, is highly dependent on the doping level. Additionally, topological edge states may have a substantial impact on the Shiba states, leading to a decrease in Shiba state energies and the creation of new states when the magnetic impurity approaches the boundary.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariant quantization for circuits including Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a new theory of superconductivity has been put forward that attributes the origin of superconductivity to the appearance of a non-trivial Berry connection from many-electron wave functions.
  This theory reproduces the major results of the BCS theory with conserving the particle number, and predicts the single-electron supercurrent tunneling across the Josephson junction with keeping the correct Josephson relation. We re-examine the quantization of superconducting qubit circuits by taking into account the above development, and show that the dynamical variables used in the standard theory, the flux nodes relating to the voltage, should be replaced by those relating to the electromagnetic vector potential. The fact that the Josephson junction tunneling allows the single-electron supercurrent tunneling is the reason for the existence of excited single electrons in superconducting qubits with Josephson junctions. We predict that it will be avoided by weakening the coupling between two superconductors in the Josephson junction.</description>

      <title>1/f frequency fluctuations due to kinetic inductance in CoSi$_2$ microwave cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cobalt disilicide provides a promising nearly-epitaxial superconducting material on silicon, which is compatible with high-density integrated circuit technology. We have characterized CoSi$_{2}$ superconducting microwave cavities around 5.5 GHz for resonance frequency fluctuations at temperatures 10 - 200 mK. We found relatively weak fluctuations $(\delta f/f)^2$ following the spectral density $A/f^{\gamma} $, with $A \simeq 6 \times 10^{-16}$ and $\gamma$ slightly below 1 at an average number of photons of $10^4$; the noise decreased with measurement power as $1/P^{1/2}$. We identify the noise as arising from kinetic inductance fluctuations and discuss possible origins of such fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Efficient electronic cooling above 2 K by niobium-based superconducting tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous applications, from industrial non-destructive imaging through ultra-sensitive photon counting to various implementations of solid-state quantum computers require low temperatures for their sensor and processor chips. Replacing the bulky cryo-liquid based cooling stages of cryo-enabled instruments by chip scale refrigeration is envisioned to disruptively reduce the system size similarly as microprocessors did for computers. Chip scale cooling has been demonstrated with electronic refrigerators based on tunnel junctions in the sub-1 K temperature range. Here, we extend the operation temperature to above 2 K, thereby, bridging the gap between electronic and pulse tube refrigerators. We report on scalable Al-AlOx-Nb superconducting tunnel junction cooler technology that can deliver electronic cooling power of ~ mW/mm^2, which is enough to demonstrate significant electron temperature reduction of 0.82 K against the phonon bath at 2.4 K (34% relative cooling). Our work shows that the key material of integrated superconducting circuits (niobium) enables powerful cryogenic refrigerator technology. This result is a prerequisite for practical cryogenic chip scale refrigerators and, at the same time, it introduces a new electro-thermal tool for quantum heat transport experiments.</description>

      <title>Light-driven interlayer propagation of collective-mode excitations in layered superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductors exhibit a nonlinear interaction with an applied light, which can resonantly excite the collective amplitude (Higgs) mode. Here we study light-induced dynamics of layered superconductors, where each layer is coupled to adjacent layers via the Josephson coupling and the first few layers near the surface are driven by an in-plane-polarized light. We study the system under the assumption that the interlayer Coulomb interactions are sufficiently screened out and that the phase-difference mode becomes available in the low-energy regime. We find that interlayer transport is induced via excitations of the collective amplitude and phase-difference modes, even when the applied electric field is parallel to the planes. We provide analytic calculations as well as numerical simulations of the real-time dynamics, and investigate the influence on the light-induced interlayer Josephson current and intralayer third-harmonic generation.</description>

      <title>Kondo Effect in Micron Size Device Fabricated From Flakes of Mn Doped Bi2Se3 Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single crystals of Mn0.03Bi1.97Se3 were synthesized by modified Bridgman technique and phase purity was confirmed via XRD analysis. EDAX analysis has verified the stoichiometric ratio of elements in the sample. Sample flakes were transferred to the SiO2/Si n-type substrate by mechanical exfoliation technique. Four probe gold contacts were etched with the help of e-beam lithography by masking and lift off process. Resistivity measurement was performed in four probe configurations in 2-300 K temperature range. We report evidence for Kon-do effect in Mn0.03Bi1.97Se3 micro-flakes with Tmin of 14.4 K.</description>

      <title>Quenched pair breaking by interlayer correlations as a key to superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with $T_\mathrm{c} \simeq 80~\mathrm{K}$ under high pressure opens up a new route to high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ superconductivity. This material realizes a bilayer square lattice model featuring a strong interlayer hybridization unlike many unconventional superconductors. A key question in this regard concerns how electronic correlations driven by the interlayer hybridization affect the low-energy electronic structure and the concomitant superconductivity. Here, we demonstrate using a cluster dynamical mean-field theory that the interlayer electronic correlations (IECs) induce a Lifshitz transition resulting in a change of Fermi surface topology. By solving an appropriate gap equation, we further show that the dominant pairing instability (intraorbital $s$-wave/interorbital $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave, or $s \pm$-wave in a bonding-antibonding basis) is enhanced by the IECs. The underlying mechanism is the quenching of a strong ferromagnetic channel, resulting from the Lifshitz transition driven by the IECs. Based on this picture, we provide a possible reason of why superconductivity emerges only under high pressure.</description>
