      <title>Auxiliary-Variable Adaptive Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of ensuring safety and feasibility in control systems using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). Existing CBF-based Quadratic Programs (CBF-QPs) often encounter feasibility issues due to mixed relative degree constraints, input nullification problems, and the presence of tight or time-varying control bounds, which can lead to infeasible solutions and compromised safety. To address these challenges, we propose Auxiliary-Variable Adaptive Control Barrier Functions (AVCBFs), a novel framework that introduces auxiliary functions to dynamically adjust CBF constraints without the need of excessive additional constraints. The AVCBF method ensures that all components of the control input explicitly appear in the desired-order safety constraint, thereby improving feasibility while maintaining safety guarantees. Additionally, we introduce an automatic tuning method that iteratively adjusts AVCBF hyperparameters to ensure feasibility and safety with less conservatism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in adaptive cruise control and obstacle avoidance scenarios, showing that AVCBFs outperform existing CBF methods by reducing infeasibility and enhancing adaptive safety control under tight or time-varying control bounds.</description>

      <title>Discrete implementations of sliding-mode controllers with barrier-function adaptations require a revised framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Challenges in the discrete implementation of sliding-mode controllers (SMC) with barrier-function-based adaptations are analyzed, revealing fundamental limitations in conventional design frameworks. It is shown that under uniform sampling, the original continuous-time problem motivating these controllers becomes theoretically unsolvable under standard assumptions. To address this incompatibility, a revised control framework is proposed, explicitly incorporating actuator capacity constraints and sampled-data dynamics. Within this structure, the behavior of barrier function-based adaptive controllers (BFASMC) is rigorously examined, explaining their empirical success in digital implementations. A key theoretical result establishes an explicit relation between the actuator capacity, the sampling rate, and the width of the barrier function, providing a principled means to tune these controllers for different application requirements. This relation enables the resolution of various design problems with direct practical implications. A modified BFASMC is then introduced, systematically leveraging sampling effects to ensure finite-time convergence to a positively invariant predefined set, a key advancement for guaranteeing predictable safety margins.</description>

      <title>Leader-Follower Formation Tracking Control of Quadrotor UAVs Using Bearing Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the practical problem of distributed formation tracking control of a group of quadrotor vehicles in a relaxed sensing graph topology with a very limited sensor set, where only one leader vehicle can access the global position. Other vehicles in the formation are assumed to only have access to inter-agent bearing (direction) measurements and relative velocities with respect to their neighbor agents. A hierarchical control architecture is adopted for each quadrotor, combining a high-gain attitude inner-loop and an outer-loop bearing-based formation controller with collision avoidance augmentation. The proposed method enables a group of quadrotors to track arbitrary bearing persistently exciting desired formations, including time-varying shapes and rotational maneuvers, such that each quadrotor only requires relative measurements to at least one neighboring quadrotor. The effective performance of the control strategy is validated by numerical simulations in MATLAB and real-world experiments with three quadrotors.</description>

      <title>Learning-based Model Predictive Control for Passenger-Oriented Train Rescheduling with Flexible Train Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on passenger-oriented real-time train rescheduling, considering flexible train composition and rolling stock circulation, by integrating learning-based and optimization-based approaches. A learning-based model predictive control (MPC) approach is developed for real-time train rescheduling with flexible train composition and rolling stock circulation to address time-varying passenger demands. In the proposed approach, first, the values of the integer variables are obtained by pre-trained long short-term memory (LSTM) networks; next, they are fixed and the values of continuous variables are determined via nonlinear constrained optimization. The learning-based MPC approach enables us to jointly consider efficiency and constraint satisfaction by combining learning-based and optimization-based approaches. In order to reduce the number of integer variables, four presolve techniques are developed to prune a subset of integer decision variables. Numerical simulations based on real-life data from the Beijing urban rail transit system are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed learning-based MPC approach.</description>

      <title>A Deep Neural Network-based Frequency Predictor for Frequency-Constrained Optimal Power Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) and frequency nadir should be considered in real-time frequency-constrained optimal power flow (FCOPF) to ensure frequency stability of the modern power systems. Since calculating the frequency response is complex, deep neural network (DNN) could be adopted to capture the nonlinearities and estimate those two metrics accurately. Therefore, in this paper, a DNN-based frequency predictor is developed with the training data obtained from time-domain simulations using PSCAD/EMTDC. Subsequently, it is reformulated using a set of mixed-integer linear programming formulations and then embedded into the FCOPF framework as constraints to ensure grid frequency stability, creating the proposed DNN-FCOPF model. Two benchmark models, a traditional OPF without any frequency constraints and a linear system-wide RoCoF-constrained FCOPF, are also implemented to gauge the proposed DNN-FCOPF. Finally, the solutions obtained with these three models are compared and evaluated with time-domain simulations using PSCAD under various load profiles, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed DNN-FCOPF.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Formulations for System Identification of Linear Dynamics with Bilinear Observation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the identification problem for the systems characterized by linear time-invariant dynamics with bilinear observation models. More precisely, we consider a suitable parametric description of the system and formulate the identification problem as the estimation of the parameters defining the mathematical model of the system using the observed input-output data. To this end, we propose two probabilistic frameworks. The first framework employs the Maximum Likelihood (ML) approach, which accurately finds the optimal parameter estimates by maximizing a likelihood function. Subsequently, we develop a tractable first-order method to solve the optimization problem corresponding to the proposed ML approach. Additionally, to further improve tractability and computational efficiency of the estimation of the parameters, we introduce an alternative framework based on the Expectation--Maximization (EM) approach, which estimates the parameters using an appropriately designed cost function. We show that the EM cost function is invex, which ensures the existence and uniqueness of the optimal solution. Furthermore, we derive the closed-form solution for the optimal parameters and also prove the recursive feasibility of the EM procedure. Through extensive numerical experiments, the practical implementation of the proposed approaches is demonstrated, and their estimation efficacy is verified and compared, highlighting the effectiveness of the methods to accurately estimate the system parameters and their potential for real-world applications in scenarios involving bilinear observation structures.</description>

      <title>Design of a Visual Pose Estimation Algorithm for Moon Landing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to make a pinpoint landing on the Moon, the spacecraft's navigation system must be accurate. To achieve the desired accuracy, navigational drift caused by the inertial sensors must be corrected. One way to correct this drift is to use absolute navigation solutions. In this study, a terrain absolute navigation method to estimate the spacecraft's position and attitude is proposed. This algorithm uses the position of the craters below the spacecraft for estimation. Craters seen by the camera onboard the spacecraft are detected and identified using a crater database known beforehand. In order to focus on estimation algorithms, image processing and crater matching steps are skipped. The accuracy of the algorithm and the effect of the crater number used for estimation are inspected by performing simulations.</description>

      <title>Safe Beyond the Horizon: Efficient Sampling-based MPC with Neural Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common problem when using model predictive control (MPC) in practice is the satisfaction of safety specifications beyond the prediction horizon. While theoretical works have shown that safety can be guaranteed by enforcing a suitable terminal set constraint or a sufficiently long prediction horizon, these techniques are difficult to apply and thus are rarely used by practitioners, especially in the case of general nonlinear dynamics. To solve this problem, we impose a tradeoff between exact recursive feasibility, computational tractability, and applicability to ''black-box'' dynamics by learning an approximate discrete-time control barrier function and incorporating it into a variational inference MPC (VIMPC), a sampling-based MPC paradigm. To handle the resulting state constraints, we further propose a new sampling strategy that greatly reduces the variance of the estimated optimal control, improving the sample efficiency, and enabling real-time planning on a CPU. The resulting Neural Shield-VIMPC (NS-VIMPC) controller yields substantial safety improvements compared to existing sampling-based MPC controllers, even under badly designed cost functions. We validate our approach in both simulation and real-world hardware experiments.</description>

      <title>Inferring System and Optimal Control Parameters of Closed-Loop Systems from Partial Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the joint problem of system identification and inverse optimal control for discrete-time stochastic Linear Quadratic Regulators. We analyze finite and infinite time horizons in a partially observed setting, where the state is observed noisily. To recover closed-loop system parameters, we develop inference methods based on probabilistic state-space model (SSM) techniques. First, we show that the system parameters exhibit non-identifiability in the infinite-horizon from closed-loop measurements, and we provide exact and numerical methods to disentangle the parameters. Second, to improve parameter identifiability, we show that we can further enhance recovery by either (1) incorporating additional partial measurements of the control signals or (2) moving to the finite-horizon setting. We further illustrate the performance of our methodology through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>DDAT: Diffusion Policies Enforcing Dynamically Admissible Robot Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models excel at creating images and videos thanks to their multimodal generative capabilities. These same capabilities have made diffusion models increasingly popular in robotics research, where they are used for generating robot motion. However, the stochastic nature of diffusion models is fundamentally at odds with the precise dynamical equations describing the feasible motion of robots. Hence, generating dynamically admissible robot trajectories is a challenge for diffusion models. To alleviate this issue, we introduce DDAT: Diffusion policies for Dynamically Admissible Trajectories to generate provably admissible trajectories of black-box robotic systems using diffusion models. A sequence of states is a dynamically admissible trajectory if each state of the sequence belongs to the reachable set of its predecessor by the robot's equations of motion. To generate such trajectories, our diffusion policies project their predictions onto a dynamically admissible manifold during both training and inference to align the objective of the denoiser neural network with the dynamical admissibility constraint. The auto-regressive nature of these projections along with the black-box nature of robot dynamics render these projections immensely challenging. We thus enforce admissibility by iteratively sampling a polytopic under-approximation of the reachable set of a state onto which we project its predicted successor, before iterating this process with the projected successor. By producing accurate trajectories, this projection eliminates the need for diffusion models to continually replan, enabling one-shot long-horizon trajectory planning. We demonstrate that our framework generates higher quality dynamically admissible robot trajectories through extensive simulations on a quadcopter and various MuJoCo environments, along with real-world experiments on a Unitree GO1 and GO2.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent Multi-armed Bandits with Minimum Reward Guarantee Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of maximizing social welfare while ensuring fairness in a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) setting. In this problem, a centralized decision-maker takes actions over time, generating random rewards for various agents. Our goal is to maximize the sum of expected cumulative rewards, a.k.a. social welfare, while ensuring that each agent receives an expected reward that is at least a constant fraction of the maximum possible expected reward.
  Our proposed algorithm, RewardFairUCB, leverages the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) technique to achieve sublinear regret bounds for both fairness and social welfare. The fairness regret measures the positive difference between the minimum reward guarantee and the expected reward of a given policy, whereas the social welfare regret measures the difference between the social welfare of the optimal fair policy and that of the given policy.
  We show that RewardFairUCB algorithm achieves instance-independent social welfare regret guarantees of $\tilde{O}(T^{1/2})$ and a fairness regret upper bound of $\tilde{O}(T^{3/4})$. We also give the lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ for both social welfare and fairness regret. We evaluate RewardFairUCB's performance against various baseline and heuristic algorithms using simulated data and real world data, highlighting trade-offs between fairness and social welfare regrets.</description>

      <title>Categorical Lyapunov Theory I: Stability of Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lyapunov's theorem provides a fundamental characterization of the stability of dynamical systems. This paper presents a categorical framework for Lyapunov theory, generalizing stability analysis with Lyapunov functions categorically. Core to our approach is the set of axioms underlying a setting for stability, which give the necessary ingredients for ``doing Lyapunov theory'' in a category of interest. With these minimal assumptions, we define the stability of equilibria, formulate Lyapunov morphisms, and demonstrate that the existence of Lyapunov morphisms is necessary and sufficient for establishing the stability of flows. To illustrate these constructions, we show how classical notions of stability, e.g., for continuous and discrete time dynamical systems, are captured by this categorical framework for Lyapunov theory. Finally, to demonstrate the extensibility of our framework, we illustrate how enriched categories, e.g., Lawvere metric spaces, yield settings for stability enabling one to ``do Lyapunov theory'' in enriched categories.</description>

      <title>TAG: A Decentralized Framework for Multi-Agent Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15425v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical organization is fundamental to biological systems and human societies, yet artificial intelligence systems often rely on monolithic architectures that limit adaptability and scalability. Current hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) approaches typically restrict hierarchies to two levels or require centralized training, which limits their practical applicability. We introduce TAME Agent Framework (TAG), a framework for constructing fully decentralized hierarchical multi-agent systems.TAG enables hierarchies of arbitrary depth through a novel LevelEnv concept, which abstracts each hierarchy level as the environment for the agents above it. This approach standardizes information flow between levels while preserving loose coupling, allowing for seamless integration of diverse agent types. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TAG by implementing hierarchical architectures that combine different RL agents across multiple levels, achieving improved performance over classical multi-agent RL baselines on standard benchmarks. Our results show that decentralized hierarchical organization enhances both learning speed and final performance, positioning TAG as a promising direction for scalable multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Network Resource Optimization for ML-Based UAV Condition Monitoring with Vibration Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As smart cities begin to materialize, the role of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and their reliability becomes increasingly important. One aspect of reliability relates to Condition Monitoring (CM), where Machine Learning (ML) models are leveraged to identify abnormal and adverse conditions. Given the resource-constrained nature of next-generation edge networks, the utilization of precious network resources must be minimized. This work explores the optimization of network resources for ML-based UAV CM frameworks. The developed framework uses experimental data and varies the feature extraction aggregation interval to optimize ML model selection. Additionally, by leveraging dimensionality reduction techniques, there is a 99.9% reduction in network resource consumption.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a control design methodology, stability criteria, and performance bounds for autonomous helicopter aerial refueling. Autonomous aerial refueling is particularly difficult due to the aerodynamic interaction between the wake of the tanker, the contact-sensitive nature of the maneuver, and the uncertainty in drogue motion. Since the probe tip is located significantly away from the helicopter's center-of-gravity, its position (and velocity) is strongly sensitive to the helicopter's attitude (and angular rates). In addition, the fact that the helicopter is operating at high speeds to match the velocity of the tanker forces it to maintain a particular orientation, making the docking maneuver especially challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel outer-loop position controller that incorporates the probe position and velocity into the feedback loop. The position and velocity of the probe tip depend both on the position (velocity) and on the attitude (angular rates) of the aircraft. We derive analytical guarantees for docking performance in terms of the uncertainty of the drogue motion and the angular acceleration of the helicopter, using the ultimate boundedness property of the closed-loop error dynamics. Simulations are performed on a high-fidelity UH60 helicopter model with a high-fidelity drogue motion under wind effects to validate the proposed approach for realistic refueling scenarios. These high-fidelity simulations reveal that the proposed control methodology yields an improvement of 36% in the 2-norm docking error compared to the existing standard controller.</description>

      <title>Online Planning of Power Flows for Power Systems Against Bushfires Using Spatial Context</title>

Abstract: The 2019-20 Australia bushfire incurred numerous economic losses and significantly affected the operations of power systems. A power station or transmission line can be significantly affected due to bushfires, leading to an increase in operational costs. We study a fundamental but challenging problem of planning the optimal power flow (OPF) for power systems subject to bushfires. Considering the stochastic nature of bushfire spread, we develop a model to capture such dynamics based on Moore's neighborhood model. Under a periodic inspection scheme that reveals the in-situ bushfire status, we propose an online optimization modeling framework that sequentially plans the power flows in the electricity network. Our framework assumes that the spread of bushfires is non-stationary over time, and the spread and containment probabilities are unknown. To meet these challenges, we develop a contextual online learning algorithm that treats the in-situ geographical information of the bushfire as a 'spatial context'. The online learning algorithm learns the unknown probabilities sequentially based on the observed data and then makes the OPF decision accordingly. The sequential OPF decisions aim to minimize the regret function, which is defined as the cumulative loss against the clairvoyant strategy that knows the true model parameters. We provide a theoretical guarantee of our algorithm by deriving a bound on the regret function, which outperforms the regret bound achieved by other benchmark algorithms. Our model assumptions are verified by the real bushfire data from NSW, Australia, and we apply our model to two power systems to illustrate its applicability.</description>

      <title>Graphon Particle Systems, Part I: Spatio-Temporal Approximation and Law of Large Numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of graphon particle systems with time-varying random coefficients. In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from the stochastic processes associated with the particle labels. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over a large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the limiting dynamics of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</description>

      <title>A Parameterized Nonlinear Magnetic Equivalent Circuit for Design and Fast Analysis of Radial Flux Magnetic Gears with Bridges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08375v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic gears offer significant advantages over mechanical gears, including contactless power transfer, but require efficient and accurate modeling tools for optimization and commercialization. This paper presents the first fast and accurate 2D nonlinear magnetic equivalent circuit (MEC) model for radial flux magnetic gears (RFMG), capable of analyzing designs with bridges critical structural elements that introduce intense localized magnetic saturation. The proposed model systematically incorporates nonlinear effects while maintaining rapid simulation times through a parameterized geometry and adaptable flux tube distribution. A robust initialization strategy ensures reliable performance across diverse designs. Extensive validation against nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) confirms the model's accuracy in torque and flux density predictions. A comprehensive parametric study of 140,000 designs demonstrates close agreement with FEA results, with simulations running up to 100 times faster. Unlike previous MEC approaches, this model provides a generalized, computationally efficient solution for analyzing a wide range of RFMG designs with or without bridges, making it particularly well-suited for large scale design optimization.</description>

Abstract: We study the distributed optimization problem over a graphon with a continuum of nodes, which is regarded as the limit of the distributed networked optimization as the number of nodes goes to infinity. Each node has a private local cost function. The global cost function, which all nodes cooperatively minimize, is the integral of the local cost functions on the node set. We propose stochastic gradient descent and gradient tracking algorithms over the graphon. We establish a general lemma for the upper bound estimation related to a class of time-varying differential inequalities with negative linear terms, based upon which, we prove that for both kinds of algorithms, the second moments of the nodes' states are uniformly bounded. Especially, for the stochastic gradient tracking algorithm, we transform the convergence analysis into the asymptotic property of coupled nonlinear differential inequalities with time-varying coefficients and develop a decoupling method. For both kinds of algorithms, we show that by choosing the time-varying algorithm gains properly, all nodes' states achieve $\mathcal{L}^{\infty}$-consensus for a connected graphon. Furthermore, if the local cost functions are strongly convex, then all nodes' states converge to the minimizer of the global cost function and the auxiliary states in the stochastic gradient tracking algorithm converge to the gradient value of the global cost function at the minimizer uniformly in mean square.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical DRL Approach for Resource Optimization in Multi-RIS Multi-Operator Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) emerge as a pivotal technology in the upcoming sixth-generation (6G) networks, their deployment within practical multiple operator (OP) networks presents significant challenges, including the coordination of RIS configurations among OPs, interference management, and privacy maintenance. A promising strategy is to treat RIS as a public resource managed by an RIS provider (RP), which can enhance resource allocation efficiency by allowing dynamic access for multiple OPs. However, the intricate nature of coordinating management and optimizing RIS configurations significantly complicates the implementation process. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) approach that decomposes the complicated RIS resource optimization problem into several subtasks. Specifically, a top-level RP-agent is responsible for RIS allocation, while low-level OP-agents control their assigned RISs and handle beamforming, RIS phase-shifts, and user association. By utilizing the semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) theory, we establish a sophisticated interaction mechanism between the RP and OPs, and introduce an advanced hierarchical proximal policy optimization (HPPO) algorithm. Furthermore, we propose an improved sequential-HPPO (S-HPPO) algorithm to address the curse of dimensionality encountered with a single RP-agent. Experimental results validate the stability of the HPPO algorithm across various environmental parameters, demonstrating its superiority over other benchmarks for joint resource optimization. Finally, we conduct a detailed comparative analysis between the proposed S-HPPO and HPPO algorithms, showcasing that the S-HPPO algorithm achieves faster convergence and improved performance in large-scale RIS allocation scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Risk-Averse Just-In-Time Scheme for Learning-Based Operation of Microgrids with Coupled Electricity-Hydrogen-Ammonia under Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Risk-Averse Just-In-Time (RAJIT) operation scheme for Ammonia-Hydrogen-based Micro-Grids (AHMGs) to boost electricity-hydrogen-ammonia coupling under uncertainties. First, an off-grid AHMG model is developed, featuring a novel multi-mode ammonia synthesis process and a hydrogen-ammonia dual gas turbine with tunable feed-in ratios. Subsequently, a state-behavior mapping strategy linking hydrogen storage levels with the operation modes of ammonia synthesis is established to prevent cost-ineffective shutdowns. The proposed model substantially improves operational flexibility but results in a challenging nonlinear fractional program. Based upon this model, a data-driven RAJIT scheme is developed for the real-time rolling optimization of AHMGs. Unlike conventional one-size-fits-all schemes using one optimization method throughout, the data driven RAJIT intelligently switches between cost-effective deterministic optimization and risk-averse online-learning distributionally robust optimization depending on actual risk profiles, thus capitalizing on the respective strengths of these two optimization methods. To facilitate the solution of the resulting nonlinear program, we develop an equivalent-reformulation-based solution methodology by leveraging a constraint-tightening technique. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme guarantees safety and yields an overall cost reduction up to 14.6% compared with several state-of-the-art methods.</description>

Abstract: The electric distribution system is a cornerstone of modern life, playing a critical role in the daily activities and well-being of individuals. As the world transitions toward a decarbonized future, where even mobility relies on electricity, ensuring the resilience of the grid becomes paramount. This paper introduces novel resilience metrics designed to equip utilities and stakeholders with actionable tools to assess performance during storm events. The metrics focus on emergency storm response and the resources required to improve customer service. The practical calculation of the metrics from historical utility data is demonstrated for multiple storm events. Additionally, the metrics' improvement with added crews is estimated by "rerunning history" with faster restoration. By applying this resilience framework, utilities can enhance their restoration strategies and unlock potential cost savings, benefiting both providers and customers in an era of heightened energy dependency.</description>

      <title>Quantum Markov Decision Processes: Dynamic and Semi-Definite Programs for Optimal Solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, building on the formulation of quantum Markov decision processes (q-MDPs) presented in our previous work [{\sc N.~Saldi, S.~Sanjari, and S.~Y\"{u}ksel}, {\em Quantum Markov Decision Processes: General Theory, Approximations, and Classes of Policies}, SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization, 2024], our focus shifts to the development of semi-definite programming approaches for optimal policies and value functions of both open-loop and classical-state-preserving closed-loop policies. First, by using the duality between the dynamic programming and the semi-definite programming formulations of any q-MDP with open-loop policies, we establish that the optimal value function is linear and there exists a stationary optimal policy among open-loop policies. Then, using these results, we establish a method for computing an approximately optimal value function and formulate computation of optimal stationary open-loop policy as a bi-linear program. Next, we turn our attention to classical-state-preserving closed-loop policies. Dynamic programming and semi-definite programming formulations for classical-state-preserving closed-loop policies are established, where duality of these two formulations similarly enables us to prove that the optimal policy is linear and there exists an optimal stationary classical-state-preserving closed-loop policy. Then, similar to the open-loop case, we establish a method for computing the optimal value function and pose computation of optimal stationary classical-state-preserving closed-loop policies as a bi-linear program.</description>

Abstract: Patient transfer devices allow to move patients passively in hospitals and care centers. Instead of hoisting the patient, it would be beneficial in some cases to assist their movement, enabling them to move by themselves. However, patient assistance requires devices capable of precisely controlling output forces at significantly higher speeds than those used for patient transfers alone, and a single motor solution would be over-sized and show poor efficiency to do both functions. This paper presents a dual-motor actuator and control schemes adapted for a patient mobility equipment that can be used to transfer patients, assist patient in their movement, and help prevent falls. The prototype is shown to be able to lift patients weighing up to 318 kg, to assist a patient with a desired force of up to 100 kg with a precision of 7.8%. Also, a smart control scheme to manage falls is shown to be able to stop a patient who is falling by applying a desired deceleration.</description>

      <title>DistRL: An Asynchronous Distributed Reinforcement Learning Framework for On-Device Control Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14803v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On-device control agents, especially on mobile devices, are responsible for operating mobile devices to fulfill users' requests, enabling seamless and intuitive interactions. Integrating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into these agents enhances their ability to understand and execute complex commands, thereby improving user experience. However, fine-tuning MLLMs for on-device control presents significant challenges due to limited data availability and inefficient online training processes. This paper introduces DistRL, a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency of online RL fine-tuning for mobile device control agents. DistRL employs centralized training and decentralized data acquisition to ensure efficient fine-tuning in the context of dynamic online interactions. Additionally, the framework is backed by our tailor-made RL algorithm, which effectively balances exploration with the prioritized utilization of collected data to ensure stable and robust training. Our experiments show that, on average, DistRL delivers a 3X improvement in training efficiency and enables training data collection 2.4X faster than the leading synchronous multi-machine methods. Notably, after training, DistRL achieves a 20% relative improvement in success rate compared to state-of-the-art methods on general Android tasks from an open benchmark, significantly outperforming existing approaches while maintaining the same training time. These results validate DistRL as a scalable and efficient solution, offering substantial improvements in both training efficiency and agent performance for real-world, in-the-wild device control tasks.</description>

      <title>UniDB: A Unified Diffusion Bridge Framework via Stochastic Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05749v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion bridge models leverage Doob's $h$-transform to establish fixed endpoints between distributions, demonstrating promising results in image translation and restoration tasks. However, these approaches frequently produce blurred or excessively smoothed image details and lack a comprehensive theoretical foundation to explain these shortcomings. To address these limitations, we propose UniDB, a unified framework for diffusion bridges based on Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC). UniDB formulates the problem through an SOC-based optimization and derives a closed-form solution for the optimal controller, thereby unifying and generalizing existing diffusion bridge models. We demonstrate that existing diffusion bridges employing Doob's $h$-transform constitute a special case of our framework, emerging when the terminal penalty coefficient in the SOC cost function tends to infinity. By incorporating a tunable terminal penalty coefficient, UniDB achieves an optimal balance between control costs and terminal penalties, substantially improving detail preservation and output quality. Notably, UniDB seamlessly integrates with existing diffusion bridge models, requiring only minimal code modifications. Extensive experiments across diverse image restoration tasks validate the superiority and adaptability of the proposed framework. Our code is available at https://github.com/UniDB-SOC/UniDB/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of robust information selection for a Bayesian hypothesis testing / classification task, where the goal is to identify the true state of the world from a finite set of hypotheses based on observations from the selected information sources. We introduce a novel misclassification penalty framework, which enables non-uniform treatment of different misclassification events. Extending the classical subset selection framework, we study the problem of selecting a subset of sources that minimize the maximum penalty of misclassification under a limited budget, despite deletions or failures of a subset of the selected sources. We characterize the curvature properties of the objective function and propose an efficient greedy algorithm with performance guarantees. Next, we highlight certain limitations of optimizing for the maximum penalty metric and propose a submodular surrogate metric to guide the selection of the information set. We propose a greedy algorithm with near-optimality guarantees for optimizing the surrogate metric. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithms in several instances of the information set selection problem.</description>
