      <title>Computing and Bounding Equilibrium Concentrations in Athermic Chemical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing equilibrium concentrations of molecular complexes is generally analytically intractable and requires numerical approaches. In this work we focus on the polymer-monomer level, where indivisible molecules (monomers) combine to form complexes (polymers). Rather than employing free-energy parameters for each polymer, we focus on the athermic setting where all interactions preserve enthalpy. This setting aligns with the strongly bonded (domain-based) regime in DNA nanotechnology when strands can bind in different ways, but always with maximum overall bonding -- and is consistent with the saturated configurations in the Thermodynamic Binding Networks (TBNs) model. Within this context, we develop an iterative algorithm for assigning polymer concentrations to satisfy detailed-balance, where on-target (desired) polymers are in high concentrations and off-target (undesired) polymers are in low. Even if not directly executed, our algorithm provides effective insights into upper bounds on concentration of off-target polymers, connecting combinatorial arguments about discrete configurations such as those in the TBN model to real-valued concentrations. We conclude with an application of our method to decreasing leak in DNA logic and signal propagation. Our results offer a new framework for design and verification of equilibrium concentrations when configurations are distinguished by entropic forces.</description>

      <title>Identifying Protein Co-regulatory Network Logic by Solving B-SAT Problems through Gate-based Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is growing awareness that the success of pharmacologic interventions on living organisms is significantly impacted by context and timing of exposure. In turn, this complexity has led to an increased focus on regulatory network dynamics in biology and our ability to represent them in a high-fidelity way, in silico. Logic network models show great promise here and their parameter estimation can be formulated as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) that is well-suited to the often sparse, incomplete data in biology. Unfortunately, even in the case of Boolean logic, the combinatorial complexity of these problems grows rapidly, challenging the creation of models at physiologically-relevant scales. That said, quantum computing, while still nascent, facilitates novel information-processing paradigms with the potential for transformative impact in problems such as this one. In this work, we take a first step at actualizing this potential by identifying the structure and Boolean decisional logic of a well-studied network linking 5 proteins involved in the neural development of the mammalian cortical area of the brain. We identify the protein-protein connectivity and binary decisional logic governing this network by formulating it as a Boolean Satisfiability (B-SAT) problem. We employ Grover's algorithm to solve the NP-hard problem faster than the exponential time complexity required by deterministic classical algorithms. Using approaches deployed on both quantum simulators and actual noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) hardware, we accurately recover several high-likelihood models from very sparse protein expression data. The results highlight the differential roles of data types in supporting accurate models; the impact of quantum algorithm design as it pertains to the mutability of quantum hardware; and the opportunities for accelerated discovery enabled by this approach.</description>
