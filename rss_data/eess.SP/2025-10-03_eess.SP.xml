      <title>JaneEye: A 12-nm 2K-FPS 18.9-$\mu$J/Frame Event-based Eye Tracking Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eye tracking has become a key technology for gaze-based interactions in Extended Reality (XR). However, conventional frame-based eye-tracking systems often fall short of XR's stringent requirements for high accuracy, low latency, and energy efficiency. Event cameras present a compelling alternative, offering ultra-high temporal resolution and low power consumption. In this paper, we present JaneEye, an energy-efficient event-based eye-tracking hardware accelerator designed specifically for wearable devices, leveraging sparse, high-temporal-resolution event data. We introduce an ultra-lightweight neural network architecture featuring a novel ConvJANET layer, which simplifies the traditional ConvLSTM by retaining only the forget gate, thereby halving computational complexity without sacrificing temporal modeling capability. Our proposed model achieves high accuracy with a pixel error of 2.45 on the 3ET+ dataset, using only 17.6K parameters, with up to 1250 Hz event frame rate. To further enhance hardware efficiency, we employ custom linear approximations of activation functions (hardsigmoid and hardtanh) and fixed-point quantization. Through software-hardware co-design, our 12-nm ASIC implementation operates at 400 MHz, delivering an end-to-end latency of 0.5 ms (equivalent to 2000 Frames Per Second (FPS)) at an energy efficiency of 18.9 $\mu$J/frame. JaneEye sets a new benchmark in low-power, high-performance eye-tracking solutions suitable for integration into next-generation XR wearables.</description>

      <title>Satellite Assignment Policy Learning for Coexistence in LEO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike in terrestrial cellular networks, certain frequency bands for low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems have thus far been allocated on a non-exclusive basis. In this context, systems that launch their satellites earlier (referred to as primary systems) are given spectrum access priority over those that launch later, known as secondary systems. For a secondary system to function, it is expected to either coordinate with primary systems or ensure that it does not cause excessive interference to primary ground users. Reliably meeting this interference constraint requires real-time knowledge of the receive beams of primary users, which in turn depends on the primary satellite-to-primary user associations. However, in practice, primary systems have thus far not publicly disclosed their satellite assignment policies; therefore, it becomes essential for secondary systems to develop methods to infer such policies. Assuming there is limited historical data indicating which primary satellites have served which primary users, we propose an end-to-end graph structure learning-based algorithm for learning highest elevation primary satellite assignment policies, that, upon deployment, can directly map the primary satellite coordinates into assignment decisions for the primary users. Simulation results show that our method can outperform the best baseline, achieving approximately a 15% improvement in prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Delay-Augmented Stacked Intelligent Surfaces: Potential, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stacked intelligent surfaces (SIS)s have been proposed recently as an enabling technology for Holographic Multiple Input Multiple Output (HMIMO) and Ultra-massive MIMO (umMIMO) technologies. Their utility can extend beyond spatial wave-domain processing of signals if they are enhanced with strategically-tuned symbol-duration level delays to enable temporal processing as well. In this work, we introduce the idea of a delay-augmented SIS (DA-SIS). We shed light on the feasibility of realizing delay units in an SIS. Then, we discuss the relevance of the proposed DA-SIS and present a use case that illustrates its potential, wherein the DA-SIS serves as an analog equalizer that aids in eliminating multi-path-induced inter-symbol-interference (ISI). We show how the number of elements affect the equalization process using the bit error rate (BER) as a metric, and demonstrate the potential of the DA-SIS in equalization via comparing with digital equalizers as a benchmark. Finally, we present opportunities and future research directions that can be undertaken to bring this idea to fruition.</description>

      <title>A Drone-mounted Magnetometer System for Automatic Interference Removal and Landmine Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Landmines have been extensively used in conflict zones as an indiscriminate weapon to control military movements, often remaining active long after hostilities have ended. Their presence poses a persistent danger to civilians, hindering post-war recovery efforts, causing injuries or death, and restricting access to essential land for agriculture and infrastructure. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) equipped with magnetometers are commonly used to detect remnant hidden landmines but come with significant technical challenges due to magnetic field interference from UAV electronics such as motors. We propose the use of a frame-mounted UAV-borne two-magnetometer payload to perform a two-step automated interference removal and landmine detection analysis. The first step removes interference via the Wavelet-Adaptive Interference Cancellation for Underdetermined Platform (WAIC-UP) method designed for spaceflight magnetometers. The second method uses the Rapid Unsupervised Detection of Events (RUDE) algorithm to detect landmine signatures. This two-step WAIC-UP/RUDE approach with multiple magnetometers achieves high-fidelity ordinance detection at a low computational cost and simplifies the design of magnetic survey payloads. We validate the method through a Monte Carlo simulation of randomized landmine placements in a 10 x 10 m square grid and drone motor interference. Additionally, we assess the efficacy of the algorithm by varying the drone's altitude, examining its performance at different heights above the ground.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning-Driven Resource Optimization in Full-Duplex ISAC with Movable Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a full-duplex (FD) scenario where a base station (BS) equipped with movable antennas (MAs) simultaneously provides communication services to a set of downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) users while also enabling sensing functionalities for target detection, thereby supporting integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology. Additionally, a receiving BS, also equipped with MAs (denoted as BS R), is responsible for capturing the reflected echo. To optimize this setup, we formulate an optimization problem aimed at maximizing the signal-to-noise and interference ratio (SINR) of the captured echo. This is achieved by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming vectors at the FD BS, the receiving beamforming vectors at both the FD BS and BS R, the UL users' transmit power, and the MAs' positions at both BSs, all while satisfying the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for both sensing and communication. Given the non-convex nature of the problem and the high coupling between the variables, we employ a gradient-based meta-learning (GML) approach tailored for large-scale optimization. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed meta-learning approach, achieving results within 99% of the optimal solution. Furthermore, the MA-based scheme outperforms several benchmark approaches, highlighting its advantages in practical ISAC applications.</description>

      <title>The Analysis and Performance of LODC-OFDM Signal in Nonlinear Rydberg Atomic Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atomic sensors have been seen as novel radio frequency (RF) measurements and the high sensitivity to a large range of frequencies makes it attractive for communications reception. However, the signal sensing process in Rydberg system involves sequential transduction from electromagnetic waves to optical signals and finally to electrical signals. The unipolar characteristic of the optical interface inherently restricts conventional OFDM reception. Therefore, adopting unipolar OFDM schemes, inspired by optical communication systems, becomes essential for compatible signal transmission. In this work, we investigate the amplitude modulation-to-amplitude modulation (AM-AM) characteristics of Rydberg atomic sensors, establishing an empirical approximation function. Building on the direct current-biased optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) framework, we propose a novel local oscillator direct current-biased OFDM (LODC-OFDM) scheme specifically optimized for Rydberg-based sensing, effectively addressing the broadband OFDM reception challenge. Then, we adopt Bussgang theorem to analyze the nonlinear distortion of LODC-OFDM signals and the results in closed-form solutions are derived for AM/AM curves approximated by Taylor series expansion and for the ideal pre-distortion case. In real experiments, the experimental and theoretical results fit well.</description>

      <title>SEP Analysis of 1-Bit Quantized SIMO Systems with QPSK over Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The average symbol error probability (SEP) of a 1-bit quantized single-input multiple-output (SIMO) system is analyzed under Rayleigh fading channels and quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulation. Previous studies have partially characterized the diversity gain for selection combining (SC). In this paper, leveraging a novel analytical method, an exact analytical SEP expression is derived for a 1-bit quantized SIMO system employing QPSK modulation at the transmitter and maximum ratio combining (MRC) at the receiver. The corresponding diversity and coding gains of a SIMO-MRC system are also determined. Furthermore, the diversity and coding gains of a 1-bit quantized SIMO-SC system are quantified for an arbitrary number of receive antennas, thereby extending and complementing prior results.</description>

      <title>3D 8-Ary Noise Modulation Using Bayesian- and Kurtosis-based Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel three-dimensional (3D) 8-ary noise modulation scheme that introduces a new dimension: the mixture probability of a Mixture of Gaussian (MoG) distribution. This proposed approach utilizes the dimensions of mean and variance, in addition to the new probability dimension. Within this framework, each transmitted symbol carries three bits, each corresponding to a distinct sub-channel. For detection, a combination of specialized detectors is employed: a simple threshold based detector for the first sub-channel bit (modulated by the mean), a Maximum-Likelihood (ML) detector for the second sub-channel bit (modulated by the variance), a Kurtosis-based, Jarque-Bera (JB) test, and Bayesian Hypothesis (BHT)-based detectors for the third bit (modulated by the MoG probability). The Kurtosis- and JB-based detectors specifically distinguish between Gaussian (or near-Gaussian) and non-Gaussian MoG distributions by leveraging higher-order statistical measures. The Bit Error Probabilities (BEPs) are derived for the threshold-, Kurtosis-, and BHT-based detectors. The optimum threshold for the Kurtosis-based detector is also derived in a tractable manner. Simulation results demonstrate that a comparably low BEP is achieved for the third sub-channel bit relative to existing two-dimensional (2D) schemes. Simultaneously, the proposed scheme increases the data rate by a factor of 1.5 and 3 compared to the Generalized Quadratic noise modulator and the classical binary KLJN noise modulator, respectively. Furthermore, the Kurtosis-based detector offers a low-complexity solution, achieving an acceptable BEP of approximately 0.06.</description>

      <title>Exactly or Approximately Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Estimation According to Wasserstein Radii Being Small or Large</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper primarily considers the robust estimation problem under Wasserstein distance constraints on the parameter and noise distributions in the linear measurement model with additive noise, which can be formulated as an infinite-dimensional nonconvex minimax problem. We prove that the existence of a saddle point for this problem is equivalent to that for a finite-dimensional minimax problem, and give a counterexample demonstrating that the saddle point may not exist. Motivated by this observation, we present a verifiable necessary and sufficient condition whose parameters can be derived from a convex problem and its dual. Additionally, we also introduce a simplified sufficient condition, which intuitively indicates that when the Wasserstein radii are small enough, the saddle point always exists. In the absence of the saddle point, we solve an finite-dimensional nonconvex minimax problem, obtained by restricting the estimator to be linear. Its optimal value establishes an upper bound on the robust estimation problem, while its optimal solution yields a robust linear estimator. Numerical experiments are also provided to validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Composite Generalized Quadratic Noise Modulation via Signal Addition: Towards Higher Dimensional Noise Modulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes superposing two Generalized Quadratic Noise Modulators (GQNM) by simply adding their outputs. It creates a 16-ary noise modulator that resembles QAM modulators in classical communication. It modulates the information bits on four different means and four different variances. It could also be applied to reach higher-order modulations than 16-ary schemes by adding the outputs of more than two modulators, which is not discussed in detail in this letter and left for future work. By selecting the parameters necessary for satisfying the theoretical distinguishability conditions provided in the paper, we can reach better performances in comparison to the Kirchhoff-Law Johnson Noise (KLJN) modulator and the GQNM modulator, which is verified by the simulations. The better result in terms of smaller Bit Error Probability (BEP) is achieved by increasing the complexity in the modulator, the transmitter, and the detectors in the receiver.</description>

      <title>Closed-form Single UAV-aided Emitter Localization and Trajectory Design Using Doppler and TOA Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a single Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicle (UAV)-aided localization algorithm which uses both Doppler and Time of Arrival (ToA) measurements is presented. In contrast to Doppler-based localization algorithms which are based on non-convex functions, exploiting ToA measurements in a Least-Square (LS) Doppler-based cost function, leads to a quadratic convex function whose minimizer lies on a line. Utilizing the ToA measurements in addition to the linear equation of minimizer, a closed form solution is obtained for the emitter location using a constrained LS optimization. In addition, a trajectory design of the UAV is provided which has also closed-form solution. Simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in comparison to some others in the literature.</description>

      <title>Performance Optimization for Movable Antenna Enhanced MISO-OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) technology offers a flexible approach to enhancing wireless channel conditions by adjusting antenna positions within a designated region. While most existing works focus on narrowband MA systems, this paper investigates MA position optimization for an MA-enhanced multiple-input single-output (MISO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system. This problem appears to be particularly challenging due to the frequency-flat nature of MA positioning, which should accommodate the channel conditions across different subcarriers. To overcome this challenge, we discretize the movement region into a multitude of sampling points, thereby converting the continuous position optimization problem into a discrete point selection problem. Although this problem is combinatorial, we develop an efficient partial enumeration algorithm to find the optimal solution using a branch-and-bound framework, where a graph-theoretic method is incorporated to effectively prune suboptimal solutions. In the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, a simplified graph-based algorithm is also proposed to obtain the optimal MA positions without the need for enumeration. Simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs), while narrowband-based antenna position optimization can achieve near-optimal performance.</description>

      <title>NGGAN: Noise Generation GAN Based on the Practical Measurement Dataset for Narrowband Powerline Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capturing comprehensive statistics of nonperiodic asynchronous impulsive noise is a critical issue in enhancing impulse noise processing for narrowband powerline communication (NB-PLC) transceivers. However, existing mathematical noise generative models capture only some of the characteristics of additive noise. Therefore, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN), called the noise-generation GAN (NGGAN), that learns the complicated characteristics of practically measured noise samples for data augmentation. To closely match the statistics of complicated noise in NB-PLC systems, we measured the NB-PLC noise via the analog coupling and bandpass filtering circuits of a commercial NB-PLC modem to build a realistic dataset. Specifically, the NGGAN design approaches based on the practically measured dataset are as follows: (i) we design the length of input signals that the NGGAN model can fit to facilitate cyclo-stationary noise generation. (ii) Wasserstein distance is used as a loss function to enhance the similarity between the generated noise and the training dataset and ensure that the sample diversity is sufficient for various applications. (iii) To measure the similarity performance of the GAN-based models based on mathematical and practically measured datasets, we perform quantitative and qualitative analyses. The training datasets include (1) a piecewise spectral cyclo-stationary Gaussian model (PSCGM), (2) a frequency-shift (FRESH) filter, and (3) practical measurements from NB-PLC systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed NGGAN trained using waveform characteristics is closer to the practically measured dataset in terms of the quality of the generated noise.</description>

      <title>Wearable and Ultra-Low-Power Fusion of EMG and A-Mode US for Hand-Wrist Kinematic Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hand gesture recognition based on biosignals has shown strong potential for developing intuitive human-machine interaction strategies that closely mimic natural human behavior. In particular, sensor fusion approaches have gained attention for combining complementary information and overcoming the limitations of individual sensing modalities, thereby enabling more robust and reliable systems. Among them, the fusion of surface electromyography (EMG) and A-mode ultrasound (US) is very promising. However, prior solutions rely on power-hungry platforms unsuitable for multi-day use and are limited to discrete gesture classification. In this work, we present an ultra-low-power (sub-50 mW) system for concurrent acquisition of 8-channel EMG and 4-channel A-mode US signals, integrating two state-of-the-art platforms into fully wearable, dry-contact armbands. We propose a framework for continuous tracking of 23 degrees of freedom (DoFs), 20 for the hand and 3 for the wrist, using a kinematic glove for ground-truth labeling. Our method employs lightweight encoder-decoder architectures with multi-task learning to simultaneously estimate hand and wrist joint angles. Experimental results under realistic sensor repositioning conditions demonstrate that EMG-US fusion achieves a root mean squared error of $10.6^\circ\pm2.0^\circ$, compared to $12.0^\circ\pm1^\circ$ for EMG and $13.1^\circ\pm2.6^\circ$ for US, and a R$^2$ score of $0.61\pm0.1$, with $0.54\pm0.03$ for EMG and $0.38\pm0.20$ for US.</description>

      <title>Computing on Dirty Paper: Interference-Free Integrated Communication and Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by Costa's pioneering work on dirty paper coding (DPC), this paper proposes a novel scheme for integrated communication and computing (ICC), named Computing on Dirty Paper, whereby the transmission of discrete data symbols for communication, and over-the-air computation (AirComp) of nomographic functions can be achieved simultaneously over common multiple-access channels. In particular, the proposed scheme allows for the integration of communication and computation in a manner that is asymptotically interference-free, by precanceling the computing symbols at the transmitters (TXs) using DPC principles. A simulation-based assessment of the proposed ICC scheme under a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) setup is also offered, including the evaluation of performance for data detection, and of mean-squared-error (MSE) performance for function computation, over a block of symbols. The results validate the proposed method and demonstrate its ability to significantly outperform state-of-the-art (SotA) ICC schemes in terms of both bit error rate (BER) and MSE.</description>

      <title>Joint Jammer Mitigation and Data Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-antenna (or MIMO) processing is a promising solution to the problem of jammer mitigation. Existing methods mitigate the jammer based on an estimate of its spatial signature that is acquired through a dedicated training phase. This strategy has two main drawbacks: (i) it reduces the communication rate since no data can be transmitted during the training phase and (ii) it can be evaded by smart or multi-antenna jammers that do not transmit during the training phase or that dynamically change their subspace through time-varying beamforming. To address these drawbacks, we propose Joint jammer Mitigation and data Detection (JMD), a novel paradigm for MIMO jammer mitigation. The core idea of JMD is to estimate and remove the jammer interference subspace jointly with detecting the legitimate transmit data over multiple time slots. Doing so removes the need for a dedicated and rate-reducing training period while being able to mitigate smart and dynamic multi-antenna jammers. We provide two JMD-type algorithms, SANDMAN and MAED, that differ in the way they estimate the channels of the legitimate transmitters and achieve different complexity-performance tradeoffs. Extensive simulations demonstrate the efficacy of JMD for jammer mitigation.</description>

      <title>A Secure Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing for Wireless Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) has garnered significant attention due to its superior performance in high-mobility scenarios, coupled with multiple waveform parameters that provide greater degrees of freedom for system design. This paper introduces a novel secure affine frequency division multiplexing (SE-AFDM) system, which advances prior designs by dynamically varying an AFDM pre-chirp parameter to enhance physical-layer security. In the SE-AFDM system, the pre-chirp parameter is dynamically generated from a codebook controlled by a long-period pseudo-noise (LPPN) sequence. Instead of applying spreading in the data domain, our parameter-domain spreading approach provides additional security while maintaining reliability and high spectrum efficiency. We also propose a synchronization framework to solve the problem of reliably and rapidly synchronizing the time-varying parameter in fast time-varying channels. The theoretical derivations prove that unsynchronized eavesdroppers cannot eliminate the nonlinear impact of the time-varying parameter and further provide useful guidance for codebook design. Simulation results demonstrate the security advantages of the proposed SE-AFDM system in high-mobility scenarios, while our hardware prototype validates the effectiveness of the proposed synchronization framework.</description>

      <title>Joint DOA and Attitude Sensing Based on Tri-Polarized Continuous Aperture Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates joint direction-of-arrival (DOA) and attitude sensing using tri-polarized continuous aperture arrays (CAPAs). By employing electromagnetic (EM) information theory, the spatially continuous received signals in tri-polarized CAPA are modeled, thereby enabling accurate DOA and attitude estimation. To facilitate subspace decomposition for continuous operators, an equivalent continuous-discrete transformation technique is developed. Moreover, both self- and cross-covariances of tri-polarized signals are exploited to construct a tri-polarized spectrum, significantly enhancing DOA estimation performance. Theoretical analyses reveal that the identifiability of attitude information fundamentally depends on the availability of prior target snapshots. Accordingly, two attitude estimation algorithms are proposed: one capable of estimating partial attitude information without prior knowledge, and the other achieving full attitude estimation when such knowledge is available. Numerical results demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Sensing-Secure ISAC: Ambiguity Function Engineering for Impairing Unauthorized Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) brings along unprecedented vulnerabilities to authorized sensing, necessitating the development of secure solutions. Sensing parameters are embedded within the target-reflected signal leaked to unauthorized passive radar sensing eavesdroppers (Eve), implying that they can silently extract sensory information without prior knowledge of the information data. To overcome this limitation, we propose a sensing-secure ISAC framework that ensures secure target detection and estimation for the legitimate system, while obfuscating unauthorized sensing without requiring any prior knowledge of Eve. By introducing artificial imperfections into the ambiguity function (AF) of ISAC signals, we introduce artificial targets into Eve's range profile which increase its range estimation ambiguity. In contrast, the legitimate sensing receiver (Alice) can suppress these AF artifacts using mismatched filtering, albeit at the expense of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss. Employing an OFDM signal, a structured subcarrier power allocation scheme is designed to shape the secure autocorrelation function (ACF), inserting periodic peaks to mislead Eve's range estimation and degrade target detection performance. To quantify the sensing security, we introduce peak sidelobe level (PSL) and integrated sidelobe level (ISL) as key performance metrics. Then, we analyze the three-way trade-offs between communication, legitimate sensing, and sensing security, highlighting the impact of the proposed sensing-secure ISAC signaling on system performance. We formulate a convex optimization problem to maximize ISAC performance while guaranteeing a certain sensing security level. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed sensing-secure ISAC signaling, demonstrating its ability to degrade Eve's target estimation while preserving Alice's performance.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Symbol-Level Precoding Efficiency Through Tensor Equivariant Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although symbol-level precoding (SLP) based on constructive interference (CI) exploitation offers performance gains, its high complexity remains a bottleneck. This paper addresses this challenge with an end-to-end deep learning (DL) framework with low inference complexity that leverages the structure of the optimal SLP solution in the closed-form and its inherent tensor equivariance (TE), where TE denotes that a permutation of the input induces the corresponding permutation of the output. Building upon the computationally efficient model-based formulations, as well as their known closed-form solutions, we analyze their relationship with linear precoding (LP) and investigate the corresponding optimality condition. We then construct a mapping from the problem formulation to the solution and prove its TE, based on which the designed networks reveal a specific parameter-sharing pattern that delivers low computational complexity and strong generalization. Leveraging these, we propose the backbone of the framework with an attention-based TE module, achieving linear computational complexity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such a framework is also applicable to imperfect CSI scenarios, where we design a TE-based network to map the CSI, statistics, and symbols to auxiliary variables. Simulation results show that the proposed framework captures substantial performance gains of optimal SLP, while achieving an approximately 80-times speedup over conventional methods and maintaining strong generalization across user numbers and symbol block lengths.</description>

      <title>A Control Theory inspired Exploration Method for a Linear Bandit driven by a Linear Gaussian Dynamical System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper introduces a linear bandit environment where the reward is the output of a known Linear Gaussian Dynamical System (LGDS). In this environment, we address the fundamental challenge of balancing exploration -- gathering information about the environment -- and exploitation -- selecting to the action with the highest predicted reward. We propose two algorithms, Kalman filter Upper Confidence Bound (Kalman-UCB) and Information filter Directed Exploration Action-selection (IDEA). Kalman-UCB uses the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty. IDEA selects actions that maximize the combination of the predicted reward and a term that quantifies how much an action minimizes the error of the Kalman filter state prediction, which depends on the LGDS property called observability. IDEA is motivated by applications such as hyperparameter optimization in machine learning. A major problem encountered in hyperparameter optimization is the large action spaces, which hinder the performance of methods inspired by principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty as they need to explore each action to lower reward prediction uncertainty. To predict if either Kalman-UCB or IDEA will perform better, a metric based on the LGDS properties is provided. This metric is validated with numerical results across a variety of randomly generated environments.</description>

      <title>CardioRAG: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework for Multimodal Chagas Disease Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chagas disease affects nearly 6 million people worldwide, with Chagas cardiomyopathy representing its most severe complication. In regions where serological testing capacity is limited, AI-enhanced electrocardiogram (ECG) screening provides a critical diagnostic alternative. However, existing machine learning approaches face challenges such as limited accuracy, reliance on large labeled datasets, and more importantly, weak integration with evidence-based clinical diagnostic indicators. We propose a retrieval-augmented generation framework, CardioRAG, integrating large language models with interpretable ECG-based clinical features, including right bundle branch block, left anterior fascicular block, and heart rate variability metrics. The framework uses variational autoencoder-learned representations for semantic case retrieval, providing contextual cases to guide clinical reasoning. Evaluation demonstrated high recall performance of 89.80%, with a maximum F1 score of 0.68 for effective identification of positive cases requiring prioritized serological testing. CardioRAG provides an interpretable, clinical evidence-based approach particularly valuable for resource-limited settings, demonstrating a pathway for embedding clinical indicators into trustworthy medical AI systems.</description>

      <title>NPN: Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space for Imaging Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imaging inverse problems aims to recover high-dimensional signals from undersampled, noisy measurements, a fundamentally ill-posed task with infinite solutions in the null-space of the sensing operator. To resolve this ambiguity, prior information is typically incorporated through handcrafted regularizers or learned models that constrain the solution space. However, these priors typically ignore the task-specific structure of that null-space. In this work, we propose \textit{Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space} (NPN), a novel class of regularization that, instead of enforcing structural constraints in the image domain, promotes solutions that lie in a low-dimensional projection of the sensing matrix's null-space with a neural network. Our approach has two key advantages: (1) Interpretability: by focusing on the structure of the null-space, we design sensing-matrix-specific priors that capture information orthogonal to the signal components that are fundamentally blind to the sensing process. (2) Flexibility: NPN is adaptable to various inverse problems, compatible with existing reconstruction frameworks, and complementary to conventional image-domain priors. We provide theoretical guarantees on convergence and reconstruction accuracy when used within plug-and-play methods. Empirical results across diverse sensing matrices demonstrate that NPN priors consistently enhance reconstruction fidelity in various imaging inverse problems, such as compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, with plug-and-play methods, unrolling networks, deep image prior, and diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Next-Generation AI-Native Wireless Communications: MCMC-Based Receiver Architectures for Unified Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receiver processing is a key technology for current and next-generation wireless communications. However, it faces significant challenges related to complexity and scalability as the number of antennas increases. Artificial intelligence (AI), a cornerstone of next-generation wireless networks, offers considerable potential for addressing these challenges. This paper proposes an AI-driven, universal MIMO receiver architecture based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Unlike existing AI-based methods that treat receiver processing as a black box, our MCMC-based approach functions as a generic Bayesian computing engine applicable to various processing tasks, including channel estimation, symbol detection, and channel decoding. This method enhances the interpretability, scalability, and flexibility of receivers in diverse scenarios. Furthermore, the proposed approach integrates these tasks into a unified probabilistic framework, thereby enabling overall performance optimization. This unified framework can also be seamlessly combined with data-driven learning methods to facilitate the development of fully intelligent communication receivers.</description>

      <title>Automated Defect Detection for Mass-Produced Electronic Components Based on YOLO Object Detection Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the defect detection of conventional industry components is time-consuming and labor-intensive, it leads to a significant burden on quality inspection personnel and makes it difficult to manage product quality. In this paper, we propose an automated defect detection system for the dual in-line package (DIP) that is widely used in industry, using digital camera optics and a deep learning (DL)-based model. The two most common defect categories of DIP are examined: (1) surface defects, and (2) pin-leg defects. However, the lack of defective component images leads to a challenge for detection tasks. To solve this problem, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a suitable-sized dataset for training and testing. Four varieties of the YOLO model are investigated (v3, v4, v7, and v9), both in isolation and with the ConSinGAN augmentation. The proposed YOLOv7 with ConSinGAN is superior to the other YOLO versions in accuracy of 95.50\%, detection time of 285 ms, and is far superior to threshold-based approaches. In addition, the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system is developed, and the associated sensor architecture is described. The proposed automated defect detection can be easily established with numerous types of defects or insufficient defect data.</description>

      <title>Variational Secret Common Randomness Extraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of extracting common randomness (CR) or secret keys from correlated random sources observed by two legitimate parties, Alice and Bob, through public discussion in the presence of an eavesdropper, Eve. We propose a practical two-stage CR extraction framework. In the first stage, the variational probabilistic quantization (VPQ) step is introduced, where Alice and Bob employ probabilistic neural network (NN) encoders to map their observations into discrete, nearly uniform random variables (RVs) with high agreement probability while minimizing information leakage to Eve. This is realized through a variational learning objective combined with adversarial training. In the second stage, a secure sketch using code-offset construction reconciles the encoder outputs into identical secret keys, whose secrecy is guaranteed by the VPQ objective. As a representative application, we study physical layer key (PLK) generation. Beyond the traditional methods, which rely on the channel reciprocity principle and require two-way channel probing, thus suffering from large protocol overhead and being unsuitable in high mobility scenarios, we propose a sensing-based PLK generation method for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems, where paired range-angle (RA) maps measured at Alice and Bob serve as correlated sources. The idea is verified through both end-to-end simulations and real-world software-defined radio (SDR) measurements, including scenarios where Eve has partial knowledge about Bob's position. The results demonstrate the feasibility and convincing performance of both the proposed CR extraction framework and sensing-based PLK generation method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on collaborative edge inference over wireless, which enables multiple devices to cooperate to improve inference performance in the presence of corrupted data. Exploiting a key-query mechanism for selective information exchange (or, group formation for collaboration), we recall the effect of wireless channel impairments in feature communication. We argue and show that a disjoint approach, which only considers either the semantic relevance or channel state between devices, performs poorly, especially in harsh propagation conditions. Based on these findings, we propose a joint approach that takes into account semantic information relevance and channel states when grouping devices for collaboration, by making the general attention weights dependent of the channel information. Numerical simulations show the superiority of the joint approach against local inference on corrupted data, as well as compared to collaborative inference with disjoint decisions that either consider application or physical layer parameters when forming groups.</description>

      <title>Authentication Security of PRF GNSS Ranging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work derives the authentication security of pseudorandom function (PRF) GNSS ranging under multiple GNSS spoofing models, including the Security Code Estimation and Replay (SCER) spoofer. When GNSS ranging codes derive from a PRF utilizing a secret known only to the broadcaster, the spoofer cannot predict the ranging code before broadcast. Therefore, PRF ranging can be used to establish trust in the GNSS pseudoranges and the resulting receiver position, navigation, and timing (PNT) solution. I apply the methods herein to Galileo's Signal Authentication Service (SAS) utilizing the encrypted Galileo E6-C signal to compute that, at most, 400 ms of Galileo E6-C data to assert 128-bit authentication security under non-SCER models. For the SCER adversary, I predict the adversary's needed receiving radio equipment to break authentication security. One can use this work to design a PRF GNSS ranging protocol to meet useful authentication security requirements by computing the probability of missed detection.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Edge Inference via Semantic Grouping under Wireless Channel Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the framework of collaborative inference, or edge ensembles. This framework enables multiple edge devices to improve classification accuracy by exchanging intermediate features rather than raw observations. However, efficient communication strategies are essential to balance accuracy and bandwidth limitations. Building upon a key-query mechanism for selective information exchange, this work extends collaborative inference by studying the impact of channel noise in feature communication, the choice of intermediate collaboration points, and the communication-accuracy trade-off across tasks. By analyzing how different collaboration points affect performance and exploring communication pruning, we show that it is possible to optimize accuracy while minimizing resource usage. We show that the intermediate collaboration approach is robust to channel errors and that the query transmission needs a higher degree of reliability than the data transmission itself.</description>

      <title>How to Combat Reactive and Dynamic Jamming Attacks with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of mitigating reactive jamming, where a jammer adopts a dynamic policy of selecting channels and sensing thresholds to detect and jam ongoing transmissions. The transmitter-receiver pair learns to avoid jamming and optimize throughput over time (without prior knowledge of channel conditions or jamming strategies) by using reinforcement learning (RL) to adapt transmit power, modulation, and channel selection. Q-learning is employed for discrete jamming-event states, while Deep Q-Networks (DQN) are employed for continuous states based on received power. Through different reward functions and action sets, the results show that RL can adapt rapidly to spectrum dynamics and sustain high rates as channels and jamming policies change over time.</description>

Abstract: Pixel antennas, based on discretizing a continuous radiation surface into small elements called pixels, are a flexible reconfigurable antenna technology. By controlling the connections between pixels via switches, the characteristics of pixel antennas can be adjusted to enhance the wireless channel. Inspired by this, we propose a novel technique denoted antenna coding empowered by pixel antennas. We first derive a physical and electromagnetic based communication model for pixel antennas using microwave multiport network theory and beamspace channel representation. With the model, we optimize the antenna coding to maximize the channel gain in a single-input single-output (SISO) pixel antenna system and develop a codebook design for antenna coding to reduce the computational complexity. We analyze the average channel gain of SISO pixel antenna system and derive the corresponding upper bound. In addition, we jointly optimize the antenna coding and transmit signal covariance matrix to maximize the channel capacity in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) pixel antenna system. Simulation results show that using pixel antennas can enhance the average channel gain by up to 5.4 times and channel capacity by up to 3.1 times, demonstrating the significant potential of pixel antennas as a new dimension to design and optimize wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Radio Propagation Prediction in Automated Warehouses using Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22456v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The next decade will usher in a profound transformation of wireless communication, driven by the ever-increasing demand for data-intensive applications and the rapid adoption of emerging technologies. To fully unlock the potential of 5G and beyond, substantial advancements are required in signal processing techniques, innovative network architectures, and efficient spectrum utilization strategies. These advancements facilitate seamless integration of emerging technologies, driving industrial digital transformation and connectivity. This paper introduces a novel Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based framework, Wireless Infrastructure for Smart Warehouses using VAE (WISVA), designed for accurate indoor radio propagation modeling in automated Industry 4.0 environments such as warehouses and factory floors operating within 5G wireless bands. The research delves into the meticulous creation of training data tensors, capturing complex electromagnetic (EM) wave behaviors influenced by diverse obstacles, and outlines the architecture and training methodology of the proposed VAE model. The model's robustness and adaptability are showcased through its ability to predict signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) heatmaps across various scenarios, including denoising tasks, validation datasets, extrapolation to unseen configurations, and previously unencountered warehouse layouts. Compelling reconstruction error heatmaps are presented, highlighting the superior accuracy of WISVA compared to traditional autoencoder models. The paper also analyzes the model's performance in handling complex smart warehouse environments, demonstrating its potential as a key enabler for optimizing wireless infrastructure in Industry 4.0.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous Polarimetry with Zak-OTFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarimetry, which is the ability to measure the scattering response of the environment across orthogonal polarizations, is fundamental to enhancing wireless communication and radar system performance. In this paper, we utilize the Zak-OTFS modulation to enable instantaneous polarimetry within a single transmission frame. We transmit a Zak-OTFS carrier waveform and a spread carrier waveform mutually unbiased to it simultaneously over orthogonal polarizations. The mutual unbiasedness of the two waveforms enables the receiver to estimate the full polarimetric response of the scattering environment from a single received frame. Unlike existing methods for instantaneous polarimetry with computational complexity quadratic in the time-bandwidth product, the proposed method enables instantaneous polarimetry at near-linear complexity in the time-bandwidth product. Via numerical simulations, we show ideal polarimetric target detection and parameter estimation results with the proposed method, with improvements in performance and computational complexity over comparable baselines.</description>

      <title>Target Detection in Two-Channel Passive Radars with Inter-Receiver Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address target detection in a single Delay-Doppler cell using spatially distributed two-channel passive radars. An unknown illuminator of opportunity (IO) is assumed to emit a waveform lying in a known low-dimensional subspace (e.g., OFDM). Each receiver transforms its reference and surveillance signals onto the IO subspace after noise-whitening, to obtain cross-correlation (CC) measurements. To save bandwidth, receivers collaboratively exchange and linearly combine the CC output, and only a subset transmits them to a fusion center (FC) over a multiple-access channel (MAC). Collaboration weights are designed using the moments of the FC measurement to enhance detection performance.</description>

      <title>Phase Noise Tolerance for Low-Pilot-Overhead OFDM Terahertz Links Beyond 64-QAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: THz wireless communications have garnered significant attention due to their unprecedented data rates enabled by the abundant untapped spectrum. However, advanced modulation formats beyond 64-QAM remain largely unexplored, as phase errors introduced during up/down-conversion severely limit system performance. Particularly, OFDM transmission is highly susceptible to aggravated ICI induced by phase noise, undermining the orthogonality of subcarriers. While PLLs and pilot-assisted compensation can mitigate phase errors, excessive pilot overhead compromises spectral efficiency and energy consumption, and white phase noise remains unrecoverable. Therefore, quantifying phase noise tolerance is essential for practical physical layer protocols. Here, we reveal the impact of phase noise in a 64-QAM, 2048-subcarrier OFDM THz transmission system. 3{\sigma}-error estimation is proposed to quantify phase noise tolerance, indicating an intuitive EVM threshold of approximately 5%. This threshold further delineates the trade-offs among phase noise levels, SNR requirements, and pilot overhead. Moreover, by benchmarking representative oscillators with distinct phase noise spectra, microring resonators (MRRs) are identified as indispensable enablers for low-pilot-overhead OFDM THz links operating beyond 64-QAM.</description>

      <title>On the Gaussian Limit of the Output of IIR Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic distribution of the output of a stable Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system driven by a non-Gaussian stochastic input. Motivated by longstanding heuristics in the stochastic describing function method, we rigorously characterize when the output process becomes approximately Gaussian, even when the input is not. Using the Wasserstein-1 distance as a quantitative measure of non-Gaussianity, we derive upper bounds on the distance between the appropriately scaled output and a standard normal distribution. These bounds are obtained via Stein's method and depend explicitly on the system's impulse response and the dependence structure of the input process. We show that when the dominant pole of the system approaches the edge of stability and the input satisfies one of the following conditions: (i) independence, (ii) positive correlation with a real and positive dominant pole, or (iii) sufficient correlation decay, the output converges to a standard normal distribution at rate $O(1/\sqrt{t})$. We also present counterexamples where convergence fails, thereby motivating the stated assumptions. Our results provide a rigorous foundation for the widespread observation that outputs of low-pass LTI systems tend to be approximately Gaussian.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Phase Noise Tolerance for Single-Carrier M-QAM Terahertz Wireless Communications with Advantages of Photonic Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Terahertz wireless communications offer abundant untapped spectrum and are regarded as a promising playground for next-generation high-throughput links. Yet oscillator phase noise becomes the dominant impairment at such high frequencies, severely limiting the reliability of high-order QAM transmission. While photonic approaches, such as microcombs, are known to realize ultralow phase noise, the quantitative level of suppression required to sustain reliable high-order QAM transmission has not been clarified. Here, phase noise is reconstructed from measured spectra and embedded into a single-carrier link model to evaluate its impact. Distinct distortion mechanisms are identified, with slow common phase error and instantaneous phase jitter, where the latter remains as the residual impairment after carrier phase recovery. We further adopt the 3{\sigma} error criterion, which maps residual distortions onto the constellation, providing a clear and practical indicator of system robustness. The results indicate that modest improvements in oscillator stability translate into significant BER gains without proportional power increase. These findings provide intuitive tolerance of phase noise in M-QAM systems and emphasize the importance of integrating low-noise photonic oscillators such as microcombs.</description>
