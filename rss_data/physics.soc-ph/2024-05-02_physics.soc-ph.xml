      <title>Cross-platform impact of social media algorithmic adjustments on public discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the hypertrophic and uncharted information world, recommender systems are gatekeepers of knowledge. The evolution of these algorithms is usually an opaque process, but in February 2023, the recommender system of X, formerly Twitter, was altered by its chairman (Elon Musk) transparently, offering a unique study opportunity. This paper analyses the cross-platform impact of adjusting the platform's recommender system on public discourse. We focus on the account of Elon Musk and, for comparison, the account of the President of the United States (Joe Biden). Our results highlight how algorithm adjustments can boost content visibility, user engagement, and community involvement without increasing the engagement or involvement probabilities. We find that higher visibility can increase the influence on social dialogue but also backfire, triggering negative community reactions. Finally, our analysis offers insights to detect future less transparent changes to recommender systems.</description>

      <title>News ecosystem dynamics: Supply, Demand, Diffusion, and the role of Disinformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The digital age provides new challenges as information travels more quickly in a system of increasing complexity. But it also offers new opportunities, as we can track and study the system more efficiently. Several studies individually addressed different digital tracks, focusing on specific aspects like disinformation production or content-sharing dynamics. In this work, we propose to study the news ecosystem as an information market by analysing three main metrics: Supply, Demand, and Diffusion of information. Working on a dataset relative to Italy from December 2019 to August 2020, we validate the choice of the metrics, proving their static and dynamic relations, and their potential in describing the whole system. We demonstrate that these metrics have specific equilibrium relative levels. We reveal the strategic role of Demand in leading a non-trivial network of causal relations. We show how disinformation news Supply and Diffusion seem to cluster among different social media platforms. Disinformation also appears to be closer to information Demand than the general news Supply and Diffusion, implying a potential danger to the health of the public debate. Finally, we prove that the share of disinformation in the Supply and Diffusion of news has a significant linear relation with the gap between Demand and Supply/Diffusion of news from all sources. This finding allows for a real-time assessment of disinformation share in the system. It also gives a glimpse of the potential future developments in the modelisation of the news ecosystem as an information market studied through its main drivers.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal load shifting for truly clean computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Companies with datacenters are procuring significant amounts of renewable energy to reduce their carbon footprint. There is increasing interest in achieving 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy (CFE) matching in electricity usage, aiming to eliminate all carbon footprints associated with electricity consumption on an hourly basis. However, the variability of renewable energy resources poses significant challenges for achieving this goal. We explore the impact of shifting computing jobs and associated power loads both in time and between datacenter locations. We develop an optimization model to simulate a network of geographically distributed datacenters managed by a company leveraging spatio-temporal load flexibility to achieve 24/7 CFE matching. We isolate three signals relevant for informed use of load flexiblity: varying average quality of renewable energy resources, low correlation between wind power generation over long distances due to different weather conditions, and lags in solar radiation peak due to Earth's rotation. We illustrate that the location of datacenters and the time of year affect which signal drives an effective load-shaping strategy. The energy procurement and load-shifting decisions based on informed use of these signals facilitate the resource-efficiency and cost-effectiveness of clean computing -- the costs of 24/7 CFE are reduced by 1.29$\pm$0.07 EUR/MWh for every additional percentage of flexible load. We provide practical guidelines on how companies with datacenters can leverage spatio-temporal load flexibility for truly clean computing. Our results and the open-source optimization model can also be useful for a broader variety of companies with flexible loads and an interest in eliminating their carbon footprint.</description>

      <title>A theory of best choice selection through objective arguments grounded in Linear Response Theory concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose how to use objective arguments grounded in statistical mechanics concepts in order to obtain a single number, obtained after aggregation, which would allow to rank "agents", "opinions", ..., all defined in a very broad sense. We aim toward any process which should a priori demand or lead to some consensus in order to attain the presumably best choice among many possibilities. In order to precise the framework, we discuss previous attempts, recalling trivial "means of scores", - weighted or not, Condorcet paradox, TOPSIS, etc. We demonstrate through geometrical arguments on a toy example, with 4 criteria, that the pre-selected order of criteria in previous attempts makes a difference on the final result. However, it might be unjustified. Thus, we base our "best choice theory" on the linear response theory in statistical mechanics: we indicate that one should be calculating correlations functions between all possible choice evaluations, thereby avoiding an arbitrarily ordered set of criteria. We justify the point through an example with 6 possible criteria. Applications in many fields are suggested. Beside, two toy models serving as practical examples and illustrative arguments are given in an Appendix.</description>

      <title>Airbus A32x vs Boeing 737 Safety Occurrences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety is the priority for airlines. Airlines are sensitive to passengers' perceptions of safety, having randomly assigned the Boeing 737 Max to routes and times. Historically, Boeing has been considered more reliable and safer than Airbus. Hence, it is worth asking the question, are there any differences in the safety occurrences of the core narrow-body single-aisle aircraft of Boeing and Airbus; the 737 and A32x families of aircraft. Utilizing the International Civil Aviation Organization safety occurrence data, from 2008 to 2019, these aircraft were compared in terms of occurrence type, occurrence category, phase of flight, injury level, and fatalities. It was found that Boeing had more accidents than expected, while Airbus had less (p=0.015). In terms of fatalities Boeing has had more than expected, with Airbus less (p&lt;0.001). Looking at just accidents, only the number of fatalities was statistically significantly different. In both cases, the increased number of fatalities for Boeing appears to be the result of the two recent Boeing 737 Max accidents. Looking at the reported fatal and hull loss accident rates, it was also found that the annual reduction for the Airbus A32x aircraft were better than for the Boeing 737 aircraft.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine a system of N=2 coupled non-linear delay-differential equations representing financial market dynamics. In such time delay systems, coupled oscillations have been derived. We linearize the system for small time delays and study its collective dynamics. Using analytical and numerical solutions, we obtain the bifurcation diagrams and analyze the corresponding regions of amplitude death, phase locking, limit cycles and market synchronization in terms of the system frequency-like parameters and time delays. We further numerically explore higher order systems with N&gt;2, and demonstrate that limit cycles can be maintained for coupled N-asset models with appropriate parameterization.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Dynamics of Cost Accounting: Investigating WIP via the Time-Independent Schrodinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intersection of quantum theory and accounting presents a novel and intriguing frontier in exploring financial valuation and accounting practices. This paper applies quantum theory to cost accounting, specifically Work in Progress (WIP) valuation. WIP is conceptualized as materials in a quantum superposition state whose financial value remains uncertain until observed or measured. This work comprehensively reviews the seminal works that explored the overlap between quantum theory and accounting. The primary contribution of this work is a more nuanced understanding of the uncertainties involved, which emerges by applying quantum phenomena to model the complexities and uncertainties inherent in managerial accounting. In contrast, previous works focus more on financial accounting or general accountancy.</description>

      <title>Urban planning in a context of rapid urban growth. A large scale review of urban plans in Africa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the African continent continues to urbanise, cities are becoming increasingly central to the transformations of societies and economies. Many studies highlight the limits of urban planning in these cities, emphasising the high share of population living in slums and the low levels of services that reach neighbourhoods. Less attention is given to the urban planning activities that try to prevent or improve these conditions. This analysis of urban plans illustrates that plans are more widespread than commonly thought. They also, for the large part, consider spatial growth. The low number of cities that grew within the projected boundaries of these plans is a symptom of numerous bottlenecks that constrain planning systems in these countries. Examples of these include the disregard of the full built-up areas at the time of the plan's approval and the missing link between the plans and the financial means allocated for its delivery. This article identifies opportunities to overcome these barriers such as flexible and adaptable urban plans that consider the entire built-up area of the agglomeration.</description>

      <title>Arbitrage impact on the relationship between XRP price and correlation tensor spectra of transaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing use of cryptoassets for international remittances has proven to be faster and more cost-effective, particularly for migrants without access to traditional banking. However, the inherent volatility of cryptoasset prices, independent of blockchain-based remittance mechanisms, introduces potential risks during periods of high volatility. This study investigates the intricate dynamics between XRP price fluctuations across diverse crypto exchanges and the correlation of the largest singular values of the correlation tensor of XRP transaction networks. Particularly, we show the impact of arbitrage opportunities across different crypto exchanges on the relationship between XRP price and correlation tensor spectra of transaction networks. Distinct periods, non-bubble and bubble, showcase different characteristics in XRP price fluctuations. Establishing a connection between XRP price and transaction networks, we compute correlation tensors and singular values, emphasizing the significance of the largest singular value. Comparisons with reshuffled and Gaussian random correlation tensors validate the uniqueness of the empirical tensor. A set of simulated weekly XRP prices, resembling arbitrage opportunities across various crypto exchanges, further confirms the robustness of our findings. It reveals a pronounced anti-correlation during bubble periods and a non-significant correlation during non-bubble periods with the largest singular value, irrespective of price fluctuations across different crypto exchanges.</description>

      <title>A new understanding on the history of developing MRI for cancer detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Science is about facts and truth. Yet sometimes the truth and facts are not obvious. For example, in the field of MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), there has been a long-lasting debate about who were the major contributors in its development. Particularly, there was a strong dispute between the followers of two scientists, R. Damadian and P. Lauterbur. In this review, we carefully trace the major developments in the use of NMR for cancer detection starting almost 50 years ago. The research records show that the truth was beyond the claims of either research camps. The development of NMR for cancer detection involved multiple research groups, who made critical contributions at different junctures.</description>

      <title>A global evidence map of human well-being and biodiversity co-benefits and trade-offs of natural climate solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural climate solutions (NCS) are critical for mitigating climate change through ecosystem-based carbon removal and emissions reductions. NCS implementation can also generate biodiversity and human well-being co-benefits and trade-offs ("NCS co-impacts"), but the volume of evidence on NCS co-impacts has grown rapidly across disciplines, is poorly understood, and remains to be systematically collated and synthesized. A global evidence map of NCS co-impacts would overcome key barriers to NCS implementation by providing relevant information on co-benefits and trade-offs where carbon mitigation potential alone does not justify NCS projects. We employ large language models to assess over two million articles, finding 257,266 relevant articles on NCS co-impacts. We analyze this large and dispersed body of literature using innovative machine learning methods to extract relevant data (e.g., study location, species, and other key variables), and create a global evidence map on NCS co-impacts. Evidence on NCS co-impacts has grown approximately ten-fold in three decades, although some of the most abundant evidence is associated with pathways that have less mitigation potential. We find that studies often examine multiple NCS pathways, indicating natural NCS pathway complements, and each NCS is often associated with two or more coimpacts. Finally, NCS co-impacts evidence and priority areas for NCS are often mismatched--some countries with high mitigation potential from NCS have few published studies on the broader co-impacts of NCS implementation. Our work advances and makes available novel methods and systematic and representative data of NCS co-impacts studies, thus providing timely insights to inform NCS research and action globally.</description>

      <title>Astronomy's climate emissions: Global travel to scientific meetings in 2019</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Travel to academic conferences -- where international flights are the norm -- is responsible for a sizeable fraction of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with academic work. In order to provide a benchmark for comparison with other fields, as well as for future reduction strategies and assessments, we estimate the CO2-equivalent emissions for conference travel in the field of astronomy for the prepandemic year 2019. The GHG emission of the international astronomical community's 362 conferences and schools in 2019 amounted to 42,500 tCO2e, assuming a radiative-forcing index factor of 1.95 for air travel. This equates to an average of 1.0 $\pm$ 0.6 tCO2e per participant per meeting. The total travel distance adds up to roughly 1.5 Astronomical Units, that is, 1.5 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun. We present scenarios for the reduction of this value, for instance with virtual conferencing or hub models, while still prioritizing the benefits conferences bring to the scientific community.</description>

      <title>Robustness of graph embedding methods for community detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the robustness of graph embedding methods for community detection in the face of network perturbations, specifically edge deletions. Graph embedding techniques, which represent nodes as low-dimensional vectors, are widely used for various graph machine learning tasks due to their ability to capture structural properties of networks effectively. However, the impact of perturbations on the performance of these methods remains relatively understudied. The research considers state-of-the-art graph embedding methods from two families: matrix factorization (e.g., LE, LLE, HOPE, M-NMF) and random walk-based (e.g., DeepWalk, LINE, node2vec). Through experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world networks, the study reveals varying degrees of robustness within each family of graph embedding methods. The robustness is found to be influenced by factors such as network size, initial community partition strength, and the type of perturbation. Notably, node2vec and LLE consistently demonstrate higher robustness for community detection across different scenarios, including networks with degree and community size heterogeneity. These findings highlight the importance of selecting an appropriate graph embedding method based on the specific characteristics of the network and the task at hand, particularly in scenarios where robustness to perturbations is crucial.</description>

      <title>Is Artificial Intelligence the great filter that makes advanced technical civilisations rare in the universe?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the hypothesis that the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), culminating in the emergence of Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), could act as a "Great Filter" that is responsible for the scarcity of advanced technological civilisations in the universe. It is proposed that such a filter emerges before these civilisations can develop a stable, multiplanetary existence, suggesting the typical longevity (L) of a technical civilization is less than 200 years. Such estimates for L, when applied to optimistic versions of the Drake equation, are consistent with the null results obtained by recent SETI surveys, and other efforts to detect various technosignatures across the electromagnetic spectrum. Through the lens of SETI, we reflect on humanity's current technological trajectory - the modest projections for L suggested here, underscore the critical need to quickly establish regulatory frameworks for AI development on Earth and the advancement of a multiplanetary society to mitigate against such existential threats. The persistence of intelligent and conscious life in the universe could hinge on the timely and effective implementation of such international regulatory measures and technological endeavours.</description>

      <title>U.S. Election Hardens Hate Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local or national politics can trigger potentially dangerous hate in someone. But with a third of the world's population eligible to vote in elections in 2024 alone, we lack understanding of how individual-level hate multiplies up to hate behavior at the collective global scale. Here we show, based on the most recent U.S. election, that offline events are associated with a rapid adaptation of the global online hate universe that hardens (strengthens) both its network-of-networks structure and the 'flavors' of hate content that it collectively produces. Approximately 50 million potential voters in hate communities are drawn closer to each other and to the broad mainstream of approximately 2 billion others. It triggers new hate content at scale around immigration, ethnicity, and antisemitism that aligns with conspiracy theories about Jewish-led replacement before blending in hate around gender identity/sexual orientation, and religion. Telegram acts as a key hardening agent - yet is overlooked by U.S. Congressional hearings and new E.U. legislation. Because the hate universe has remained robust since 2020, anti-hate messaging surrounding not only upcoming elections but also other events like the war in Gaza, should pivot to blending multiple hate 'flavors' while targeting previously untouched social media structures.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a critical analysis of the literature and perspective research ideas for modeling the epidemics caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It goes beyond deterministic population dynamics to consider several key complexity features of the system under consideration. In particular, the multiscale features of the dynamics from contagion to the subsequent dynamics of competition between the immune system and the proliferating virus. Other topics addressed in this work include the propagation of epidemics in a territory, taking into account local transportation networks, the heterogeneity of the population, and the study of social and economic problems in populations involved in the spread of epidemics. The overall content aims to show how new mathematical tools can be developed to address the above topics and how mathematical models and simulations can contribute to the decision making of crisis managers.</description>

Abstract: The field of opinion dynamics has its roots in early research that applied methods from magnetic physics to gain insights into the formation of social opinions. A central challenge in this field lies in modeling how diverse opinions coexist and exert influence on each other. In the realm of social issues, it's In this study, we leverage the dimer construct and the dimer model to establish a theoretical framework. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate how this proposed model can be applied to real-world scenarios of social opinion formation. The model involves the computation of the Castellain matrix (K), the distribution function (Z), and the probability of dimer configuration (P(D)) for convex regions with varying positions and distances. It explores how alterations in convex regions impact the probability of dimer configuration.
  Furthermore, our model takes into account two critical factors: "dependence" and "forgetting" in the process of opinion formation. It also delves into the concepts of "distance" and "location" of opinions. The results of numerical simulations shed light on how our model effectively captures the processes involved in real-world social opinion formation.
  This study lays the groundwork for a deeper comprehension of the social opinion formation process and the development of strategies to address real-world social issues. In essence, our research introduces a novel methodology for comprehending and dissecting the intricate dynamics of opinion formation within the realm of opinion dynamics.
  This theoretical framework, coupled with a numerical simulation-based approach, offers fresh insights that extend beyond the confines of opinion dynamics. It opens up new perspectives in the domains of social science, physics, and computational modeling, ultimately contributing to a more profound understanding of social opinion formation.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Evolutionary Pressure and Diminishing Returns Might Explain the Fermi Paradox: On What Super-AIs Are Like</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With an evolutionary approach, the basis of morality can be explained as adaptations to problems of cooperation. With 'evolution' taken in a broad sense, evolving AIs that satisfy the conditions for evolution to apply will be subject to the same cooperative evolutionary pressure as biological entities. Here the adaptiveness of increased cooperation as material safety and wealth increase is discussed -- for humans, for other societies, and for AIs. Diminishing beneficial returns from increased access to material resources also suggests the possibility that, on the whole, there will be no incentive to for instance colonize entire galaxies, thus providing a possible explanation of the Fermi paradox, wondering where everybody is. It is further argued that old societies could engender, give way to, super-AIs, since it is likely that super-AIs are feasible, and fitter. Closing is an aside on effective ways for morals and goals to affect life and society, emphasizing environments, cultures, and laws, and exemplified by how to eat.
  Appended are an algorithm for colonizing for example a galaxy quickly, models of the evolution of cooperation and fairness under diminishing returns, and software for simulating signaling development. It is also noted that there can be no exponential colonization or reproduction, for mathematical reasons, as each entity takes up a certain amount of space.</description>

      <title>Three-state Opinion Dynamics for Financial Markets on Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the effects of complex networks on the collective behavior of a three-state opinion formation model in economic systems. Our model considers two distinct types of investors in financial markets: noise traders and fundamentalists. Financial states evolve via probabilistic dynamics that include economic strategies with local and global influences. The local majoritarian opinion drives noise traders' market behavior, while the market index influences the financial decisions of fundamentalist agents. We introduce a level of market anxiety $q$ present in the decision-making process that influences financial action. In our investigation, nodes of a complex network represent market agents, whereas the links represent their financial interactions. We investigate the stochastic dynamics of the model on three distinct network topologies, including scale-free networks, small-world networks and Erd{\"o}s-R\'enyi random graphs. Our model mirrors various traits observed in real-world financial return series, such as heavy-tailed return distributions, volatility clustering, and short-term memory correlation of returns. The histograms of returns are fitted by coupled Gaussian distributions, quantitatively revealing transitions from a leptokurtic to a mesokurtic regime under specific economic heterogeneity. We show that the market dynamics depend mainly on the average agent connectivity, anxiety level, and market composition rather than on specific features of network topology.</description>
