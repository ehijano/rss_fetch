      <title>Geometric fragmentation and anomalous thermalization in cubic dimer model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While quantum statistical mechanics triumphs in explaining many equilibrium phenomena, there is an increasing focus on going beyond conventional scenarios of thermalization. Traditionally examples of non-thermalizing systems are either integrable, or disordered. Recently, examples of translationally-invariant physical systems have been discovered whose excited energies avoid thermalization either due to local constraints (whether exact or emergent), or due to higher-form symmetries. In this article, we extend these investigations for the case of 3D $U(1)$ quantum dimer models, which are lattice gauge theories with finite-dimensional local Hilbert spaces (also generically called quantum link models) with staggered charged static matter. Using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we uncover a class of athermal states that arise in large winding sectors, when the system is subjected to external electric fields. The polarization of the dynamical fluxes in the direction of applied field traps excitations in 2D planes, while an interplay with the Gauss Law constraint in the perpendicular direction causes exotic athermal behaviour due to the emergence of new conserved quantities. This causes a geometric fragmentation of the system. We provide analytical arguments showing that the scaling of the number of fragments is exponential in the linear system size, leading to weak fragmentation. Further, we identify sectors which host fractonic excitations with severe mobility restrictions. The unitary evolution of fragments dominated by fractons is qualitatively different from the one dominated by non-fractonic excitations.</description>

      <title>Simulating lattice fermion doubling with a Floquet drive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10601v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a recently discovered mathematical correspondence between the spectra of a naively discretized lattice fermion and that of a periodically driven (i.e., Floquet) quantum system and turn it into an infrared equivalence between the two systems. The equivalence can be framed as a duality relation, allowing us to simulate a two-flavor discrete-time fermion theory on the lattice side, where the two flavors arise from time discretization, using a single-flavor fermion theory on the Floquet side. Our demonstration establishes an equivalence between (i) the fermion content, (ii) the correlation functions, and consequently (iii) observables of the two theories in the infrared. We also show how interactions may be incorporated into this equivalence.</description>

      <title>Shear and bulk viscosity for a pure glue theory using an effective matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At nonzero temperatures, the deconfining phase transition can be analyzed using an effective matrix model to characterize the change in holonomy. The model includes gluons and two-dimensional ghost fields in the adjoint representation, or ``teens''. As ghosts, the teen fields are responsible for the decrease of the pressure as $T \rightarrow T_d$, with $T_d$ the transition temperature for deconfinement. Using the solution of this matrix model for a large number of colors, the parameters of the teen fields are adjusted so that the expectation value of the Polyakov loop is close to the values from the lattice. The shear, $\eta$, and bulk, $\zeta$, viscosities are computed in weak coupling but nonzero holonomy. In the pure glue theory, the value of the Polyakov loop is relatively large in the deconfined phase, $\approx 1/2$ at $T_d$. Consequently, if $s$ is the entropy density, while $\eta/s$ decreases as $T\rightarrow T_d$, it is still well above the conformal bound. In contrast, $\zeta/s$ is largest at $T_d$, comparable to $\eta/s$, then falls off rapidly with increasing temperature and is negligible by $\sim 2 T_d$.</description>
