      <title>Checking Timed Bisimilarity with Virtual Clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timed automata are a widely used formalism for specifying discrete-state/continuous-time behaviors of time-critical reactive systems. Concerning the fundamental verification problem of comparing a candidate implementation against a specification, both given as timed automata over the same alphabet, it has been shown that timed trace equivalence is undecidable, whereas timed bisimulation equivalence is decidable. The corresponding decidability proof utilizes region graphs, a finite but often unnecessarily space-consuming characterization of timed automata semantics. In practice, most verification tools use zone graphs instead, a symbolic and, on average, more space-efficient representation of timed automata semantics. However, zone graphs only provide sound results for those verification tasks being reducible to plain location-reachability problems thus being too imprecise for timed-bisimilarity checking. In particular, potentially distinctive effects of, by definition invisible, clock resets on the subsequent branching behaviors in a timed run may be abstracted away in a zone graph representation if this does not harm global reachability properties. As a consequence, to the best of our knowledge, no practical tool is currently available for automated timed-bisimilarity checking. In this paper, we propose a new representation of timed automata semantics to enable sound and complete timed bisimilarity checking, yet still guaranteeing a finite representation. To this end, we extend zone graphs by so-called virtual clocks to memorize previous delays, which is usually not possible due to clock resets. Our zone-based construction is, on average, significantly smaller than the corresponding region-graph representation. We also present experimental results gained from applying our tool implementation to TA models, which are frequently used in the evaluation of TA analysis techniques.</description>
