      <title>Exploration of groups and outliers in Gaia RVS stellar spectra with metric learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gaia mission is transforming our view of the Milky Way by providing distances towards a billion stars, and much more. The third data release includes nearly a million spectra from its Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS). Identifying unexpected features in such vast datasets presents a significant challenge. It is impossible to visually inspect all of the spectra and difficult to analyze them in a comprehensive way. In order to supplement traditional analysis approaches, and in order to facilitate deeper insights from these spectra, we present a new dataset together with an interactive portal that applies established self-supervised metric learning techniques, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection, to allow researchers to visualize, analyze, and interact with the Gaia RVS spectra in straightforward but under-utilized manner. We demonstrate a few example interactions with the dataset, examining groupings and the most unusual RVS spectra, according to our metric. This combination of methodology and public availability enables broader exploration, and may reveal yet-to-be-discovered stellar phenomena.</description>

      <title>HD 5501: A Rapidly Evolving Interacting Eclipsing Binary with a Variable Light Curve and H$\alpha$ Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HD~5501, a hitherto little studied eclipsing binary with an early A-type primary, has been caught in a short-lived, astrophysically interesting phase of its binary evolution. Recent photometric and spectroscopic observations, including photometric data from {\it TESS}, show it has a highly variable light curve as well as complex spectral variability, particularly in both the absorption and emission components at H~$\alpha$. Our current campaign, including both professional and amateur observers, has determined that the primary is evolving rapidly across the Hertzsprung gap and that, unusually in the case of mass transfer, the orbital period is declining with a characteristic time-scale $P/\dot{P} \approx$ 170,000 years. Significantly, the orbit is eccentric and it appears that mass transfer from the primary to the secondary occurs only near periastron. Modeling indicates the presumed B7 V secondary to be surrounded by an accretion torus, which likely has dynamically chaotic variations in size and shape. Our analysis further implies the presence of a circumbinary disc or shell supplied by mass loss through the Lagrange $L_3$ point. That mass loss appears to account for most of the emission at H$\alpha$. We describe how this astrophysically interesting system may yield valuable information about binary star evolution at the onset of Roche-lobe overflow, as well as insights into eccentricity-modifying mechanisms such as the Soker mechanism.</description>

      <title>Forming Double Neutron Stars using Detailed Binary Evolution Models with POSYDON: Comparison to the Galactic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With over two dozen detections in the Milky Way, double neutron stars (DNSs) provide a unique window into massive binary evolution. We use the POSYDON binary population synthesis code to model DNS populations and compare them to the observed Galactic sample. By tracing their origins to underlying single and binary star physics, we place constraints on the detailed evolutionary stages leading to DNS formation. Our study reveals a bifurcation within the well-known common envelope formation channel for DNSs, which naturally explains an observed split in the orbital periods of the Galactic systems. The two sub-channels are defined by whether the donor star has a helium core (Case B mass transfer) or a carbon-oxygen core (Case C) at the onset of the common envelope, with only the helium core systems eventually merging due to gravitational wave-modulated orbital decay. However, producing DNSs through both sub-channels requires either a generous core definition of $\simeq$ 30% H-fraction or a high common envelope ejection efficiency of $\alpha_{\rm CE}\gtrsim1.2$. By testing different supernova kick velocity models, we find that galactic DNSs are best reproduced using a prescription that favors low velocity kicks ($\lesssim 50 \, \rm km/s$), in agreement with previous studies. Furthermore, our models indicate that merging DNSs are born from a stripped progenitor with a median pre-supernova envelope mass $\sim$ 0.2$M_{\odot}$. Our results highlight the value of detailed evolutionary models for improving our understanding of exotic binary star formation.</description>

      <title>Helicity Fluxes and Hemispheric Helicity Rule of Active Regions Emerging from the Convection Zone Dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a 3D non-linear mean-field solar dynamo model, we investigate the magnetic helicity flux and magnetic twist, and tilt parameters of bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs) emerging from the solar convection zone due to the magnetic buoyancy instability. The twist and tilt of the BMR magnetic field are modeled as a result of an effective electromotive force along the rising part of the toroidal magnetic field. This force generates the poloidal field that tilts the whole magnetic configuration. We find that variations of BMR's twist and tilt determine the magnitude and the sign of the magnetic helicity flux on the solar surface. The model shows that the helicity flux associated with the BMR's tilt/twist is the dominant contribution to the BMR helicity at the beginning of the BMR's evolution, while the effect of differential rotation is the main source of the helicity flux at the final stage of the BMR's evolution. We discuss the implications of these effects on the basic properties and variations of the hemispheric helicity rule of active regions on the solar surface.</description>

      <title>Effect of Matter Accretion on Lithium Enhancement of Giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subset of low-mass giants ($&lt;2.2\,M_{\odot}$) exhibit anomalous lithium enhancement behavior, which is still an open topic. Given that more massive giants retain more surface lithium, increasing mass by accreting circumstellar matter could be a channel to enrich lithium. We evaluate this process in the current work. Using MESA, we construct a model of matter accretion, including mass loss, that evolves a star from the main sequence turnoff to the red giant branch tip. The mean accretion rate is estimated from the upper limit of the accreted mass and the evolutionary time of the star during this period, and a grid of accretion rates is constructed. We separately consider their effects on the lithium enhancement of giants, both in terms of the mass and the composition of accretion. Accreting matter with higher lithium abundances has a promoting effect on the lithium enhancement of giants. The accreted matter with excess lithium alleviates the dilution of lithium in the convective envelope during the first dredge-up. The added mass results in lower temperatures at the bottom of the convective envelope, which likewise weakens the depletion of surface lithium. Weak accretion of circumstellar matter is a possible route to lithium enhancement for giants, and it predicts an upper limit on the lithium abundance of $\rm \sim 2.5\,dex$. However, the mass increment it requires poses a potential challenge to real astrophysical environments. Such accretion suppresses lithium dilution and depletion of the star during the first dredge-up, thus exhibiting lithium enhancement behavior.</description>

      <title>Prompt identification of solar wind stream interaction regions from Survey Burst 1 Mode observations of the Radio and Plasma Wave experiment on Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying stream interaction regions (SIRs), from their inception and the dynamics of their development, can provide insight into solar-terrestrial connections. Some in-situ instruments on the Solar Orbiter (SolO) space mission are designed to measure solar wind (SW) and interplanetary magnetic field parameters along the flight path. These instruments are ideal for studying the dynamics of SIR evolution at heliocentric distances of 0.28-1.0 AU and with changes in heliolatitude of 0^{\circ} - 33^{\circ}. To address the challenges of promptly identifying SIRs and predicting their arrival time on Earth, we consider using trigger events from the Radio and Plasma Wave (RPW)/SolO instrument, which are transmitted in telemetry data packages. We suggest that multiple activations of the trigger mode (SBM1 mode) in the RPW instrument over an interval of up to four hours may reflect the fine structure of large-scale events in SW. Such events can serve as markers for the spacecraft's location within the SIR. In this regard, the 2023 analysis revealed that multiple activations of the SBM1 trigger mode throughout the day accounted for more than 50\% of the total number of days for which such events were recorded. Of this number, 63\% were events when the trigger algorithm was prompted repeatedly within a time interval of up to four hours. A comparison of the registration times of SBM1 trigger events with the SW parameters obtained from the SWA-PAS and MAG instruments showed that repeated activations of the trigger algorithm occurred at the stream interface surface when a high-speed SW stream and a formed compression region were present.</description>

      <title>A late-time view of the progenitor candidates of the Type II-P SN 2009ib and SN 2012ec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The progenitors of Type II-P supernovae (SNe) are generally considered to be red supergiants; however, the so-called "red supergiant problem" indicates that a deeper investigation into the progenitors of this class of SNe is necessary. SN 2009ib and SN 2012ec are two Type II-P SNe for which progenitor candidates have been identified in pre-explosion images. In this work, we use new, late-time Hubble Space Telescope observations to search for the disappearance of these two candidates and confirm their nature. In the case of SN 2009ib, the late-time high-resolution imaging reveals that the progenitor candidate is in fact a blend of multiple unresolved stars. Subsequent difference imaging shows no significant change in brightness at the SN's position even years after the explosion. These findings indicate that the flux from the previously identified source is dominated by unresolved field stars, with little to no contribution from the genuine progenitor. In the case of SN 2012ec, a comparison of pre-explosion and late-time images reveals that the progenitor candidate faded by about 0.6 mag in the F814W band seven years after the explosion, confirming the disappearance of the progenitor.</description>

      <title>The substellar population in Corona Australis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The substellar initial mass function (IMF) and the formation mechanisms of brown dwarfs (BDs) remain key open questions in star formation theory. IMF characterization in a large number of star-forming regions (SFRs) is essential for constraining these processes. We aim to identify and spectroscopically confirm very low-mass members of the Corona Australis (CrA) SFR to refine its substellar census, determine its low-mass IMF, and compare it to other clusters. Using deep I-band photometry from SuprimeCam/Subaru and data from the VISTA Hemisphere Survey, we identified low-mass BD candidates in CrA. We subsequently obtained NIR spectra of 173 of these candidates with KMOS/VLT, as well as optical spectra for 8 kinematic candidate members using FLOYDS/LCO. The kinematic candidates are confirmed as low-mass stellar members with spectral types M1 to M5. In contrast, all 173 BD candidates observed with KMOS are identified as contaminants. Although the follow-up yielded no new substellar members, it places strong constraints on the number of undetected substellar objects in the region. Combined with literature data, this enables us to derive the substellar IMF, which is consistent with a single power-law slope of alpha = 0.95+-0.06 in the range 0.01-1 MSun or alpha = 0.33+-0.19 in the range 0.01-0.1 MSun. The star-to-BD ratio in CrA is about 2. We also provide updated IMFs and star-to-BD ratios for Lupus3 and ChaI from the SONYC survey, reflecting revised distances from Gaia. Finally, we estimate surface densities and median FUV fluxes for 6 SFRs and clusters and compare their substellar populations as a function of environmental properties. The IMF and star-to-BD ratio show no clear dependence on stellar density or ionizing flux from the massive stars. A combined effect - where one factor enhances and the other suppresses BD formation - also appears unlikely. (Abridged)</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) aims to measure the linear polarization of solar flares in the 25-100 keV X-ray band using a Compton scattering polarimeter. CUSP will allow us to study the magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the flaring magnetic structures of our star by providing high-sensitivity polarization measurements. CUSP is a project in the framework of the Alcor Program of the Italian Space Agency aimed to develop innovative CubeSat technologies and missions. As part of CUSPs Phase B study, which began in December 2024 and will continue for one year, we present the development status of the Geant4 based simulator to accurately simulate the detectors response and initial results on the sensitivity of the instrument. Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation is used to assess the physical interactions of the source photons with the detector and the passive materials. We implemented a detailed CUSP Mass Model within Geant4 to simulate and estimate the instruments sensitivity, correcting the geometric effects of the instrument. We also evaluated the effect of backscattering shielding on the sensitivity to optimize the mass model of the instrument.</description>

      <title>UV flux variation study in contact binary VW Cephei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite many attempts, the origin of UV emission line and continuum in contact binary stars remains unclear. We present a substantial UV spectroscopic analysis of VW Cephei, a late-type contact binary system, using 46 low-resolution spectra from the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) in the wavelength range 1150-1978 \r{A}. By modelling continuum and emissions lines in individual spectra, we report the significant detection of OIII] (1660 and 1666 \r{A}) and SiIV (1393 and 1402 \r{A}) line complexes. We observe that UV fluxes for both continuum and emission lines like CIV, OIII], CII and SiIV vary significantly (fractional rms variability up to 45%) from hours to years. In addition, line widths also change by hundreds of kilometres/sec. The UV flux variabilities observed in the continuum bands and line emissions are uncorrelated. However, most of the flux values follow the binary orbital period observed from optical data. Our analysis indicates that, while the variation in continuum flux may be attributed to a heated photosphere, the line width measurements indicate that the emission lines are likely formed in the dynamical clouds associated with Roche lobe overflow. We estimate the mass transfer rate of $ \dot{M} = (0.82 \pm 0.01) \times 10^{-7} \ M_{\odot} {yr^{-1}}$ from UV line fluxes, which is in good agreement with optical studies.</description>

      <title>A Large Catalog of DA White Dwarf Characteristics Using SDSS and Gaia Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalog of 8545 and 19,257 unique DA white dwarfs observed in SDSS Data Release 19 and previous SDSS data releases, respectively. This is the largest catalog of both spectroscopic and photometric measurements of DA white dwarfs available to date, and we make this catalog and all code used to create it publicly available. We measure the apparent radial velocity, spectroscopic effective temperature and surface gravity, and photometric effective temperature and radius for all objects in our catalog. We validate our measurements against other published white dwarf catalogs. For apparent radial velocities, surface gravities, and effective temperatures measured from spectra with signal-to-noise ratios $&gt;50$, our measurements agree with published SDSS white dwarf catalogs to within 7.5 km/s, 0.060 dex, and $2.4\%$, respectively. For radii and effective temperatures measured with Gaia photometry, our measurements agree with other published Gaia datasets to within $0.0005$ $R_\odot$ and $3\%$, respectively. We use this catalog to investigate systematic discrepancies between white dwarfs observed in SDSS-V and previous generations of SDSS. For objects observed in both SDSS-V and previous generations, we uncover systematic differences between measured spectroscopic parameters depending on which set of survey data is used. On average, the measured apparent radial velocity of a DA white dwarf is $11.5$ km/s larger and the surface gravity is $0.015$ dex smaller when a white dwarf's spectroscopic parameters are measured using SDSS-V data compared to using data from previous generations of SDSS. These differences may be due to changes in the wavelength solution across survey generations.</description>

      <title>Discovery of an $\rm[Fe/H] \sim -4.8$ Star in $Gaia$ XP Spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the discovery of GDR3_526285 ($Gaia$ DR3 Source ID 5262850721755411072), a star with $\rm[Fe/H] = -4.82 \pm 0.25$ and one of the lowest metal ($\text{atomic number} &gt; 2$) mass fractions ever found ($Z_{\rm GDR3\_526585} \lesssim 1.0 \times 10^{-6}$). We first identified it as an ultra metal-poor (UMP; $\rm[Fe/H] &lt; -4$) red giant-branch (RGB) star candidate in the $Gaia$ BP/RP (XP) spectro-photometric catalog ($Gaia$ $G$ magnitude $\approx$15). A combination of multi-band photometry and high-resolution spectroscopic analysis under local thermodynamic equilibrium confirmed the status of GDR3_526285 as a distant ($\approx$24 kpc from the Sun) RGB star ($T_{\rm eff} = 4596\,{\rm K}$, $\log g = 0.88$) in the Milky Way's outer halo. We obtain only an upper limit for the carbon abundance of $\rm[C/H] &lt; -4.32$, resulting in $\rm[C/Fe] &lt; +0.50$. A correction for the evolutionary carbon depletion ($\Delta \rm[C/Fe] = +0.68$) brings the nominal carbon-to-iron ratio upper limit to $\rm[C/Fe]_{\rm cor} &lt; +1.18$. Given its extraordinarily low [C/H], GDR3_526285 likely formed from gas cooled via dust grains rather than fine structure line cooling. The kinematics of GDR3_526285 suggests that this star was either dynamically perturbed by the infall of the Magellanic system or was formerly a member of the Magellanic Clouds and was later stripped by the Milky Way. Our results showcase the potential of an all-sky search for low-metallicity targets with $Gaia$ XP and confirm that the methodology described here is an useful "treasure map" for finding additional UMP stars.</description>

      <title>JWST imaging of omega Centauri -- I. Luminosity and mass functions of its main sequence populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the first study of the most massive globular cluster (GC) in the Milky Way, omega Centauri, employing recently acquired JWST deep images. By combining these data with archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images, we derived proper motions (PMs) for a significant portion of the JWST field. Our analysis of the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) reveals two prominent sequences extending from a magnitude F322W2 ~ 17.5 to the bottom of the main sequence (MS). These sequences correspond to the two main stellar populations of omega Centauri: the bMS (He-rich) and rMS (He-normal) populations. The two sequences intersect at the MS knee (F322W2 ~ 19.5) and change positions for lower magnitudes, with the bMS luminosity function (LF) ending at least ~0.5 magnitudes brighter than the rMS LF. We identified a third group of stars (named gMS) along the main sequence located between the two primary ones and conducted a detailed analysis of the LFs and MFs for these three stellar populations. The LFs of these sequences show similar trends, with the rMS being the most populated and the bMS the least. The MFs display distinct power-law slopes: the rMS is well fitted by a single power-law while the gMS and the bMS are characterised by MFs steeper than that of the rMS for masses larger than 0.2 solar masses and flatter MFs for smaller masses. The flattening around ~0.2 solar masses for the gMS and the bMS might be a real feature of the MFs of these populations or due to uncertainties in the adopted mass-luminosity relationship (MLR). The variation in the slope of the MFs of the gMS and bMS contributes to the steepening (flattening) of the combined MF for masses higher (lower) than 0.2 solar masses.</description>

      <title>Probing Proton versus Electron Heating and Energization during Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanisms controlling the relative heating and energization of electrons and protons during magnetic reconnection are explored. Simulations are carried out with the kglobal model, which produces bulk heating and the extended powerlaw distributions of both species that have been documented in observations. The simulations have been carried out with a range of proton-to-electron mass ratios and upstream temperatures to isolate the factors that control energy gain. The simulations reveal that when the upstream temperatures of the two species are equal, the proton heating and energization exceeds that of electrons and that this is a consequence of the much larger energy gain of protons on their first entry into the reconnection exhaust. The effective energy gain of protons on exhaust entry scales as $m_iC_A^2$ since the protons counterstream at the Alfv\'en speed $C_A$ while the initial electron energy gain is smaller by the factor $(\beta_{e0}m_e/m_i)^{1/2}$. Since Fermi reflection during flux rope merger dominates energy gain in large-scale reconnecting systems and the rate of energy gain is proportional to energy, protons continue to gain energy faster than electrons for the duration of the simulations, leading to temperature increments of protons exceeding that of electrons and the non-thermal energy content of protons also exceeding that of electrons.</description>

      <title>Implication of neutron star observations to the origin of nucleon mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the implications of neutron star observations for understanding the origin of nucleon mass using a framework that combines three complementary approaches: the equation of state based on parity doublet structure for hadronic matter below $2n_0$, the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model for quark matter above $5n_0$, and a model-independent analysis of the intermediate density region based on fundamental physical principles. By systematically exploring parameter spaces and comparing theoretical predictions with recent observational constraints, we establish constraints on the chiral invariant mass. Our results suggest that more than a half of the nucleon mass originates from sources beyond spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, challenging conventional understanding of nucleon mass generation. These constraints arise solely from fundamental physical principles and observational data, independent of specific assumptions about the nature of the quark-hadron transition, providing robust insights into the microscopic origin of hadron masses.</description>

      <title>Noise Reduction Method for Radio Astronomy Single Station Observation Based on Wavelet Transform and Mathematical Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 21 cm radiation of neutral hydrogen provides crucial information for studying the early universe and its evolution. To advance this research, countries have made significant investments in constructing large low-frequency radio telescope arrays, such as the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and the Square Kilometre Array Phase 1 Low Frequency (SKA1-low). These instruments are pivotal for radio astronomy research. However, challenges such as ionospheric plasma interference, ambient radio noise, and instrument-related effects have become increasingly prominent, posing major obstacles in cosmology research. To address these issues, this paper proposes an efficient signal processing method that combines wavelet transform and mathematical morphology. The method involves the following steps: Background Subtraction: Background interference in radio observation signals is eliminated. Wavelet Transform: The signal, after removing background noise, undergoes a two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform. Threshold processing is then applied to the wavelet coefficients to effectively remove interference components. Wavelet Inversion: The processed signal is reconstructed using wavelet inversion. Mathematical Morphology: The reconstructed signal is further optimized using mathematical morphology to refine the results. Experimental verification was conducted using solar observation data from the Xinjiang Observatory and the Yunnan Observatory. The results demonstrate that this method successfully removes interference signals while preserving useful signals, thus improving the accuracy of radio astronomy observations and reducing the impact of radio frequency interference (RFI).</description>

      <title>Prototype Development and Calibration of the CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The space-based CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) mission aims to measure the linear polarization of solar flares in the hard X-ray band by means of a Compton scattering polarimeter. CUSP will allow to study the magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the flaring magnetic structures of our star with its unprecedented sensitivity to solar flare polarization. CUSP is a project in the framework of the Alcor Program of the Italian Space Agency aimed to develop new CubeSat missions. It has been proposed as a constellation of a two Cubesat mission to monitor the Sun for Space Weather, and will proceed with a single-satellite asset in its baseline implementation.
  In the frame of CUSP's Phase B study, that started in December 2024 for a 1-year period, we present the development status of this dual-phase polarimeter. Preliminary laboratory results using two chains of acquisition will be discussed. The first chain of acquisition, based on the Hamamatsu R7600 multi-anode photomultiplier tubes coupled to plastic scintillator bars and read out by the MAROC-3A ASIC, is used to detect the Compton scattering of incoming photons. On the other hand, GAGG crystals coupled to avalanche photo-diodes with a readout based on the SKIROC-2A ASIC are used to absorb the scattered photons. By reconstructing the azimuthal scattering direction for many incoming photons, one can infer the linear polarization degree and angle of the source. We will discuss the calibration results obtained with our prototype detector by using well-known radioactive isotopes, allowing us to assess the performances of our detector over the full 25-100 keV energy range.</description>

Abstract: The CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) project is a CubeSat mission orbiting the Earth aimed to measure the linear polarization of solar flares in the hard X-ray band by means of a Compton scattering polarimeter. CUSP will allow to study the magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the flaring magnetic structures of our star. CUSP is a project in the framework of the Alcor Program of the Italian Space Agency aimed to develop new CubeSat missions. CUSP undergoing the Phase B started in December 2024 that will last for 12 month. The Compton polarimeter of the CUSP payload performs coincidence measurements between plastic scintilaltors and GaGG(Ce) crystals to derive the polarization of X-rays. These sensors are readout by Multi Anode Photomultiplier Tubes (MAPMTs) and Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs) respectively. Both sensors need an HV power supply up to -1~kV (for the MAPMT) and +500~V (for the APD). We tested precision regulated High Voltage DC/DC Converters by HVM Technology Inc. with Sub-Miniature Case Size ($0.85''\times0.85''\times0.60''$) of the SMHV series. These modules are compact and suited for CubeSat missions.</description>

      <title>Gravity's role in taming the Tayler instability in red giant cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stability of toroidal magnetic fields in radiative stellar interiors is a key open problem in astrophysics. We investigate the Tayler instability of purely toroidal fields $B_\phi$ in a nonrotating, thermally stably stratified stellar region using global linear perturbation analysis and 3D direct numerical simulations in spherical geometry. Both approaches assume a magnetohydrostatic equilibrium where the Lorentz force is balanced by a pressure gradient, and include gravity and thermal diffusion. The simulations incorporate finite resistivity and viscosity and span the full range from stable to highly supercritical regimes for the first time. The global linear analysis reveals two classes of unstable nonaxisymmetric $m=1$ modes. High-latitude modes grow at Alfv\'enic rates with short radial scales, consistent with local WKB solutions. Low-latitude modes, missed by local analyses, show larger radial scales and reduced growth rates due to the stabilizing buoyancy. Simulations support these findings and yield field strength thresholds for both instability onset and the transition between global and WKB regimes. These thresholds correspond to the roots of two algebraic equations of the form $B_\phi^{3/4} - a_1 \mathcal{A}_1 B_\phi^{1/4} - a_0 \mathcal{A}_0 = 0$, where $\mathcal{A}_0$, $\mathcal{A}_1$ depend on the fluid properties, and $a_0$, $a_1$ are simulation-derived coefficients. Combining our results with stellar evolution models of low-mass stars, we find that outer radiative cores of red giants are generally unstable, while deeper degenerate regions require toroidal fields above $10-100$ kG for instability. Our findings may help to constrain asteroseismic magnetic field detection and angular momentum transport in red giant cores, and provide a framework for identifying instability conditions in other stars with radiative interiors.</description>

      <title>New Insights into the T Tauri Binary Separation Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For three decades, adaptive optic surveys have revealed an excess of T Tauri binaries across a = 10-100 au in nearby star-forming regions compared to the field population of main-sequence (MS) stars. Such an excess requires that most stars are born in dense clusters and subjected to significant dynamical processing that disrupts such binaries across intermediate separations. However, we demonstrate that the apparent excess is due to an observational selection bias. Close binaries within a &lt; 100 au clear out their dusty circumstellar disks on faster timescales compared to wide binaries and single stars. A magnitude-limited sample is therefore biased toward close binaries that have preferentially cleared out their obscuring disks. We re-examine the separation distribution of pre-MS binaries in low-density Taurus, moderately dense Upper Scorpius, and the extremely dense Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). By limiting the samples to primary spectral type / mass instead of magnitude, the artificial excess across a = 10-100 au disappears in all three environments. Across wider separations a = 100-4,000 au, Taurus exhibits an excess of companions (mostly tertiaries), the ONC displays a deficit, and Upper Scorpius matches the field MS population. The field derives from an amalgam of all three environments, where Upper Scorpius corresponds to the average birth environment of solar-type stars. The total binary fraction within a &lt; 10,000 au in Taurus is only 52% +/- 7%, substantially lower than the 100% inferred from the biased observations and only slightly higher than the field MS value of 45%. N-body interactions preferentially disrupt outer tertiaries with only marginal dynamical processing of the inner binaries, especially those within a &lt; 100 au.</description>

      <title>Rotating Supermassive Pop III Stars On The Main Sequence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of billion-solar-mass supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within the first billion years of cosmic history challenges conventional theories of black hole formation and growth. Simultaneously, recent JWST observations revealing exceptionally high nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratios in galaxies at high redshifts raise critical questions about rapid chemical enrichment mechanisms operating in the early universe. Supermassive stars (SMSs) with masses of 1000 to 10000 M$_{\odot}$ are promising candidates to explain these phenomena, but existing models have so far neglected the pivotal role of stellar rotation. Here, we present the first comprehensive evolutionary models of rotating Pop III SMSs computed using the GENEC stellar evolution code, including detailed treatments of rotation-induced chemical mixing, angular momentum transport, and mass loss driven by the $\Omega\Gamma$ limit. We demonstrate that rotation significantly enlarges the convective core and extends stellar lifetimes by up to 20%, with moderate enhancement of mass-loss rates as stars approach critical rotation thresholds. Our results further indicate that the cores of SMSs rotate relatively slowly (below $\sim 200$ km s$^{-1}$), resulting in dimensionless spin parameters $a* &lt; 0.1$ for intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) remnants that are notably lower than theoretical maximum spins. These findings highlight rotation as a key factor in determining the structural evolution, chemical yields, and black hole spin properties of SMSs, providing critical insights to interpret observational signatures from the high-redshift universe.</description>

      <title>Starkiller: subtracting stars and other sources from IFU spectroscopic data through forward modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present starkiller, an open-source Python package for forward-modeling flux retrieval from integral field unit spectrograph (IFU) datacubes. Starkiller simultaneously provides stellar spectral classification, relative velocity, and line-of-sight extinction for all sources in a catalog, alongside a source-subtracted datacube. It performs synthetic difference imaging by simulating all catalog sources in the field of view, using the catalog for positions and fluxes to scale stellar models, independent of the datacube. This differencing method is particularly powerful for subtracting both point-sources and trailed or even streaked sources from extended astronomical objects. We demonstrate starkiller's effectiveness in improving observations of extended sources in dense stellar fields for VLT/MUSE observations of comets, asteroids and nebulae. We also show that starkiller can treat satellite-impacted VLT/MUSE observations. The package could be applied to tasks as varied as dust extinction in clusters and stellar variability; the stellar modeling using Gaia fluxes is provided as a standalone function. The techniques can be expanded to imagers and to other IFUs.</description>

      <title>A statistical study of the metallicity of core-collapse supernovae based on VLT/MUSE integral-field-unit spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metallicity plays a crucial role in the evolution of massive stars and their final core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosions. Integral-field-unit (IFU) spectroscopy can provide a spatially resolved view of SN host galaxies and serve as a powerful tool to study SN metallicities. While early transient surveys targeted on high star formation rate and metallicity galaxies, recent untargeted, wide-field surveys (e.g., ASAS-SN, ZTF) have discovered large numbers of SNe without this bias. In this work, we construct a large sample of SNe discovered by wide-field untargted searches, consisting of 166 SNe of Types II(P), IIn, IIb, Ib and Ic at $z \leq 0.02$ with VLT/MUSE observations. This is currently the largest CCSN sample with IFU observations. With the strong-line method, we reveal the spatially-resolved metallicity maps of the SN host galaxies and acquire accurate metallicity measurements for the SN sites, finding a range from $12 + \log(\text{O/H}) = 8.1$ to 8.7 dex. And the metallicity distributions for different SN types are very close to each other, with mean and median values of 8.4--8.5 dex. Our large sample size narrows the 1$\sigma$ uncertainty down to only 0.05 dex. The apparent metallicity differences among SN types are all within $\sim$1$\sigma$ uncertainties and the metallicity distributions for different SN types are all consistent with being randomly drawn from the same reference distribution. This suggests that metallicity plays a minor role in the origin of different CCSN types and some other metallicity-insensitive processes, such as binary interaction, dominate the distinction of CCSN types.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Amplification and Reconstruction in Rotating Astrophysical Plasmas: Verifying the Roles of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in Dynamo Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigated the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ effects in a rotating spherical plasma system relevant to astrophysical environments. These coefficients were derived using three different approaches based on the large-scale magnetic field $\overline{\mathbf{B}}$, turbulent velocity $\mathbf{u}$, and turbulent magnetic field $\mathbf{b}$, yielding $\alpha_{\mathrm{EM-HM}}$, $\beta_{\mathrm{EM-HM}}$, $\beta_{\mathrm{vv-vw}}$, and $\beta_{\mathrm{bb+jb}}$. Using raw data from direct numerical simulations (DNS), we constructed the magnetic induction equation incorporating the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ coefficients. We then reproduced the $\overline{\mathbf{B}}$ field and compared the results with the DNS data. In the kinematic regime, where $\overline{\mathbf{B}}$ is weak, all models exhibit good agreement with the DNS results. However, in the nonlinear regime, the $\overline{\mathbf{B}}$ field, reproduced using $\beta_{\mathrm{vv-vw}}$, deviates from the DNS and exhibits unbounded growth. To address this discrepancy, we added $\beta_{\mathrm{bb+jb}}$, which represents the contribution of turbulent magnetic fields, to $\beta_{\mathrm{vv-vw}}$. This addition suppresses the divergent growth of $\overline{\mathbf{B}}$ in the nonlinear regime. We then assessed the actual influence of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ on the evolution of $\overline{\mathbf{B}}$ by applying weighted combinations of the two coefficients. Our results show that magnetic $\beta$ diffusion plays a dominant role throughout the entire process. In contrast, the $\alpha$ effect is minor in the kinematic regime but becomes essential for sustaining the $\overline{\mathbf{B}}$ field in the nonlinear regime. We also discussed the underlying physical mechanism responsible for this behavior.</description>

      <title>TESSELLATE: Piecing Together the Variable Sky With TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present TESSELLATE, a dedicated pipeline for performing an untargeted search documenting all variable phenomena captured by the TESS space telescope. Building on the TESSreduce difference imaging pipeline, TESSELLATE extracts calibrated and reduced photometric data for every full frame image in the TESS archive. Using this data, we systematically identify transient, variable and non-sidereal signals across timescales ranging from minutes to weeks. The high cadence and wide field of view of TESS enables us to conduct a comprehensive search of the entire sky to a depth of ~17 $m_i$. Based on the volumetric rates for known fast transients, we expect there to be numerous Fast Blue Optical Transients and Gamma Ray Burst afterglows present in the existing TESS dataset. Beyond transients, TESSELLATE can also identify new variable stars and exoplanet candidates, and recover known asteroids. We classify events using machine learning techniques and the work of citizen scientists via the Zooniverse Cosmic Cataclysms project. Finally, we introduce the TESSELLATE Sky Survey: a complete, open catalog of the variable sky observed by TESS.</description>

      <title>Cluster Ages to Reconstruct the Milky Way Assembly (CARMA). III. NGC 288 as the first Splashed globular cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The system of globular clusters (GCs) in the Milky Way (MW) comprises a mixture of both in situ and accreted clusters. Tracing the origin of GCs provides invaluable insights into the formation history of the MW. However, reconciling diverse strands of evidence is often challenging. A notable example is NGC 288, where despite significant efforts in the literature, the available chrono-chemodynamical data have yet to provide a definitive conclusion regarding its origin. On the one hand, all post-Gaia dynamical studies indicate an accreted origin for NGC 288 from the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) dwarf galaxy. On the other hand, NGC 288 has been found to be 2.5 Gyr older than other GSE GCs at the same metallicity, this suggesting a different (and possibly in situ) origin. In this work, we address the unresolved question on the origin of NGC 288 by analyzing its chrono-chemical properties in an unprecedentedly homogeneous framework. First, we compare the location of NGC 288 in the age-metallicity plane with that of other two in situ GCs at similar metallicity, namely NGC 6218 and NGC 6362. The age estimates obtained within the homogeneous framework of the CARMA collaboration show that the three clusters are coeval, reinforcing the contrast with the dynamical interpretation. Then, we compare the abundances with a sample of in situ and accreted clusters at similar metallicity, finding again consistency with the chemistry of in situ systems. To reconcile these results with its orbital properties, we propose a scenario where NGC 288 formed in the proto-disc of the MW, and then was dynamically heated by the interaction with the GSE merger. This is a fate that resembles that of proto-disc stars undergoing the so-called Splash event. Therefore, NGC 288 demonstrates the importance of a homogeneous chrono-chemodynamical information in the interpretation of the origin of MW GCs.</description>

      <title>Fast Radio Bursts and Electromagnetic Transition Radiation on Gravitational Shockwaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a gravitational shockwave hits a magnetar it creates perturbations of the magnetar magnetic field in a form of a transition radiation. We argue that this radiation can be a novel candidate to explain the origin of fast radio bursts (FRB). A unique feature of the transition radiation on the shockwaves is that normal components of its Maxwell strength `remember' only the spatial `profile' of the shock, not the form of the signal. This fact allows us to determine completely a characteristic initial problem for the perturbations with Cauchy data defined on a null hypersurface just behind the shockwave front. The computations are carried by modeling magnetar as a magnetic dipole. As an illustration we consider shockwaves created by ultrarelativistic objects of two types, by compact sources or by cosmic strings. In the both cases the duration of the engine pulse is determined by an impact distance between the magnetar and the source. We present the angular distribution of the transition radiation flux and show that it is consistent with properties of the FRB engine.</description>
