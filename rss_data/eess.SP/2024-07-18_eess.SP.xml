      <title>Multi-Band Wi-Fi Neural Dynamic Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wi-Fi channel measurements across different bands, e.g., sub-7-GHz and 60-GHz bands, are asynchronous due to the uncoordinated nature of distinct standards protocols, e.g., 802.11ac/ax/be and 802.11ad/ay. Multi-band Wi-Fi fusion has been considered before on a frame-to-frame basis for simple classification tasks, which does not require fine-time-scale alignment. In contrast, this paper considers asynchronous sequence-to-sequence fusion between sub-7-GHz channel state information (CSI) and 60-GHz beam signal-to-noise-ratio~(SNR)s for more challenging tasks such as continuous coordinate estimation. To handle the timing disparity between asynchronous multi-band Wi-Fi channel measurements, this paper proposes a multi-band neural dynamic fusion (NDF) framework. This framework uses separate encoders to embed the multi-band Wi-Fi measurement sequences to separate initial latent conditions. Using a continuous-time ordinary differential equation (ODE) modeling, these initial latent conditions are propagated to respective latent states of the multi-band channel measurements at the same time instances for a latent alignment and a post-ODE fusion, and at their original time instances for measurement reconstruction. We derive a customized loss function based on the variational evidence lower bound (ELBO) that balances between the multi-band measurement reconstruction and continuous coordinate estimation. We evaluate the NDF framework using an in-house multi-band Wi-Fi testbed and demonstrate substantial performance improvements over a comprehensive list of single-band and multi-band baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Mode Hopping with OAM-Based Index Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) based mode hopping (MH) scheme is expected to be a potential anti-jamming technology in radio vortex wireless communications. However, it only uses one OAM-mode for hopping, thus resulting in low spectrum efficiency (SE). Index modulation offers a trade-off balance between the SE and performance reliability. In this paper, we propose an MH with OAM-based index modulation scheme, where several OAM-modes are activated for hopping, to achieve high SE at a given bit error rate in radio vortex wireless communications. Based on the proposed scheme, we derive the upper bound and lower bound of achievable SEs. Furthermore, in order to take advantage of index information, we derive the optimal hopped OAM-modes to achieve the maximum SE. Numerical results show that our proposed MH with index modulation scheme can achieve high SE while satisfying a certain reliability of radio vortex wireless communications.</description>

      <title>Decomposed and Distributed Directional Modulation for Secure Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directional modulation and artificial noise (AN)-based methods have been widely employed to achieve physical-layer security (PLS). However, these approaches can only achieve angle-dependent secure transmission. This paper presents an AN-aided decomposed and distributed directional modulation (D3M) scheme for secure wireless communications, which takes advantage of the spatial signatures to achieve an extra range-dimension security apart from the angles. Leveraging decomposed and distributed structure, each of modulated signal is represented by mutually orthogonal in-phase and quadrature branches, which are transmitted by two distributed transmitters to enhance PLS. In particular, we first aim to minimize transmit message power by integrated design of the transmit beamformers, subject to prescribed received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the legitimate user (LU) and no inter-branch interference. This guarantees reliable and accurate transmission for the LU with the minimum transmit message power. Considering the leakage power on the sidelobes, AN is superimposed on the messages to try to mask the confidential information transmission. Simulation results demonstrate the security enhancement of our proposed D3M system.</description>

      <title>Joint OAM Multiplexing and OFDM in Sparse Multipath Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging orbital angular momentum (OAM) based wireless communication is expected to be a high spectrum-efficiency communication paradigm to solve the growing transmission data rate and limited bandwidth problem. Academic researchers mainly concentrate on the OAM-based line-of-sight (LoS) communications. However, there exist some surroundings around the transceiver in most practical wireless communication scenarios, thus forming multipath transmission. In this paper, a hybrid orthogonal division multiplexing (HODM) scheme by using OAM multiplexing and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in conjunction is proposed to achieve high-capacity wireless communications in sparse multipath environments, where the scatterers are sparse. We first build the OAM-based wireless channel in a LoS path and several reflection paths combined sparse multipath environments. We concentrate on less than or equal to three-time reflection paths because of the severe energy attenuation. The phase difference among the channel amplitude gains of the LoS and reflection paths, which is caused by the reflection paths, makes it difficult to decompose the OAM signals. We propose the phase difference compensation to handle this problem and then calculate the corresponding capacity in radio vortex wireless communications. Numerical results illustrate that the capacity of wireless communications by using our proposed HODM scheme can be drastically increased in sparse multipath environments.</description>

      <title>Mode Hopping for Anti-Jamming in Radio Vortex Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency hopping (FH) has been widely used as a powerful technique for antijamming in wireless communications. However, as the wireless spectrum is becoming more and more crowded, it is very difficult to achieve efficient antijamming results with FH-based schemes. Orbital angular momentum (OAM), which provides the new angular/mode dimension for wireless communications, offers an intriguing way for antijamming. In this paper, we propose to use the orthogonality of OAM-modes for antijamming in wireless communications. In particular, we propose the mode hopping (MH) scheme for antijamming within the narrow frequency band. We derive the closed-form expression of bit error rate (BER) for multiple users scenario with our developed MH scheme. Our developed MH scheme can achieve the same antijamming results within the narrow frequency band as compared with the conventional wideband FH scheme. Furthermore, we propose mode-frequency hopping (MFH) scheme, which jointly uses our developed MH scheme and the conventional FH scheme to further decrease the BER for wireless communication. Numerical results are presented to show that the BER of our developed MH scheme within the narrow frequency band is the same with that of the conventional wideband FH scheme. Moreover, the BER of our developed MFH schemes is much smaller than that of the conventional FH schemes for wireless communications.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Integrated Sensing and Communication Networks: Analysis and Distributed Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a cooperative integrated sensing and communication network (Co-ISACNet) adopting hybrid beamforming (HBF) architecture, which improves both radar sensing and communication performance. The main contributions of this work are four-fold. First, we introduce a novel cooperative sensing method for the considered Co-ISACNet, followed by a comprehensive analysis of this method. This analysis mathematically verifies the benefits of Co-ISACNet and provides insightful design guidelines. Second, to show the benefits of Co-ISACNet, we propose to jointly design the HBF to maximize the network communication capacity while satisfying the constraint of beampattern similarity for radar sensing, which results in a highly dimensional and non-convex problem. Third, to facilitate the joint design, we propose a novel distributed optimization framework based on proximal gradient and alternating direction method of multipliers, namely PANDA. Fourth, we further adopt the proposed PANDA framework to solve the joint HBF design problem for the Co-ISACNet. By using the proposed PANDA framework, all access points (APs) optimize the HBF in parallel, where each AP only requires local channel state information and limited message exchange among the APs. Such framework reduces significantly the computational complexity and thus has pronounced benefits in practical scenarios. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared with the conventional centralized algorithm and show the remarkable performance improvement of radar sensing and communication by deploying Co-ISACNet.</description>

      <title>Empowering 5G PRS-Based ISAC with Compressed Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enable widespread use of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) in future communication systems, an important requirement is the ease of integration. A possible way to achieve this is to use existing communication reference signals for sensing, such as the 5G Positioning Reference Signal (PRS). Existing works have demonstrated promising results by using the PRS with classical signal processing techniques. However, this approach suffers from a loss of SNR due to the sparse resource allocation. In this work, we improve upon existing results by combining the 5G PRS with compressed sensing methods. We demonstrate that our method achieves better noise robustness compared to the existing works and has superresolution properties, making it an ideal choice for range-Doppler map generation and target detection even in noisy environments.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis and Low-Complexity Beamforming Design for Near-Field Physical Layer Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale arrays (XL-arrays) have emerged as a key enabler in achieving the unprecedented performance requirements of future wireless networks, leading to a significant increase in the range of the near-field region. This transition necessitates the spherical wavefront model for characterizing the wireless propagation rather than the far-field planar counterpart, thereby introducing extra degrees of freedom (DoFs) to wireless system design. In this paper, we explore the beam focusing-based physical layer security (PLS) in the near field, where multiple legitimate users and one eavesdropper are situated in the near-field region of the XL-array base station (BS). First, we consider a special case with one legitimate user and one eavesdropper to shed useful insights into near-field PLS. In particular, it is shown that 1) Artificial noise (AN) is crucial to near-field security provisioning, transforming an insecure system to a secure one; 2) AN can yield numerous security gains, which considerably enhances PLS in the near field as compared to the case without AN taken into account. Next, for the general case with multiple legitimate users, we propose an efficient low-complexity approach to design the beamforming with AN to guarantee near-field secure transmission. Specifically, the low-complexity approach is conceived starting by introducing the concept of interference domain to capture the inter-user interference level, followed by a three-step identification framework for designing the beamforming. Finally, numerical results reveal that 1) the PLS enhancement in the near field is pronounced thanks to the additional spatial DoFs; 2) the proposed approach can achieve close performance to that of the computationally-extensive conventional approach yet with a significantly lower computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Optimal Closed-Form Phase Configuration of $1$-bit RISs via Sign Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) constitute one of the most prominent enablers for the upcoming sixth Generation (6G) of wireless networks, the design of efficient RIS phase profiles remains a notorious challenge when large numbers of phase-quantized unit cells are involved, typically of a single bit, as implemented by a vast majority of existing metasurface prototypes. In this paper, we focus on the RIS phase configuration problem for the exemplary case of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) maximization for an RIS-enabled single-input single-output system where the metasurface tunable elements admit a phase difference of $\pi$ radians. We present a novel closed-form configuration which serves as a lower bound guaranteeing at least half the SNR of the ideal continuous (upper bound) SNR gain, and whose mean performance is shown to be asymptotically optimal. The proposed sign alignment configuration can be further used as initialization to standard discrete optimization algorithms. A discussion on the reduced complexity hardware benefits via the presented configuration is also included. Our numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed RIS sign alignment scheme over iterative approaches as well as the commonplace continuous phase quantization treatment.</description>

      <title>With or Without Replacement? Improving Confidence in Fourier Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last few years, debiased estimators have been proposed in order to establish rigorous confidence intervals for high-dimensional problems in machine learning and data science. The core argument is that the error of these estimators with respect to the ground truth can be expressed as a Gaussian variable plus a remainder term that vanishes as long as the dimension of the problem is sufficiently high. Thus, uncertainty quantification (UQ) can be performed exploiting the Gaussian model. Empirically, however, the remainder term cannot be neglected in many realistic situations of moderately-sized dimensions, in particular in certain structured measurement scenarios such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). This, in turn, can downgrade the advantage of the UQ methods as compared to non-UQ approaches such as the standard LASSO. In this paper, we present a method to improve the debiased estimator by sampling without replacement. Our approach leverages recent results of ours on the structure of the random nature of certain sampling schemes showing how a transition between sampling with and without replacement can lead to a weighted reconstruction scheme with improved performance for the standard LASSO. In this paper, we illustrate how this reweighted sampling idea can also improve the debiased estimator and, consequently, provide a better method for UQ in Fourier imaging.</description>

      <title>Approximate Partially Decentralized Linear EZF Precoding for Massive MU-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems enable high spatial resolution, high spectral efficiency, and improved link reliability compared to traditional MIMO systems due to the large number of antenna elements deployed at the base station (BS). Nevertheless, conventional massive MU-MIMO BS transceiver designs rely on centralized linear precoding algorithms, which entail high interconnect data rates and a prohibitive complexity at the centralized baseband processing unit. In this paper, we consider an MU-MIMO system, where each user device is served with multiple independent data streams in the downlink. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel decentralized BS architecture, and develop a novel decentralized precoding algorithm based on eigen-zero-forcing (EZF). Our proposed approach relies on parallelizing the baseband processing tasks across multiple antenna clusters at the BS, while minimizing the interconnection requirements between the clusters, and is shown to closely approach the performance of centralized EZF.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an empirical investigation of software developed by the Science and Music Research Group at the University of Glasgow. Initially created for musicological applications, it is equally applicable in any area where precise time and frequency information is required from a signal, without encountering the problems associated with the uncertainty principle. By constructing a bank of non-linear tuned resonators (`detectors'), each of which operates at a Hopf bifurcation, it is possible to detect frequencies within half a period of oscillation, even in the presence of wideband noise. The time and frequency response characteristics of these detectors will be examined here.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Fractal UCA Based N-Dimensional OAM Orthogonal Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vortex electromagnetic wave carried by multiple orthogonal orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes in the same frequency band can be applied to the field of wireless communications, which greatly increases the spectrum efficiency. The uniform circular array (UCA) structure is widely used to generate or receive vortex electromagnetic waves with multiple OAM-modes. However, the maximum number of orthogonal OAM-modes based on UCA is usually limited to the number of array-elements of the UCA antenna, leaving how to utilize more OAM-modes to achieve higher spectrum efficiency given a fixed number of array-elements as an intriguing question. In this paper, we propose an Ndimensional quasi-fractal UCA (ND QF-UCA) antenna structure in different fractal geometry layouts to break through the limits of array-elements number on OAM-modes number. We develop the N-dimensional OAM modulation (NOM) and demodulation (NOD) schemes for OAM multiplexing transmission with the OAM-modes number exceeding the array-elements number, which is beyond the traditional concept of multiple antenna based wireless communications. Then, we investigate different dimensional multiplex transmission schemes based on the corresponding QF-UCA antenna structure with various array-elements layouts. Simulation results show that our proposed schemes can obtain a higher spectrum efficiency.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised and Interpretable Synthesizing for Electrical Time Series Based on Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating synthetic data has become a popular alternative solution to deal with the difficulties in accessing and sharing field measurement data in power systems. However, to make the generation results controllable, existing methods (e.g. Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets, cGAN) require labeled dataset to train the model, which is demanding in practice because many field measurement data lacks descriptive labels. In this paper, we introduce the Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Nets (infoGAN) to achieve interpretable feature extraction and controllable synthetic data generation based on the unlabeled electrical time series dataset. Features with clear physical meanings can be automatically extracted by maximizing the mutual information between the input latent code and the classifier output of infoGAN. Then the extracted features are used to control the generation results similar to a vanilla cGAN framework. Case study is based on the time series datasets of power load and renewable energy output. Results demonstrate that infoGAN can extract both discrete and continuous features with clear physical meanings, as well as generating realistic synthetic time series that satisfy given features.</description>

      <title>BIRA: A Spherical Bistatic Reflectivity Measurement System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming 6G mobile communication standard will offer a revolutionary new feature: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) reuses mobile communication signals to realize multi-static radar for various applications including localization. Consequently, applied ISAC propagation research necessitates to evolve from classical monostatic radar cross section (RCS) measurement of static targets on to bistatic radar reflectivity characterization of dynamic objects. Here, we introduce our "Bistatic Radar" (BIRA) and antenna measurement facility for bistatic spherical positioning with sub-millimeter accuracy on a diameter of up to 7 m and with almost continuous frequency coverage from 0.7 up to 260 GHz. Currently, BIRA is the only bistatic measurement facility capable of unrestricted ISAC research: In addition to vector network analysis, BIRA employs advanced wideband transceiver technology with an instantaneous bandwidth of up to 4 GHz. These transceivers grant BIRA the unique ability to characterize dynamic targets in both Doppler and range, while also significantly accelerating RCS measurements of static objects.</description>

Abstract: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are indispensable for data-intensive applications, necessitating efficient energy management and robust data fusion techniques. This paper proposes an integrated framework leveraging fuzzy logic and backpropagation neural networks (BPNN) to enhance energy efficiency and data accuracy in WSNs. The model focuses on optimizing Cluster Head (CH) selection using fuzzy logic, considering parameters such as energy levels, proximity to the base station, and local density centrality. A Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm is employed for energy-efficient data transmission from sensor nodes to CHs, minimizing energy consumption during data routing. BPNN-based data fusion at CHs reduces redundant data transmissions to the base station, thereby optimizing energy utilization and enhancing overall network performance. Simulation results demonstrate substantial improvements over conventional methods, including a 30% increase in network longevity, 25% improvement in data accuracy, and a 40% reduction in energy consumption. These gains are attributed to the intelligent CH selection strategy enabled by fuzzy logic, which ensures efficient resource allocation and minimizes energy wastage. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through comprehensive simulations, showcasing its ability to prolong network lifetime, maintain data integrity, and improve energy efficiency. The integration of fuzzy logic and BPNN not only addresses the challenges of energy management and data fusion in WSNs but also provides a scalable and adaptable framework for future applications requiring reliable and sustainable sensor network operations.

      <title>Matching-Driven Deep Reinforcement Learning for Energy-Efficient Transmission Parameter Allocation in Multi-Gateway LoRa Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-range (LoRa) communication technology, distinguished by its low power consumption and long communication range, is widely used in the Internet of Things. Nevertheless, the LoRa MAC layer adopts pure ALOHA for medium access control, which may suffer from severe packet collisions as the network scale expands, consequently reducing the system energy efficiency (EE). To address this issue, it is critical to carefully allocate transmission parameters such as the channel (CH), transmission power (TP) and spreading factor (SF) to each end device (ED). Owing to the low duty cycle and sporadic traffic of LoRa networks, evaluating the system EE under various parameter settings proves to be time-consuming. Consequently, we propose an analytical model aimed at calculating the system EE while fully considering the impact of multiple gateways, duty cycling, quasi-orthogonal SFs and capture effects. On this basis, we investigate a joint CH, SF and TP allocation problem, with the objective of optimizing the system EE for uplink transmissions. Due to the NP-hard complexity of the problem, the optimization problem is decomposed into two subproblems: CH assignment and SF/TP assignment. First, a matching-based algorithm is introduced to address the CH assignment subproblem. Then, an attention-based multiagent reinforcement learning technique is employed to address the SF/TP assignment subproblem for EDs allocated to the same CH, which reduces the number of learning agents to achieve fast convergence. The simulation outcomes indicate that the proposed approach converges quickly under various parameter settings and obtains significantly better system EE than baseline algorithms.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Aided Vehicular Edge Computing: Joint Phase-shift Optimization and Multi-User Power Allocation</title>

Abstract: Vehicular edge computing (VEC) is an emerging technology with significant potential in the field of internet of vehicles (IoV), enabling vehicles to perform intensive computational tasks locally or offload them to nearby edge devices. However, the quality of communication links may be severely deteriorated due to obstacles such as buildings, impeding the offloading process. To address this challenge, we introduce the use of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS), which provide alternative communication pathways to assist vehicular communication. By dynamically adjusting the phase-shift of the RIS, the performance of VEC systems can be substantially improved. In this work, we consider a RIS-assisted VEC system, and design an optimal scheme for local execution power, offloading power, and RIS phase-shift, where random task arrivals and channel variations are taken into account. To address the scheme, we propose an innovative deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that combines the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm for optimizing RIS phase-shift coefficients and the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm for optimizing the power allocation of vehicle user (VU). Simulation results show that our proposed scheme outperforms the traditional centralized DDPG, Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) and some typical stochastic schemes.</description>

      <title>Interleaved Block-Sparse Transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-complexity Bayes-optimal memory approximate message passing (MAMP) is an efficient signal estimation algorithm in compressed sensing and multicarrier modulation. However, achieving replica Bayes optimality with MAMP necessitates a large-scale right-unitarily invariant transformation, which is prohibitive in practical systems due to its high computational complexity and hardware costs. To solve this difficulty, this letter proposes a low-complexity interleaved block-sparse (IBS) transform, which consists of interleaved multiple low-dimensional transform matrices, aimed at reducing the hardware implementation scale while mitigating performance loss. Furthermore, an IBS cross-domain memory approximate message passing (IBS-CD-MAMP) estimator is developed, comprising a memory linear estimator in the IBS transform domain and a non-linear estimator in the source domain. Numerical results show that the IBS-CD-MAMP offers a reduced implementation scale and lower complexity with excellent performance in IBS-based compressed sensing and interleave frequency division multiplexing systems.</description>

      <title>Group Movable Antenna With Flexible Sparsity: Joint Array Position and Sparsity Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) is a promising technology to exploit the spatial variation of wireless channel for performance enhancement, by dynamically varying the antenna position within a certain region. However, for multi-antenna communication systems, moving each antenna independently not only requires prohibitive complexity to find the optimal antenna positions, but also incurs sophisticated movement control in practice. To address this issue, this letter proposes a new MA architecture termed group MA (GMA), enabling the group movement of all elements collectively in a continuous manner, and simultaneously achieving flexible array architecture by antenna selection (AS). In this letter, we focus on the uniform sparse array based GMA, where equally spaced antenna elements are selected to achieve desired array sparsity. The array position and sparsity level are jointly optimized to maximize the sum rate of the multi-user communication system. Numerical results verify the necessity to optimize the position and sparsity of GMA, and considerable performance gain is achieved as compared to the conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA).</description>

      <title>Hybrid Deep Learning-Based for Enhanced Occlusion Segmentation in PICU Patient Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote patient monitoring has emerged as a prominent non-invasive method, using digital technologies and computer vision (CV) to replace traditional invasive monitoring. While neonatal and pediatric departments embrace this approach, Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) face the challenge of occlusions hindering accurate image analysis and interpretation. \textit{Objective}: In this study, we propose a hybrid approach to effectively segment common occlusions encountered in remote monitoring applications within PICUs. Our approach centers on creating a deep-learning pipeline for limited training data scenarios. \textit{Methods}: First, a combination of the well-established Google DeepLabV3+ segmentation model with the transformer-based Segment Anything Model (SAM) is devised for occlusion segmentation mask proposal and refinement. We then train and validate this pipeline using a small dataset acquired from real-world PICU settings with a Microsoft Kinect camera, achieving an Intersection-over-Union (IoU) metric of 85\%. \textit{Results}: Both quantitative and qualitative analyses underscore the effectiveness of our proposed method. The proposed framework yields an overall classification performance with 92.5\% accuracy, 93.8\% recall, 90.3\% precision, and 92.0\% F1-score. Consequently, the proposed method consistently improves the predictions across all metrics, with an average of 2.75\% gain in performance compared to the baseline CNN-based framework. \textit{Conclusions}: Our proposed hybrid approach significantly enhances the segmentation of occlusions in remote patient monitoring within PICU settings. This advancement contributes to improving the quality of care for pediatric patients, addressing a critical need in clinical practice by ensuring more accurate and reliable remote monitoring.</description>

      <title>Quantifying uncertainty in area and regression coefficient estimation from remote sensing maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote sensing map products are used to obtain estimates of environmental quantities, such as deforested area or the effect of conservation zones on deforestation. However, the quality of map products varies, and - because maps are outputs of complex machine learning algorithms that take in a variety of remotely sensed variables as inputs - errors are difficult to characterize. Without capturing the biases that may be present, naive calculations of population-level estimates from such maps are statistically invalid. In this paper, we compare several uncertainty quantification methods - stratification, Olofsson area estimation method, and prediction-powered inference - that combine a small amount of randomly sampled ground truth data with large-scale remote sensing map products to generate statistically valid estimates. Applying these methods across four remote sensing use cases in area and regression coefficient estimation, we find that they result in estimates that are more reliable than naively using the map product as if it were 100% accurate and have lower uncertainty than using only the ground truth and ignoring the map product. Prediction-powered inference uses ground truth data to correct for bias in the map product estimate and (unlike stratification) does not require us to choose a map product before sampling. This is the first work to (1) apply prediction-powered inference to remote sensing estimation tasks, and (2) perform uncertainty quantification on remote sensing regression coefficients without assumptions on the structure of map product errors. To improve the utility of machine learning-generated remote sensing maps for downstream applications, we recommend that map producers provide a holdout ground truth dataset to be used for calibration in uncertainty quantification alongside their maps.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Channel Decoding for Wireless Federated Learning: Convergence Analysis and Adaptive Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most critical challenges for deploying distributed learning, such as federated learning (FL), in wireless networks is the limited battery capacity of mobile devices. While it is a common belief that the major energy consumption of mobile devices comes from the uplink data transmission, this paper presents a novel finding, namely the channel decoding operation also contributes significantly to the overall energy consumption of mobile devices in FL. Motivated by this new observation, we propose an energy-efficient adaptive channel decoding scheme that leverages the intrinsic robustness of FL to model errors. In particular, the robustness is exploited to reduce the energy consumption of channel decoders at mobile devices by adaptively adjusting the number of decoding iterations. We theoretically prove that FL with communication errors can converge at the same rate as error-free communication as long as the bit error rate (BER) is properly constrained. An adaptive channel decoding scheme is then proposed to improve the energy efficiency of FL systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method maintains the same learning accuracy while reducing the channel decoding energy consumption by 20% when compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>GAP9Shield: A 150GOPS AI-capable Ultra-low Power Module for Vision and Ranging Applications on Nano-drones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of AI and digital signal processing technologies, combined with affordable energy-efficient processors, has propelled the development of both hardware and software for drone applications. Nano-drones, which fit into the palm of the hand, are suitable for indoor environments and safe for human interaction; however, they often fail to deliver the required performance for complex tasks due to the lack of hardware providing sufficient sensing and computing performance. Addressing this gap, we present the GAP9Shield, a nano-drone-compatible module powered by the GAP9, a 150GOPS-capable SoC. The system also includes a 5MP OV5647 camera for high-definition imaging, a WiFi-BLE NINA module, and a 5D VL53L1-based ranging subsystem, which enhances obstacle avoidance capabilities. In comparison with similarly targeted state-of-the-art systems, GAP9Shield provides a 20% higher sample rate (RGB images) while offering a 20% weight reduction. In this paper, we also highlight the energy efficiency and processing power capabilities of GAP9 for object detection (YOLO), localization, and mapping, which can run within a power envelope of below 100 mW and at low latency (as 17 ms for object detection), highlighting the transformative potential of GAP9 for the new generation of nano-drone applications.</description>

Abstract: This letter introduces a low-complexity beamforming approach for MU-MIMO systems with multiple data streams per user, minimizing inter-user interference and improving spectral efficiency (SE). The Interference-Optimized Singular Vector Beamforming (IOSVB) algorithm is developed by correlating inter-user interference with channel singular vectors. It blends interference minimization and SE maximization by identifying ideal singular vectors. Extensive simulations demonstrate that IOSVB provides near-optimal SE performance, closely matching exhaustive search results while reducing the computational overhead. This novel approach in MU-MIMO systems is a promising option for future 6G wireless communication networks due to its excellent performance and reduced complexity.</description>

      <title>Distributed Parameter Estimation with Gaussian Observation Noises in Time-varying Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03911v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of distributed parameter estimation in sensor networks. Each sensor makes successive observations of an unknown $d$-dimensional parameter, which might be subject to Gaussian random noises. The sensors aim to infer the true value of the unknown parameter by cooperating with each other. To this end, we first generalize the so-called dynamic regressor extension and mixing (DREM) algorithm to stochastic systems, with which the problem of estimating a $d$-dimensional vector parameter is transformed to that of $d$ scalar ones: one for each of the unknown parameters. For each of the scalar problem, both combine-then-adapt (CTA) and adapt-then-combine (ATC) diffusion-based estimation algorithms are given, where each sensor performs a combination step to fuse the local estimates in its in-neighborhood, alongside an adaptation step to process its streaming observations. Under weak conditions on network topology and excitation of regressors, we show that the proposed estimators guarantee that each sensor infers the true parameter, even if any individual of them cannot by itself. Specifically, it is required that the union of topologies over an interval with fixed length is strongly connected. Moreover, the sensors must collectively satisfy a cooperative persistent excitation (PE) condition, which relaxes the traditional PE condition. Numerical examples are finally provided to illustrate the established results.</description>

      <title>An ADMM-Based Geometric Configuration Optimization in RSSD-Based Source Localization By UAVs with Spread Angle Constraint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deploying multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to locate a signal-emitting source covers a wide range of military and civilian applications like rescue and target tracking. It is well known that the UAVs-source (sensors-target) geometry, namely geometric configuration, significantly affects the final localization accuracy. This paper focuses on the geometric configuration optimization for received signal strength difference (RSSD)-based passive source localization by drone swarm. Different from prior works, this paper considers a general measuring condition where the spread angle of drone swarm centered on the source is constrained. Subject to this constraint, a geometric configuration optimization problem with the aim of maximizing the determinant of Fisher information matrix (FIM) is formulated. After transforming this problem using matrix theory, an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based optimization framework is proposed. To solve the subproblems in this framework, two global optimal solutions based on the Von Neumann matrix trace inequality theorem and majorize-minimize (MM) algorithm are proposed respectively. Finally, the effectiveness as well as the practicality of the proposed ADMM-based optimization algorithm are demonstrated by extensive simulations.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents tighter lower bounds on the maximum aperiodic ambiguity function (AF) magnitude of unimodular sequences under certain delay-Doppler low ambiguity zones (LAZ). These bounds are derived by exploiting the upper and lower bounds on the Frobenius norm of the weighted auto- and cross-AF matrices, with the introduction of two weight vectors associated with the delay and Doppler shifts, respectively. As a second major contribution, we demonstrate that our derived lower bounds are asymptotically achievable with selected Chu sequence sets by analyzing their maximum auto- and cross- AF magnitudes within certain LAZ.</description>

      <title>Mechanics-Informed Autoencoder Enables Automated Detection and Localization of Unforeseen Structural Damage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structural health monitoring (SHM) ensures the safety and longevity of structures like buildings and bridges. As the volume and scale of structures and the impact of their failure continue to grow, there is a dire need for SHM techniques that are scalable, inexpensive, can operate passively without human intervention, and are customized for each mechanical structure without the need for complex baseline models. We present MIDAS, a novel "deploy-and-forget" approach for automated detection and localization of damage in structures. It is a synergistic integration of entirely passive measurements from inexpensive sensors, data compression, and a mechanics-informed autoencoder. Once deployed, MIDAS continuously learns and adapts a bespoke baseline model for each structure, learning from its undamaged state's response characteristics. After learning from just 3 hours of data, it can autonomously detect and localize different types of unforeseen damage. Results from numerical simulations and experiments indicate that incorporating the mechanical characteristics into the autoencoder allows for up to a 35% improvement in the detection and localization of minor damage over a standard autoencoder. Our approach holds significant promise for reducing human intervention and inspection costs while enabling proactive and preventive maintenance strategies. This will extend the lifespan, reliability, and sustainability of civil infrastructures.</description>

      <title>User Connection and Resource Allocation Optimization in Blockchain Empowered Metaverse over 6G Wireless Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The convergence of blockchain, Metaverse, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) brings transformative digital opportunities alongside challenges like privacy and resource management. Addressing these, we focus on optimizing user connectivity and resource allocation in an NFT-centric and blockchain-enabled Metaverse in this paper. Through user work-offloading, we optimize data tasks, user connection parameters, and server computing frequency division. In the resource allocation phase, we optimize communication-computation resource distributions, including bandwidth, transmit power, and computing frequency. We introduce the trust-cost ratio (TCR), a pivotal measure combining trust scores from users' resources and server history with delay and energy costs. This balance ensures sustained user engagement and trust. The DASHF algorithm, central to our approach, encapsulates the Dinkelbach algorithm, alternating optimization, semidefinite relaxation (SDR), the Hungarian method, and a novel fractional programming technique from a recent IEEE JSAC paper [2]. The most challenging part of DASHF is to rewrite an optimization problem as Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programming (QCQP) via carefully designed transformations, in order to be solved by SDR and the Hungarian algorithm. Extensive simulations validate the DASHF algorithm's efficacy, revealing critical insights for enhancing blockchain-Metaverse applications, especially with NFTs.</description>

Abstract: This work presents a novel approach to neural architecture search (NAS) that aims to increase carbon efficiency for the model design process. The proposed framework CE-NAS addresses the key challenge of high carbon cost associated with NAS by exploring the carbon emission variations of energy and energy differences of different NAS algorithms. At the high level, CE-NAS leverages a reinforcement-learning agent to dynamically adjust GPU resources based on carbon intensity, predicted by a time-series transformer, to balance energy-efficient sampling and energy-intensive evaluation tasks. Furthermore, CE-NAS leverages a recently proposed multi-objective optimizer to effectively reduce the NAS search space. We demonstrate the efficacy of CE-NAS in lowering carbon emissions while achieving SOTA results for both NAS datasets and open-domain NAS tasks. For example, on the HW-NasBench dataset, CE-NAS reduces carbon emissions by up to 7.22X while maintaining a search efficiency comparable to vanilla NAS. For open-domain NAS tasks, CE-NAS achieves SOTA results with 97.35% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 with only 1.68M parameters and a carbon consumption of 38.53 lbs of CO2. On ImageNet, our searched model achieves 80.6% top-1 accuracy with a 0.78 ms TensorRT latency using FP16 on NVIDIA V100, consuming only 909.86 lbs of CO2, making it comparable to other one-shot-based NAS baselines.</description>

      <title>Multi-Active-IRS-Assisted Cooperative Sensing: Cram\'{e}r-Rao Bound and Joint Beamforming Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12426</link>

Abstract: This paper studies the multi-intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted cooperative sensing, in which multiple active IRSs are deployed in a distributed manner to facilitate multi-view target sensing at the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) area of the base station (BS). Different from prior works employing passive IRSs, we leverage active IRSs with the capability of amplifying the reflected signals to overcome the severe multi-hop-reflection path loss in NLoS sensing. In particular, we consider two sensing setups without and with dedicated sensors equipped at active IRSs. In the first case without dedicated sensors at IRSs, we investigate the cooperative sensing at the BS, where the target's direction-of-arrival (DoA) with respect to each IRS is estimated based on the echo signals received at the BS. In the other case with dedicated sensors at IRSs, we consider that each IRS is able to receive echo signals and estimate the target's DoA with respect to itself. For both sensing setups, we first derive the closed-form Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating target DoA. Then, the (maximum) CRB is minimized by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming at the BS and the reflective beamforming at the multiple IRSs, subject to the constraints on the maximum transmit power at the BS, as well as the maximum amplification power and the maximum power amplification gain constraints at individual active IRSs. To tackle the resulting highly non-convex (max-)CRB minimization problems, we propose two efficient algorithms to obtain high-quality solutions for the two cases with sensing at the BS and at the IRSs, respectively, based on alternating optimization, successive convex approximation, and semi-definite relaxation.</description>
