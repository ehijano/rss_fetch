      <title>Conformal invariance in out-of-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensates governed by the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study density isolines in quantum turbulence under the Schramm-Loewner framework using direct numerical simulations of the truncated Gross-Pitaevskii equation, in both spherical and cylindrical traps with three-dimensional dynamics. Density isolines develop increasing complexity as turbulence matures. As the systems evolves towards a thermalized regime, it spontaneously develops conformal invariance. In contrast to other systems exhibiting conformal invariance, this system manifests it during the transition towards disorder rather than to self-organization. We discuss a link between this behavior in quantum turbulence and other 4-wave interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic potential immersed in a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a modified three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevski equation that describes a static impurity in a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Our focus is on the interplay between the shape of the impurity and the anisotropy of the medium manifested in the energy and the density of the system. Without external confinement, properties of the system are derived with basic analytical approaches. For a system in a harmonic trap, the model is investigated numerically, using the split-step Crank-Nicolson method. Our results demonstrate that the impurity would prefer to change its shape to accommodate the anisotropic character of the bath, in particular it would prefer to align itself with the direction of the dipoles. Our work complements studies of impurities in Bose gases with zero-range interactions, and paves the way for studies of dipolar polarons with a modified Gross-Pitaevski equation.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Generation of Superflow in a Fermionic Ring through Phase Imprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamic generation of persistent current by phase imprinting fermionic atoms in a ring geometry. Mediated by the pairing interaction, the Fermi condensate dynamically acquires a quantized current by developing azimuthal phase slips, as well as density and pairing-order-parameter depletions. Resorting to the Bogolioubov-de Gennes formalism, we investigate the time evolution of the transferred total angular momentum and the quantized superfluid current throughout the phase-imprinting process. This enables a detailed analysis of the impact of interaction, as well as different initial pairing states, on the superflow formation. In particular, we show that, as the condensate is tuned toward the Bose-Einstein-condensate side of the Feshbach resonance, the azimuthal density distribution becomes less susceptible to the phase imprinting potential, leading to smaller quantized current under the same imprinting parameters. Our results offer microscopic insights into the dynamic development of superflow in the phase-imprinting process, and are helpful for the ongoing experimental effort.</description>

      <title>Controlling Vortex Lattice Structure of Binary Bose-Einstein Condensates via Disorder Induced Vortex Pinning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the vortex pinning effect on the vortex lattice structure of the rotating two-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in the presence of impurities or disorder by numerically solving the time-dependent coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations. We investigate the transition of the vortex lattice structures by changing conditions such as angular frequency, the strength of the inter-component interaction and pinning potential, and also the lattice constant of the periodic pinning potential. We show that even a single impurity pinning potential can change the unpinned vortex lattice structure from triangular to square or from triangular to a structure which is the overlap of triangular and square. In the presence of periodic pinning potential or optical lattice, we observe the structural transition from the unpinned vortex lattice to the pinned vortex lattice structure of the optical lattice. In the presence of random pinning potential or disorder, the vortex lattice melts following a two-step process by creation of lattice defects, dislocations, and disclinations, with the increase of rotational frequency, similar to that observed for single component Bose-Einstein condensates. However, for the binary BECs, we show that additionally the two-step vortex lattice melting also occurs with increasing strength of the inter-component interaction.</description>

      <title>Collapse of a quantum vortex in an attractive two-dimensional Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally and numerically study the collapse dynamics of a quantum vortex in a two-dimensional atomic superfluid following a fast interaction ramp from repulsion to attraction. We find the conditions and time scales for a superfluid vortex to radially converge into a quasi-stationary density profile, demonstrating the first spontaneous formation of a vortex soliton in an atomic Bose gas. We record an emergent universal dynamics of an azimuthal modulational instability, which amplifies initial density perturbations and leads to the eventual splitting of a vortex soliton or direct fragmentation of a superfluid into disordered, but roughly circular arrays of Townes soliton-like wavepackets. Our study sets the stage for exploring universal out-of-equilibrium dynamics of vortex quantum matter quenched to attractive interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantum turbulence, superfluidity, non-Markovian dynamics, and wave function thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While quantum turbulence has been addressed both experimentally (predominantly for superfluid $^4$He and $^3$He) and theoretically, the dynamics of various ensembles of quantized vortices was followed in time only until the vortices decay into phonons. How this ``thermalization'' is achieved is still an unelucidated question. Here, we report on the microscopic treatment of the real-time dynamics of an initial ensemble of quantized vortices and anti-vortices, with no phonons, at zero temperature, in a Unitary Fermi Gas (UFG). We follow the system in time until ``thermalization'' is achieved, and a clear non-Markovian evolution of the single particle occupation probabilities is observed.</description>

      <title>Observation of a broad state-to-state spin-exchange collision near a p-wave Feshbach resonances of $^6$Li atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of state-to-state spin-exchange collisions in the vicinity of $p$-wave Feshbach resonances offer great opportunities to explore many-body interactions and novel quantum phases. Here, we report the observation of a spin-exchange collision near a $p$-wave Feshbach resonance within a mixture of the lowest and third-lowest hyperfine states of $^6$Li atoms. The spin-exchange interaction is observed over a range of ten gausses and produces a pair of atoms in the second-lowest hyperfine states that are captured by a deep optical dipole trap. We apply a coupled-channel method to calculate the scattering properties of this system. We find that the $p$-wave resonance exhibits a low inelastic collision rate and a broad resonance profile, which is due to the modification by the accompanying spin-exchange collisions. These findings open up new possibilities for the creation of long-lived, strongly interacting $p$-wave Fermi gases.</description>

      <title>Spinor Bose-Einstein condensates subject to current-density interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently achieved chiral condensates open intriguing avenues for the study of the chiral properties induced by current-density interactions. An attempt to include these features in a spinor system is presented, which gives rise to a nonlinear, effective spin-orbit coupling that emerges from the differential orbital currents, along with constraints in the conserved quantities due to the linear coupling between spin components. Chirality pervades the resulting spectrum of stationary states and their dynamical stability, which are explored in plane waves, dark and bright solitons, and Josephson vortices. Our analytical and numerical results reveal the destabilizing role of polarization and Josephson currents, and support the existence of stable nonlinear states built of linear superpositions of plane waves.</description>

      <title>Prethermalization in the PXP Model under Continuous Quasiperiodic Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments realizing long-lived non-equilibrium states in aperiodically driven quantum many-body systems, we investigate the dynamics of a quasiperiodically driven Rydberg atom chain in the strong Rydberg blockage regime. In this regime, the system is kinetically constrained and the `PXP' model describes its dynamics. Even without driving, the PXP model exhibits many-body scarring and resultant persistent oscillations for dynamics originating from the N\'{e}el-ordered initial state. We demonstrate that a rich array of dynamical behaviors emerge when the system is subjected to a continuous drive. In the high-frequency regime, the system exhibits revivals and oscillations for the N\'{e}el ordered initial state both for periodic and quasi-periodic drives. We trace the origin of this non-ergodicity to an effective PXP Hamiltonian for both of these driving protocols in this regime. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the behavior of the fidelity and the entanglement entropy is non-monotonic at low frequencies in the high-amplitude regime. This leads to several re-entrant scarring transitions both for both the N\'{e}el-ordered and the fully polarized initial state. Our results demonstrate that continuous quasi-periodic drive protocols can provide a promising route to realize prethermal phases of matter in kinetically constrained systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Hopf-Euler insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a class of three-band non-Abelian topological insulators in three dimensions which carry a single bulk Hopf index protected by spatiotemporal ($\mathcal{PT}$) inversion symmetry. These phases may also host subdimensional topological invariants given by the Euler characteristic class, resulting in real Hopf-Euler insulators. Such systems naturally realize helical nodal structures in the 3D Brillouin zone, providing a physical manifestation of the linking number described by the Hopf invariant. We show that, by opening a gap between the valence bands of these systems, one finds a fully-gapped `flag' phase, which displays a three-band multi-gap Pontryagin invariant. Unlike the previously reported $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric four-band real Hopf insulator, which hosts a $\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}$ invariant, these phases are not unitarily equivalent to two copies of a complex two-band Hopf insulator. We show that these uncharted phases can be obtained through dimensional extension of two-dimensional Euler insulators, and that they support (1) an optical bulk integrated circular shift effect quantized by the Hopf invariant, (2) quantum-geometric breathing in the real space Wannier functions, and (3) surface Euler topology on boundaries. Consequently, our findings pave a way for novel experimental realizations of real-space quantum-geometry, as these systems may be directly simulated by utilizing synthethic dimensions in metamaterials or ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Transformer neural networks and quantum simulators: a hybrid approach for simulating strongly correlated systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Owing to their great expressivity and versatility, neural networks have gained attention for simulating large two-dimensional quantum many-body systems. However, their expressivity comes with the cost of a challenging optimization due to the in general rugged and complicated loss landscape. Here, we present a hybrid optimization scheme for neural quantum states (NQS) that involves a data-driven pretraining with numerical or experimental data and a second, Hamiltonian-driven optimization stage. By using both projective measurements from the computational basis as well as expectation values from other measurement configurations such as spin-spin correlations, our pretraining gives access to the sign structure of the state, yielding improved and faster convergence that is robust w.r.t. experimental imperfections and limited datasets. We apply the hybrid scheme to the ground state search for the 2D transverse field Ising model and the 2D dipolar XY model on $6\times 6$ and $10\times 10$ square lattices with a patched transformer wave function, using numerical and experimental data from a programmable Rydberg quantum simulator [Chen et al., Nature 616 (2023)], with snapshots of the quantum system obtained from the different measurement configurations, and show that the information from the second basis highly improves the performance. Our work paves the way for a reliable and efficient optimization of neural quantum states.</description>

      <title>Dirac spin liquid in quantum dipole arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We predict that the gapless $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid naturally emerges in a two-dimensional array of quantum dipoles. In particular, we demonstrate that the dipolar XY model$\unicode{x2014}$realized in both Rydberg atom arrays and ultracold polar molecules$\unicode{x2014}$hosts a quantum spin liquid ground state on the kagome lattice. Large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations indicate that this spin liquid exhibits signatures of gapless, linearly-dispersing spinons, consistent with the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid. We identify a route to adiabatic preparation via staggered on-site fields and demonstrate that this approach can prepare cold spin liquids within experimentally realistic time-scales. Finally, we propose a number of novel signatures of the Dirac spin liquid tailored to near-term quantum simulators, including termination-dependent edge modes and the Friedel response to a local perturbation.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase transition of infrared radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a phase transition of infrared radiation, driven by quantum fluctuations, which takes place at the boundary of (the conformal diagram of) Minkowski spacetime. Specifically, we consider a family of states interpolating between the vacuum and the Kraus-Polley-Reents infravacuum. A state from this family can be imagined as a static source emitting flashes of infrared radiation in distant past. The flashes are in suitable squeezed states and the time intervals between them are controlled by a certain parameter r. For r&lt;0 the states are lightcone normal, thus physically indistinguishable from local excitations of the vacuum. They suffer from the usual infrared problems such as disintegration of the Bloch-Nordsieck S-matrix and rotational symmetry breaking by soft photon clouds. However, for r&gt;0 lightcone normality breaks down, the S-matrix is stabilized by the Kraus-Polley-Reents mechanism and the rotational symmetry is restored. We interpret these two situations as ordered (r&lt;0) and disordered (r&gt;0) phase of infrared radiation, and show that they can be distinguished by asymptotic fluctuations of the fields. We also determine the singular behaviour of some S-matrix elements near the critical point r=0.</description>

      <title>Measuring a localization phase diagram controlled by the interplay of disorder and driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay of localizing and delocalizing mechanisms such as disorder, interactions, and driving is a central topic of modern condensed matter physics. In this work we experimentally explore the interplay between quasiperiodic disorder and periodic driving, each of which in isolation is capable of driving a metal-insulator phase transition. Using a 1D quasiperiodic cold-atom chain we measure transport across the full phase diagram varying both drive strength and quasi-disorder strength. We observe lobes of metallic phases bounded by quantum phase transitions which depend on both drive and disorder. While these observations are broadly consistent with expectations from a high-drive-frequency theoretical model, we also observe clear departures from the predictions of this model, including anomalous changes in localization behavior at lower drive frequency. We demonstrate experimentally and theoretically that understanding the full measured phase diagram requires an extension to commonly-used approximate theories of Floquet matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report numerically exact quantum scattering calculations on magnetic Feshbach resonances in ultracold, strongly anisotropic atom-molecule [Rb($^2$S) + SrF($^2\Sigma^+$)] collisions based on state-of-the-art ab initio potential energy surfaces. We find broad resonances mediated by the intermolecular spin-exchange interaction, as well as narrow resonances due to the intramolecular spin-rotation interaction, which are unique to atom-molecule collisions. Remarkably, the density of resonances in atom-molecule collisions is not much higher than that in atomic collisions despite the presence of a dense manifold of molecular rotational states, which can be rationalized by analyzing the adiabatic states of the collision complex.</description>

      <title>Double, triple, and quadruple magic wavelengths for cesium ground, excited, and Rydberg states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic polarizabilities of cesium Rydberg states, explicitly $nS_{1/2}$, $nP_{1/2}$, $nP_{3/2}$, $nD_{3/2}$, and $nD_{5/2}$, where the principal quantum number $n$ is $40$ to $70$, are presented for linearly polarized light. The dynamic polarizability is calculated using the sum-over-states approach. We identify double magic wavelengths in the range of $1,000-2,000$~nm for simultaneous trapping of the ground state and a Rydberg state, which are, respectively, red-detuned and blue-detuned with respect to a low-lying excited auxiliary state. Based on calculations of the radiative lifetime, blackbody radiation induced transitions, and population transfer out of the Rydberg and auxiliary states (estimated within two-state as well as master equation models), we conclude that magic wavelength trapping is particularly promising experimentally for the $nD_{J,|M_J|}$ Rydberg series with angular momentum $J=3/2$ and projection quantum numbers $M_J=\pm 1/2$ (auxiliary state $8P_{1/2}$) and $M_J=\pm 3/2$ (auxiliary state $8P_{3/2}$), using trap depths as large as $10$~$\mu$K. Moreover, by tuning the angle between the quantization axis and the polarization vector of the light, we identify triple and quadruple magic wavelengths, for which the polarizabilities of the ground state, a Rydberg state, and, respectively, one and two low-lying excited states are equal. Our comprehensive theoretical study provides much needed guidance for on-going experimental efforts on cesium Rydberg-state based quantum simulations that operate on time scales up to several $\mu$s.</description>

      <title>Tessellated phase diagram and extended criticality in driven quasicrystals and quantum Hall matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The well-known mapping between 1D quasiperiodic systems and 2D integer quantum Hall matter can also be applied in the presence of driving. Here we explore the effect of time-varying electric fields on the transport properties and phase diagram of Harper-Hofstadter materials. We consider light of arbitrary polarization illuminating a 2D electron gas at high magnetic field; this system maps to a 1D quasicrystal subjected to simultaneous phasonic and dipolar driving. We show that this generalized driving generates a tessellated phase diagram featuring a nested duality-protected pattern of metal-insulator transitions. Circularly or elliptically polarized light can create an extended critical phase, opening up a new route to achieving wavefunction multifractality without fine-tuning to a critical point, as well as induce Floquet topological insulators. We describe in detail a path to experimental realization of these phenomena using lattice-trapped ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Isotopologue-selective laser cooling of molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct laser cooling of molecules has made significant progress in recent years. However, the selective cooling and manipulation of molecules based on their isotopic composition, which is ubiquitous in atomic laser cooling, has not yet been achieved. Here, we demonstrate such isotopologue-selective laser cooling of molecules, using barium monofluoride (BaF) as an example. The manipulation of the rare and previously uncooled 136BaF is achieved within a molecular beam containing several isotopologues of significantly higher natural abundance. Our results enable intense molecular beams and high fidelity detection of select low-abundance isotopologues or isotopic mixtures. Such beams are a first step towards isotopologue-selective molecular trapping and will be useful for applications in trace gas analysis, cold chemistry and precision tests of fundamental symmetries.</description>

      <title>Quantum Liquid in Lower Dimensions: From the perspective of Surface Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the surface tension in ultra-cold atomic gases in a quasi one-dimensional and one-dimensional geometry. In recent years, experimental observations have confirmed the ``clustering of atoms" to form droplets in ultra-cold atomic gases and the emergence of this new phase is attributed to the beyond mean-field interaction. However, two decades earlier, liquid formation was predicted due to the competition of two-body and three-body interactions. Here, we review both propositions and comment on the role of beyond mean-field and three-body interaction in liquid formation by calculating the surface tension.</description>

      <title>Bell sampling from quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00083v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central challenge in the verification of quantum computers is benchmarking their performance as a whole and demonstrating their computational capabilities. In this work, we find a universal model of quantum computation, Bell sampling, that can be used for both of those tasks and thus provides an ideal stepping stone towards fault-tolerance. In Bell sampling, we measure two copies of a state prepared by a quantum circuit in the transversal Bell basis. We show that the Bell samples are classically intractable to produce and at the same time constitute what we call a circuit shadow: from the Bell samples we can efficiently extract information about the quantum circuit preparing the state, as well as diagnose circuit errors. In addition to known properties that can be efficiently extracted from Bell samples, we give several new and efficient protocols: an estimator of state fidelity, a test for the depth of the circuit and an algorithm to estimate a lower bound to the number of T gates in the circuit. With some additional measurements, our algorithm learns a full description of states prepared by circuits with low T-count.</description>

      <title>Quantum Force Sensing by Digital Twinning of Atomic Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High sensitivity detection plays a vital role in science discoveries and technological applications. While intriguing methods utilizing collective many-body correlations and quantum entanglements have been developed in physics to enhance sensitivity, their practical implementation remains challenging due to rigorous technological requirements. Here, we propose an entirely data-driven approach that harnesses the capabilities of machine learning, to significantly augment weak-signal detection sensitivity. In an atomic force sensor, our method combines a digital replica of force-free data with anomaly detection technique, devoid of any prior knowledge about the physical system or assumptions regarding the sensing process. Our findings demonstrate a significant advancement in sensitivity, achieving an order of magnitude improvement over conventional protocols in detecting a weak force of approximately $10^{-25}~\mathrm{N}$. The resulting sensitivity reaches $1.7(4) \times 10^{-25}~\mathrm{N}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$. Our machine learning-based signal processing approach does not rely on system-specific details or processed signals, rendering it highly applicable to sensing technologies across various domains.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Floquet non-Abelian topological insulator and multifold bulk-edge correspondence"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We comment on the recent paper ``Floquet non-Abelian topological insulator and multifold bulk-edge correspondence" by Tianyu Li and Haiping Hu, Nat. Comm. {\bf 14}, 6418 (2023). Apart from the fact that the authors unjustly imply to study multi-gap topology in Floquet systems for the first time, only known homotopic relations are presented. While such insights are used to present interesting Floquet phenomena and phases, which is an attractive result in itself, they cannot be used to deduce the total bulk characterization in the dynamical context without further proof. In fact, the authors essentially rephrase a Zak phase description. These results should in particular be contrasted to earlier results, arXiv:2208.12824, in which static-compatible Zak phases {\it and} dynamical Dirac strings were shown to be able to {\it distinguish} rather similar non-Abelian Floquet phases in $2+1$ dimensional systems. As a result, the claim of a sharp multifold bulk-edge correspondence cannot be concluded from the given arguments.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of the interacting Haldane model with spin-dependent sublattice potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17813v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the exact-diagonalization (ED) and mean-field (MF) approaches, we investigate the ground-state phase diagram of the interacting Haldane model on the honeycomb lattice, incorporating spin-dependent sublattice potentials $\Delta_{\sigma,\alpha}$. Here $\alpha=\text{A}$,$\text{B}$ and $\sigma=\uparrow$,$\downarrow$ denote the sublattice and spin components, respectively. Setting $\Delta_{\sigma,\text{A}}=+\Delta$ ($-\Delta$) and $\Delta_{\sigma,\text{B}}$$=-\Delta$ ($+\Delta$) for $\sigma=\uparrow$ ($\downarrow$) results in the system favoring a spin ordered state. Conversely, introducing the nearest-neighbor Coulomb interaction can induce charge ordering in the system. Due to the competition between these factors, we observe that in both ED and MF approaches, an exotic state with Chern number $C=1$ survives amidst two locally ordered phases and a topologically ordered phase with $C=2$. In the ED method, various properties, such as the fidelity metric, the excitation gap and the structure factors, are employed to identify critical points. In the MF method, using a sufficiently large lattice size, we define the local order parameters and band gaps to characterize the phase transitions. The interacting Haldane model and the spin-dependent lattice potential may be experimentally realized in an ultracold atom gas, providing a potential means to detect this intriguing state.</description>
