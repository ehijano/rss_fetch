      <title>A Real-Options-Aware Multi-Criteria Framework for Ex-Ante Real Estate Redevelopment Use Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A growing share of the existing real estate stock exhibits persistent underperformance that can no longer be explained by cyclical market phases or inadequate maintenance alone. In many cases, technically recoverable assets located in non-marginal contexts fail to generate economic value consistent with the capital immobilized. This condition reflects a structural misalignment between intended use and effective demand rather than episodic market weakness, and calls for a decision framework capable of integrating value, risk, complexity, and irreversibility in strategic use selection. This study proposes a decision-analytic framework for the ex-ante selection of intended use in real estate redevelopment processes. The framework integrates real-options logic on irreversibility and managerial flexibility with a multi-criteria decision-analysis structure, enabling comparative evaluation of expected economic value, market and operational risk, technical and managerial complexity, and time-to-income. By treating redevelopment primarily as a problem of strategic option selection rather than design or financial optimization, the framework operationalizes option value preservation through disciplined ex-ante screening. Illustrative cases demonstrate how this integration of real options reasoning and MCDA reduces over-complexification and misalignment across different asset types and urban contexts.</description>

      <title>The Widening Profitability Gap between Renewable and Fossil Power Firms in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobilising private capital is a critical bottleneck of the energy transition, yet recent crisis-driven windfall profits for fossil power firms suggest that market signals may still favour carbon-intensive assets. Here we analyse a panel of 900 European power firms (2001-2023) to resolve whether these profits reflect a durable profitability advantage or a crisis-driven anomaly. Using machine-learning clustering and Bayesian model averaging, we identify a structural divergence: wind and solar portfolios exhibit rising profitability, with return on assets among wind-dominated firms increasing by over 6% between 2014 and 2023. Conversely, higher fossil portfolio shares are increasingly associated with lower profitability, with marginal effects reaching -4% by 2023, while renewable-dominated firms match or outperform their fossil-heavy counterparts across most European regions. These findings suggest that the record profits of fossil incumbents were distinct outliers, masking an ongoing decline in the profitability of carbon-intensive business models.</description>

Abstract: Political polarization can be beneficial to competing political parties. I study how electoral competition itself generates incentives to polarize voters, even when parties are ex ante identical and motivated purely by political power, interpreted as office rents or influence. I develop a probabilistic voting model with aggregate popularity shocks in which parties have decreasing marginal utility from political power. Equilibrium policy convergence fails. Platform differentiation provides insurance against electoral volatility by securing loyal voter bases and stabilizing political power. In a unidimensional policy space, parties' equilibrium payoffs rise as voters on opposite sides of the median become more extreme, including when polarization is driven by changes in the opponent's supporters. In a multidimensional setting, parties benefit from ideological coherence, the alignment of disagreements across issues. The results have implications for polarizing political communication, party identity, and electoral institutions.</description>

      <title>Identity and Cooperation in Multicultural Societies: An Experimental Investigation</title>

Abstract: Immigration has shaped many nations, posing the challenge of integrating immigrants into society. While economists often focus on immigrants' economic outcomes compared to natives (such as education, labor market success, and health) social interactions between immigrants and natives are equally crucial. These interactions, from everyday exchanges to teamwork, often lack enforceable contracts and require cooperation to avoid conflicts and achieve efficient outcomes. However, socioeconomic, ethnic, and cultural differences can hinder cooperation. Thus, evaluating integration should also consider its impact on fostering cooperation across diverse groups. This paper studies how priming different identity dimensions affects cooperation between immigrant and native youth. Immigrant identity includes both ethnic ties to their country of origin and connections to the host country. We test whether cooperation improves by making salient a specific identity: Common identity (shared society), Multicultural identity (ethnic group within society), or Neutral identity. In a lab in the field experiment with over 390 adolescents, participants were randomly assigned to one of these priming conditions and played a Public Good Game. Results show that immigrants are 13 percent more cooperative than natives at baseline. Natives increase cooperation by about 3 percentage points when their multicultural identity is primed, closing the initial gap with immigrant peers.</description>

      <title>DeepGreen: Effective LLM-Driven Greenwashing Monitoring System Designed for Empirical Testing -- Evidence from China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the emerging adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in economics and management research, this paper investigates whether LLMs can reliably identify corporate greenwashing narratives and, more importantly, whether and how the greenwashing signals extracted from textual disclosures can be used to empirically identify causal effects. To this end, this paper proposes DeepGreen, a dual-stage LLM-Driven system for detecting potential corporate greenwashing in annual reports. Applied to 9369 A-share annual reports published between 2021 and 2023, DeepGreen attains high reliability in random-sample validation at both stages. Ablation experiment shows that Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) reduces hallucinations, as compared to simply lengthening the input window. Empirical tests indicate that "greenwashing" captured by DeepGreen can effectively reveal a positive relationship between greenwashing and environmental penalties, and IV, PSM, Placebo test, which enhance the robustness and causal effects of the empirical evidence. Further study suggests that the presence and number of green investors can weaken the positive correlation between greenwashing and penalties. Heterogeneity analysis shows that the positive relationship between "greenwashing - penalty" is less significant in large-sized corporations and corporations that have accumulated green assets, indicating that these green assets may be exploited as a credibility shield for greenwashing. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can standardize ESG oversight by early warning and direct regulators' scarce attention toward the subsets of corporations where monitoring is more warranted.</description>

      <title>Who Connects Global Aid? The Hidden Geometry of 10 Million Transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The global aid system functions as a complex and evolving ecosystem; yet widespread understanding of its structure remains largely limited to aggregate volume flows. Here we map the network topology of global aid using a dataset of unprecedented scale: over 10 million transaction records connecting 2,456 publishing organisations across 230 countries between 1967 and 2025. We apply bipartite projection and dimensionality reduction to reveal the geometry of the system and unveil hidden patterns. This exposes distinct functional clusters that are otherwise sparsely connected. We find that while governments and multilateral agencies provide the primary resources, a small set of knowledge brokers provide the critical connectivity. Universities and research foundations specifically act as essential bridges between disparate islands of implementers and funders. We identify a core solar system of 25 central actors who drive this connectivity including unanticipated brokers like J-PAL and the Hewlett Foundation. These findings demonstrate that influence in the aid ecosystem flows through structural connectivity as much as financial volume. Our results provide a new framework for donors to identify strategic partners that accelerate coordination and evidence diffusion across the global network.</description>
