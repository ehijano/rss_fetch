      <title>Real-time graph neural networks on FPGAs for the Belle II electromagnetic calorimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the development and evaluation of a real-time Graph Neural Network-based trigger for the electromagnetic calorimeter of the Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB collider. The algorithm processes calorimeter trigger cells as graph nodes to perform clustering, feature extraction, and per-cluster signal classification with deterministic latency compatible with the first-level trigger readout system. The model predicts cluster positions and energies and provides a signal classification score, enabling a more flexible clustering strategy than the baseline trigger algorithm. Implemented on an FPGA and integrated into the Belle II trigger chain for synchronous operation, the system sustains the 8 MHz trigger throughput with an end-to-end latency of 3.168 $\mu$s. The performance is evaluated using simulated events and collision data. The energy resolution is comparable to the baseline trigger, while the position resolution for high-energy clusters improves by up to 18 percent in the central detector region. Cluster purity increases by up to 20 percent at low energies for isolated clusters, and cluster efficiency improves by up to 20 percent for overlapping clusters. The signal classifier enables additional background suppression at fixed signal retention. These results demonstrate the first operation of a Graph Neural Network-based reconstruction system implemented on FPGAs within the real-time trigger readout path of a collider experiment.</description>

      <title>Systematic study of high performance GeSn photodiodes with thick absorber for SWIR and extended SWIR detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Germanium-tin (GeSn) photodiodes potentiate a viable solution to integrate SWIR and extended SWIR detection technology into CMOS processing line. However, challenges in the growth of thick, high quality GeSn limit the device absorber thickness, making it impossible to ascertain the performance limit of GeSn photodiodes. An in-depth understanding of their device physics and a clear optimization pathway towards commercial-grade devices remain elusive. This work presents a systematic empirical study of GeSn photodiodes with thick absorber (2 to 8% Sn content, up to 2630 nm thick), showing high responsivity up to 0.59 A.W-1 at 1.55 {\mu}m and 0.43 A.W-1 at 2 {\mu}m wavelengths, low dark current density down to 2 x 10-2 A.cm-2, and high detection cutoff wavelengths up to 2.1 and 2.5 {\mu}m at 5% and 8% Sn, respectively. Using specific doping design (P-i-N and N-i-P), an in-depth analysis is presented on the impact of junction position, p-type background carrier concentration, bulk/ surface defects and photocarrier diffusion length - on photodetection performance. Different optimization strategies for GeSn photodiodes, in particular at high Sn content, are proposed.</description>

      <title>Compton imaging of undepleted volumes of germanium detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shape of the undepleted volume of a p-type high-purity Broad Energy Germanium detector, dependent on the bias voltage, has been imaged by measuring spatially-resolved Compton-scattering efficiency. The bias voltage was raised stepwise from $-50\,\text{V}$ to the full-depletion voltage. The geometric acceptance was determined at full depletion. Below full depletion, the relative acceptance observed for $2\times2\times2\,\text{mm}^3$ voxels was used to create the image of the undepleted volume for each bias voltage. The images were used to extract the impurity density profile of the detector by fitting predictions of the open-source software package SolidStateDetectors$.$jl to the images. The result is shown and compared to the impurity density profile deduced from capacitance measurements. This is the first time that three-dimensional images of the undepleted volumes of a germanium detector have become available and have been used to deduce an impurity density profile.</description>

      <title>Impact of front-end parameters of the ARCADIA MD3 on charged particle detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ARCADIA INFN R&amp;D project developed a Fully Depleted Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (FD-MAPS) using a customized LFoundry 110 nm CIS process. The first in-beam characterization of the ARCADIA Main Demonstrator 3 (MD3) sensor with 200 $\mu$m active thickness has been performed at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility with a 120 GeV proton beam. The Device Under Test (DUT) is tested with a trigger-less telescope composed of two ARCADIA MD3 tracking planes. This early study investigates the effect of the front-end parameters on the tracking performance.</description>

      <title>GW-FALCON: A Novel Feature-Driven Deep Learning Approach for Early Warning Alerts of BNS and NSBH Inspirals in Next-Generation GW Observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation GW observatories such as the ET and CE will detect BNS and NSBH inspirals with high SNRs and long in-band durations, making systematic early-warning alerts both feasible and scientifically valuable. Such triggers are essential for coordinating rapid electromagnetic follow-up. In this work, we introduce GW-FALCON, a novel feature-driven DL framework for early-time detection between GW signal+noise and noise-only data in next-generation detectors. Instead of feeding raw time series to CNN or more complex neural network architectures, we first extract a large set of statistical, temporal, and spectral quantities from short observational time windows using the TSFEL library. The resulting fixed-length feature vectors are then used as input to feed-forward ANNs suitable for low-latency operation. We demonstrate the method using simulated BNS and NSBH inspiral waveforms injected into colored Gaussian noise generated from the ET and CE design PSDs. We train separate ANNs on feature sets extracted from partial-inspiral windows characterized by different maximum instantaneous frequencies, enabling early-warning triggers from tens to hundreds of seconds before merger. Across all detector configurations and datasets, the resulting classifiers achieve high accuracy and detection efficiency, with ET-like networks typically reaching test accuracies of order 90% and CE-like ones exceeding 97% at low false-alarm probability. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first comprehensive feature-based DL detection framework for Next-generation GW observatories, connecting feature extraction from strain time series data to robust signal-noise classification within a setup that can be extended to real data and to more advanced neural network architectures.</description>

      <title>GPS constellation search for exotic physics messengers coincident with the binary neutron star merger GW170817</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Global Positioning System (GPS) includes a continuously operating, planet-scale network of atomic clocks that, beyond navigation and time dissemination, enables precision tests of fundamental physics. Here we use GPS carrier phase archival data to perform a retrospective search for exotic low-mass fields (ELFs) that might be emitted by the binary neutron-star merger GW170817, complementing gravitational wave and electromagnetic modalitiesnin multi-messenger astronomy. Such ultra-relativistic fields would imprint a dispersive, anti-chirp signature in clock-frequency time series, delayed with respect to the LIGO-Virgo gravitational wave detection. We construct network-median pseudo-frequency data from eighteen Rb satellite clocks referenced to a terrestrial hydrogen maser and conduct a template-bank search spanning ELF pulse duration, arrival delay, and characteristic frequency. No statistically significant signal is observed after accounting for noise statistics and template-bank trials. We derive 95\% confidence-level lower bounds on the interaction energy scale $\Lambda_\alpha$ of quadratic couplings driving variations in electromagnetic fine-structure constant. These limits improve upon existing astrophysical and gravity-test constraints across the ELF-energy range $\approx10^{-18}$--$10^{-14}\,\mathrm{eV}$. This demonstrates that mature global satellite-clock networks provide an observational capability for retrospective, multi-messenger searches for new physics using decades of archival timing data.</description>

      <title>The First Instrumentally Documented Fall of an Iron Meteorite: atmospheric trajectory and ground impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Iron meteorite falls are rare compared to stony meteorites, and until recently no iron meteorite had a reliably determined pre-atmospheric orbit. This changed on 2020 November 7, when a bright fireball was observed across Sweden and neighboring regions, with optical, acoustic, and seismic detections extending up to 665 km from the trajectory. After a month-long recovery effort, a 13.8 kg iron meteorite was discovered near {\AA}dalen, representing the first instrumentally recorded and recovered fall of its type and the first iron meteorite with a derivable heliocentric orbit; the event also exhibited the lowest terminal height measured for a well-documented fireball. We combine optical, infrasound, and seismic data to reconstruct the luminous trajectory and employ a Monte Carlo model to simulate the dark flight phase and predicted strewn field, while also investigating the plausibility of a ricochet prior to final deposition. Our analysis identifies distinct aerodynamic properties of iron meteoroids compared to stony bodies, including the influence of streamlined shapes and deep regmaglypts on drag and flight stability, underscoring the need to incorporate iron-specific parameters into entry models to constrain atmospheric dynamics and improve recovery predictions for future events.</description>

      <title>The COHERENT Experiment: 2026 Update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COHERENT experiment measures neutrino-induced recoils from coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) with multiple nuclear targets at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), USA. Several successful CEvNS measurements have been achieved in recent years with tens-of-kg detector masses, with a CsI scintillating crystal, a liquid argon single-phase detector, and high-purity germanium spectrometers. For the next phase, COHERENT aims at high-statistics detection of CEvNS events for precision tests of the standard model of particle physics, and to probe new physics beyond-the-standard model. Percent-level precision can be achieved by lowering thresholds, reducing backgrounds, and by scaling up the detector masses. It goes hand in hand with benchmarking the neutrino flux from the SNS. Further detectors will measure CEvNS in additional nuclei, including lighter target nuclei such as sodium and neon, to continue to test the expected neutron-number-squared dependence of the cross section. COHERENT can furthermore study charged-current and neutral-current inelastic neutrino-nucleus cross sections on various nuclei at neutrino energies below $\sim$50 MeV. Many of these cross sections have never been measured before, but are critical input for the interpretation of core-collapse supernova detection in large-scale neutrino experiments such as DUNE, Super-K, Hyper-K, and HALO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a multi-beam scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging that integrates down-sampling with super-resolution image reconstruction via a compressive sensing framework. A custom condenser aperture with six randomly positioned circular holes is employed to produce a multi-beam STEM probe, with the beam shape and distribution tuned through defocus. While the raw multi-beam images exhibit overlapping patterns, reconstruction using Adam optimization and total variation normalization yields high-fidelity images that closely reproduce the original sample structures, even from substantially down-sampled data. The proposed approach offers a pathway toward significant acceleration of such techniques through multibeam sparse sampling and computational reconstruction potentially useful for the analytical scanning methods in general.</description>

      <title>A journey to ITACA: Ion Tracking with Ammonium Cations Apparatus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A unique feature of gas xenon electroluminescent time projection chambers (GXeEL TPCs) in $0\nu\beta\beta$ searches is their ability to reconstruct event topology, in particular to distinguish "single-electron" from "double-electron" tracks, the latter being the signature of a $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay near the decay endpoint $Q_{\beta\beta}$. Together with excellent energy resolution and the t$_0$ provided by primary scintillation, this topological information is key to suppressing backgrounds. Preserving EL, however, requires operation in pure xenon (with helium as the only benign additive), where electron diffusion is large. Consequently, reconstructed track fidelity is limited by diffusion and intrinsic EL blurring. We propose augmenting the detector with the ability to image not only the electron track but also the corresponding mirror ion track. Introducing trace amounts of NH$_3$ ($\sim$100 ppb) converts primary xenon ions into ammonium ions, NH$_4^+$, via a fast two-step ion-molecule process involving charge transfer followed by proton transfer, while leaving EL unaffected. Electrons drift rapidly to the anode, producing the standard EL image, whereas NH$_4^+$ ions drift slowly toward the cathode, allowing time to determine the event energy and barycenter. For events in the region of interest, an ion sensor near the cathode at the projected barycenter captures the ions. Laser interrogation of the sensor's molecular layer then reveals an ion-track image with sub-millimeter diffusion and no EL-induced smearing. Combined electron-ion imaging strengthens topological discrimination, improving background rejection by about an order of magnitude and significantly extending the discovery potential of GXeEL TPCs for very long $0\nu\beta\beta$ lifetimes.</description>

      <title>Proton Computed Tomography Image Reconstruction Based on the Richardson-Lucy Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.00126v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proton therapy is an emerging method in cancer therapy. One of the main developments is to increase the accuracy of the Bragg-peak position calculation, which requires more precise relative stopping power (RSP) measurements. A promising choice is the application of proton computed tomography (pCT) systems which takes the images under similar conditions, as they use the same irradiation device and hadron beam for imaging and treatment. A key aim is to develop a precise image reconstruction algorithm for pCT systems to reach their maximal performance.
  In this work, an iterative image reconstruction algorithm, based on the Richardson-Lucy iteration is proposed for the first time for proton CT image reconstruction. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of CTP528 and CTP404 phantoms were used to benchmark the proposed method. In the case of an idealized detector setup, using a 1 mm pitch grid, 4.88 lp/cm spatial resolution and 0.66% average RSP uncertainty was achieved. The present method provides a promising proof-of-concept candidate for compromise between accuracy and speed with several further development directions.</description>

      <title>First search for light fermionic dark matter absorption on electrons using germanium detector in CDEX-10 experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first results of the search for sub-MeV fermionic dark matter absorbed by electron targets of germanium using the 205.4~kg$\cdot$day data collected by the CDEX-10 experiment, with the analysis threshold of 160~eVee. No significant dark matter (DM) signals over the background are observed. Results are presented as limits on the cross section of DM--electron interaction. We present new constraints of cross section in the DM range of 0.1--10 keV/$c^2$ for vector and axial-vector interaction. The upper limit on the cross section is set to be $\rm 6.8\times10^{-46}~cm^2$ for vector interaction, and $\rm 2.3\times10^{-46}~cm^2$ for axial-vector interaction at DM mass of 5 keV/$c^2$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Metrology of Newton's Constant with Levitated Mechanical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Newton's constant is the least well-measured among the fundamental constants of Nature, and, indeed, its accurate measurement has long served an experimental challenge. Levitated mechanical systems are attracting growing attention for their promising applications in sensing and as an experimental platform for exploring the intersection between quantum physics and gravitation. Here we propose a mechanical interferometric scheme of interacting levitated oscillators for the accurate estimation of Newton's constant. Our scheme promises to beat the current standard by several orders of magnitude.</description>
