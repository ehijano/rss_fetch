      <title>A Pathway to Efficient Simulations of Charge Density Waves in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides: A Case Study for TiSe2</title>

Abstract: Charge density waves (CDWs) in transition metal dichalcogenides are the subject of growing scientific interest due to their rich interplay with exotic phases of matter and their potential technological applications. Here, using density functional theory with advanced meta-generalized gradient approximations (meta-GGAs) and linear response time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) with state-of-the-art exchange-correlation kernels, we investigate the electronic, vibrational, and optical properties in 1T-TiSe2 with and without CDW. In both bulk and monolayer TiSe2, the electronic bands and phonon dispersions in either normal (semi-metallic) or CDW (semiconducting) phase are described well via meta-GGAs, which separate the valence and conduction bands just as HSE06 does but with significantly more computational feasibility. Instead of the underestimated gap with standard exchange-correlation approximations and the overestimated gap with screened hybrid functional HSE06, the band gap of the monolayer TiSe2 CDW phase calculated by the meta-GGA MVS (151 meV) is consistent with the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) gap of 153 meV measured at 10 K. In addition, the gap of bulk TiSe2 CDW phase reaches 67 meV within the TASK approximation, close to the ARPES gap of 82 meV. Regarding excitations of many-body nature, for bulk TiSe2 in normal and CDW phases, the experimentally observed humps of electron energy loss spectroscopy and plasmon peak are successfully reproduced in TDDFT, without an obvious kernel dependence. To unleash the full scientific and technological potential of CDWs in transition metal dichalcogenides, the chemical doping, heterostructure engineering, and pump-probe techniques are needed. Our study opens the door to simulating these complexities in CDW compounds from first principles by revealing meta-GGAs as an accurate low-cost alternative to HSE06.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Secondary and Backscattered Electron Energy Spectra and Yields Analysis: from Theory to Applications</title>

Abstract: Over the past decade, experimental microscopy and spectroscopy have made significant progress in the study of the morphological, optical, electronic and transport properties of materials. These developments include higher spatial resolution, shorter acquisition times, more efficient monochromators and electron analysers, improved contrast imaging and advancements in sample preparation techniques. These advances have driven the need for more accurate theoretical descriptions and predictions of material properties. Computer simulations based on first principles and Monte Carlo methods have emerged as a rapidly growing field for modeling the interaction of charged particles, such as electron, proton and ion beams, with various systems, such as slabs, nanostructures and crystals. This report delves into the theoretical and computational approaches to modeling the physico-chemical mechanisms that occur when charged beams interact with a medium. These mechanisms encompass single and collective electronic excitation, ionization of the target atoms and the generation of a secondary electron cascade that deposits energy into the irradiated material. We show that the combined application of ab initio methods, which are able to model the dynamics of interacting many-fermion systems, and Monte Carlo methods, which capture statistical fluctuations in energy loss mechanisms by random sampling, proves to be an optimal strategy for the accurate description of charge transport in solids. This joint quantitative approach enables the theoretical interpretation of excitation, loss and secondary electron spectra, the analysis of the chemical composition and dielectric properties of solids and contributes to our understanding of irradiation-induced damage in materials, including those of biological significance.</description>
