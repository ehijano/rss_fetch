      <title>A Unified Symmetry Classification of Many-Body Localized Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anderson localization admits a complete symmetry classification given by the Altland-Zirnbauer (AZ) tenfold scheme, whereas an analogous framework for interacting many-body localization (MBL) has remained elusive. Here we develop a symmetry-based classification of static MBL phases formulated at the level of local integrals of motion (LIOMs). We show that a symmetry is compatible with stable MBL if and only if its action can be consistently represented within a quasi-local LIOM algebra, without enforcing extensive degeneracies or nonlocal operator mixing. This criterion sharply distinguishes symmetry classes: onsite Abelian symmetries are compatible with stable MBL and can host distinct symmetry-protected topological MBL phases, whereas continuous non-Abelian symmetries generically preclude stable MBL. By systematically combining AZ symmetries with additional onsite symmetries, we construct a complete classification table of MBL phases, identify stable, fragile, and unstable classes, and provide representative lattice realizations. Our results establish a unified and physically transparent framework for understanding symmetry constraints on MBL.</description>

      <title>Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) with row-update Projected Entangled-Pair States (PEPS) and its applications in quantum spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving the quantum many-body ground state problem remains a central challenge in computational physics. In this context, the Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) framework based on Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) has witnessed rapid development, establishing itself as a vital approach for investigating strongly correlated two-dimensional systems. However, standard PEPS-VMC algorithms predominantly rely on sequential local updates. This conventional approach often suffers from slow convergence and critical slowing down, particularly in the vicinity of phase transitions or within frustrated landscapes. To address these limitations, we propose an efficient autoregressive row-wise sampling algorithm for PEPS that enables direct, rejection-free sampling via single-layer contractions. By utilizing autoregressive single-layer row updates to generate collective, non-local configuration proposals, our method significantly reduces temporal correlations compared to local Metropolis moves. We benchmark the algorithm on the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and the quantum spin glass. Our results demonstrate that the row-wise scheme effectively mitigates critical slowing down near the Ising critical point. Furthermore, in the rugged landscape of the quantum spin glass, it yields improved optimization stability and lower ground-state energies. These findings indicate that single-layer autoregressive row updates provide a flexible and robust improvement to local PEPS-VMC sampling and may serve as a basis for more advanced sampling schemes.</description>

      <title>Directionality and node heterogeneity reshape criticality in hypergraph percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directed and heterogeneous hypergraphs capture directional higher-order interactions with intrinsically asymmetric functional dependencies among nodes. As a result, damage to certain nodes can suppress entire hyperedges, whereas failure of others only weakens interactions. Metabolic reaction networks offer an intuitive example of such asymmetric dependencies. Here we develop a message-passing and statistical mechanics framework for percolation in directed hypergraphs that explicitly incorporates directionality and node heterogeneity. Remarkably, we show that these hypergraph features have a fundamental effect on the critical properties of hypergraph percolation, reshaping criticality in a way that depends on network structure. Specifically, we derive anomalous critical exponents that depend on whether node or hyperedge percolation is considered in maximally correlated, heavy-tailed regimes. These theoretical predictions are validated on synthetic hypergraph models and on a real directed metabolic network, opening new perspectives for the characterization of the robustness and resilience of real-world directed, heterogeneous higher-order networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.06609v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive pedagogical discussion of a family of models describing the propagation of a single particle in a multicomponent non-Markovian Gaussian random field. We report some exact results for single-particle Green's functions, self-energy, vertex part and T-matrix. These results are based on a closed form solution of the Dyson equation combined with the Ward identity. Analytical properties of the solution are discussed. Further we describe the combinatorics of the Feynman diagrams for the Green's function and the skeleton diagrams for the self-energy and vertex, using recurrence relations between the Taylor expansion coefficients of the self-energy. Asymptotically exact equations for the number of skeleton diagrams in the limit of large N are derived. Finally, we consider possible realizations of a multicomponent Gaussian random potential in quantum transport via complex quantum dot experiments.</description>

      <title>Connectivity determines the capability of sparse neural network quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) posits that within overparametrized neural networks, there exist sparse subnetworks that are capable of matching the performance of the original model when trained in isolation from the original initialization. We extend this hypothesis to the unsupervised task of approximating the ground state of quantum many-body Hamiltonians, a problem equivalent to finding a neural-network compression of the lowest-lying eigenvector of an exponentially large matrix. Focusing on two representative quantum Hamiltonians, the transverse field Ising model (TFIM) and the toric code (TC), we demonstrate that sparse neural networks can reach accuracies comparable to their dense counterparts, even when pruned by more than an order of magnitude in parameter count. Crucially, and unlike the original LTH, we find that performance depends only on the structure of the sparse subnetwork, not on the specific initialization, when trained in isolation. Moreover, we identify universal scaling behavior that persists across network sizes and physical models, where the boundaries of scaling regions are determined by the underlying Hamiltonian. At the onset of high-error scaling, we observe signatures of a sparsity-induced quantum phase transition that is first-order in shallow networks. Finally, we demonstrate that pruning enhances interpretability by linking the structure of sparse subnetworks to the underlying physics of the Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study of anomalous temperature dependence of resistivity in V-Al alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: V$_{1-x}$Al$_x$ is a representative example of highly resistive metallic alloys exhibiting a crossover to a negative temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR), known as the Mooij correlation. Despite numerous proposals to explain this anomalous behavior,none have provided a satisfactory quantitative explanation thus far. In this work, we calculate the electrical conductivity using an ab initio methodology that combines the Kubo-Greenwood formalism with the coherent potential approximation (CPA). The temperature dependence of the conductivity is obtained within a CPA-based model of thermal atomic vibrations. Using this approach, we observe the crossover to the negative TCR behavior in V$_{1-x}$Al$_x$, with the temperature coefficient following the Mooij correlation, which matches experimental observations in the intermediate-to-high temperature range. Analysis of the results allows us to clearly identify a non-Boltzmann contribution responsible for this behavior and describe it as a function of temperature and composition.</description>

      <title>AiiDA-TrainsPot: Towards automated training of neural-network interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crafting neural-network interatomic potentials (NNIPs) remains a complex task, demanding specialized expertise in both machine learning and electronic-structure calculations. Here, we introduce AiiDA-TrainsPot, an automated, open-source, and user-friendly workflow that streamlines the creation of accurate NNIPs by orchestrating density-functional-theory calculations, data augmentation strategies, and classical molecular dynamics. Our active-learning strategy leverages on-the-fly calibration of committee disagreement against ab initio reference errors to ensure reliable uncertainty estimates. We use electronic-structure descriptors and dimensionality reduction to analyze the efficiency of this calibrated criterion, and show that it minimizes both false positives and false negatives when deciding what to compute from first principles. AiiDA-TrainsPot has a modular design that supports multiple NNIP backends, enabling both the training of NNIPs from scratch and the fine-tuning of foundation models. We demonstrate its capabilities through automated training campaigns targeting pristine and defective carbon allotropes, including amorphous carbon, as well as structural phase transitions in monolayer $\mathrm{W_xMo_{1-x}Te_2}$ alloys.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear skin breathing modes in one-dimensional nonreciprocal mechanical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay of nonreciprocity and nonlinearity in a one-dimensional nonlinear Klein-Gordon chain of classical oscillators coupled by asymmetric springs, akin to a mechanical analogue of the Hatano-Nelson model with onsite nonlinearity. Using multiple-scale analysis, we show that families of nonlinear skin breathing modes -- time-periodic, boundary-localized oscillations -- emerge from their linear counterparts at any nonreciprocal strength. We derive an explicit nonlinear frequency shift for these families of nonlinear breathing modes, showing its dependence on amplitude, nonlinearity type, lattice size, and nonreciprocity, and we predict the emergence of genuine skin end breathers at the boundary once their oscillation frequency and higher harmonics enter the spectral gaps of the linear spectrum. Numerical pseudo-arclength continuation confirms full families of solutions for both hardening and softening nonlinearities. Furthermore, the Floquet analysis shows that these modes can be either linearly stable or unstable, with Floquet eigenvectors exhibiting skin localization inherited from the asymmetric couplings. Our results extend the nonlinear non-Hermitian skin effect from stationary modes to intrinsically time-periodic excitations, providing a pathway to engineer and control breathing modes in nonreciprocal mechanical metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Order Out of Noise and Disorder: Fate of the Frustrated Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Langevin dynamics of $N$ Brownian particles on two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, interacting through pairwise potentials linear in geodesic distance with quenched random couplings. These \emph{frustrated Brownian particles} experience competing demands of random attractive and repulsive interactions while confined to curved surfaces. We consider three geometries: the sphere $S^2$, torus $T^2$, and bounded cylinder. Our central finding is disorder-induced dimension reduction with spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking: order emerges from two sources of randomness (thermal noise and quenched disorder), with manifold topology determining the character of emerging structures. Glassy relaxation drives particles from 2D distributions to quasi-1D structures: bands on $S^2$, rings on $T^2$, and localized clusters on the cylinder. Unlike conventional symmetry breaking, the symmetry-breaking direction is not frozen but evolves slowly via thermal noise. On the sphere, the structure normal precesses diffusively on the Goldstone manifold with correlation time $\tau_c \approx 18$, a classical realization of type-A dissipative Nambu-Goldstone dynamics. The model requires no thermodynamic gradients, no fine-tuning, and no slow external input. We discuss connections to spin glass theory, quantum field theory, astrophysical structure formation, and self-organizing systems. The model admits a large-$N$ limit yielding statistical field theory on Riemannian surfaces, while remaining experimentally realizable in colloidal and soft matter systems.</description>
