      <title>A Robust Support Vector Machine Approach for Raman COVID-19 Data Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in healthcare technologies have led to the availability of large amounts of biological samples across several techniques and applications. In particular, in the last few years, Raman spectroscopy analysis of biological samples has been successfully applied for early-stage diagnosis. However, spectra' inherent complexity and variability make the manual analysis challenging, even for domain experts. For the same reason, the use of traditional Statistical and Machine Learning (ML) techniques could not guarantee for accurate and reliable results. ML models, combined with robust optimization techniques, offer the possibility to improve the classification accuracy and enhance the resilience of predictive models. In this paper, we investigate the performance of a novel robust formulation for Support Vector Machine (SVM) in classifying COVID-19 samples obtained from Raman Spectroscopy. Given the noisy and perturbed nature of biological samples, we protect the classification process against uncertainty through the application of robust optimization techniques. Specifically, we derive robust counterpart models of deterministic formulations using bounded-by-norm uncertainty sets around each observation. We explore the cases of both linear and kernel-induced classifiers to address binary and multiclass classification tasks. The effectiveness of our approach is validated on real-world COVID-19 datasets provided by Italian hospitals by comparing the results of our simulations with a state-of-the-art classifier.</description>

      <title>Input layer regularization and automated regularization hyperparameter tuning for myelin water estimation using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel deep learning method which combines classical regularization with data augmentation for estimating myelin water fraction (MWF) in the brain via biexponential analysis. Our aim is to design an accurate deep learning technique for analysis of signals arising in magnetic resonance relaxometry. In particular, we study the biexponential model, one of the signal models used for MWF estimation. We greatly extend our previous work on \emph{input layer regularization (ILR)} in several ways. We now incorporate optimal regularization parameter selection via a dedicated neural network or generalized cross validation (GCV) on a signal-by-signal, or pixel-by-pixel, basis to form the augmented input signal, and now incorporate estimation of MWF, rather than just exponential time constants, into the analysis. On synthetically generated data, our proposed deep learning architecture outperformed both classical methods and a conventional multi-layer perceptron. On in vivo brain data, our architecture again outperformed other comparison methods, with GCV proving to be somewhat superior to a NN for regularization parameter selection. Thus, ILR improves estimation of MWF within the biexponential model. In addition, classical methods such as GCV may be combined with deep learning to optimize MWF imaging in the human brain.</description>

      <title>Consensus statement on the credibility assessment of ML predictors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid integration of machine learning (ML) predictors into in silico medicine has revolutionized the estimation of quantities of interest (QIs) that are otherwise challenging to measure directly. However, the credibility of these predictors is critical, especially when they inform high-stakes healthcare decisions. This position paper presents a consensus statement developed by experts within the In Silico World Community of Practice. We outline twelve key statements forming the theoretical foundation for evaluating the credibility of ML predictors, emphasizing the necessity of causal knowledge, rigorous error quantification, and robustness to biases. By comparing ML predictors with biophysical models, we highlight unique challenges associated with implicit causal knowledge and propose strategies to ensure reliability and applicability. Our recommendations aim to guide researchers, developers, and regulators in the rigorous assessment and deployment of ML predictors in clinical and biomedical contexts.</description>

      <title>adabmDCA 2.0 -- a flexible but easy-to-use package for Direct Coupling Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this methods article, we provide a flexible but easy-to-use implementation of Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) based on Boltzmann machine learning, together with a tutorial on how to use it. The package \texttt{adabmDCA 2.0} is available in different programming languages (C++, Julia, Python) usable on different architectures (single-core and multi-core CPU, GPU) using a common front-end interface. In addition to several learning protocols for dense and sparse generative DCA models, it allows to directly address common downstream tasks like residue-residue contact prediction, mutational-effect prediction, scoring of sequence libraries and generation of artificial sequences for sequence design. It is readily applicable to protein and RNA sequence data.</description>

      <title>A distribution-guided Mapper algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12237v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivation: The Mapper algorithm is an essential tool to explore shape of data in topology data analysis. With a dataset as an input, the Mapper algorithm outputs a graph representing the topological features of the whole dataset. This graph is often regarded as an approximation of a reeb graph of data. The classic Mapper algorithm uses fixed interval lengths and overlapping ratios, which might fail to reveal subtle features of data, especially when the underlying structure is complex.
  Results: In this work, we introduce a distribution guided Mapper algorithm named D-Mapper, that utilizes the property of the probability model and data intrinsic characteristics to generate density guided covers and provides enhanced topological features. Our proposed algorithm is a probabilistic model-based approach, which could serve as an alternative to non-prababilistic ones. Moreover, we introduce a metric accounting for both the quality of overlap clustering and extended persistence homology to measure the performance of Mapper type algorithm. Our numerical experiments indicate that the D-Mapper outperforms the classical Mapper algorithm in various scenarios. We also apply the D-Mapper to a SARS-COV-2 coronavirus RNA sequences dataset to explore the topological structure of different virus variants. The results indicate that the D-Mapper algorithm can reveal both vertical and horizontal evolution processes of the viruses.
