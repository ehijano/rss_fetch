      <title>Phase Separation in Active Binary Mixtures With Chemical Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study motility-induced phase separation~(MIPS) in active AB binary mixtures undergoing the chemical reaction $A \rightleftharpoons B$. Starting from the evolution equations for the density fields $\rho_i(\vec r, t)$ describing MIPS, we phenomenologically incorporate the effects of the reaction through the reaction rate $\Gamma$ into the equations. The steady-state domain morphologies depend on $\Gamma$ and the relative activity of the species, $\Delta$. For a sufficiently large $\Gamma$ and $\Delta\ne 1$, the more active component of the mixture forms a droplet morphology. We characterize the morphology of domains by calculating the equal-time correlation function $C(r, t)$ and the structure factor $S(k, t)$, exhibiting scaling violation. The average domain size, $L(t)$, follows a diffusive growth as $L(t)\sim t^{1/3}$ before reaching the steady state domain size, $L_{\rm ss}$. Additionally, $L_{\rm ss}$ shows the scaling relation $L_{\rm ss}\sim\Gamma^{-1/4}$, independent of $\Delta$.</description>

      <title>Density-field structures in a few systems undergoing velocity ordering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two (off-lattice) varieties of out-of-equilibrium systems, viz., granular and active matter systems, that, in addition to displaying velocity ordering, exhibit fascinating pattern formation in the density field, similar to those during vapor-liquid phase transitions. In the granular system, velocity ordering occurs due to reduction in the normal components of velocities, arising from inelastic collisions. In the active matter case, on the other hand, velocity alignment occurs because of the inherent tendency of the active particles to follow each other. Inspite of this difference, the patterns, even during density-field evolutions, in these systems can be remarkably similar. This we have quantified via the calculations of the two-point equal time correlation functions and the structure factors. These results have been compared with the well studied case of kinetics of phase separation within the framework of the Ising model. Despite the order-parameter conservation constraint in all the cases, in the density field, the quantitative structural features in the Ising case is quite different from those for the granular and active matters. Interestingly, the correlation function for the latter varieties, particularly for an active matter model, quite accurately describes the structure in a real assembly of biologically active particles.</description>

      <title>Twist Grain Boundary phases in proper ferroelectric liquid crystals realm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The twist-grain-boundary (TGB) phases, characterized by a periodic, helical arrangement of blocks made of polar smectic phases, SmAF and SmCF, have been discovered. They have been observed for rod-like molecules with a strong longitudinal dipole moment, featuring an (S)-2-methylbutyl end group having only weak twisting power, and emerge below the antiferroelectric SmAAF phase, where the lamellar structure is already well established. It is suggested that the structure is governed by electrostatic interactions amplified by weak chiral forces, in striking contrast to the mechanism of TGB phase formation found in non-polar materials. The TGB phases exhibit light selective reflection in the visible range, while the value of electric polarization confirms an almost perfectly ordered dipole alignment.</description>

      <title>Dirac Representation for Lattice Spin Operators: Spin-$1/2$ and Spin-$1$ cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel quantum representation of lattice spin operators (LSOs) is achieved by mapping quantum spins onto their classical analogues for spin size $S=1/2$ and $S=1$. The "braket" representations of LSOs are attained thanks to a profound inspection into the binary/ternary distribution of classical bits/trits in non-negative integers. We claim the possility of getting the $j$th digit of a positive integer without performing any binary/ternary decomposition. Analytical formulas returning the $j$th bits/trits of an integer are presented. Impacts of our achievements in Physics are highlighted by revisiting the $1D$ spin-$1/2$ {XXZ} Heisenberg model with open boundaries in a magnetic field in both absence (uniform magnetic field) and presence of disorder (random magnetic field). In the absence of disorder (clean system), we demonstrate that the corresponding eigenvalues problem can be reduced to a tight-binding problem on a graph and solved without resorting to any spinless transformation nor the Bethe Anzath. In the presence of disorder, a convergent perturbation theory is elaborated. Our analytical results are compared with data from exact diagonalization for relatively large spin systems ($K\leq 18$ spins with $K$ denoting the total number of spins) obtained by implementing both the global $U(1)$ symmetry to block-diagonalize the Hamiltonian and the spin-inversion symmetry for two-fold block-diagonalization in the sector with total magnetization $\mathcal{J}^z=0$. We observe a good agreement between both results.</description>

      <title>Periodic Potential for Point Defects in a 2D Hexagonal Colloidal Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the statistical nature of point defects in a two-dimensional hexagonal colloidal crystal from the perspective of stochastic dynamics. Starting from the experimentally recorded trajectories of time series, the underlying drifting forces along with the diffusion matrix from thermal fluctuations are extracted. We then employ a deposition in which the deterministic terms are split into diffusive and transverse components under a stochastic potential with the lattice periodicity to uncover the dynamic landscape as well as the transverse matrix, two key structures from limited ranges of measurements. The analysis elucidates some fundamental dichotomy between mono-point and di-point defects of paired vacancies or interstitials. Having large transverse magnitude, the second class of defects are likely to break the detailed balance, Such a scenario was attributed to the root cause of lattice melting by experimental observations. The constructed potential can in turn facilitate large-scale simulation for the ongoing research.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation induced network patterns in active matter with spatially correlated noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluctuations play a central role in many fields of physics, from quantum electrodynamics to statistical mechanics. In active matter physics, most models focus on thermal fluctuations due to a surrounding solvent. An alternative but much less explored noise source can occur due to fluctuating external fields, which typically feature certain spatial correlations. In this work, we introduce a minimal model to explore the influence of spatially correlated but temporally uncorrelated noise on the collective behavior of active particles. We find that specifically in chiral active particles such fluctuations induce the formation of network patterns, which neither occur for spatially (uncorrelated) thermal noise, nor in the complete absence of fluctuations. These networks show (i) a percolated structure, (ii) local alignment of the contained particles, but no global alignment, and (iii) hardly coarsen. We perform a topological data analysis to systematically characterize the topology of the network patterns. Our work serves as a starting point to explore the role of spatially correlated fluctuations and presents a route towards noise-induced phenomena in active matter.</description>

      <title>Energy Cascades in Driven Granular Liquids : A new Universality Class? I : Model and Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article deals with the existence and scaling of an energy cascade in steady granular liquid flows between the scale at which the system is forced and the scale at which it dissipates energy. In particular, we examine the possible origins of a breaking of the Kolmogorov Universality class that applies to Newtonian liquids under similar conditions. In order to answer these questions, we build a generic field theory of granular liquid flows and, through a study of its symmetries, show that indeed the Kolmogorov scaling can be broken, although most of the symmetries of the Newtonian flows are preserved.</description>

      <title>Elastic wave propagation in magneto-active fibre composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fibre-reinforced elastomers are lightweight and strong materials that can sustain large deformations. When filled with magnetic particles, their effective mechanical response can be modified by an external magnetic field. In the present study, we propose an effective theory of fibre-reinforced composite, based on a neo-Hookean elastic response and a linear magnetic law in each phase. The theory is shown suitable to describe the motion of composite cylinders. Furthermore, it is found appropriate for the modelling of fibre-reinforced composites subjected to a permanent magnetic field aligned with the fibres. To reach this result, we use the incremental theory ('small on large'), in combination with homogenisation theory and the Bloch-Floquet method. This way, we show that wave directivity is sensitive to the application of a permanent magnetic field, whereas the frequency range in which wave propagation is forbidden is not modified by such a load (the band gaps are invariant). In passing, we describe a method to deduce the total stress in the material based on the measurement of two wave speeds. Furthermore, we propose an effective energy function for the description of nonlinear composites made of Yeoh-type generalised neo-Hookean fibres within a neo-Hookean matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the radial densification of spruce wood using explicit Finite Element Method simulations, focusing on the effects of various densification protocols. These protocols include quasi-static compression, oscillatory excitation, and self-densification through shrinking hydrogel fillings and their impact on the morphogenesis of folding patterns across different tissue types. The simulations incorporate the an isotropic mechanical behavior of wood tracheid walls and account for moisture and delignification effects using a hierarchical approach. Our results reveal the technological potential of targeted densification in creating tailored density profiles that enhance stiffness and strength. These insights offer valuable guidance for optimizing densification processes in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Velocity Distribution and Diffusion of an Athermal Inertial Run-and-Tumble Particle in a Shear-Thinning Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of an athermal inertial active particle moving in a shear-thinning medium in $d=1$. The viscosity of the medium is modeled using a Coulomb-tanh function, while the activity is represented by an asymmetric dichotomous noise with strengths $-\Delta$ and $\mu\Delta$, transitioning between these states at a rate $\lambda$. Starting from the Fokker-Planck~(FP) equation for the time-dependent probability distributions $P(v,-\Delta,t)$ and $P(v,\mu\Delta,t)$ of the particle's velocity $v$ at time $t$, moving under the influence of active forces $-\Delta$ and $\mu\Delta$ respectively, we analytically derive the steady-state velocity distribution function $P_s(v)$, explicitly dependent on $\mu$. Also, we obtain a quadrature expression for the effective diffusion coefficient $D_e$ for the symmetric active force case~($\mu=1$). For a given $\Delta$ and $\mu$, we show that $P_s(v)$ exhibits multiple transitions as $\lambda$ is varied. Subsequently, we numerically compute $P_s(v)$, the mean-squared velocity $\langle v^2\rangle(t)$, and the diffusion coefficient $D_e$ by solving the particle's equation of motion, all of which show excellent agreement with the analytical results in the steady-state. Finally, we examine the universal nature of the transitions in $P_s(v)$ by considering an alternative functional form of medium's viscosity that also capture the shear-thinning behavior.</description>

      <title>Infrared Imaging of Photochromic Contrast in Thiazolothiazole-Embedded Polymer Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for optical technologies with dynamic spectral control has driven interest in chromogenic materials, particularly for applications in tunable infrared metasurfaces. Phase-change materials such as vanadium dioxide and germanium-antimony-tellurium, for instance, have been widely used in the infrared regime. However, their reliance on thermal and electrical tuning introduces challenges such as high power consumption, limited emissivity tuning, and slow modulation speeds. Photochromic materials may offer an alternative approach to dynamic infrared metasurfaces, potentially overcoming these limitations through rapid, light-induced changes in optical properties. This manuscript explores the potential of thiazolothiazole-embedded polymers, known for their reversible photochromic transitions and strong infrared absorption changes, for tunable infrared metasurfaces. The material exhibits low absorption and a strong photochromic contrast in the spectral range from 1500 cm-1 to 1700 cm-1, making it suitable for dynamic infrared light control. This manuscript reports on infrared imaging experiments demonstrating photochromic contrast in thiazolothiazole-embedded polymer and thereby provides compelling evidence for their potential applications for dynamic infrared metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction and Dipole-Exchange Curvature Effects on the Spin-Wave Spectra of Magnetic Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores spin-wave dynamics in magnetic nanotubes, focusing on the influence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and curvature. The study uses analytical methods to examine how these factors influence the emergence of nonreciprocity and azimuthal standing waves in nanotubes with longitudinal magnetization along the axis or with a vortex-like magnetization. The interplay between exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya, and dipolar couplings in determining the chirality of spin waves is discussed. When the magnetization is saturated along an axis, the spin waves propagating along it are symmetric under the inversion of the wave vector. However, magnetochirality, mainly driven by exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya couplings, is observed in the azimuthal standing modes. In the vortex state, frequency nonreciprocity occurs for waves propagating along the tube, while the azimuthal modes remain reciprocal. For positive Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and depending on the helicity of the vortex, the asymmetry induced by the dipolar interaction is reinforced, whereas a negative coupling opposes this asymmetry. The influence of radial anisotropy is also examined. It is found that radial anisotropy reduces the frequency of the modes and shifts the dispersion minimum to a finite wave vector in the vortex state. The properties of modes near zero frequency offer insight into the emergence of chiral magnetic textures.</description>

      <title>Active nematic response to a deformable body or boundary: elastic deformations and anchoring-induced flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A body immersed in a nematic liquid crystal disturbs the fluid's preferred molecular configuration and increases its stored elastic energy. In an active nematic, the fluid components also generate a stress in the bulk fluid. By introducing either an immersed body or boundary, a fluid flow can be triggered due to anchoring boundary conditions alone -- a global pressure built by active stresses at equilibrium is instantly released everywhere. The fluid then imposes viscous, elastic, and active stresses on such surfaces, which, if compliant, may result in a surface deformation. We study the deformations and stress in a linearly elastic body placed in an active nematic in two-dimensions. Using complex variables techniques, exact expressions for the fluid flow, director field, surface tractions, and body deformation are derived. Qualitative differences between elastic and active stress-driven deformations are identified, depending on an active Ericksen number, anchoring conditions, and body material properties, thereby suggesting a new method for measuring mechanical stresses in active anisotropic environments. Flow profiles, external confinement, and anchoring-induced stirring are also addressed.</description>

      <title>Rubber wear on concrete: dry and in-water conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rubber wear results from the removal of small (micrometer-sized) rubber particles through crack propagation. In this study, we investigate the wear behavior of Styrene-Butadiene Rubber (SBR) and Natural Rubber (NR) sliding on two different concrete surfaces under dry and wet (in water) conditions. Experiments are conducted at low sliding speeds ($\approx 3 \ {\rm mm/s}$) to minimize frictional heating and hydrodynamic effects. For two SBR compounds, we observe significantly higher wear rates in water compared to the dry state, with enhancement factors of $1.5-2.5$ for a low-glass-transition-temperature SBR compound ($T_{\rm g} = -50^\circ {\rm C}$) and approximately $4$ for a higher-glass-transition compound ($T_{\rm g} = -7^\circ {\rm C}$). In contrast, the NR compound showed no wear in water at low nominal contact pressures ($\sigma_0 \approx 0.12$, $0.16$, and $0.25 \ {\rm MPa}$), while at higher pressures ($\sigma_0 \approx 0.36$ and $0.49 \ {\rm MPa}$), the wear rates in dry and in-water states are similar. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms of rubber wear under varying environmental and mechanical conditions, highlighting the influence of material properties, interfacial effects, and applied pressures on wear behavior.</description>

Abstract: Spatial information from cell-surface receptors is crucial for processes that require signal processing and sensing of the environment. Here, we investigate the optimal placement of such receptors through a theoretical model that minimizes uncertainty in gradient estimation. Without requiring a priori knowledge of the physical limits of sensing or biochemical processes, we reproduce the emergence of clusters that closely resemble those observed in real cells. On perfect spherical surfaces, optimally placed receptors spread uniformly. When perturbations break their symmetry, receptors cluster in regions of high curvature, massively reducing estimation uncertainty. This agrees with mechanistic models that minimize elastic preference discrepancies between receptors and cell membranes. We further extend our model to motile receptors responding to cell-shape changes and external fluid flow, demonstrating the relevance of our model in realistic scenarios. Our findings provide a simple and utilitarian explanation for receptor clustering at high-curvature regions when high sensing accuracy is paramount.</description>
