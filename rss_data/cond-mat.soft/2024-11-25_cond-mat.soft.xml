      <title>Transient rheology and morphology in sheared nanolayer polymer films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rheology of coextruded layered films of polystyrene/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PS/PMMA) has been studied with small and large amplitude oscillations at a temperature above their glass transition. While the complex viscosity remains constant over the experimental time window for the micron-sized layered films, a decrease has been observed for the nanolayered films. The rheological behavior has then been correlated to the morphological evolution of the multilayer films: while the nanolayers dewet. Layer breakup followed by retraction and coalescence leading to a lamellar-like blend morphology succeeded by a nodular-like morphology has been evidenced in the nanolayer films, for all compositions and conditions tested. The analysis of the microscopic images of the film cross-sections also provided the droplet size distribution. The nodular morphology is achieved more rapidly when the initial layers are the thinnest at low strains, while at high strains the formation of these droplets is prevented.</description>

      <title>The origin of strings and rings in the atomic dynamics of disordered systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has long been believed that the atomic dynamics in disordered structures, such as undercooled liquids and pre-melted interfaces, are characterized by collective atomic rearrangements in the form of quasi-one-dimensional chains of atomic displacements (strings) and their closed forms (rings). Here, we show by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that strings do not form by a single collective event. Instead, they are simply MD trajectories of propagating local density perturbations, which we call densitons. The atoms on this trajectory are physically indistinguishable from their environments except for the moving head of the string (densiton). A densiton migrates by either single-atom jumps or a concerted rearrangement of 2-3 atoms. The simulations reveal a remarkable similarity between the strings in disordered and crystalline structures, in which the densitons localize into point defects. This work calls for a significant reinterpretation of the string concept and instead proposes a densiton model of the atomic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Morphodynamics of surface-attached active drops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many biological and synthetic systems are suspensions of oriented, actively-moving components. Unlike in passive suspensions, the interplay between orientational order, active flows, and interactions with boundaries gives rise to fascinating new phenomena in such active suspensions. Here, we examine the paradigmatic example of a surface-attached drop of an active suspension (an "active drop"), which has so far only been studied in the idealized limit of thin drops. We find that such surface-attached active drops can exhibit a wide array of stable steady-state shapes and internal flows that are far richer than those documented previously, depending on boundary conditions and the strength of active stresses. Our analysis uncovers quantitative principles to predict and even rationally control the conditions under which these different states arise -- yielding design principles for next-generation active materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of photophysical aggregates in conjugated polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photophysical aggregates are ubiquitous in many solid-state microstructures adopted by conjugated polymers, in which $\pi$ electrons interact with those in other polymer chains or those in other chromophores along the chain. These interactions fundamentally define the electronic and optical properties of the polymer film. While valuable insight can be gained from linear excitation and photoluminescence spectra, nonlinear coherent excitation spectral lineshapes provide intricate understanding on the electronic couplings that define the aggregate and their fluctuations. Here, we discuss the coherent two-dimensional excitation lineshape of a model hairy-rod conjugated polymer. At zero population waiting time, we find a $\pi/2$ phase shift between the 0-0 and 0-1 vibronic peaks in the real and imaginary components of the complex coherent spectrum, as well as a dynamic phase rotation with population waiting time over timescales that are longer than the optical dephasing time. We conjecture that these are markers of relaxation of the photophysical aggregate down the tight manifold of the exciton band. These results highlight the potential for coherent spectroscopy via analysis of the complex spectral lineshape to become a key tool to develop structure-property relationships in complex functional materials.</description>

      <title>Diffusiophoretic transport of colloids in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how colloids move in crowded environments is key for gaining control over their transport in applications such as drug delivery, filtration, contaminant/microplastic remediation and agriculture. The classical models of colloid transport in porous media rely on geometric characteristics of the medium, and hydrodynamic/non-hydrodynamic equilibrium interactions to predict their behavior. However, chemical gradients are ubiquitous in these environments and can lead to the non-equilibrium diffusiophoretic migration of colloids. Here, combining microfluidic experiments, numerical simulations, and theoretical modeling we demonstrate that diffusiophoresis leads to significant macroscopic changes in the dispersion of colloids in porous media. We displace a suspension of colloids dispersed in a background salt solution with a higher/lower salinity solution and monitor the removal of the colloids from the medium. While mixing weakens the solute gradients, leading to the diffusiophoretic velocities that are orders of magnitude weaker than the background fluid flow, we show that the cross-streamline migration of colloids changes their macroscopic transit time and dispersion through the medium by an order of magnitude compared to the control case with no salinity gradients. Our observations demonstrate that solute gradients modulate the influence of geometric disorder on the transport, pointing to the need for revisiting the classical models of colloid transport in porous media to obtain predictive models for technological, medical, and environmental applications.</description>

      <title>Entropic tug of war: Topological constraints spontaneously rectify the dynamics of a polymer with heterogeneous fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymers with active segments constitute prospective future materials and are used as a model for some biological systems such as chromatin. The directions of the active forces are typically introduced with temporal or spatial correlations to establish directional motion of the chain and corresponding active dynamics. Instead, here we consider an active-passive copolymer, where the two segments differ only by the magnitude of their fluctuations and feature no artificial correlations. Here we show that although the model itself does not possess directional dynamics, if the chains are concentrated, directional persistent motion spontaneously arises as a consequence of the broken translational symmetry owing to the topological constraints. Using scaling arguments and simulations, we explain the phenomenon and describe the ensuing dynamics. Our work has thus far-reaching consequences for the mechanical properties of all dense active polymeric systems with heterogeneous fluctuations and in particular for chromatin conformation and dynamics that are crucial for biological functionality.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Analysis of Surface Modifications on Silanized Glass: Wettability Alteration and Long-Term Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To investigate the effect of wettability on multiphase flow in porous media, hydrophilic glass surfaces are typically modified through a silanization process. This study examines the nanoscale chemical and structural modifications of glass bead surfaces treated with Surfasil, using inverse gas chromatography and atomic force microscopy. The results show that silanization reduces both specific and dispersive components of surface energy, indicating fewer polar groups and lower total energy, leading to decreased hydrophilicity compared to untreated glass beads. BET surface area measurements and AFM images reveal that the surface becomes progressively smoother with increased silanization.
  Subsequently, this study assessed the stability and extent of surface modifications in silanized samples caused by adsorbed water during storage, using untreated glass beads as a reference. Untreated samples exhibit increases in surface roughness and polar groups, leading to marginal increase in surface energy and hydrophilicity. In contrast, the silanized samples show resistance to water adsorption, with only minor alterations in surface energy and structure, likely occurring in areas where the silanization coating was incomplete. The results suggest that humidity control is crucial during extended storage, as prolonged moisture exposure could still lead to surface modifications, even in silanized samples, potentially affecting wettability consistency in repeated experiments.</description>

      <title>Unique Dielectric Behaviour and Anomalies in Nanoconfined Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dielectric properties of a bulk dipolar liquid have been subjects of intense interest during the past decades. A surprising result was the discovery of a strong wavenumber dependence in the bulk homogeneous state. Such behaviour seems to suggest the possibility of a strong system size dependence of the dielectric constant (DC) of a nanoconfined liquid, although details have been revealed only recently. Dielectric properties of nanoconfined water indeed show marked sensitivity not only to the size and shape (dielectric boundaries) of confinement but also to the nature of surface-water interactions. For geometries widely studied, namely, water confined in a narrow slit, nanocylinder, and nanospherical cavity, the asymptotic approach to the bulk value of the DC with the increase in confinement size, is found to be surprisingly slow. This seems to imply the appearance of a dipolar cross-correlation length, much larger than the molecular length-scale of water. In narrow slit and narrow cylinder, the dielectric function becomes both inhomogeneous and anisotropic, and the longitudinal and transverse components display markedly different system size dependencies. This sensitivity can be traced back to the dependence of the DC on the ratio of the mean square dipole moment fluctuation to the volume of the system. The observed sensitivity of collective dipole moment fluctuations to the length scale of confinement points to the possibility of using DC to estimate orientational correlation length scale which has been an elusive quantity. Furthermore, the determination of volume also requires special consideration when the system size is in nanoscale. We discuss these and several other interesting issues along with several applications that have emerged in recent years.</description>

      <title>Kinetic model for transport in granular mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A kinetic model for granular mixtures is considered to study three different non-equilibrium situations. The model is based on the equivalence between a gas of elastic hard spheres subjected to a drag force proportional to the particle velocity and a gas of inelastic hard spheres. As a first problem, the relaxation of the velocity moments to their forms in the homogeneous cooling state (HCS) is studied. Then, taking the HCS as the reference state, the kinetic model is solved by the Chapman-Enskog method, which is conveniently adapted to inelastic collisions. For small spatial gradients, the mass, momentum and heat fluxes of the mixture are determined and exact expressions for the Navier-Stokes transport coefficients are obtained. As a third nonequilibrium problem, the kinetic model is solved exactly in the uniform shear flow (USF) state, where the rheological properties of the mixture are computed in terms of the parameter space of the mixture. In addition to the transport properties, the velocity distribution functions of each species are also explicitly obtained. To assess the reliability of the model, its theoretical predictions are compared with both (approximate) analytical results and computer simulations of the original Boltzmann equation. In general, the comparison shows a reasonable agreement between the two kinetic equations. While the diffusion transport coefficients show excellent agreement with the Boltzmann results, more quantitative differences appear in the case of the shear viscosity coefficient and the heat flux transport coefficients. In the case of the USF, although the model qualitatively captures the shear rate dependence of the rheological properties well, the discrepancies increase with increasing inelasticity in collisions.</description>

      <title>Theory of Nonequilibrium Crystallization and the Phase Diagram of Active Brownian Spheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The crystallization of hard spheres at equilibrium is perhaps the most familiar example of an entropically-driven phase transition. In recent years, it has become clear that activity can dramatically alter this order-disorder transition in unexpected ways. The theoretical description of active crystallization has remained elusive as the traditional thermodynamic arguments that shape our understanding of passive freezing are inapplicable to active systems. Here, we develop a statistical mechanical description of the one-body density field and a nonconserved order parameter field that represents local crystalline order. We develop equations of state, guided by computer simulations, describing the crystallinity field which result in shifting the order-disorder transition to higher packing fractions with increasing activity. We then leverage our recent dynamical theory of coexistence to construct the full phase diagram of active Brownian spheres, quantitatively recapitulating both the solid-fluid and liquid-gas coexistence curves and the solid-liquid-gas triple point.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann simulations for soft flowing matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last decade, the Lattice Boltzmann method has found major scope for the simulation of a large spectrum of problems in soft matter, from multiphase and multi-component microfluidic flows, to foams, emulsions, colloidal flows, to name but a few. Crucial to many such applications is the role of supramolecular interactions which occur whenever mesoscale structures, such as bubbles or droplets, come in close contact, say of the order of tens of nanometers. Regardless of their specific physico-chemical origin, such near-contact interactions are vital to preserve the coherence of the mesoscale structures against coalescence phenomena promoted by capillarity and surface tension, hence the need of including them in Lattice Boltzmann schemes. Strictly speaking, this entails a complex multiscale problem, covering about six spatial decades, from centimeters down to tens of nanometers, and almost twice as many in time. Such a multiscale problem can hardly be taken by a single computational method, hence the need for coarse-grained models for the near-contact interactions. In this review, we shall discuss such coarse-grained models and illustrate their application to a variety of soft flowing matter problems, such as soft flowing crystals, strongly confined dense emulsions, flowing hierarchical emulsions, soft granular flows, as well as the transmigration of active droplets across constrictions. Finally, we conclude with a few considerations on future developments in the direction of quantum-nanofluidics, machine learning, and quantum computing for soft flows applications.</description>

Abstract: In a recent paper, Di Lisio et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 159 064505 (2023)] analyzed a series of temperature down-jumps using the single-parameter aging (SPA) ansatz combined with a specific assumption about density scaling in the out-of-equilibrium system and did not find a good prediction for the largest down-jumps. In this paper we show that SPA in its original form does work for all their data including large jumps of \Delta T &gt; 20 K. Furthermore, we discuss different approaches to the extension of the density scaling concept to out-of-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cylindrical inclusions in mobile brushes experience apparent attraction, which arises from a tendency to minimize the depletion zone around the inclusions, thereby maximizing the overall entropy. We find that correlation blobs act as the basic units of the attraction. In tall brushes, however, the depletion zone formed above the inclusions can generate repulsion, partially offsetting the depletion attraction. Our study offers physical insights into the brush-induced depletion interaction and suggests it as a mechanism for protein cluster formation on cell surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.01622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A GPU-accelerated version of the lattice Boltzmann method for efficient simulation of soft materials is introduced. Unlike standard approaches, this method reconstructs the distribution functions from available hydrodynamic variables (density, momentum, and pressure tensor) without storing the full set of discrete populations. This scheme shows satisfactory numerical stability, significantly lower memory requirements, and data access cost. A series of benchmark tests of relevance to soft matter, such as collisions of fluid droplets, is discussed to validate the method. The results can be of particular interest for high-performance simulations of soft matter systems on future exascale computers.</description>
