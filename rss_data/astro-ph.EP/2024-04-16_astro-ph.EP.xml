      <title>Inclination instability of circumbinary planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a tilt instability of the orbit of an outer planet in a two planet circumbinary system that we recently reported. The binary is on an eccentric orbit and the inner circumbinary planet is on a circular polar orbit that causes the the binary to undergo apsidal precession. The outer circumbinary planet is initially on a circular or eccentric orbit that is coplanar with respect to the binary. We apply a Hamiltonian in quadrupole order of the binary potential to show that the tilt instability is the result of a secular resonance in which the apsidal precession rate of the binary matches the nodal precession rate of the outer planet. Resonance is possible because the polar inner planet causes the apsidal precession of the binary to be retrograde. The outer planet periodically undergoes large tilt oscillations for which we analytically determine the initial evolution and maximum inclination. Following a typically relatively short adjustment phase, the tilt grows exponentially in time at a characteristic rate that is of order the absolute value of the binary apsidal precession rate. The analytic results agree well with numerical simulations. This instability is analogous to the Kozai-Lidov instability, but applied to a circumbinary object. The instability fails to operate if the binary mass ratio is too extreme. The instability occurs even if the outer planet is instead an object of stellar mass and involves tilt oscillations of the inner binary.</description>

      <title>Purple is the new green: biopigments and spectra of Earth-like purple worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With more than 5500 detected exoplanets, the search for life is entering a new era. Using life on Earth as our guide, we look beyond green landscapes to expand our ability to detect signs of surface life on other worlds. While oxygenic photosynthesis gives rise to modern green landscapes, bacteriochlorophyll-based anoxygenic phototrophs can also colour their habitats and could dominate a much wider range of environments on Earth-like exoplanets. Here, we characterize the reflectance spectra of a collection of purple sulfur and purple non-sulfur bacteria from a variety of anoxic and oxic environments. We present models for Earth-like planets where purple bacteria dominate the surface and show the impact of their signatures on the reflectance spectra of terrestrial exoplanets. Our research provides a new resource to guide the detection of purple bacteria and improves our chances of detecting life on exoplanets with upcoming telescopes. Our biological pigment data base for purple bacteria and the high-resolution spectra of Earth-like planets, including ocean worlds, snowball planets, frozen worlds, and Earth analogues, are available online, providing a tool for modellers and observers to train retrieval algorithms, optimize search strategies, and inform models of Earth-like planets, where purple is the new green.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Model of Rotation and Orbital Coupling for Deimos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dynamical model, building upon the existing dynamical model for Deimos in the current numerical ephemerides, which only encompasses the simple libration effects of Deimos. The study comprehensively incorporates the rotational dynamics of Deimos influenced by the torque exerted by the major celestial bodies (Mars, the Sun) in the solar system within the inertial space. Consequently, a full dynamical model is formulated to account for the complete coupling between the rotation and orbit of Deimos. Simultaneously, employing precision orbit determination methods used for artificial satellites, we develop an adjustment model for fitting data to the complete model. The 12-order Adams--Bashforth--Moulton (ABM) integration algorithm is employed to synchronously integrate the 12 state variables of the full model to obtain the orbit of Deimos. Numerical simulation results indicate that the full dynamical model and adjustment model are stable and reliable. Compared to the simple model, the polar axis of Deimos in the inertial space exhibits a more complex oscillation in the full model. This work further advances the current dynamical model for Deimos and establishes the foundational model for the generation of a new set of precise numerical ephemerides for Deimos.</description>

      <title>High-resolution atmospheric retrievals of WASP-76b transmission spectroscopy with ESPRESSO: Monitoring limb asymmetries across multiple transits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct atmospheric retrievals of exoplanets at high-resolution have recently allowed for a more detailed characterisation of their chemistry and dynamics from the ground. By monitoring the longitudinal distribution of species, as well as the varying vertical temperature structure and dynamics between the limbs of WASP-76b, across multiple transits, we aim to enhance our understanding of the 3D nature and chemical/dynamical evolution of such objects over the timescales of months/years. We present retrievals of three VLT/ESPRESSO observations of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b, including one not yet reported in the literature, from which we constrain the atmospheric abundances, vertical temperature structure, and atmospheric dynamics for both the leading and trailing limbs of the atmosphere separately, via novel rotational broadening kernels. We confirm the presence of VO recently reported in the atmosphere of WASP-76b. We find a uniform longitudinal distribution of Fe and Mg across the limbs of the atmosphere, for each of our transits, consistent with previous works as well as with stellar values. We constrain substellar Na/Fe and Cr/Fe ratios across each of our transits, consistent with previous studies of WASP-76b. Where constrained, V/Fe and VO/Fe ratios were also found to be broadly consistent between the limbs of the atmosphere for each of the transits, as well as with previous studies. However, for two of the transits, both V and VO were unconstrained in the leading limb, suggesting possible depletion due to recombination and condensation. The consistency of our constraints across multiple high-resolution observations, as well as with previous studies using varying modelling/retrieval frameworks and/or instruments, affirms the efficacy of high-resolution ground-based retrievals of exoplanetary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Direct imaging of exoplanets: Legacy and prospects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how giant and terrestrial planets form and evolve, what is their internal structure and that of their atmosphere, represents one of the major challenges of modern astronomy, which is directly connected to the ultimate search for life at the horizon 2040. However, several astrophysical, biological and technological obstacles must be overcome. From the astrophysical point of view, it is indeed crucial to understand the mechanisms of formation and evolution of giant planets, including planet and disk interactions, which will completely sculpt the planetary architectures and thus dominate the formation of terrestrial planets, especially in regions around the host star capable of supporting life. It is also important to develop dedicated instrumentation and techniques to study in their totality the population of giant and terrestrial planets, but also to reveal in the near future the first biological clues of life in the atmospheres of terrestrial planets. In that perspective, direct imaging from ground-based observatories or in space is playing a central role in concert with other observing techniques. This review introduces the genesis of this observing technique, the main instrumental innovation and challenges, stellar targets and surveys, to then present the main results obtained so far about the physics and the mechanisms of formation and evolution of young giant planets and planetary system architectures. I will then present the exciting perspectives offered by the upcoming generation of planet imagers about to come online, particularly on the future extremely large telescopes. On the timescale of a human Life, we may well be witnessing the first discovery of an exoplanet and the first detection of indices of life in the atmosphere of a nearby exo-Earth!</description>

      <title>The XUV-driven escape of the planets around TOI-431 &amp; $\nu^2$ Lupi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the leading mechanisms invoked to explain the existence of the radius valley is atmospheric mass loss driven by X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet irradiation, with this process stripping the primordial envelopes of young, small planets to produce the observed bimodal distribution. We present an investigation into the TOI-431 and $\nu^2$ Lupi planetary systems, both of which host planets either side of the radius valley, to determine if their architectures are consistent with evolution by the XUV mechanism. With $\textit{XMM-Newton}$, we measure the current X-ray flux of each star, and see evidence for a stellar flare in the TOI-431 observations. We then simulate the evolution of all of the transiting planets across the two systems in response to the high-energy irradiation over their lifetimes. We use the measured X-ray fluxes as an anchor point for the XUV time evolution in our simulations, and employ several different models of estimating mass loss rates. While the simulations for TOI-431b encountered a problem with the initial calculated radii, we estimate a likely short ($\sim$ Myr) timespan for primordial envelope removal using reasonable assumptions for the initial planet. $\nu^2$ Lupi b is likely harder to strip, but is achieved in a moderate fraction of our simulations. None of our simulations stripped any of the lower density planets of their envelope, in line with prediction. We conclude that both systems are consistent with expectations for generation of the radius valley through XUV photoevaporation.</description>

Abstract: We present a catalog of 150 variable stars, including 13 stars with exoplanet candidates. 37 stars were identified as variables for the first time. As a result of a 2.5-year photometric survey of exoplanets, we have obtained and analyzed light curves for almost 50 thousand stars in fields around white dwarfs WD 0009+501 and GRW +708247. Here we describe observations and data processing, the search for variable stars, their cross-identification with other catalogs and classification. The catalog is published in open access and contains the primary classification of variability, light curves and their parameters.</description>

      <title>Protoplanetary Disk Polarization at Multiple Wavelengths: Are Dust Populations Diverse?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millimeter and sub-millimeter observations of continuum linear dust polarization provide insight into dust grain growth in protoplanetary disks, which are the progenitors of planetary systems. We present the results of the first survey of dust polarization in protoplanetary disks at 870 $\mu$m and 3 mm. We find that protoplanetary disks in the same molecular cloud at similar evolutionary stages can exhibit different correlations between observing wavelength and polarization morphology and fraction. We explore possible origins for these differences in polarization, including differences in dust populations and protostar properties. For RY Tau and MWC 480, which are consistent with scattering at both wavelengths, we present models of the scattering polarization from several dust grain size distributions. These models aim to reproduce two features of the observational results for these disks: (1) both disks have an observable degree of polarization at both wavelengths and (2) the polarization fraction is higher at 3 mm than at 870 $\mu$m in the centers of the disks. For both disks, these features can be reproduced by a power-law distribution of spherical dust grains with a maximum radius of 200 $\mu$m and high optical depth. In MWC 480, we can also reproduce features (1) and (2) with a model containing large grains ($a_{max}$ = 490 $\mu$m ) near the disk midplane and small grains ($a_{max}$ = 140 $\mu$m) above and below the midplane.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional atmospheric dynamics of Jupiter from ground-based Doppler imaging spectroscopy in the visible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present three-dimensional (3D) maps of Jupiter's atmospheric circulation at cloud-top level from Doppler-imaging data obtained in the visible domain with JIVE, the second node of the JOVIAL network, which is mounted on the Dunn Solar Telescope at Sunspot, New Mexico. We report on 12 nights of observations between May 4 and May 30, 2018, representing a total of about 80 hours. Firstly, the average zonal wind profile derived from our data is compatible with that derived from cloud-tracking measurements performed on Hubble Space Telescope images obtained in April 2018 from the Outer Planet Atmospheres Legacy (OPAL) program. Secondly, we present the first ever two-dimensional maps of Jupiter's atmospheric circulation from Doppler measurements. The zonal velocity map highlights well-known atmospheric features, such as the equatorial hot spots and the Great Red Spot (GRS). In addition to zonal winds, we derive meridional and vertical velocity fields from the Doppler data. The motions attributed to vertical flows are mainly located at the boundary between the equatorial belts and tropical zones, which could indicate active motion in theses regions. Qualitatively, these results compare well to recent Juno data that have unveiled the three-dimensional structure of Jupiter's wind field. To the contrary, the motions attributed to meridional circulation are very different from what is obtained by cloud tracking, except at the GRS. Because of limitations with data resolution and processing techniques, we acknowledge that our measurement of vertical or meridional flows of Jupiter are still to be confirmed.</description>

      <title>Do Temperate Rocky Planets Around M Dwarfs have an Atmosphere ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12617v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting an atmosphere on nearby temperate planets is one of the most important scientific objectives of the Webb mission, an endeavour in practice limited to a handful of well-characterized planets: Trappist-1d, e, f, g, LHS1140b, and the mini-Neptune K2- 18b. The first 18 months of atmospheric characterization with JWST have confirmed both its power and versatility to probe exoplanet atmospheres, and have highlighted the challenge of stellar activity in studying those atmospheres through transmission spectroscopy. Assessing the prevalence of atmosphere in temperate planets with a minimal degree of confidence will require a multi-cycle program of order of a few 1000 hours involving both eclipse photometry and transmission spectroscopy, a program that would have to be executed over a significant fraction of JWST's lifetime. Implementing specialized fast readout modes tailored for time-series observations of relatively bright stars would greatly enhance the efficiency and productivity of JWST's exoplanet science programs. The forthcoming 500 hours of Cycle 3 Director Discretionary Time dedicated to exoplanet programs represent a unique opportunity to initiate a deep reconnaissance of habitability of the best keystone temperate planets.</description>

      <title>A simple method to measure numax for asteroseismology: application to 16,000 oscillating Kepler red giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17557v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The importance of numax (the frequency of maximum oscillation power) for asteroseismology has been demonstrated widely in the previous decade, especially for red giants. With the large amount of photometric data from CoRoT, Kepler and TESS, several automated algorithms to retrieve numax values have been introduced. Most of these algorithms correct the granulation background in the power spectrum by fitting a model and subtracting it before measuring numax. We have developed a method that does not require fitting to the granulation background. Instead, we simply divide the power spectrum by a function of the form nu^-2, to remove the slope due to granulation background, and then smooth to measure numax. This method is fast, simple and avoids degeneracies associated with fitting. The method is able to measure oscillations in 99.9% of previously-studied Kepler red giants, with a systematic offset of 1.5 % in numax values that that we are able to calibrate. On comparing the seismic radii from this work with Gaia, we see similar trends to those observed in previous studies. Additionally, our values of width of the power envelope can clearly identify the dipole mode suppressed stars as a distinct population, hence as a way to detect them. We also applied our method to stars with low (0.19--18.35 muHz) and found it works well to correctly identify the oscillations.</description>

      <title>The Solar Neighborhood LI: A Variability Survey of Nearby M Dwarfs with Planets from Months to Decades with TESS and the CTIO/SMARTS 0.9 m Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the optical photometric variability of 32 planet-hosting M dwarfs within 25 parsecs over timescales of months to decades. The primary goal of this project, ATLAS -- A Trail to Life Around Stars, is to follow the trail to life by revealing nearby M dwarfs with planets that are also "quiet", which may make them more amiable to habitability. There are 69 reported exoplanets orbiting the 32 stars discussed here, providing a rich sample of worlds for which environmental evaluations are needed. We examine the optical flux environments of these planets over month-long timescales for 23 stars observed by TESS, and find that 17 vary by less than 1% ($\sim$11 mmag). All 32 stars are being observed at the CTIO/SMARTS 0.9 m, with a median duration of 19.1 years of optical photometric data in the $VRI$ bands. We find over these extended timescales that six stars show optical flux variations less than 2%, 25 vary from 2--6% ($\sim$22-67 mmag), and only one, Proxima Centauri, varies by more than 6%. Overall, LHS 1678 exhibits the lowest optical variability levels measured over all timescales examined, thereby providing one of the most stable photometric environments among planets reported around M dwarfs within 25 parsecs. More than 600 of the nearest M dwarfs are being observed at the 0.9 m in the RECONS program that began in 1999, and many more planet hosts will undoubtedly be revealed, providing more destinations to be added to the ATLAS sample in the future.</description>
