      <title>Separation of the initial conditions in the inverse problem for 1D non-linear tsunami wave run-up theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the inverse tsunami wave problem within the framework of the 1D nonlinear shallow water equations (SWE). Specifically, we focus on determining the initial displacement $\eta_0(x)$ and velocity $u_0(x)$ of the wave, given the known motion of the shoreline $R(t)$ (the wet/dry free boundary). We demonstrate that for power-shaped inclined bathymetries, this problem admits a complete solution for any $\eta_0$ and $u_0$, provided the wave does not break. In particular, we show that the knowledge of $R(t)$ enables the unique recovery of both $\eta_0(x$) and $u_0(x)$ in terms of the Abel transform.
  It is important to note that, in contrast to the direct problem (also known as the tsunami wave run-up problem), where $R(t)$ can be computed exactly only for $u_0(x)=0$, our algorithm can recover $\eta_0$ and $u_0$ exactly for any non-zero $u_0$. This highlights an interesting asymmetry between the direct and inverse problems. Our results extend the work presented in \cite{Rybkin23,Rybkin24}, where the inverse problem was solved for $u_0(x)=0$. As in previous work, our approach utilizes the Carrier-Greenspan transformation, which linearizes the SWE for inclined bathymetries. Extensive numerical experiments confirm the efficiency of our algorithms.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic modelling of a skin effect in magnetic conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the time-harmonic Maxwell equations set on a domain made of two subdomains $\Omega_{-}$ and $\Omega_{+}$, such that $\Omega_{-}$ represents a magnetic conductor and $\Omega_{+}$ represents a non-magnetic material, and the relative magnetic permeability $\mu_{r}$ between the two materials is very high. Assuming smoothness for the interface between the subdomains and regularity of the data, the electric field solution of the Maxwell equations possesses an asymptotic expansion in powers of the parameter $\eps=1/ \sqrt{\mu_{r}}$ with profile terms rapidly decaying inside the magnetic conductor. We make explicit the first terms of this expansion. As an application of the asymptotic expansion we obtain the asymptotic behavior of a skin depth function that allows to measure the boundary layer phenomenon at large relative permeability. As another application of this expansion we give elements of proof for the derivation of impedance boundary conditions (IBCs) up to the third order of approximation with respect to the parameter $\varepsilon$, and we prove error estimates for the IBCs.</description>

      <title>Nonexistence of traveling wave solutions in the fractional Rosenau-Hyman equation via homotopy perturbation method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the homotopy perturbation method to construct series solutions for the fractional Rosenau-Hyman (fRH) equation and study their dynamics. Unlike the classical RH equation where compactons arise from truncated periodic solutions, we show that spatial nonlocality prevents the existence of compactons, and therefore periodic traveling waves are considered. By asymptotic analyses involving the Mittag-Leffler function, it is shown that the quadratic fRH equation exhibits bifurcation with respect to the order of the temporal fractional derivative, leading to the eventual pinning of wave propagation. Additionally, numerical results suggest potential finite time blow-up in the cubic fRH. While HPM proves effective in constructing analytic solutions, we identify cases of divergence, underscoring the need for further research into its convergence properties and broader applicability.</description>

      <title>Radial symmetry and sharp asymptotic behaviors of nonnegative solutions to weighted doubly $D^{1,p}$-critical quasi-linear nonlocal elliptic equations with Hardy potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly consider nonnegative weak solutions $u\in D^{1,p}(\R^{N})$ to the doubly $D^{1,p}(\R^{N})$-critical nonlocal quasi-linear Schr\"{o}dinger-Hartree equation: \begin{align*} -\Delta_p u- \mu \frac{u^{p-1}}{|x|^p}=\left(|x|^{-2p}\ast |u|^{p}\right)|u|^{p-2}u \qquad &amp;\mbox{in} \,\, \mathbb{R}^N, \end{align*} where $N\geq3$, $0\leq\mu&lt; \bar{\mu}:=\left( (N-p)/p \right)^p$ and $1&lt;p&lt;\frac{N}{2}$. When $\mu&gt;0$, due to appearance of the Hardy potential, the equation has singularity at $0\in\mathbb{R}^{N}$ and hence is not translation invariant, so sharp asymptotic estimates near the origin must be involved. First, we establish regularity and the sharp estimates on asymptotic behaviors near the origin and the infinity for any positive solution $u\in D^{1,p}(\R^{N})$ (and $|\nabla u|$) to more general equation $-\triangle_p u - \mu \frac{1}{|x|^p}u^{p-1}=V(x)\frac{1}{|x|^s}u^{p-1}$ with $N\geq2$, $0\leq\mu&lt; \bar{\mu}$, $1&lt;p&lt;N$, $0\leq s &lt; p$ and $0\leq V(x)\in L^\frac{N}{p-s}(\R^N)$. Then, as a consequence, we can apply the method of moving planes to prove that all the nontrivial nonnegative solutions in $D^{1,p}(\R^{N})$ are radially symmetric and strictly radially decreasing about the origin $0\in\mathbb{R}^{N}$. The sharp asymptotic estimates and radial symmetry for more general weighted doubly $D^{1,p}$-critical nonlocal quasi-linear equations were also derived. Our results extend the results in \cite{DLL} from the special case $\mu=0$ to general cases $0\leq\mu&lt;\bar{\mu}$.</description>

      <title>The Korteweg-de Vries Equation on general star graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish local well-posedness for the Cauchy problem associated with the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation on a general metric star graph. The graph comprises m + k semi-infinite edges: k negative half-lines and m positive half-lines, all joined at a common vertex. The choice of boundary conditions is compatible with the conditions determined by the semigroup theory. The crucial point in this work is to obtain the integral formula using the forcing operator method and the Fourier restriction method of Bourgain. This work extends the results obtained by Cavalcante for the specific case of the Y junction to a more general class of star graphs.</description>

      <title>Convergence to superposition of boundary layer, rarefaction and shock for the 1D Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the asymptotic stability of solutions to the inflow problem for the one-dimensional barotropic Navier-Stokes equations in half space. When the boundary value is located at the subsonic regime, all the possible thirteen asymptotic patterns are classified in \cite{M01}. We consider the most complicated pattern, the superposition of the boundary layer solution, the 1-rarefaction wave, and the viscous 2-shock waves. In this superposition, the boundary layer is degenerate and large. We prove that, if the strengths of the rarefaction wave and shock wave are small, and if the initial data is a small perturbation of the superposition, then the solution asymptotically converges to the superposition up to a dynamical shift for the shock. As a corollary, our result implies the asymptotic stability for the simpler case where the superposition consists of the degenerate boundary layer solution and the viscous 2-shock. Therefore, we complete the study of the asymptotic stability of the inflow problem for the 1D barotropic Navier-Stokes equations for subsonic boundary values.</description>

      <title>On a coupled system of KP-type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A defining characteristic of the Kadomstev-Petviashvili (KP) model equations is that the well-posedness results are subject to the restriction that at all transverse positions, the mass $\int u \,dx = \text{constant independent of $y$}.$ In 2007, for a rather general class of equations of KP type, it was shown that the zero-mass (in $x$) constraint is satisfied at any non-zero time even if it is not satisfied at initial time zero. In an effort to remedy this "odd" behavior of the mass of a given solution to the KP Cauchy problem, a model modification is introduced which does not impose non-physical restrictions upon the initial data. In this article, we introduce a new modified KP system. After providing a variational derivation of the model, we analyze its Hamiltonian evolutionary structure. Furthermore, we prove linear estimates in the Bourgain spaces $X^{s,b}$ corresponding to the integral equation arising from the Duhamel formulation of system.</description>

      <title>Effect of additional regularity for the initial data on semi-linear $\sigma$-evolution equations with different damping types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we would like to study the critical exponent for semi-linear $\sigma$-evolution equations with different damping types under the influence of additional regularity for the initial data. On the one hand, we establish the existence of global (in time) solutions for small initial data and the blow-up in finite time solutions in the supercritical case and the subcritical case, respectively. The very interesting phenomenon is that the critical case belonging to the global solution range or the blow-up solution range depends heavily on the assumption of additional regularity for the initial data. Furthermore, we are going to provide lifespan estimates for solutions when the blow-up phenomenon occurs.</description>

      <title>Forward and Inverse Problems in Nonlinear Acoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The importance of ultrasound is well established in the imaging of human tissue. In order to enhance image quality by exploiting nonlinear effects, recently techniques such as harmonic imaging and nonlinearity parameter tomography have been put forward. As soon as the pressure amplitude exceeds a certain bound, the classical linear wave equation loses its validity and more general nonlinear versions have to be used. Another characteristic property of ultrasound propagation in human tissue is frequency power law attenuation, leading to fractional derivative damping models in time domain. In this contribution we will first of all dwell on modeling nonlinearity on the one hand and fractional damping on the other hand. Moreover we will give an idea on the challenges in the analysis of the resulting PDEs and discuss some parameter asymptotics. Finally, we address a relevant inverse problems in this context, the above mentioned task of nonlinearity parameter imaging, which leads to a coefficient identification problem for a quasilinear wave equation.</description>

      <title>Moment estimates for polyatomic Boltzmann equation with frozen collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a polyatomic gas with continuous internal energy is considered, allowing for frozen collisions, in which the kinetic energy of the colliding particle pair is conserved, and the internal energy of each particle remains unchanged. A priori moment estimates are derived for solutions of the space-homogeneous Boltzmann equation with a collision kernel of the hard potentials type with cut-off. The model with frozen collisions is first analyzed, followed by a review of general collisions--referred to as pure polyatomic--which preserve the total kinetic and internal energy. By combining existing results for pure polyatomic collisions with the newly derived estimates for frozen collisions, moment estimates are established for the Boltzmann equation with a collision operator that convexly combines both types of collisions. In particular, the moment generation property is shown to be driven by the rate of the pure polyatomic operator, and the moment propagation property holds.</description>

      <title>On isolated singularities of the conformal Gaussian curvature equation and $Q$-curvature equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the isolated singularities of the conformal Gaussian curvature equation \[
  -\Delta u = K(x) e^{u} \quad ~ in ~ B_{1} \setminus \{ 0 \}, \] where $B_1 \setminus \{ 0 \} \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is the punctured unit disc. Under the assumption that the Gaussian curvature $K \in L^\infty(B_1)$ is nonnegative, we establish the asymptotic behavior of solutions near the singularity. When $K \equiv 1$, a similar result has been obtained by Chou and Wan (Pacific J. Math. 1994) using the method of complex analysis. Our proof is entirely based on the PDE method and applies to the general Gaussian curvature $K(x)$. Furthermore, our approach is also available for characterizing isolated singularities of the conformal $Q$-curvature equation $(-\Delta)^{\frac{n}{2}} u = K(x) e^{u}$ in any dimension $n\geq 3$. This equation arises from the prescribing $Q$-curvature problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shallow water system with a bed jump is used to describe a fluid flow over a dam. It is modeled as a simple step function with the Riemann initial data with a vacuum on the right-hand side. The main question is whether the fluid will stay on the left-hand side of the dam. After approximating the step function space derivative with a fixed shadow wave solutions to that problem stay bounded. The maximal dissipation principle is used to find a proper connection between waves on both sides of the dam, and a unique solution afterward.</description>

      <title>Effects of oscillation scales in discrete brittle damage models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the asymptotic analysis of a sequence of variational models of brittle damage in the context of linearized elasticity in the two-dimensional discrete setting. We consider a discrete version of Francfort and Marigo's brittle damage model, where the total energy is restricted to continuous and piecewise affine displacements; within different regimes where the damaged regions concentrate on vanishingly small sets while the stiffness of the damaged material degenerates to $0$. In this setting, the convergence of the space discretization, the concentration of the damaged regions, and the decay of the elastic properties of the damaged phase all compete simultaneously in non-trivial ways according to the scaling law under consideration. The mesh size turns out to be a crucial feature of the analysis, as it induces a minimal scale of spatial oscillations for admissible displacements. This study was motivated by the numerical investigations performed in [2] on the one hand, where Allaire-Jouve-Van Goethem have shown that forcing the stiffness decay on sets of arbitrarily small measure seems to lead to concentrations phenomena such as in brittle fracture; and by the static analysis performed in [10] on the other hand, where Babadjian-Iurlano-Rindler addressed the rigorous asymptotic analysis of this observation in terms of the $\Gamma$-convergence of the total energies, in the continuous setting in space. Surprisingly, they showed that fracture-type models were not obtained asymptotically, thus raising the question of the dependence of the effective models with respect to the scaling of a spatial discretization in Francfort and Marigo's model. This is the content of the present work, where we show that concentrations phenomena are only captured asymptotically in regimes where the mesh size and the concentration of damaged regions are of same order.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann equations with neutral initial data and small relative entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of dilute plasma particles such as electrons and ions can be modeled by the fundamental two species Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann equations, which describes mutual interactions of plasma particles through collisions in the self-induced electric field. In this paper, we are concerned with global well-posedness of mild solutions of the equations. We establish the global existence and uniqueness of mild solutions to the two species Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann equations in the torus for a class of initial data with bounded time-velocity weighted $L^{\infty}$ norm under nearly neutral condition and some smallness condition on $L^1_xL^\infty_v$ norm as well as defect mass, energy and entropy so that the initial data allow large amplitude oscillations. Due to the nonlinear effect of electric field, we consider the problem in $W^{1, \infty}_{x,v}$ with large amplitude data, new difficulty arises when establishing globally uniform $W^{1, \infty}_{x,v}$ bound, which has been overcome based on nearly neutral condition, time-velocity weight function and a logarithmic estimate. Moreover, the large time behavior of solutions in $W^{1, \infty}_{x,v}$ norm with exponential decay rates of convergence is also obtained.</description>

      <title>Scattering of Rational Solutions to the Half-Wave Maps Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores the rational solutions of the Half-Wave Maps equation in the non-singular spectrum case, demonstrating their global-in-time existence and systematic scattering. We begin by describing a scattering framework, establishing equivalent characterizations, and identifying a sufficient local condition that guarantees scattering over infinite time scales. Next, we construct initial conditions that lead to solutions scattering indefinitely for any given number of solitons and any prescribed spectrum of speeds. Furthermore, we prove that any rational solution with a non-singular spectrum scatters in Sobolev norm to a sum of solitons, each characterized by a constant spin and a pole moving at a constant velocity. Moreover, the scattering map from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$ is constant. Lastly, we provide an algebraic characterization of traveling waves and establish that a solution cannot scatter to a traveling map without itself being in a traveling state for finite times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain Calder\'on-Zygmund estimates for the laplacian of the following fourth order quasilinear elliptic problem $$ \Delta(g(\Delta u)\Delta u) = \Delta(g(\Delta f)\Delta f). $$ where the primitive of $g(t)t$, $G(t)$, is an $N-$function. We prove that if $G(f)\in L^q$, then $G(\Delta u)\in L^q$ for $q\ge 1$.</description>

Abstract: On a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary, we study the set of conformal metrics of negative constant scalar curvature in the interior and positive constant mean curvature on the boundary. Working in the case of positive Yamabe conformal invariant, we prove that this set is a priori bounded in the three-dimensional case and in the locally conformally flat with umbilical boundary case in any dimension not less than three.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discover a new, non-radial example of a manifold whose heat kernel decreases monotonically along all minimal geodesics. We also classify the flat tori with this monotonicity property. Furthermore, we show that for a generic metric on any smooth manifold the monotonicity property fails at large times. This answers a recent question of Alonso-Or\'an, Chamizo, Mart\'inez, and Mas.</description>

      <title>Shadowing for Infinite Dimensional Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we extend some results about Shadowing Lemma there are known on finite dimensional compact manifolds without border and $\mathbb{R}^n$, to an infinite dimensional space. In fact, we prove that if $\{\mathcal{T}(t):t\ge 0\}$ is a Morse-Smale semigroup defined in a Hilbert space with global attractor $\mathcal{A}$, then $\mathcal{T}(1)|_{\mathcal{A}}:\mathcal{A}\to \mathcal{A} $ admits the Lipschitz Shadowing property. Moreover, for any positively invariant bounded neighborhood $\mathcal{U}\supset\mathcal{A}$ of the global attractor, the map $\mathcal{T}(1)|_{\mathcal{U}}:\mathcal{U}\to \mathcal{U}$ has the H\"{o}lder-Shadowing property. As applications, we obtain new results related to the structural stability of Morse-Smale semigroups defined in Hilbert spaces and continuity of global attractors.</description>

      <title>Stability of N-front and N-back solutions in the Barkley model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we establish for an intermediate Reynolds number domain the stability of N-front and N-back solutions for each N &gt; 1 corresponding to traveling waves, in an experimentally validated model for the transition to turbulence in pipe flow proposed in [Barkley et al., Nature 526(7574):550-553, 2015]. We base our work on the existence analysis of a heteroclinic loop between a turbulent and a laminar equilibrium proved by Engel, Kuehn and de Rijk in [Engel, Kuehn, de Rijk, Nonlinearity 35:5903, 2022], as well as some results from this work. The stability proof follows the verification of a set of abstract stability hypotheses stated by Sandstede in [SIAM Journal on Mathematical Analysis 29.1 (1998), pp. 183-207] for traveling waves motivated by the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations. In particular, this completes the first detailed analysis of Engel, Kuehn and de Rijk in [Engel, Kuehn, de Rijk, Nonlinearity 35:5903, 2022] leading to a complete existence and stability statement that nicely fits within the abstract framework of waves generated by twisted heteroclinic loops.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study tilings of the plane composed of two repeating tiles of different assigned areas relative to an arbitrary periodic lattice. We classify isoperimetric configurations (i.e., configurations with minimal length of the interfaces) both in the case of a fixed lattice or for an arbitrary periodic lattice. We find three different configurations depending on the ratio between the assigned areas of the two tiles and compute the isoperimetric profile. The three different configurations are composed of tiles with a different number of circular edges, moreover, different configurations exhibit a different optimal lattice. Finally, we raise some open problems related to our investigation.</description>

      <title>Numerical Schemes for Signature Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signature kernels have emerged as a powerful tool within kernel methods for sequential data. In the paper "The Signature Kernel is the solution of a Goursat PDE", the authors identify a kernel trick that demonstrates that, for continuously differentiable paths, the signature kernel satisfies a Goursat problem for a hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE) in two independent time variables. While finite difference methods have been explored for this PDE, they face limitations in accuracy and stability when handling highly oscillatory inputs. In this work, we introduce two advanced numerical schemes that leverage polynomial representations of boundary conditions through either approximation or interpolation techniques, and rigorously establish the theoretical convergence of the polynomial approximation scheme. Experimental evaluations reveal that our approaches yield improvements of several orders of magnitude in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) compared to traditional finite difference schemes, without increasing computational complexity. Furthermore, like finite difference methods, our algorithms can be GPU-parallelized to reduce computational complexity from quadratic to linear in the length of the input sequences, thereby improving scalability for high-frequency data. We have implemented these algorithms in a dedicated Python library, which is publicly available at: https://github.com/FrancescoPiatti/polysigkernel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate critical quasilinear elliptic partial differential equations on a complete Riemannian manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature. By exploiting a new and sharp nonlinear Kato inequality and establishing some Cheng-Yau type gradient estimates for positive solutions, we classify positive solutions to the critical $p$-Laplace equation and show rigidity concerning the ambient manifold. Our results extend and improve some previous conclusions in the literature. Similar results are obtained for solutions to the quasilinear Liouville equation involving the $n$-Laplace operator, where $n$ corresponds to the dimension of the ambient manifold.</description>

Abstract: In an infinite dimensional separable Hilbert space $X$, we study compactness properties and the hypercobtractivity of the realizations of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck evolution operators $P_{s,t}$ in the spaces $L^p(X,\gamma_t)$, $\{\gamma_t\}_{t\in\R}$ being a suitable evolution system of measures for $P_{s,t}$. Moreover we study the asymptotic behavior of $P_{s,t}$. All these results are produced thank to a representation of $P_{s,t}$ through the second quantization operator. Among the examples we consider the transition evolution operator associated to a non-autonomous stochastic parabolic PDE.</description>

Abstract: Given a smooth bounded domain $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$, we study the following anisotropic Neumann problem $$ \begin{cases} -\nabla(a(x)\nabla u)+a(x)u=\lambda a(x) u^{p-1}e^{u^p},\,\,\,\, u&gt;0\,\,\,\,\, \textrm{in}\,\,\,\,\, \Omega,\\[2mm] \frac{\partial u}{\partial\nu}=0\,\, \qquad\quad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad \ \ \ \ \,\qquad\quad\, \textrm{on}\,\,\, \partial\Omega, \end{cases} $$ where $\lambda&gt;0$ is a small parameter, $0&lt;p&lt;2$, $a(x)$ is a positive smooth function over $\overline{\Omega}$ and $\nu$ denotes the outer unit normal vector to $\partial\Omega$. Under suitable assumptions on anisotropic coefficient $a(x)$, we construct solutions of this problem with arbitrarily many mixed interior and boundary bubbles which concentrate at totally different strict local maximum or minimal boundary points of $a(x)$ restricted to $\partial\Omega$, or accumulate to the same strict local maximum boundary point of $a(x)$ over $\overline{\Omega}$ as $\lambda\rightarrow0$.</description>

Abstract: We consider the parabolic-parabolic Keller-Segel equation in the plane and prove the nonlinear exponential stability of the self-similar profile in a quasi parabolic-elliptic regime. We first perform a perturbation argument in order to obtain exponential stability for the semigroup associated to part of the first component of the linearized operator, by exploiting the exponential stability of the linearized operator for the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel equation. We finally employ a purely semigroup analysis to prove linear, and then nonlinear, exponential stability of the system in appropriated functional spaces.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the Euler equations in a stably stratified ocean in isopycnal coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13263v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is concerned with the well-posedness of the incompressible Euler equations describing a stably stratified ocean, reformulated in isopycnal coordinates. Our motivation for using this reformulation is twofold: first, its quasi-2D structure renders some parts of the analysis easier. Second, it closes a gap between the analysis performed in the paper by Bianchini and Duch{\^e}ne in 2022 in isopycnal coordinates, with shear velocity but with a regularizing term, and the analysis performed in the paper by Desjardins, Lannes, Saut in 2020 in Eulerian coordinates, without any regularizing term but without shear velocity. Our main result is a local well-posedness result in Sobolev spaces on the system in isopycnal coordinates, with shear velocity, without any regularizing term. The time of existence that we obtain is uniform with respect to the size $\epsilon$ of the perturbation, and boils down to the large time $1/\epsilon$ with the assumptions of the paper by Desjardins, Lannes, Saut in 2020. With additional assumptions, it is also uniform in the shallow-water parameter. The main difficulty consists in transposing to the isopycnal reformulation the symmetric structure of the system which is more straightforward in Eulerian coordinates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations on the circle, without external parameters, admits plenty of almost periodic solutions. Indeed, we prove that arbitrarily close to most of the finite dimensional KAM tori constructed by Kuksin--Poschel in 1996, there exist infinite dimensional non resonant Kronecker tori, i.e. rotational invariant tori. This result answers a natural and longstanding question, well identified by the Hamiltonian PDE community since the first KAM-type result for PDEs by Kuksin in 1987.</description>
