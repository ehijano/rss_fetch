      <title>A Non-Renormalization Theorem for Local Functionals in Ghost-Free Vector Field Theories Coupled to Dynamical Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a non-renormalization theorem for a class of ghost-free local functionals describing massive vector field theories coupled to dynamical geometry. Under the assumptions of locality, Lorentz invariance, and validity of the effective field theory expansion below a fixed cutoff, we show that quantum corrections do not generate local operators that renormalize the classical derivative self-interactions responsible for the constraint structure of the theory. The proof combines an operator-level analysis of the space of allowed local counterterms with a systematic decoupling-limit argument, which isolates the leading contributions to the effective action at each order in the derivative expansion. As a consequence, all radiatively induced local functionals necessarily involve additional derivatives per field and are suppressed by the intrinsic strong-coupling scales of the theory. In particular, the classical interactions defining ghost-free vector field theories are stable under renormalization, and any additional degrees of freedom arising from quantum corrections appear only above the effective field theory cutoff. This result extends known non-renormalization properties of flat-space vector theories to the case of dynamical geometry and provides a structural explanation for their perturbative stability to all loop orders.</description>

      <title>Algebras of distributions suitable for phase-space quantum mechanics. I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The twisted product of functions on $R^{2N}$ is extended to a $*$-algebra of tempered distributions which contains the rapidly decreasing smooth functions, the distributions of compact support, and all polynomials, and moreover is invariant under the Fourier transformation. The regularity properties of the twisted product are investigated. A matrix presentation of the twisted product is given, with respect to an appropriate orthonormal basis, which is used to construct a family of Banach algebras under this product.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Square roots of complexified (complex) quaternions, namely, the Hamilton quaternion, coquaternion, nectorine, and conectorine are investigated. The isomorphisms between the complex quaternions and 3-dimensional multivectors of Clifford algebras is employed for this purpose. Root examples for all named quaternions are presented from which follows that the complex quaternionic roots may assume discrete or continuous form, or there may be no roots at all.</description>

      <title>Conservation laws and exact solutions of a nonlinear acoustics equation by classical symmetry reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetries and conservation laws are studied for a generalized Westervelt equation which is a nonlinear partial differential equation modelling the propagation of sound waves in a compressible medium. This nonlinear wave equation is widely used in nonlinear acoustics and it is especially important in biomedical applications such as ultra-sound imaging in human tissue. Modern methods are applied to uncover point symmetries and conservation laws that can lead to useful developments concerning solutions and their properties. A complete classification of point symmetries is shown for the arbitrary function. Local low-order conservation laws related to net mass of sound waves are obtained by the multiplier method. Two potential systems are derived yielding potential symmetries and nonlocal conservation laws. For the physical case interesting for this equation, travelling wave solutions are studied leading to shock waves.</description>

      <title>Application of the theory of C*-algebras to the emergence of hydrodynamics in quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Ph.D. thesis reports on progress in rigorously establishing hydrodynamic principles from the microscopic Hamiltonian dynamics of quantum many-body systems in a general, non-model-specific manner. Using the C*-algebra framework of statistical mechanics, we treat systems directly in the thermodynamic limit, primarily focusing on quantum lattice models where tools such as Lieb-Robinson bounds yield rigorous statements. We thus provide a proof-of-principle that large-scale behaviours can indeed be seen as emerging from microscopic dynamics, with mathematical proof. We first report on ergodicity results in short-range models with exponentially decaying or finite-range interactions. We show that time-averaged observables converge to their ensemble averages and decorrelate from all other observables almost everywhere within the light-cone defined by Lieb-Robinson bounds. This relaxation property indicates the loss of information at large scales, from which we prove a Boltzmann-Gibbs principle: at the Euler scaling limit of large time and distance, observables project onto hydrodynamic modes (extensive conserved quantities), within correlation functions. These results hold independently of microscopic details, capturing the physical idea that such details are lost at large space-time scales. Regarding finer scales of hydrodynamics, we discuss rigorous lower bounds on the strength of diffusion. We establish a general result on the clustering of n-th order connected correlations within C* dynamical systems. These results are applied to obtain a strictly positive lower bound on the diffusion constant of chaotic open quantum spin chains with nearest-neighbor interactions. This thesis underlines the universality of hydrodynamic principles, provides a framework for establishing them rigorously, and sets the stage for future progress toward the goal of proving the hydrodynamic equations.</description>

      <title>Upper and Lower Bounds for The Quantum Dynamics of One-Dimensional Divergence-Type Random Jacobi Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantum transport for the discrete one-dimensional random Jacobi operator of divergence-gradient type. For strictly positive and bounded random variables, we analyze the q-moments of the position operator and establish both upper and lower power-law bounds on their growth. Our approach relies on the asymptotic behavior of the integrated density of states and the Lyapunov exponent near the critical energy 0, previously obtained by Pastur and Figotin. A key ingredient in our analysis is the large deviation-type estimates explored via the phase formalism, which play a central role in deriving bounds on the growth of the transfer matrices.</description>

      <title>Zero-Point Energy of a Scalar Field in $q$-Deformed Euclidean Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the energy of a scalar field in its ground state within $q$-deformed Euclidean space. Specifically, we compute the total vacuum energy of the entire $q$-deformed Euclidean space, originating from the scalar field's ground-state energy. Our results show that, for a massless scalar field, the total vacuum energy vanishes. In contrast, when evaluating the average ground-state energy over finite, localized regions of the $q$-deformed Euclidean space, we find that the vacuum energy density can assume significant values.</description>

      <title>A universal sum over topologies in 3d gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the sum over topologies in AdS$_3$ quantum gravity and its relationship with the statistical interpretation of the boundary theory. We formulate a statistical version of the conformal bootstrap that systematizes the universal statistical properties of high-energy CFT$_2$ data. We identify a series of surgery moves on bulk manifolds that precisely reflect the requirements of typicality and crossing symmetry of the boundary ensemble. These surgery moves generate a large number of bulk manifolds that have to be included in any reasonable definition of the gravitational path integral. We show that this procedure generates only on-shell (hyperbolic) manifolds, although it does not produce all of them. These proofs rely on structure theorems of 3-manifolds, which non-trivially interact with the requirements of the statistical boundary ensemble. We illustrate the application of this procedure with many examples, such as Euclidean wormholes, twisted $I$-bundles and handlebody-knots. Our findings reveal a large space of possible choices of which manifolds can be included in the gravitational path integral, reflecting a wide range of possible statistical ensembles consistent with crossing symmetry and typicality.</description>

      <title>Generalized junction conditions for discontinuous metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the Darmois-Israel junction formalism is extended to the case of discontinuous metrics within the framework of Colombeau algebras of generalized functions. This formulation provides a mathematically consistent treatment of nonlinear operations involving singular quantities, such as products and derivatives of distributions. By relaxing the usual continuity condition on the metric, the generalized junction conditions naturally include higher-order singular terms in the curvature and in the surface energy-momentum tensor. These additional contributions represent new geometric degrees of freedom associated with genuine discontinuities in the space-time geometry. The resulting formalism recovers the traditional Darmois-Israel conditions as a limiting case, while offering a coherent extension applicable to geometric boundaries and abrupt transitions in space-time.</description>

      <title>A Scattering Transform for Noncommutative Instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a detailed and mathematically rigorous analysis of the path integrals of chiral fermions supported on holomorphic curves on $T^* \mathbb{C}$ in a general noncommutative instanton background. It is shown that such path integrals can be interpreted as computing instanton analogs of matrix coefficients of monopole scattering matrices. Generalizing the known relation between monopole scattering matrices and $R$-matrices of (shifted) Yangians $\mathsf{Y}(\mathfrak{gl}_r)$, our formalism gives rise to a novel geometric method to calculate $R$-matrices of (shifted) affine Yangians $\mathsf{Y}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_r)$. This may also be viewed as an explicit description of double affine Grassmannian slices by $\infty \times \infty$ matrices, compatible with factorization. Our approach unifies a number of earlier results in the literature, and also leads to interesting new results and conjectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides an introduction to non-abelian Hodge theory and moduli spaces of Higgs bundles on compact Riemann surfaces. We develop the moduli theory of vector bundles and Higgs bundles, establish the main correspondences of non-abelian Hodge theory, and interpret them through the hyperk\"ahler structure on the Hitchin moduli space. We study the Hitchin fibration and its geometric properties, including SYZ mirror symmetry and topological mirror symmetry for type $\mathsf{A}$ Hitchin systems. As an illustration, we compute the Poincar\'e polynomial of the rank 2 moduli space and verify topological mirror symmetry in this case.</description>

      <title>A Structure-Preserving Penalization Method for the Single-species Rosenbluth-Fokker-Planck Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Rosenbluth-Fokker-Planck (RFP) equation describes Coulomb collisional dynamics within and across species in plasmas. It belongs to the broader class of anisotropic-diffusion-advection equations, whose numerical approximation is highly-nontrivial due to its nonlinearity, stiffness, and structural properties such as conservation and entropy dissipation (hence with the Maxwellian distribution as the equilibrium state). In this paper, we propose a structure-preserving penalization scheme for the stiff, single-species RFP equation. The scheme features three novel components: 1) a novel generalization of the well-known Chang-Cooper discretization for the RFP equation that is equilibrium-preserving and enables positivity while preserving mass, momentum, and energy; 2) an easy-to-invert isotropic variable-coefficient penalization operator to deal with the temporal stiffness without resorting to a fully implicit scheme, borrowing ideas from explicit-implicit-null (EIN) methods, and 3) an adaptive timestepping strategy that preserves the positivity of the full penalized scheme. The resulting scheme conserves mass, momentum, and energy strictly, is unconditionally stable, and robustly positivity preserving. The scheme is demonstrated with linear and nonlinear anisotropic diffusion examples of increasing complexity, including several single-species RFP examples.</description>

      <title>A Nonlinear Mechanism for Transient Anomalous Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion is a fundamental physical phenomenon with critical applications in fields such as metallurgy, cell biology, and population dynamics. While standard diffusion is well-understood, anomalous diffusion often requires complex non-local models. This paper investigates a nonlinear diffusion equation where the diffusion coefficient is linearly dependent on concentration. We demonstrate through a perturbative analysis that this physically-grounded model exhibits transient anomalous diffusion. The system displays a clear crossover from an initial subdiffusive regime to standard Fickian behavior at long times. This result establishes an important mechanism for trasient anomalous diffusion that arises purely from local interactions, providing an intuitive alternative to models based on fractional calculus or non-local memory effects.</description>

      <title>Global Existence for General Systems of Isentropic Gas Dynamics via a Weighted Pressure Perturbation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes the global existence of bounded entropy solutions to the one-dimensional system of isentropic gas dynamics with general pressure laws, allowing for the presence of vacuum states. We introduce a novel regularization scheme based on a weighted pressure perturbation of the form $\tilde{P}(\rho,\delta) = \int_\delta^\rho s^{-2}(s^2P'(s) - \delta^2 P'(\delta)) \, ds$. Unlike previous methods that modify the continuity equation, our approach strictly preserves mass conservation while creating a degenerate hyperbolic boundary at the cut-off density $\rho=\delta$. We provide a rigorous derivation of the eigenstructure and Riemann invariants for the perturbed system. A key theoretical contribution is the proof that the perturbed pressure exactly inherits the convexity properties of the original state equation ($2\tilde{P}'+\rho\tilde{P}'' = 2P'+\rho P''$), thereby ensuring the strict convexity of the mechanical energy entropy without additional assumptions. Using the method of vanishing viscosity, we derive uniform $L^\infty$ bounds via invariant regions and establish the $H^{-1}_{\mathrm{loc}}$ compactness of entropy dissipation measures. The global existence for the vacuum-free limit is then proved using the theory of compensated compactness and singular perturbation analysis of the entropy equations.</description>

      <title>Phase-Textured Complex Viscosity in Linear Viscous Flows: Non-Normality Without Advection, Corner Defects, and 3D Mode Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider time-harmonic incompressible flow with a spatially resolved complex viscosity field $\mu^*(\mathbf{x},\omega)$ and, at fixed forcing frequency $\omega&gt;0$, its constitutive phase texture $\varphi(\mathbf{x})=\arg\mu^*(\mathbf{x},\omega)$. In three-dimensional domains periodic in a spanwise direction $z$, $z$-dependence of $\mu^*$ converts coefficient multiplication into convolution in spanwise Fourier index, yielding an operator-valued Toeplitz/Laurent coupling of modes. Consequently, even spanwise-uniform forcing generically produces $\kappa\neq 0$ sidebands in the harmonic response as a \emph{linear, constitutive} effect.
  We place $\mu^*$ at the closure level $\hat{\boldsymbol{\tau}}=2\,\mu^*(\mathbf{x},\omega)\mathbf{D}(\hat{\mathbf{v}})$, as the boundary value of the Laplace transform of a causal stress-memory kernel. Under the passivity condition $\Re\mu^*(\mathbf{x},\omega)\ge \mu_{\min}&gt;0$, the oscillatory Stokes/Oseen operators are realized as m-sectorial operators associated with coercive sectorial forms on bounded Lipschitz (including cornered) domains, yielding existence, uniqueness, and frequency-dependent stability bounds.
  Spatial variation of $\varphi$ renders the viscous operator intrinsically non-normal even in the absence of advection, so amplification is governed by resolvent geometry (and associated pseudospectra), not by eigenvalues alone. In the pure-phase class $\mu^*(\mathbf{x},\omega)=\mu_0(\omega)e^{i\varphi(\mathbf{x})}$, the texture strength is quantified by $\mu_0(\omega)\|\nabla\varphi\|_{L^\infty}$.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Scattering by a Cluster of Hybrid Dielectric-Plasmonic Dimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider time-harmonic electromagnetic scattering by a cluster of hybrid dielectric-plasmonic dimers in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Each dimer consists of a high-contrast dielectric nanoparticle and a moderately contrasting plasmonic nanoparticle separated by a subwavelength distance. The cluster is assumed to contain many such dimers whose size $a$ is small compared to the wavelength, with intra-dimer and inter-dimer distances scaling like $a^{t_1}$ and $a^{t_2}$, and the frequency is tuned near suitable electric and magnetic resonances of the associated Newtonian and magnetization operators on the reference shapes.
  Under these geometric, contrast and spectral assumptions, we derive a Foldy--Lax type approximation for the Maxwell system. We show that the scattered field and its far field admit asymptotic expansions in terms of four moments attached to each dimer, which solve an explicit finite-dimensional linear system. We prove invertibility of this system under quantitative smallness conditions on the contrast and the dimer density, and we obtain error estimates uniform in the number of dimers.
  By extracting the dominant components, we further show that each hybrid dimer behaves, at leading order, as a co-located electric and magnetic dipole driven by the local fields, and we identify the corresponding $6\times 6$ polarizability matrix. This provides a discrete model for clusters of hybrid dimers that is suitable for fast forward simulations, inverse schemes, and as input for effective-medium descriptions. In particular, it suggests parameter regimes where clusters of hybrid dimers can generate (double) negative effective permittivity and permeability and bi-anisotropic constitutive laws and eventually hyperbolic media.</description>

      <title>A multi-mesh adaptive finite element method for solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is found that the wave functions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) often vary significantly in different spatial regions, with some components exhibiting sharp variations while others remain smooth. Solving the GPE on a single mesh, even with adaptive refinement, can lead to excessive computational costs due to the need to accommodate the most oscillatory solution. To address this issue, we present a multi-mesh adaptive finite element method for solving the GPE. To this end, we first convert it into a time-dependent equation through the imaginary time propagation method. Then the equation is discretized by the backward Euler method temporally and the multi-mesh adaptive finite element method spatially. The proposed method is compared with the single-mesh adaptive method through a series of numerical experiments, which demonstrate that the multi-mesh adaptive method can achieve the same numerical accuracy with less computational consumption.</description>

      <title>Geometry is Wavy: Curvature Wave Equations for Generic Affine Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometry is wavy: even at the purely geometric level (no particular theory chosen), curvature satisfies a covariant quasilinear wave equation. In Riemannian geometry equipped with the Levi-Civita connection, the Riemann curvature tensor obeys a wave equation of the schematic form \[ \Box Riem=\mathcal{Q}(Riem,Riem), \] where $\mathcal{Q}(Riem,Riem)$ denotes the terms quadratic in the curvature arising from the Bianchi identities. In this work, we generalize this curvature wave equation to spacetimes endowed with a generic affine connection possessing torsion and nonmetricity. Working within the metric-affine framework, we derive the corresponding wave equation for the Riemann tensor and analyze its structure in several geometrically and physically distinguished settings, including Einstein spaces, teleparallel gravity, and Einstein-Cartan theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reconsider the detailed structure of the topological character of the instantons in pure Yang-Mills theory on $S^1\times\mathbb{R}^3$, so-called calorons. The claim is that the standard formula for the topological character, the second Chern number, requires some modification through analytic consideration. For concreteness, we explicitly calculate the second Chern number of the gauge configuration of the Harrington-Shepard type with unit topological charge of the gauge group $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ in several gauges. The genuine formula is shown to be applicable even though the gauge connection is in singular gauge. The gauge dependence of the magnetic charge is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Non-local singular perturbations of non-convex functionals -- recent results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Singular perturbations have been used to select solutions of (non-convex) variational problems with a multiplicity of minimizers. The prototype of such an approach is the gradient theory of phase transitions by L. Modica, who specialized some earlier Gamma-convergence results by himself and S. Mortola contained in a seminal paper, validating the so-called minimal-interface criterion. I will give an overview of some recent results on perturbations with fractional and higher-order seminorms both in the framework of phase transitions and of free-discontinuity problems, relating these results with the Bourgain-Brezis-Mironescu and Maz'ya-Shaposhnikova limit analysis for fractional Sobolev seminorms, and with the theory of Gamma-expansions.</description>

      <title>On Globalization Problem of Multi-Hamiltonian Formalisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The globalization problem arises when local tensor fields possess a given property (such as being symplectic or Poisson) but cannot be consistently extended to a global object due to incompatibilities on chart overlaps. A notable instance occurs in locally conformal analysis, where local representatives coincide only up to conformal factors. The locally conformal approach not only enables the definition of novel and rich geometric structures but also provides Hamiltonian formulations for irreversible systems, yielding physically meaningful dynamical consequences. While extensively studied for symplectic, cosymplectic, and Poisson geometries, its systematic extension to multi-Hamiltonian settings remains largely unexplored.
  In this work, we investigate locally conformally Nambu--Poisson and locally conformally generalized Poisson manifolds, showing that these structures naturally induce Nambu--Jacobi and generalized Jacobi manifolds, respectively. From a dynamical point of view, we construct Hamiltonian-type evolution equations, and for locally conformal $3$-Nambu structures, we introduce locally conformal bi-Hamiltonian systems. The resulting dynamics are particularly suitable for modeling irreversible multi-Hamiltonian processes, as they generally do not preserve the system's energy.
  Collectively, this work provides a unified framework for understanding both the geometric structures and Hamiltonian dynamics of classical, Nambu--Poisson, and generalized Poisson manifolds within a locally conformal context.</description>

      <title>Phase-sensitive superposition of quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the principle of superposition lies at the heart of quantum mechanics and is the root of almost all quantum phenomena such as coherence and entanglement, its quantification, except for that related to the resource theory of coherence and interference, remains relatively less studied. In this work, we address quantification of superposition from an information-theoretic perspective. We introduce a family of quantifiers of superposition, the phase-sensitive superposition, by taking into account the phases of amplitudes in the superposition of a fixed basis states (e.g., computational basis states). We establish a conservation relation for the phase-sensitive superposition, which is a kind of complementary relation and is reminiscent of wave-particle duality. We evaluate explicitly the second moment of phase-sensitive superposition and show that it is intrinsically related to the $l^2$-norm coherence. We characterize the dephasing channel induced by the maximally superposed states. We investigate the minimum and maximum superpositions, reveal their basic properties, and illustrate them through various examples. We further explore the dynamics of superposition in the Grover search algorithm, and demonstrate a complementary relation between superposition and success probability of the search algorithm. These results and quantifiers offer tools for analyzing structural features and implications of quantum superposition.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ferromagnetic Ising model on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $\mathbb{G}(n,m)$ with bounded average degree $d=2m/n$. Specifically, we determine the limiting distribution of $\log Z_{\mathbb{G}(n,m)}(\beta,B)$, where $Z_{\mathbb{G}(n,m)}(\beta,B)$ is the partition function at inverse temperature $\beta&gt;0$ and external field $B\geq0$.
  If either $B&gt;0$, or $B=0$, $d&gt;1$ and $\beta&gt;\operatorname{ath}(1/d)$ the limiting distribution is a Gaussian whose variance is of order $\Theta(n)$ and is described by a family of stochastic fixed point problems that encode the root magnetisation of two correlated Galton-Watson trees. By contrast, if $B=0$ and either $d\leq1$ or $\beta&lt;\operatorname{ath}(1/d)$ the limiting distribution is an infinite sum of independent random variables and has bounded variance.</description>

      <title>A Sharp Universality Dichotomy for the Free Energy of Spherical Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the free energy for pure and mixed spherical $p$-spin models with i.i.d.\ disorder. In the mixed case, each $p$-interaction layer is assumed either to have regularly varying tails with exponent $\alpha_p$ or to satisfy a finite $2p$-th moment condition.
  For the pure spherical $p$-spin model with regularly varying disorder of tail index $\alpha$, we introduce a tail-adapted normalization that interpolates between the classical Gaussian scaling and the extreme-value scale, and we prove a sharp universality dichotomy for the quenched free energy. In the subcritical regime $\alpha&lt;2p$, the thermodynamics is driven by finitely many extremal couplings and the free energy converges to a non-degenerate random limit described by the NIM (non-intersecting monomial) model, depending only on extreme-order statistics. At the critical exponent $\alpha=2p$, we obtain a random one-dimensional TAP-type variational formula capturing the coexistence of an extremal spike and a universal Gaussian bulk on spherical slices. In the supercritical regime $\alpha&gt;2p$ (more generally, under a finite $2p$-th moment assumption), the free energy is universal and agrees with the deterministic Crisanti--Sommers/Parisi value of the corresponding Gaussian model, as established in [Sawhney-Sellke'24].
  We then extend the subcritical and critical results to mixed spherical models in which each $p$-layer is either heavy-tailed with $\alpha_p\le 2p$ or has finite $2p$-th moment. In particular, we derive a TAP-type variational representation for the mixed model, yielding a unified universality classification of the quenched free energy across tail exponents and mixtures.</description>

      <title>On theta function expressions of cyclic products of fermion correlation functions in genus two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In arXiv:2211.09069, significant progress was made in decomposing simple products of fermion correlation functions, and in summing over spin structures of superstring amplitudes in genus two under cyclic constraints. In this manuscript we consider part of the same subject using a framework in which one of the branch points of the genus two curve is fixed at infinity. This framework is a direct generalization of the popular one in the case of genus one. We address some of the issues that remained unresolved in our previous paper arXiv:2209.14633. We show that the spin structures of the simple products of fermion correlation functions with cyclic conditions depend only on the Pe-function values at the half-periods of the genus two surface, for any number of factors in the products. Similar to the genus one case, we can provide basis functions to decompose the product. Consequently, the trilinear relations found in arXiv:2211.09069 can be derived from the known set of differential equations of genus two Pe-functions by simply setting the variables equal to the half-periods of the non-singular and even spin structures, as is the case for genus one. The focus of this manuscript is on the procedures for expressing the results of decomposed formulae in terms of the unique genus two theta function. At present we cannot provide a procedure for deriving the general form of the decomposed formula totally expressed in terms of the theta functions for an arbitrary number of the fermion correlation functions in the product, by the reason described in the text. We present some general results and demonstrate that concrete expressions of both the spin structure dependent and independent parts will be derived and simplified to analyze using the logic of the derivations of the classical solutions to Jacobi inversion problem and their modifications which will be given in this manuscript.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing functional determinants of differential operators is central to any field-theoretical calculation relying on a saddle-point expansion. A variety of approaches is available for the computation that avoid having to know the eigenspectrum of the operator, and in particular the Gel'fand-Yaglom theorem and the Green's function method. In this note, we show how both approaches can be constructed using a contour integral argument and conclude that these are completely equivalent for computing ratios of determinants of one-dimensional operators. Furthermore, we comment on the presence of vanishing as well as negative eigenvalues and show how the Green's function method provides a natural prescription for handling them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the phase diagram of a Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model where the couplings are forced to thermalize at different time scales. Besides being a challenging generalization of the SK model, such settings may arise naturally in physics whenever part of the many degrees of freedom of a system relaxes to equilibrium considerably faster than the others. For this model we compute the asymptotic value of the second moment of the overlap distribution. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous sufficient condition for an annealed solution to hold, identifying a high temperature, or weak coupling, region. In addition, we also prove that for sufficiently strong couplings the solution must present a number of replica symmetry breaking levels at least equal to the number of time scales already present in the multiscale model. Finally, we give a sufficient condition for the existence of gaps in the support of the functional order parameters.</description>

      <title>Hidden symmetries, hidden conservation laws and exact solutions of dispersionless Nyzhnyk equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among Lie submodels of the (real symmetric potential) dispersionless Nyzhnyk equation, we single out a remarkable submodel as such that, despite being the only one, is associated with a family of in general inequivalent one-dimensional subalgebras of the maximal Lie invariance algebra of this equation, which are parameterized by an arbitrary function of the time variable. The large family of invariant solutions of the dispersionless Nyzhnyk equation that are related to the above submodel is expressed in terms of an arbitrary function of the time variable and the double quadrature of the well-known (implicit) general solution of the inviscid Burgers equation with respect to a space-like submodel invariant variable. The singled out submodel possesses many other interesting properties. In particular, we show that it is Lie-remarkable, and its maximal Lie invariance algebra completely defines its point symmetry pseudogroup, which provides the second but simpler example of the latter phenomenon in literature. Moreover, only hidden Lie symmetries of the dispersionless Nyzhnyk equation that are associated with this submodel are essential for finding its exact solutions. Using Lie reductions, we construct new families of exact solutions of the inviscid Burgers equation and the dispersionless Nyzhnyk equation in closed or parametric form. We also exhaustively described generalized symmetries, cosymmetries and conservation laws of the submodel, which gives the corresponding nonlocal and hidden structures for the inviscid Burgers equation and the dispersionless Nyzhnyk equation, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove equivalence of two integral representations for the wave functions of hyperbolic Calogero-Sutherland system. For this we study two families of Baxter operators related to hyperbolic Calogero-Sutherland and rational Ruijsenaars models; the first one as a limit from hyperbolic Ruijsenaars system, while the second one independently. Besides, computing asymptotics of integral representations and also the value at zero point, we identify them with renormalized Heckman-Opdam $\mathfrak{gl}_n$ hypergeometric function.</description>

      <title>Modeling phononic band gap in microstructured solids using the Riemann-Cartan geometric framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper discusses the modeling of acoustic wave fields in microstructured elastic solids within the framework of Riemann-Cartan geometry. We consider a scenario in which microstructural deformations occur significantly faster than those of the bulk material. This time-scale separation creates apparent geometric incompatibilities at the macroscopic level, even in the absence of permanent inelastic deformation or damage. We formalize this phenomenon by using a non-holonomic frame field to represent macroscopic elastic deformations and an associated torsion field to characterize the resulting geometric incompatibilities. The spatial components of the torsion tensor quantify the instantaneous geometric incompatibility of the macroscopic deformations, while its temporal components capture the inertial effects arising from the reversible energy exchange between the micro- and macro-scales. A key finding is that the model's dispersion relation predicts a complete frequency band gap. Furthermore, the governing equations exhibit a mathematical analogy to Maxwell's equations, potentially bridging the modeling of phononic and photonic metamaterials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.16111v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show almost sure wellposedness of mild solution to the cubic nonlinear wave equation in a weighted Besov space over $\mathbb R^2$. To achieve this, we show that any weak limit of $\phi^4$ measures on increasing tori is invariant under the equation. We review and slightly simplify the periodic theory and the construction of the weak limit measure, and then use finite speed of propagation to reduce the infinite-volume case to the previous setup. Our argument also gives a weaker invariance result on the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in the same setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the transport properties of Schr\"{o}dinger operators on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ with potentials that are periodic in one direction and compactly supported in the other. Such systems are known to produce surface states that are weakly confined near the support of the potential. We demonstrate that surface states exhibit what we describe as directional ballistic transport, characterized by a strong form of ballistic transport along the periodic direction and its absence in the compactly supported one. By showing that the scattering states exhibit ballistic transport, we obtain ballistic transport for a dense subset of all of $\ell^2(\mathbb {Z} ^2)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove dynamical local limits for the singular numbers of $p$-adic random matrix products at both the bulk and edge. The limit object which we construct, the reflecting Poisson sea, may thus be viewed as a $p$-adic analogue of line ensembles appearing in classical random matrix theory. However, in contrast to those it is a discrete space Poisson-type particle system with only local reflection interactions and no obvious determinantal structure. The limits hold for any $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z}_p)$-invariant matrix distributions under weak universality hypotheses, with no spatial rescaling.</description>

      <title>Gradient flow in parameter space is equivalent to linear interpolation in output space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the standard gradient flow in parameter space that underlies many training algorithms in deep learning can be continuously deformed into an adapted gradient flow which yields (constrained) Euclidean gradient flow in output space. Moreover, for the $L^{2}$ loss, if the Jacobian of the outputs with respect to the parameters is full rank (for fixed training data), then the time variable can be reparametrized so that the resulting flow is simply linear interpolation, and a global minimum can be achieved. For the cross-entropy loss, under the same rank condition and assuming the labels have positive components, we derive an explicit formula for the unique global minimum.</description>

      <title>Resolving Verlinde's formula of logarithmic CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Verlinde's formula for rational vertex operator algebras computes the fusion rules from the modular transformations of characters. In the non semisimple and non finite case, a logarithmic Verlinde formula has been proposed together with David Ridout. In this formula one replaces simple modules by their resolutions by standard modules. Here and under certain natural assumptions this conjecture is proven in generality.
  The result is illustrated in the examples of the singlet algebras and of the affine vertex algebra of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at any admissible level, i.e. in particular the Verlinde conjectures in these cases are true. In the latter case it is also explained how to compute the actual fusion rules from knowledge of the Grothendieck ring.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions for unique codings of fat Sierpinski gaskets with multiple digits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an integer $M\ge 1$ and $\beta\in(1, M+1)$, let $S_{\beta, M}$ be the fat Sierpinski gasket in $\mathbb R^2$ generated by the iterated function system $\left\{f_d(x)=\frac{x+d}{\beta}: d\in\Omega_M\right\}$, where $\Omega_M=\{(i,j)\in\mathbb Z_{\ge 0}^2: i+j\le M\}$. Then each $x\in S_{\beta, M}$ may be represented as a series $x=\sum_{i=1}^\infty\frac{d_i}{\beta^i}=:\Pi_\beta((d_i))$, and the infinite sequence $(d_i)\in\Omega_M^{\mathbb N}$ is called a \emph{coding} of $x$. Since $\beta&lt;M+1$, a point in $S_{\beta, M}$ may have multiple codings. Let $U_{\beta, M}$ be the set of $x\in S_{\beta, M}$ having a unique coding, that is \[ U_{\beta, M}=\left\{x\in S_{\beta, M}: \#\Pi_\beta^{-1}(x)=1\right\}. \] When $M=1$, Kong and Li [2020, Nonlinearity] described two critical bases for the phase transitions of the intrinsic univoque set $\widetilde U_{\beta, 1}$, which is a subset of $U_{\beta, 1}$. In this paper we consider $M\ge 2$, and characterize the two critical bases $\beta_G(M)$ and $\beta_c(M)$ for the phase transitions of $U_{\beta, M}$: (i) if $\beta\in(1, \beta_G(M)]$, then $U_{\beta, M}$ is finite; (ii) if $\beta\in(\beta_G(M), \beta_c(M))$ then $U_{\beta, M}$ is countably infinite; (iii) if $\beta=\beta_c(M)$ then $U_{\beta, M}$ is uncountable and has zero Hausdorff dimension; (iv) if $\beta&gt;\beta_c(M)$ then $U_{\beta, M}$ has positive Hausdorff dimension. Our results can also be applied to the intrinsic univoque set $\widetilde{U}_{\beta, M}$. Moreover, we show that the first critical base $\beta_G(M)$ is a Perron number, while the second critical base $\beta_c(M)$ is a transcendental number.</description>

      <title>Mutual Multilinearity of Nonequilibrium Network Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous-time Markov chains have been successful in modelling systems across numerous fields, with currents being fundamental entities that describe the flows of energy, particles, individuals, chemical species, information, or other quantities. They apply to systems described by agents transitioning between vertices along the edges of a network (at some rate in each direction). It has recently been shown by the authors that, at stationarity, a hidden linearity exists between currents that flow along edges: if one controls the current of a specific "input" edge (by tuning transition rates along it), any other current is a linear-affine function of the input current [PRL 133, 047401 (2024)]. In this paper, we extend this result to the situation where one controls the currents of several edges, and prove that other currents are in linear-affine relation with the input ones. Two proofs with distinct insights are provided: the first relies on Kirchhoff's current law and reduces the input set inductively through graph analysis, while the second utilizes the resolvent approach via a Laplace transform in time. We obtain explicit expressions for the current-to-current susceptibilities, which allow one to map current dependencies through the network. We also verify from our expression that Kirchhoff's current law is recovered as a limiting case of our mutual linearity. Last, we uncover that susceptibilities can be obtained from fluctuations when the reference system is originally at equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Quantum Thermal State Preparation via Local Driving: Lindbladian Simulation with Provable Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preparing the thermal density matrix $\rho_{\beta} \propto e^{-\beta H}$ corresponding to a given Hamiltonian $H$ is a task of central interest across quantum many-body physics, and is particularly salient when attempting to study it with quantum computers. Although solved in principle by recent constructions of efficiently simulable Lindblad master equations -- that provably have $\rho_{\beta}$ as a steady state [C.-F.~Chen \emph{et al.}, Nature \textbf{646}, pp.~561--566 (2025)] -- the implementation of these ``exact Gibbs samplers'' requires large-scale quantum computational resources and is hence challenging \emph{in practice} on current or even near-term quantum devices.
  Here, we propose a scheme for approximately simulating an exact Gibbs sampler that only requires the repeated implementation of three readily available ingredients: (a) analog simulation of $H$; (b) strictly local but time-dependent couplings to ancilla qubits; and (c) reset of the ancillas. We give rigorous guarantees on the difference between the fixed point reached by our protocol and the exact thermal state, which only depend on parameters of the protocol and its \emph{mixing time}. The procedure is efficiently implementable on near-term devices if $H$ is local, and the mixing time scales mildly with both system size and protocol parameters. While guaranteeing the latter for Hamiltonians of interest remains an important problem for future work, here we lay the groundwork for developing fully efficient thermal state preparation protocols on quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Oscillator-Qudit Quantum Processors: stabilizer states, stabilizer codes, symplectic operations, and non-commutative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct stabilizer states and error-correcting codes on combinations of discrete- and continuous-variable systems, generalizing the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) quantum lattice formalism. Our framework absorbs the discrete phase space of a qudit into a hybrid phase space parameterizable entirely by the continuous variables of a harmonic oscillator. The unit cell of a hybrid quantum lattice grows with the qudit dimension, yielding a way to simultaneously measure an arbitrarily large range of non-commuting position and momentum displacements. Simple hybrid states can be obtained by applying a conditional displacement to a Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) state and a Pauli eigenstate, or by encoding some of the physical qudits of a stabilizer state into a GKP code. The states' oscillator-qudit entanglement cannot be generated using symplectic (i.e., Gaussian-Clifford) operations, distinguishing them as a resource from tensor products of oscillator and qudit stabilizer states.
  Simple hybrid codes can be thought of as subsystem GKP codes whose gauge factor is entangled with a qudit. Our numerical investigations suggest that such codes can sometimes outperform GKP codes against physical noise, and their decoders can be tuned to accommodate either more qudit or more oscillator errors. We also relate stabilizer codes to non-commutative tori, identifying that a general construction of such tori yields multi-mode multi-qudit extensions of GKP codes. We explicitly calculate these codes' logical dimension and logical operators by utilizing the Morita equivalence between their stabilizer and logical tori. We provide examples using commutation matrices, integer symplectic matrices, and binary codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The local Carroll symmetry of a gravitational wave found in Baldwin-Jeffery-Rosen coordinates is extended to a globally defined one by switching to Brinkmann coordinates. Two independent globally defined solutions of a Sturm-Liouville equation allow us to describe both the symmetries (translations and Carroll boosts) and the geodesic motions. One of them satisfies particular initial conditions which imply zero initial momentum, while the other does not. Pure displacement arises when the latter is turned off by requiring the momentum to vanish and when the wave parameters take, in addition, some particular values which correspond to having an integer half-wave number. The relation to the Schwarzian derivative is highlighted. We illustrate our general statements by the P\"oschl-Teller profile.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic Approach to Bifurcations in Kerr Ring and Fabry-Perot Resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear phenomena such as optical bistability and spontaneous symmetry breaking play a central role in Kerr resonators, and are increasingly exploited in photonic integrated circuits for all-optical information processing. In this work, we present an analytical framework allowing to find the stationary states and their bifurcations for the propagating fields in Kerr ring and Fabry-Perot resonators, which can be generalized to other nonlinear systems. Using tools from nonlinear algebra, namely, polynomial resultants and Groebner bases, we derive compact polynomial expressions describing the system's full solution in both intensity and amplitude representations. The bifurcations follow directly from these expressions, and are additionally characterized as exceptional points of an auxiliary linear non-Hermitian system. Together, these results unify optical bistability and spontaneous symmetry breaking within a single analytical framework, and offer a route toward improved control of nonlinear optical systems, and the design of photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Classifying fusion rules of anyons or SymTFTs: A general algebraic formula for domain wall problems and quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a formula for the transformation law of anyons in topologically ordered phases or topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) through a gapped or symmetry-preserving domain wall. Our formalism is based on the ring homomorphism between the $\mathbb{C}$-linear commutative fusion rings, also known as symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs). The fundamental assumption in our formalism is the validity of the Verlinde formula, applicable to commutative fusion rings. By combining it with more specific data of the settings, our formula provides classifications of anyons compatible with developing categorical formulations. It also provides the massless renormalization group (RG) flows between conformal field theories (CFTs), or a series of measurement-induced quantum phase transitions, in the language of SymTFT, through the established correspondence between CFTs and TQFTs. Moreover, by studying the correspondence between the ideal structure in the massless RG and the module in the related massive RG, one can make the Nambu-Goldstone-type arguments for generalized symmetry. By combining our formula with orbifolding, extension, and similarity transformation, one can get a series of classifications for the corresponding extended models, or symmetry-enriched topological orders and quantum criticalities.</description>

      <title>Improved Lower Bounds for Learning Quantum Channels in Diamond Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04180v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that learning an unknown quantum channel with input dimension $d_A$, output dimension $d_B$, and Choi rank $r$ to diamond distance $\varepsilon$ requires $ \Omega\!\left( \frac{d_A d_B r}{\varepsilon \log(d_B r / \varepsilon)} \right)$ channel queries when $d_A= rd_B$, and $\Omega\!\left( \frac{d_A d_B r}{\varepsilon^2 \log(d_B r / \varepsilon)} \right)$ channel queries when $d_A\le rd_B/2$. These lower bounds improve upon the best previous $\Omega(d_A d_B r)$ bound by introducing explicit $\varepsilon$-dependence, and they are optimal up to logarithmic factors. The proof constructs ensembles of channels that are well separated in diamond norm yet admit Stinespring isometries that are close in operator norm.</description>

      <title>Obstructions to Unitary Hamiltonians in Non-Unitary String-Net Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Levin-Wen string-net formalism provides a canonical mapping from spherical fusion categories to local Hamiltonians defining Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs). While the topological invariance of the ground state is guaranteed by the pentagon identity, the realization of the model on a physical Hilbert space requires the category to be unitary. In this work, we investigate the obstructions arising when this construction is applied to non-unitary spherical categories, specifically the Yang-Lee model (the non-unitary minimal model $\mathcal{M}(2,5)$). We first validate our framework by explicitly constructing and verifying the Hamiltonians for rank-3 ($\text{Rep}(D_3)$), rank-5 ($\text{TY}(\mathbb{Z}_4)$), and Abelian ($\mathbb{Z}_7$) unitary categories. We then apply this machinery to the non-unitary Yang-Lee model. Using a custom gradient-descent optimization algorithm on the manifold of $F$-symbols, we demonstrate that the Yang-Lee fusion rules admit no unitary solution to the pentagon equations. We explain this failure analytically by proving that negative quantum dimensions impose an indefinite metric on the string-net space, realizing a Krein space rather than a Hilbert space. Finally, we invoke the theory of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum mechanics to interpret the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, establishing that the obstruction is intrinsic to the fusion ring and cannot be removed by unitary gauge transformations.</description>
