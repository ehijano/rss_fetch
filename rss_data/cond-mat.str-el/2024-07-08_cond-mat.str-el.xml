      <title>Mechanism of magnetic phase transition in correlated magnetic metal: insight into itinerant ferromagnet Fe$_{3-\delta}$GeTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing a comprehensive magnetic theory of correlated itinerant magnets is a challenging task due to the difficulty in reconciling both local moments and itinerant electrons. In this work, we investigate the microscopic process of magnetic phase transition in ferromagnet metal Fe$_{3-\delta}$GeTe$_2$. A new paradigm is proposed to describe the magnetic phase transition in correlated metallic ferromagnets, where Hund's coupling dominates the spectral weight transfer between different spin channels, rather than spin-splitting as described by the Stoner model. We recognize that our theory should be universal for itinerant magnets. Additionally, we reveal an efficient way to achieve novel quantum states from various competing orders in multi-site crystal structures. Our research shows that Fe1 are proximate to Mott physics, while Fe2 exhibit Hund physics due to their distinct atomic environments. These competing orders work together to produce heavy fermion behavior within ferromagnetic long-range order through well-defined quasiparticle bands, which are promoted by Hund's coupling and further hybridized with relative itinerant bands. The complex interactions of competing orders drive correlated magnetic metal to a new frontier for discovering outstanding quantum states and exotic phenomena in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism in Heavy Fermion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel collinear magnet, the altermagnet (AM) with spin-splitting energy band and zero net magnetization have attracted great interest due to its potential spintronic applications. Here, we demonstrate AM-like phases in a microscopic Kondo lattice model, widely used for heavy fermion compounds. With the framework of fermionic parton mean-field theory, we find the $d$-wave AM state can coexist with the intrinsic Kondo screening effect in such itinerant-local electron system if an alternating next-nearest-neighbor-hopping (NNNH) is included. Such alternating NNNH take nonmagnetic atoms, neglected in usual antiferromagnetism study, into account when encountering real-life candidate AM materials. The AM-like states are characterized by their spin-splitting quasiparticle bands, Fermi surface, spin-resolved distribution function and conductivity. It is suggested that the magnetic quantum oscillation and charge transport measurement can detect those AM-like phases. We hope the present work may be useful for exploring AM-like phases in $f$-electron compounds.</description>

      <title>Quantum Supercriticality in the Ising Model and Rydberg Atom Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supercriticality, featured with universal scaling behaviors, emerges as an intriguing phenomenon proximate to the classical liquid-gas critical point. In this study, we extend this significant concept to quantum many-body systems near the quantum critical point (QCP), employing tensor network calculations and scaling analyses of the Ising model and Rydberg atom array. The supercritical, fluid-like, quantum states are found to be strongly fluctuating and highly entangled, as characterized by the universal scalings in susceptibility $\chi_z \sim (h_x-h_x^c)^{-\gamma}$, correlation length $\xi \sim (h_x-h_x^c)^{-\nu}$, fidelity susceptibility $\chi_F \sim (h_x - h_x^c)^{d\nu - 2}$, and entanglement entropy $S_{\rm E} \sim \ln{(h_x - h_x^c)}$. Here, $\gamma$ and $\nu$ represent critical exponents, $d$ is the dimension of the system, and $h_x^c$ is the critical transverse field of the Ising QCP. The universal scaling behaviors are revealed in the regime enclosed by two quantum supercritical crossover lines in the longitudinal-transverse field ($h_z$-$h_x$) plane, $|h_z| \propto (h_x - h_x^c)^{\beta + \gamma}$ relating to critical exponents $\beta$ and $\gamma$, where the response functions, measures of entanglement, and fidelity susceptibility reach their maxima. We propose that Rydberg atom arrays and quantum Ising magnets provide available platforms for exploring emergent supercritical phenomena and identifying the universal scalings. The present work establishes a foundation for exploring quantum supercriticality in magnetic systems and through quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a Fermi-surface in the current-driven Hidden state of 1T-TaS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of the metallic metastable state in 1T-TaS2. Using microARPES, we measure the spatially-dependent modifications of the electronic structure of the sample following a short current pulse. We observe that, in some regions of the sample, a Fermi surface emerges, while other regions remain gapped. A detailed study of the band structure in these different regions suggests that the metallic parts are in a state similar to the nearly commensurate charge density wave (NC-CDW) state, where the gaps are suppressed and a band crosses the Fermi level. Furthermore, we find that the metallic and insulating regions of the sample exhibit different dispersions normal to the planes. This observation is consistent with a scenario in which the current pulse breaks the star-of-David dimers present in the commensurate charge density wave (C-CDW) state.</description>

      <title>Exploring the role of nonlocal Coulomb interactions in perovskite transition metal oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing the density functional theory incorporating on-site and inter-site Coulomb interactions (DFT+U+V), we have investigated the role of the nonlocal interactions on the electronic structures of the transition metal oxide perovskites. Using constrained random phase approximation calculations, we derived screened Coulomb interaction parameters and revealed a competition between localization and screening effects, which results in nonmonotonic behavior with d-orbital occupation. We highlight the significant role and nonlocality of inter-site Coulomb interactions, V, comparable in magnitude to the local interaction, U. Our DFT+U+V results exemplarily show the representative band renormalization, and deviations from ideal extended Hubbard models due to increased hybridization between transition metal d and oxygen p orbitals as occupation increases. We further demonstrate that the inclusion of the inter-site V is essential for accurately reproducing the experimental magnetic order in transition metal oxides.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Fractional Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) have attracted intensive attention for the realization of fractional quantum Hall states in the absence of an external magnetic field. Most of FCIs have been proposed on two-dimensional (2D) Euclidean lattice models with various boundary conditions. In this work, we investigate hyperbolic FCIs which are constructed in hyperbolic geometry with constant negative curvature. Through the studies on hyperbolic analogs of kagome lattices with hard-core bosons loaded into topological flat bands, we find convincing numerical evidences of two types of $\nu=1/2$ FCI states, {\emph {i.e.}}, the conventional and unconventional FCIs. Multiple branches of edge excitations and geometry-dependent wave functions for both conventional and unconventional $\nu=1/2$ FCI states are revealed, however, the geometric degree of freedom in these FCIs plays various roles. Additionally, a center-localized orbital plays a crucial role in the unconventional FCI state.</description>

      <title>Spin liquid state in an emergent honeycomb lattice antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In rare-earth-based frustrated magnets, the synergistic interplay between spin correlations, spin-orbit coupling and competing exchange interactions provide a promising route to realize exotic quantum states with nontrivial excitations. Here, through thermodynamic and local-probe measurements down to 16 mK, we demonstrate the exotic magnetism and spin dynamics in the nearly perfect emergent honeycomb lattice antiferromagnet TbBO3. The latter embodies a frustrated lattice with a superimposed triangular lattice, constituted by additional Tb3+ ions at the center of each hexagon. Thermodynamic experiments reveal the presence of dominant antiferromagnetic interactions with no indications of either long-range order or spin freezing down to 50 mK. Despite sizable antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between the Tb3+ moments, muon-spin relaxation does not detect any signatures of long-range magnetic order or spin-freezing down to 16 mK. This suggests that the spin-orbit-driven anisotropic exchange interaction engenders a strong frustration, crucial to induce persistent spin dynamics. The specific-heat data exhibit a T^2.2 power-law behavior at low temperatures, suggesting gapless excitations consistent with theoretical predictions. The scaling of muon relaxation rate as a function of the characteristic energy scale for several spin-liquid candidates, including TbBO3, demonstrates a thermally activated behavior. This is consistent with NMR results on TbBO3 and reminiscent of a universal QSL behavior, here attributed to short-range spin correlations. Our experimental results are supported by density functional theory + Hubbard U and crystal electric-field calculations, which propose TbBO3 as a promising platform to realize the theoretically proposed quantum disorder state in an anisotropy-driven frustrated honeycomb lattice.</description>

      <title>Effect of nonmagnetic Ti substitution on the structural, magnetic and transport properties in pyrochlore iridate Eu2(Ir1-xTix)2O7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the effect of nonmagnetic Ti substitution Eu2(Ir1-xTix)2O7 with the help of electrical transport and magnetic measurement. The minor structural modification enhances the orbital overlapping and favours its electrical transport properties with Ti doping though the tuning of SOC and U with site dilution opposes it. As a result, metal insulator transition (MIT) is disappeared and resistivity of the system throughout the temperature increases with Ti doping. The nature of the conduction mechanism at low temperature follows power law like variation. As the Ti4+ is nonmagnetic, the introduction of Ti at Ir site dilutes the magnetic interaction at Ir octahedral network, which in turn decreases the magnetic moment and magnetic frustration in the system though the magnetic irreversibility temperature is hardly affected by Ti.</description>

      <title>Unveiling nonmagnetic phase and many-body entanglement in two-dimensional random quantum magnets Sr$_2$CuTe$_{1-x}$W$_x$O$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply a random-plaquette $J_1$-$J_2$ model on the square lattice to capture the physics of a series of spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet compounds Sr$_2$CuTe$_{1-x}$W$_x$O$_6$. With the input of experimentally relevant coupling strengths, our exact diagonalization (ED) study probes the ground state properties beyond previous linear spin-wave approach. An intermediate range of $x \in [0.08, 0.55]$ is identified for a nonmagnetic phase without the long-range N\'eel or stripe order. The absence of both valence-bond-glass order and spin-glass non-ergodic dynamics renders its nature intriguing. Deep inside this phase around $x = 0.3$, we observe signatures potentially linked to randomness-induced short-range spin-liquid-like (SLL) states, including close to zero spin-freezing parameter, vanishing spin-spin correlation beyond nearest neighbors, almost uniform static spin structure factor, as well as a broad tail in the dynamical spin structure factor. The nonmagnetic phase also features multipartite entanglement in the ground state witnessed by quantum Fisher information (QFI), which exhibits universal scaling behaviors at quantum critical points.</description>

      <title>Magnetoresistance and Anisotropic Spin Dynamics in Antiferromagnetic Semiconductor Eu$_5$Sn$_2$As$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the thermodynamic and transport properties of the rare-earth Zintl compound Eu$_5$Sn$_2$As$_6$, which orders as a canted antiferromagnetic magnetic semiconductor at 10.3~K. The system also displays a complex cascade of magnetic phases arising from geometric and magnetic exchange frustration, with high sensitivity to the application and direction of small magnetic fields. At low temperature, Eu$_5$Sn$_2$As$_6$ exhibits negative colossal magnetoresistance of up to a factor of $6\times10^3$. This may be a lower bound as the conductivity appears to be shunted by an unknown conduction channel, causing the resistivity to saturate. Mechanisms for the low temperature saturation of resistivity are discussed.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced topological phase transition at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of topological phase transitions in interacting, symmetry-protected quantum matter at finite temperatures. Using a combined numerical and analytical approach, we study a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with added Hubbard interactions, where no thermodynamic phase transition occurs at finite temperatures. The transition is signalled by a quantized, non-local bulk topological order parameter. It is driven by defects, which are enabled by the combination of interaction and thermal activation, with no counterpart in the non-interacting limit. The defects localize topological zero modes, which, when sufficiently abundant, cause the order parameter to vanish. This phenomenon, interpreted via bulk-boundary correspondence, reflects the loss of a topological edge mode at a well-defined critical temperature in the thermodynamic limit. Unlike zero-temperature topological transitions, these finite-temperature transitions lack thermodynamic signatures but remain observable in controlled quantum systems, such as ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Precise correspondence between the p-wave chiral superfluid and the spinless bosonic superfluid on the lowest Landau level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a precise formal correspondence between a spinless p-wave chiral fermionic superfluid and a spinless bosonic superfluid in a strong magnetic field by accounting for the correct superfluid vorticity in the effective theory of the former. In literature, the vorticity manifests itself incompletely as the magnetic field. This paper demonstrates this substitution can be understood as a truncation in the relevant expansion scheme, together with field redefinitions. Those discarded components are critical to restoring the Berry phase term in the effective theory, and the restoration incapsulates these two systems in the same master Lagrangian. In addition to clarifying the structure of the Berry phase, this formalism permits solving the bosonic system on the lowest Landau level (LLL) based on the method of analogue. In particular, we show that in the linear regime, the Maxwell equations governing these systems are identical by reformulating the vortex crystal with an auxiliary electromagnetic field. This approach offers a unified view for these systems and yields solutions that are rotationally covariant, gauge invariants, and physically interpretable.</description>

Abstract: We show that the combined effects of dynamical Coulomb blockade and integer quantum Hall effect in a coupled hybrid metal-semiconductor setup provide a pathway for realizing resonant tunneling in Luttinger liquids with interaction strength $\eta\leq 1/2$. We explore emergent quantum criticality, charge fractionalization and transport in such a hybrid setup, and verify their robust non-Fermi liquid behaviors. We also present a method to implement $1/2&lt;\eta&lt;1$ within the same hybrid setup. Our work opens a promising route for quantum simulating exotic zero temperature quantum critical phenomena associated with Luttinger liquid physics in a nanoengineered electronic circuit with well-defined quantum Hall channels.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic inter-layer coupling in FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$ superconductors revealed by inelastic neutron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$ superconductors are commonly considered layered van der Waals materials with negligible inter-layer coupling. Here, using inelastic neutron scattering to study spin excitations in single-crystal samples, we reveal that the magnetic coupling between adjacent Fe layers is not only significant, as it affects excitations up to \textcolor{black}{15} meV, but also ferromagnetic in nature, making the system different from most unconventional superconductors including iron pnictides. Our observation provides a new standpoint to understand the absence of magnetic order in FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$. Since intercalating between the Fe layers is known to enhance superconductivity and suppress the inter-layer coupling, superconductivity appears to be a more robust phenomenon in the two-dimensional limit than antiferromagnetic order.</description>

      <title>Ground-state phase diagram of the SU($4$) Heisenberg model on a plaquette lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ground state of the SU($4$) Heisenberg model on a square lattice with spatial anisotropy on each plaquette bond using the tensor-network method based on infinite projected entangled pair states. We find that the SU($4$) singlet ground state appears in the strongly anisotropic limit, whereas N\'eel and valence bond crystal orders coexist in the nearly isotropic limit. By examining the intermediate parameter region, we identify a phase transition between these phases. The nature of the phase transition is likely to be of first order, and the transition point is estimated to be around $J'/J\approx 0.85(5)$, where $J$ and $J'$ are the interaction strengths of intra- and inter-plaquette bonds, respectively. We also calculate the anisotropy dependence of singlet correlations on a plaquette bond, which will be useful for future experiments of ultracold atoms in optical lattices.</description>

Abstract: The Ruddlesden-Popper (R-P) bilayer nickelate, La3Ni2O7, was recently found to show signatures of high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC) at pressures above 14 GPa. Subsequent investigations achieved zero resistance in single- and poly-crystalline samples under hydrostatic pressure conditions. Yet, obvious diamagnetic signals, the other hallmark of superconductors, are still lacking owing to the filamentary nature with low superconducting volume fraction. The presence of a novel "1313" polymorph and competing R-P phases obscured proper identification of the phase for HTSC. Thus, achieving bulk HTSC and identifying the phase at play are the most prominent tasks at present. Here, we address these issues in the praseodymium (Pr)-doped La2PrNi2O7 polycrystalline samples. We find that the substitutions of Pr for La effectively inhibits the intergrowth of different R-P phases, resulting in nearly pure bilayer structure. For La2PrNi2O7, pressure-induced orthorhombic-to-tetragonal structural transition takes place at Pc ~ 11 GPa, above which HTSC emerges gradually upon further compression. The superconducting transition temperatures at 18-20 GPa reach Tconset = 82.5 K and Tczero = 60 K, which are the highest values among known nickelate superconductors. More importantly, bulk HTSC was testified by detecting clear diamagnetic signals below ~75 K corresponding to an estimated superconducting volume fraction ~ 57(5)% at 20 GPa. Our results not only resolve the existing controversies but also illuminate directions for exploring bulk HTSC in the bilayer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Fast and spectrally accurate construction of adaptive diagonal basis sets for electronic structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we combine the periodic sinc basis set with a curvilinear coordinate system for electronic structure calculations. This extension allows for variable resolution across the computational domain, with higher resolution close to the nuclei and lower resolution in the inter-atomic regions. We address two key challenges that arise while using basis sets obtained by such a coordinate transformation. First, we use pseudospectral methods to evaluate the integrals needed to construct the Hamiltonian in this basis. Second, we demonstrate how to construct an appropriate coordinate transformation by solving the Monge-Amp\`ere equation using a new approach that we call the cyclic Knothe-Rosenblatt flow. The solution of both of these challenges enables mean-field calculations at a cost that is log-linear in the number of basis functions. We demonstrate that our method approaches the complete basis set limit faster than basis sets with uniform resolution. We also emphasize how these basis sets satisfy the diagonal approximation, which is shown to be a consequence of the pseudospectral method. The diagonal approximation is highly desirable for the solution of the electronic structure problem in many frameworks, including mean field theories, tensor network methods, quantum computing, and quantum Monte Carlo.</description>

Abstract: Strange metals exhibit universal linear-in-temperature resistivity described by a Planckian scattering rate, the origin of which remains elusive. By employing a novel approach inspired by quantum optics, we arrive at the coherent state representation of lattice vibrations: quantum acoustics. Utilizing this nonperturbative framework, we demonstrate that lattice vibrations could serve as active drivers in the Planckian resistivity phenomenon, challenging prevailing theories. By treating charge carriers as quantum wave packets negotiating the dynamic acoustic field, we find that a competition ensues between localization and delocalization giving rise to the previously conjectured universal quantum bound of diffusion, $\hbar/m^{*}$, independent of temperature or any other material parameters. This leads to the enigmatic $T$-linear resistivity over hundreds of degrees, except at very low temperatures. Quantum diffusion also explains why strange metals have much higher electrical resistivity than typical metals. Our work elucidates the critical role of phonons in Planckian resistivity from a new perspective and reconsiders their significance in the transport properties of strange metals.</description>

      <title>Nature of the current-induced insulator-to-metal transition in Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ as revealed by transport-ARPES</title>

Abstract: The Mott insulator Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ exhibits a rare insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) induced by DC current. While structural changes associated with this transition have been tracked by neutron diffraction, Raman scattering, and x-ray spectroscopy, work on elucidating the response of the electronic degrees of freedom is still in progress. Here we unveil the current-induced modifications of the electronic states of Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ by employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) in conjunction with four-probe transport. Two main effects emerge: a clear reduction of the Mott gap and a modification in the dispersion of the Ru-bands. The changes in dispersion occur exclusively along the $XM$ high-symmetry direction, parallel to the $b$-axis where the greatest in-plane lattice change occurs. These experimental observations, together with dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations simulated from the current-induced structural distortions, indicate the intimate interplay of lattice and orbital-dependent electronic response in the current-driven IMT. Furthermore, based on a free energy analysis, we demonstrate that the current-induced phase, albeit thermodynamically equivalent, is electronically distinct from the high-temperature zero-current metallic phase. Our results provide insight into the elusive nature of the current-induced IMT of Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ and advance the challenging, yet powerful, technique of transport-ARPES.</description>

Abstract: Model Hamiltonians are regularly derived from first-principles data to describe correlated matter. However, the standard methods for this contain a number of largely unexplored approximations. For a strongly correlated impurity model system, here we carefully compare a standard downfolding technique with the best possible ground-truth estimates for charge-neutral excited state energies and wavefunctions using state-of-the-art first-principles many-body wave function approaches. To this end, we use the vanadocene molecule and analyze all downfolding aspects, including the Hamiltonian form, target basis, double counting correction, and Coulomb interaction screening models. We find that the choice of target-space basis functions emerges as a key factor for the quality of the downfolded results, while orbital-dependent double counting correction diminishes the quality. Background screening to the Coulomb interaction matrix elements primarily affects crystal-field excitations. Our benchmark uncovers the relative importance of each downfolding step and offers insights into the potential accuracy of minimal downfolded model Hamiltonians</description>

      <title>Controlled expansion for transport in a class of non-Fermi liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Fermi liquids arise when strong interactions destroy stable fermionic quasiparticles. The simplest models featuring this phenomenon involve a Fermi surface coupled to fluctuating gapless bosonic order parameter fields, broadly referred to as "Hertz-Millis" models. We revisit a controlled approach to Hertz-Millis models that combines an expansion in the inverse number ($N$) of fermion species with an expansion in the deviation of the boson dynamical critical exponent $z$ from 2. The structure of the expansion is found to be qualitatively different in the quantum critical regime $\Omega \ll q$ and in the transport regime $\Omega \gg q$. In particular, correlation functions in the transport regime involve infinitely many diagrams at each order in perturbation theory. We provide an explicit and tractable recipe to classify and resum these diagrams. For the simplest Hertz-Millis models, we show that this recipe is consistent with non-perturbative anomaly arguments and correctly captures the fixed point optical conductivity as well as leading corrections from irrelevant operators. We comment on potential applications of this expansion to transport in more complicated Hertz-Millis models as well as certain beyond-Landau metallic quantum critical points.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory of Berry Fermi liquid from the coadjoint orbit method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00877v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an effective field theory for an interacting Fermi liquid with nonzero Berry curvature at zero temperature, called the Berry Fermi liquid. We start with the extended phase space formalism, incorporating physical time into the configuration space. This approach allows us to include the time dependence of the background gauge fields ``covariantly'' into the symplectic structure. Upon restricting to the physical hypersurface, the effective action that lives on the coadjoint orbit becomes the minus free energy on the extended phase space. We also derive the action perturbatively in external fields using the canonical variables. For applications, we compute both linear and nonlinear electrical responses using the Kubo formula, and identify contributions from the electric and magnetic dipole moments, which stem from interactions breaking parity and time-reversal symmetry. The anomalous Hall effect is confirmed using the kinetic theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently several triangular-lattice magnets with delafossite structure have been found to display spin-liquid behavior down to the lowest temperatures. Remarkably, applying a magnetic field destroys the spin liquid which then gives way to symmetry-breaking states, identified as semiclassical coplanar states including a magnetization plateau at 1/3 total magnetization. Here we provide a theoretical approach rationalizing this dichotomy, utilizing a Schwinger-boson theory that captures both ordered and disordered magnetic phases. We show that a zero-field spin liquid, driven by strong frustration, is naturally destabilized in a magnetic field via spinon condensation. Symmetry-breaking order akin to the standard triangular-lattice Heisenberg model then arises via an order-by-disorder mechanism. We discuss implications for pertinent experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of ferroelectricity is now often extended to include continuous inversion symmetry-breaking transitions in various metals and doped semiconductors. Paraelectric metals near ferroelectric quantum criticality, which we term `quantum paraelectric metals,' typically possess soft transverse optical phonons that have Rashba-type coupling to itinerant electrons in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. We find through the Kubo formula calculation that such Rashba electron-phonon coupling has a profound impact on electron spin transport. While the spin Hall effect arising from non-trivial electronic band structures has been studied extensively, we find here the presence of the Rashba electron-phonon coupling can give rise to spin current, including spin Hall current, in response to an inhomogeneous electric field even with a completely trivial band structure. Furthermore, this spin conductivity displays unconventional characteristics, such as quadrupolar symmetry associated with the wave vector of the electric field and a thermal activation behavior characterized by scaling laws dependent on the phonon frequency to temperature ratio. These findings shed light on exotic electronic transport phenomena originating from ferroelectric quantum criticality, highlighting the intricate interplay of charge and spin degrees of freedom.</description>

Abstract: Multi-orbital electronic models hosting a non-trivial band-topology in the regime of strong electronic interactions are an ideal playground for exploring a host of complex phenomenology. We consider here a sign-problem-free and time-reversal symmetric model with isolated topological (chern) bands involving both spin and valley degrees of freedom in the presence of a class of repulsive electronic interactions. Using a combination of numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo computations and analytical field-theoretic considerations we analyze the phase-diagram as a function of the flat-band filling, temperature and relative interaction strength. The low-energy physics is described in terms of a set of intertwined orders -- a spin-valley hall (SVH) insulator and a spin-singlet superconductor (SC). Our low-temperature phase diagram can be understood in terms of an effective SO(4) pseudo-spin non-linear sigma model. Our work paves the way for building more refined and minimal models of realistic materials, including moir\'e systems, to study the universal aspects of competing insulating phases and superconductivity in the presence of non-trivial band-topology.</description>

Abstract: We apply "hydrodynamic" effective field theory techniques to an ersatz Fermi liquid. Our effective theory, which captures the correlation functions of density operators at each angle on the Fermi surface, can only deviate from conventional Fermi liquid behavior if the effective theory is non-local. Neglecting non-local effects, the ersatz Fermi liquid's effective action is the Legendre transform of the effective action for Fermi liquids, based on the coadjoint orbit method, up to irrelevant corrections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform variational Monte Carlo simulations of the single-band Hubbard model on the square lattice with both nearest ($t$) and next-nearest ($t'$) neighbor hoppings. Our work investigates the consequences of increasing hole doping on the instauration of stripes and the behavior of the superconducting order parameter, with a discussion on how the two phenomena affect each other. We consider two different values of the next-nearest neighbor hopping parameter, that are appropriate for describing cuprate superconductors. We observe that stripes are the optimal state in a wide doping range; the stripe wavelength reduces at increasing doping, until stripes melt into a uniform state for large values of doping. Superconducting pair-pair correlations, indicating the presence of superconductivity, are always suppressed in the presence of stripes. Our results suggest that the phase diagram for the single-band Hubbard model is dominated by stripes, with superconductivity being possible only in a narrow doping range between striped states and a nonsuperconducting metal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a refinement of the usual Hartree-Fock method applied to the 2D Hubbard model, in Nambu spinor formulation. The new element is the addition of a "condensate inducing" term proportional to a variational parameter h to the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian, which generates an s- or d-wave condensate at zero temperature. This modified Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian is used only to generate variational trial states; energy expectation values are computed in the full two-dimensional Hubbard Hamiltonian with no modification. It is found that there exist trial states with non-vanishing condensates which are lower in energy than the standard Hartree-Fock ground states. However, these lower energy condensate states exist only in a spatially inhomogeneous (stripe) phase. No lowering of energy, relative to the Hartree-Fock ground state, is found in the spatially homogenous region of the U-density phase plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strain tuning is a powerful experimental method in probing correlated electron systems. Here we study the strain response of the lattice dynamics and electronic structure in semiconductor Ta$_2$NiS$_5$ by polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy. We observe an increase of the size of the direct semiconducting band gap. Although the majority of the optical phonons show only marginal dependence to applied strain, the frequency of the two B$_{2g}$ phonon modes, which have quadrupolar symmetry and already anomalously soften on cooling under zero strain, increases significantly with tensile strain along the $a$ axis. The corresponding Gr\"uneisen parameters are unusually large in magnitude and negative in sign. These effects are well captured by first-principles density functional theory calculations and indicate close proximity of Ta$_2$NiS$_5$ to a structural instability, similar to that encountered in excitonic insulator candidate Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12967v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the low-energy effective theory of a Fermi surface coupled to an Ising-nematic quantum critical point in (2+1) spacetime dimensions with translation symmetry. We formulate the system using the large $N$ Yukawa-SYK model, whose saddle point is described by the Migdal-Eliashberg equations. The low-energy physics can be revealed by studying the Gaussian fluctuation spectrum around the saddle point, which is generated by the Bethe-Salpeter kernel $K_\text{BS}$. Based on the Ward identities, we propose an inner product on the space of two point functions, which reveals a large number of soft modes of $K_\text{BS}$. These soft modes parameterize deformation of the Fermi surface, and their fluctuation eigenvalues describe their decay rates. We analytically compute these eigenvalues for a circular Fermi surface, and we discover the odd-parity modes to be parametrically longer-lived than the even-parity modes, due to the kinematic constraint of fermions scattering on a convex FS. The sign of the eigenvalues signals an instability of the Ising-nematic quantum critical point at zero temperature for a convex Fermi surface. At finite temperature, the system can be stabilized by thermal fluctuations of the critical boson. We derive an effective action that describes the soft-mode dynamics, and it leads to a linearized Boltzmann equation, where the real part of the soft-mode eigenvalues can be interpreted as the collision rates. The structure of the effective action is similar to the theory of linear bosonization of a Fermi surface. As an application, we investigate the hydrodynamic transport of non-Fermi liquid. Analyzing the Boltzmann equation, we obtain a conventional hydrodynamic transport regime and a tomographic transport regime. In both regimes, the conductance of the system in finite geometry can be a sharp indicator for the soft-mode dynamics and non-Fermi liquid physics.</description>

      <title>Probing Random-Bond Disorder Effects on Ferromagnetic Skyrmion Arrays</title>

Abstract: In this work, we examined the impact of disorder in a ferromagnetic skyrmion lattice by introducing random-bond disorder based on two different models for both exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions: Model I, where both interactions present the same disorder distribution and thus the same local distortion, and Model II, where both interactions have different disorder distributions. Through extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we explored the effect of bond disorder on the emergent phases induced by an external magnetic field at different temperatures, varying the disorder amplitude across a range from weak (10%) to strong (200%) regimes. Our study shows that for both models, moderate disorder at low magnetic fields breaks the helical order and induces a topologically non-trivial bimeron phase. We also found that the skyrmion lattice phase loses its periodicity, but surprisingly, the resulting phases retain topological characteristics up to high disorder amplitudes. Moreover, a significant difference between both disorder models is found at large magnetic fields: while in the first model, the high-field skyrmion phase is suppressed by disorder, in the second model, this phase is enhanced and expanded in temperature and magnetic field. Furthermore, for the second model, intermediate values of disorder induce a diluted skyrmion phase and chiral textures emerging from the ferromagnetic phase at low temperatures. Our results are relevant for layered magnets and provide valuable insights into the intricate behavior of skyrmion systems under varying disorder conditions.</description>

      <title>Procedure to Reveal the Mechanism of Pattern Formation Process by Topological Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.12194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) is a versatile tool that can be used to extract scientific knowledge from complex pattern formation processes. However, the physics correspondence between the features obtained from TDA and pattern dynamics does not agree one-to-one, and the physical interpretation of the TDA features needs to be set appropriately according to the phenomenon to be analyzed. In this study, we propose an analytical procedure to physically interpret pattern dynamics through TDA and machine learning techniques. The proposed procedure was applied to the process of magnetic domain pattern formation to quantify non-trivial domain pattern classifications and reveal the nature of the underlying dynamics. On the basis of these findings, we also propose a candidate reduction model to understand the nature of magnetic domain formation.</description>

      <title>Self-doped flat band and spin-triplet superconductivity in monolayer 1T-TaSe$_{2-x}$Te$_{x}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals materials have become an established platform to engineer flat bands which can lead to strongly-correlated emergent phenomena. In particular, the family of Ta dichalcogenides in the 1\textit{T} phase presents a star-of-David charge density wave that creates a flat band at the Fermi level. For TaS$_2$ and TaSe$_2$ this flat band is at half filling leading to a magnetic insulating phase. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that ligand substitution in the TaSe$_{2-x}$Te$_x$ system produces a transition from the magnetic insulator to a non-magnetic metal in which the flat band gets doped away from half-filling. For $x\in[{0.846},{1.231}]$ the spin-polarized flat band is self-doped and the system becomes a magnetic metal. In this regime, we show that attractive interactions promote three different spin-triplet superconducting phases as a function of $x$, corresponding to a nodal f-wave and two topologically-different chiral p-wave superconducting phases. Our results establish monolayer TaSe$_{2-x}$Te$_{x}$ as a promising platform for correlated flat band physics leading to unconventional superconducting states.</description>

      <title>Easy bootstrap for the 3D Ising model: a hybrid approach of the lightcone bootstrap and error minimization methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a simple lattice model that exhibits a phase transition, the Ising model plays a fundamental role in statistical and condensed matter physics. The Ising transition is realized by physical systems, such as the liquid-vapor transition. Its continuum limit also furnishes a basic example of interacting quantum field theories and universality classes. Motivated by a recent hybrid bootstrap study of the quantum quartic oscillator, we revisit the conformal bootstrap approach to the 3D Ising model at criticality, without resorting to positivity constraints. We use at most 10 nonperturbative crossing constraints at low derivatives from the Taylor expansion around a crossing symmetric point. The high-lying contributions are approximated by simple analytic formulae deduced from the lightcone singularity structure. Surprisingly, the low-lying properties are determined to good accuracy by this computationally very cheap approach. For instance, the results for the two relevant scaling dimensions $(\Delta_\sigma,\Delta_\epsilon)\approx (0.518153,1.41278)$ are close to the most precise rigorous bounds obtained at a much higher computational cost.</description>

      <title>Pseudospins revealed through the giant dynamical Franz-Keldysh effect in massless Dirac materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamical Franz-Keldysh effect, indicative of the transient light-matter interaction regime between quantum and classical realms, is widely recognized as an essential signature in wide bandgap condensed matter systems such as dielectrics. In this study, we applied the time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy to investigate ultrafast optical responses in graphene, a zero-bandgap system. We observed in the gate-tuned graphene that the massless Dirac materials notably enhance intraband light-driven transitions, significantly leading to the giant dynamical Franz-Keldysh effect compared to the massive Dirac materials, a wide bandgap system. In addition, employing the angle-resolved spectroscopy, it is found that the unique polarimetry orientation, i.e., perpendicular polarizations for the pump and the probe, further pronounces the optical spectra to exhibit the complete fishbone structure, reflecting the quantum pseudospin nature of Dirac cones. Our findings expand the establishment of emergent transient spectroscopy frameworks into not only zero-bandgap systems but also pseudospin-mediated quantum phenomena, moving beyond dielectrics.</description>

      <title>Qubit encoding for a mixture of localized functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the crucial generic techniques for quantum computation is amplitude encoding. Although several approaches have been proposed, each of them often requires exponential classical-computational cost or an oracle whose explicit construction is not provided. Given the growing demands for practical quantum computation, we develop moderately specialized encoding techniques that generate an arbitrary linear combination of localized complex functions. We demonstrate that $n_{\mathrm{loc}}$ discrete Lorentzian functions as an expansion basis set lead to eficient probabilistic encoding, whose computational time is $\mathcal{O}( \max ( n_{\mathrm{loc}}^2 \log n_{\mathrm{loc}},n_{\mathrm{loc}}^2 \log n_q, n_q ))$ for $n_q$ data qubits equipped with $\log_2 n_{\mathrm{loc}}$ ancillae. Furthermore, amplitude amplification in combination with amplitude reduction renders it deterministic analytically with controllable errors and the computational time is reduced to $\mathcal{O}( \max ( n_{\mathrm{loc}}^{3/2} \log n_{\mathrm{loc}}, n_{\mathrm{loc}}^{3/2} \log n_q, n_q )).$ We estimate required resources for applying our scheme to quantum chemistry in real space. We also show the results on real superconducting quantum computers to confirm the validity of our techniques.</description>

      <title>Transient dynamics of quasinormal mode sums</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes of spacetimes with event horizons are typically governed by a non-normal operator. This gives rise to spectral instabilities, a topic of recent interest in the black hole pseudospectrum programme. In this work we show that non-normality leads to the existence of arbitrarily long-lived sums of short-lived quasinormal modes, corresponding to localising packets of energy near the future horizon. There exist sums of $M$ quasinormal modes whose lifetimes scale as $\log{M}$. This transient behaviour results from large cancellations between non-orthogonal quasinormal modes. We provide simple closed-form examples for a massive scalar field in the static patch of dS$_{d+1}$ and the BTZ black hole. We also provide numerical examples for scalar perturbations of Schwarzschild-AdS$_{d+1}$, and gravitational perturbations of Schwarzschild in asymptotically flat spacetime, using hyperboloidal foliations. The existence of these perturbations is linked to certain properties of black hole pseudospectra. We comment on implications for thermalisation times in holographic plasmas.</description>

      <title>Dynamical control in a prethermalized molecular ultracold plasma: Local dissipation drives global relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prethermalization occurs as an important phase in the dynamics of many-body systems when strong coupling drives a quasi-equilibrium in a subspace separated from the thermodynamic equilibrium by the restriction of a gap in energy or other conserved quantity. Here, we report the signature of an enduring prethermal regime of arrested relaxation in the molecular ultracold plasma that forms following the avalanche of a state-selected Rydberg gas of nitric oxide. Electron collisions mix orbital angular momentum, scattering Rydberg molecules to states of very high-$\ell$. Spontaneous predissociation purifies this non-penetrating character, creating an extraordinary gap between the plasma states of $n \approx \ell$, with measured $n&gt;200$ and penetrating states of $\ell = 0, ~1$ and 2. Evolution to a statistically equilibrated state of N and O atoms cannot occur without Rydberg electron penetration, and this gap blocks relaxation for a millisecond or more. Evolving through the critical phase, electrons that balance the NO$^+$ charge behave as though localized in the prethermal phase and play an ineffective role in bridging this gap. However, the application of a weak radiofrequency (RF) field promotes a dramatic degree of relaxation owing to electron collisions. On an entirely different scale, exciting a quantum-state transition in an exceedingly small fraction of the molecules in the prethermalized ensemble acts with even greater effect to drive the entire system toward equilibrium. We ascribe this to dissipative character added to a small fraction of the states in the prethermally localized ensemble. Using the Lindblad master equation, we illustrate qualitatively similar dynamics for a toy model of an open quantum system that consists of a localized set of spins on which dissipation acts locally at a single site.</description>

      <title>One point functions in large $N$ vector models at finite chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the thermal one point function of higher spin currents in the critical model of $U(N)$ complex scalars interacting with a quartic potential and the $U(N)$ Gross-Neveu model of Dirac fermions at large $N$ and strong coupling using the Euclidean inversion formula. These models are considered in odd space time dimensions $d$ and held at finite temperature and finite real chemical potential $\mu$ measured in units of the temperature. We show that these one point functions simplify both at large spin and large $d$. At large spin, the one point functions behave as though the theory is free, the chemical potential appears through a simple pre-factor which is either $\cosh\mu$ or $\sinh\mu$ depending on whether the spin is even or odd. At large $d$, but at finite spin and chemical potential, the 1-point functions are suppressed exponentially in $d$ compared to the free theory. We study a fixed point of the critical Gross-Neveu model in $d=3$ with 1-point functions exhibiting a branch cut in the chemical potential plane. The critical exponent for the free energy or the pressure at the branch point is $3/2$ which coincides with the mean field exponent of the Lee-Yang edge singularity for repulsive core interactions.</description>

      <title>Field-Dependent Metrics and Higher-Form Symmetries in Duality-Invariant Theories of Non-Linear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a $4d$ theory of non-linear electrodynamics has equations of motion which are equivalent to those of the Maxwell theory in curved spacetime, but with the usual metric $g_{\mu \nu}$ replaced by a unit-determinant metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$ which is a function of the field strength $F_{\mu \nu}$, if and only if the theory enjoys electric-magnetic duality invariance. Among duality-invariant models, the Modified Maxwell (ModMax) theory is special because the associated metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$ produces identical equations of motion when it is coupled to the Maxwell theory via two different prescriptions which we describe. We use the field-dependent metric perspective to analyze the electric and magnetic $1$-form global symmetries in models of self-dual electrodynamics. This analysis suggests that any duality-invariant theory possesses a set of conserved currents $j^\mu$ which are in one-to-one correspondence with $2$-forms that are harmonic with respect to the field-dependent metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$.</description>

      <title>Approximate symmetries, insulators, and superconductivity in continuum-model description of twisted WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of superconductivity in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$, we analyze the correlated physics in this system in the framework of a continuum model for the moir\'e superlattice. Using the symmetries in a fine-tuned limit of the system, we identify the strong-coupling ground states and their fate when the perturbations caused by finite bandwidth, displacement field, and the phase of the intralayer potential are taken into account. We classify the superconducting instabilities and, employing a spin-fermion-like model, study the superconducting instabilities in proximity to these insulating particle-hole orders. This reveals that only a neighboring intervalley coherent phase (with zero or finite wave vector) is naturally consistent with the observed superconducting state. Depending on details, the superconductor will be nodal or a chiral gapped state while further including electron-phonon coupling leads to a fully gapped, time-reversal symmetric pairing state.</description>
