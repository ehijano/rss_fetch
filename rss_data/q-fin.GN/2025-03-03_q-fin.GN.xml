      <title>Chronologically Consistent Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used in social sciences, but their training data can introduce lookahead bias and training leakage. A good chronologically consistent language model requires efficient use of training data to maintain accuracy despite time-restricted data. Here, we overcome this challenge by training chronologically consistent large language models timestamped with the availability date of their training data, yet accurate enough that their performance is comparable to state-of-the-art open-weight models. Lookahead bias is model and application-specific because even if a chronologically consistent language model has poorer language comprehension, a regression or prediction model applied on top of the language model can compensate. In an asset pricing application, we compare the performance of news-based portfolio strategies that rely on chronologically consistent versus biased language models and estimate a modest lookahead bias.</description>

      <title>Auto-Balancer: Harnessing idle network resources for enhanced market stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism embedded into the foundational infrastructure of a blockchain network, designed to improve the utility of idle network resources, whilst enhancing market microstructure efficiency during block production by leveraging both network-owned and external capital. By systematically seeking to use idle network resources for internally capture arbitrageable inefficiencies, the mechanism mitigates extractable value leakage, reduces execution frictions, and improves price formation across venues. This framework optimises resource allocation by incentivising an ordered set of transactions to be identified and automatically executed at the end of each block, redirecting any realised arbitrage income - to marketplaces operating on the host blockchain network (and other stakeholders), which may have otherwise been extracted as rent by external actors. Crucially, this process operates without introducing additional inventory risk, ensuring that the network remains a neutral facilitator of price discovery. While the systematic framework governing the distribution of these internally captured returns is beyond the scope of this work, reinvesting them to support the ecosystem deployed on the host blockchain network is envisioned to endogenously enhance liquidity, strengthen transactional efficiency, and promote the organic adoption of the blockchain for end users. This mechanism is designed specifically for Supra's blockchain and seeks to maximally utilise its highly efficient automation framework to enhance the blockchain network's efficiency.</description>
