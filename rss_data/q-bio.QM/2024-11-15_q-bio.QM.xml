      <title>A new computational model for quantifying blood flow dynamics across myogenically-active cerebral arterial networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cerebral autoregulation plays a key physiological role by limiting blood flow changes in the face of pressure fluctuations. Although the involved cellular processes are mechanically driven, the quantification of haemodynamic forces in in-vivo settings remains extremely difficult and uncertain. In this work, we propose a novel computational framework for evaluating the blood flow dynamics across networks of myogenically active cerebral arteries, which can modulate their muscular tone to stabilize flow (and perfusion pressure) as well as to limit vascular intramural stress. The introduced framework is built on contractile (myogenically active) vascular wall mechanics and blood flow dynamics models, which can be numerically coupled in either a weak or strong way. We investigate the time dependency of the vascular wall response to pressure changes at both single vessel and network levels. The robustness of the model was assessed by considering different types of inlet signals and numerical settings in an idealized vascular network formed by a middle cerebral artery and its three generations. For the vessel size and boundary conditions considered, weak coupling ensured accurate results with a lower computational cost. To complete the analysis, we evaluated the effect of an upstream pressure surge on the haemodynamics of the vascular network. This provided a clear quantitative picture of how pressure and flow are redistributed across each vessel generation upon inlet pressure changes. This work paves the way for future combined experimental-computational studies aiming to decipher cerebral autoregulation.</description>

      <title>TockyLocus: Quantitative Analysis Methods for Flow Cytometric Fluorescent Timer Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09386</link>

Abstract: Fluorescent Timer proteins, which spontaneously change their emission spectra over time, are valuable tools for analyzing temporal changes in cellular activities at the single-cell level. Traditional analysis of Fluorescent Timer data has mostly relied on conventional flow cytometric methods, which lacks the sophistication needed for detailed quantitative analysis. Recently, we developed the Timer-of-Cell-Kinetics-and-Activity (Tocky) tools, employing transgenic reporter systems using an mCherry mutant Timer protein, Fast-FT, to analyze these changes, implementing data preprocessing methods for Timer fluorescence. Despite this advancement, the computational implementation of effective quantitative analysis methods for Fluorescent Timer data has been lacking. In this study, we introduce rigorous algorithms for a data categorization method, designated as the Tocky locus approach, which uses normalized and trigonometric-transformed Fluorescent Timer data, suitable for quantitative analysis. We found that the five-locus approach, which categorizes Timer fluorescence into five categories, optimally captures the dynamics of Timer profiles, thus enabling effective quantitative statistical analysis and biological interpretation. The current study has developed comprehensive tools for data categorization, visualization, and statistical analysis optimized to Tocky Locus data. These algorithms have been implemented in the TockyLocus package, a new R package designed to facilitate the quantitative analysis of Timer fluorescence data. This toolkit is expected to significantly enhance the utility of experimental systems using Fluorescent Timer proteins, particularly the Tocky tools, by standardizing methods for analyzing dynamic cellular events and responses.</description>

      <title>An interpretable generative multimodal neuroimaging-genomics framework for decoding Alzheimer's disease</title>

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia with a progressive decline in cognitive abilities. The AD continuum encompasses a prodromal stage known as MCI, where patients may either progress to AD (MCIc) or remain stable (MCInc). Understanding AD mechanisms requires complementary analyses relying on different data sources, leading to the development of multimodal DL models. We leveraged structural and functional MRI to investigate the disease-induced GM and functional network connectivity changes. Moreover, considering AD's strong genetic component, we introduced SNPs as a third channel. Missing one or more modalities is a typical concern of multimodal methods. We hence propose a novel DL-based classification framework where a generative module employing Cycle GAN was adopted for imputing missing data in the latent space. Additionally, we adopted an XAI method, Integrated Gradients, to extract features' relevance, enhancing our understanding of the learned representations. Two tasks were addressed: AD detection and MCI conversion prediction. Experimental results showed that our framework reached the SOA in the classification of CN/AD with an average test accuracy of $0.926\pm0.02$. For the MCInc/MCIc task, we achieved an average prediction accuracy of $0.711\pm0.01$ using the pre-trained model for CN and AD. The interpretability analysis revealed that significant GM modulations led the classification performance in cortical and subcortical brain areas well known for their association with AD. Impairments in sensory-motor and visual functional network connectivity along AD, as well as mutations in SNPs defining biological processes linked to endocytosis, amyloid-beta, and cholesterol, were identified as contributors to the results. Overall, our integrative DL model shows promise for AD detection and MCI prediction, while shading light on important biological insights.</description>

      <title>TockyPrep: Data Preprocessing Methods for Flow Cytometric Fluorescent Timer Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04111</link>

Abstract: Background: Fluorescent Timer proteins, which display time-dependent changes in their emission spectra, are invaluable for analyzing the temporal dynamics of cellular events at the single-cell level. We previously developed the Timer-of-cell-kinetics-and-activity (Tocky) tools, utilizing a specific Timer protein, Fast-FT, to monitor temporal changes in cellular activities. Despite their potential, the analysis of Timer fluorescence in flow cytometry is frequently compromised by variability in instrument settings and the absence of standardized preprocessing methods. The development and implementation of effective data preprocessing methods remain to be achieved.
  Results: In this study, we introduce the R package that automates the data preprocessing of Timer fluorescence data from flow cytometry experiments for quantitative analysis at single-cell level. Our aim is to standardize Timer data analysis to enhance reproducibility and accuracy across different experimental setups. The package includes a trigonometric transformation method to elucidate the dynamics of Fluorescent Timer proteins. We have identified the normalization of immature and mature Timer fluorescence data as essential for robust analysis, clarifying how this normalization affects the analysis of Timer maturation. These preprocessing methods are all encapsulated within the TockyPrep R package.
  Conclusions: TockyPrep is available for distribution via GitHub at https://github.com/MonoTockyLab/TockyPrep, providing tools for data preprocessing and basic visualization of Timer fluorescence data. This toolkit is expected to enhance the utility of experimental systems utilizing Fluorescent Timer proteins, including the Tocky tools.</description>
