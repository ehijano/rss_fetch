      <title>Reading Radio from Camera: Visually-Grounded, Lightweight, and Interpretable RSSI Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate, real-time wireless signal prediction is essential for next-generation networks. However, existing vision-based frameworks often rely on computationally intensive models and are also sensitive to environmental interference. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel, physics-guided and light-weighted framework that predicts the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) from camera images. By decomposing RSSI into its physically interpretable components, path loss and shadow fading, we significantly reduce the model's learning difficulty and exhibit interpretability. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art by demonstrating exceptional robustness to environmental interference, a critical flaw in prior work. Quantitatively, our model reduces the prediction root mean squared error (RMSE) by 50.3% under conventional conditions and still achieves an 11.5% lower RMSE than the previous benchmark's interference-eliminated results. This superior performance is achieved with a remarkably lightweight framework, utilizing a MobileNet-based model up to 19 times smaller than competing solutions. The combination of high accuracy, robustness to interference, and computational efficiency makes our framework highly suitable for real-time, on-device deployment in edge devices, paving the way for more intelligent and reliable wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Ac Arc Fault Diagnosis via Fourier Transform Inspired Multi-frequency Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lightweight online detection of series arc faults is critically needed in residential and industrial power systems to prevent electrical fires. Existing diagnostic methods struggle to achieve both rapid response and robust accuracy under resource-constrained conditions. To overcome the challenge, this work suggests leveraging a multi-frequency neural network named MFNN, embedding prior physical knowledge into the network. Inspired by arcing current curve and the Fourier decomposition analysis, we create an adaptive activation function with super-expressiveness, termed EAS, and a novel network architecture with branch networks to help MFNN extract features with multiple frequencies. In our experiments, eight advanced arc fault diagnosis models across an experimental dataset with multiple sampling times and multi-level noise are used to demonstrate the superiority of MFNN. The corresponding experiments show: 1) The MFNN outperforms other models in arc fault location, befitting from signal decomposition of branch networks. 2) The noise immunity of MFNN is much better than that of other models, achieving 14.51% over LCNN and 16.3% over BLS in test accuracy when SNR=-9. 3) EAS and the network architecture contribute to the excellent performance of MFNN.</description>

      <title>Robust Super-Capacity SRS Channel Inpainting via Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is essential for reliable multiuser MIMO operation. In 5G NR, reciprocity-based beamforming via uplink Sounding Reference Signals (SRS) face resource and coverage constraints, motivating sparse non-uniform SRS allocation. Prior masked-autoencoder (MAE) approaches improve coverage but overfit to training masks and degrade under unseen distortions (e.g., additional masking, interference, clipping, non-Gaussian noise). We propose a diffusion-based channel inpainting framework that integrates system-model knowledge at inference via a likelihood-gradient term, enabling a single trained model to adapt across mismatched conditions. On standardized CDL channels, the score-based diffusion variant consistently outperforms a UNet score-model baseline and the one-step MAE under distribution shift, with improvements up to 14 dB NMSE in challenging settings (e.g., Laplace noise, user interference), while retaining competitive accuracy under matched conditions. These results demonstrate that diffusion-guided inpainting is a robust and generalizable approach for super-capacity SRS design in 5G NR systems.</description>

      <title>Virtual-Real Collaborated Split Learning via Model Partitioning in IRS-Assisted IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel computation and communication co-design framework for large-scale split learning in intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted internet of things (IoT) networks integrated with digital twin (DT) technique. The considered system consists of a multi-antenna access point (AP), multiple heterogeneous user devices (UDs), and an deployed IRS to enhance both uplink and downlink transmission. The training process of a deep neural network is partitioned between devices and the AP, where a DT replica is activated to replace UDs with insufficient local computation capabilities. We formulate a delay-optimal split learning problem, which optimizes five key variables: layer partitioning points, DT assignment decisions, IRS phase shift matrix, AP downlink power allocation, and DT frequency adjustment, aiming to minimize the overall end-to-end delay under communication and computation. The proposed optimization problem is a highly coupled non-convex mixed-integer problem. Therefore, we solve using an alternating optimization approach combining closed-form updates, semidefinite relaxation (SDR), and low-complexity heuristics. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly reduces training delay compared to conventional baselines and achieves up to 35\% delay improvement, especially under high UD density and stringent power constraints.</description>

      <title>6D Channel Knowledge Map Construction via Bidirectional Wireless Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the construction of channel knowledge map (CKM) from sparse channel measurements. Dif ferent from conventional two-/three-dimensional (2D/3D) CKM approaches assuming fixed base station configurations, we present a six-dimensional (6D) CKM framework named bidirectional wireless Gaussian splatting (BiWGS), which is capable of mod eling wireless channels across dynamic transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) positions in 3D space. BiWGS uses Gaussian el lipsoids to represent virtual scatterer clusters and environmental obstacles in the wireless environment. By properly learning the bidirectional scattering patterns and complex attenuation profiles based on channel measurements, these ellipsoids inherently cap ture the electromagnetic transmission characteristics of wireless environments, thereby accurately modeling signal transmission under varying transceiver configurations. Experiment results show that BiWGS significantly outperforms classic multi-layer perception (MLP) for the construction of 6D channel power gain map with varying Tx-Rx positions, and achieves spatial spectrum prediction accuracy comparable to the state-of-the art wireless radiation field Gaussian splatting (WRF-GS) for 3D CKM construction. This validates the capability of the proposed BiWGS in accomplishing dimensional expansion of 6D CKM construction, without compromising fidelity.</description>

      <title>Design of Orthogonal Phase of Arrival Positioning Scheme Based on 5G PRS and Optimization of TOA Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study analyzes the performance of positioning techniques based on configuration changes of 5G New Radio signals. In 5G networks, a terminal position is determined from the Time of Arrival of Positioning Reference Signals transmitted by base stations. We propose an algorithm that improves TOA accuracy under low sampling rate constraints and implement 5G PRS for positioning in a software defined modem. We also examine how flexible time frequency resource allocation of PRS affects TOA estimation accuracy and discuss optimal PRS configurations for a given signal environment.</description>

      <title>Optimal transmit field distribution for partially obstructed continuous radiating surfaces in near-field communication systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the optimal synthesis of aperture fields for (radiating) near-field communications in obstructed environments. A physically consistent model based on knife-edge diffraction is used to formulate the problem as a maximization in Hilbert space. The optimal solution is obtained as a matched filter that ``matches" the shape of a diffraction-induced kernel, thus linking wave propagation with signal processing methods. The framework supports hardware implementation using continuous apertures such as metasurfaces or lens antennas. This approach bridges physically grounded modeling, signal processing, and hardware design for efficient energy focusing in near-field obstructed channels.</description>

      <title>SABER: Symbolic Regression-based Angle of Arrival and Beam Pattern Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate Angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation is essential for next-generation wireless communication systems to enable reliable beamforming, high-precision localization, and integrated sensing. Unfortunately, classical high-resolution techniques require multi-element arrays and extensive snapshot collection, while generic Machine Learning (ML) approaches often yield black-box models that lack physical interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a Symbolic Regression (SR)-based ML framework. Namely, Symbolic Regression-based Angle of Arrival and Beam Pattern Estimator (SABER), a constrained symbolic-regression framework that automatically discovers closed-form beam pattern and AoA models from path loss measurements with interpretability. SABER achieves high accuracy while bridging the gap between opaque ML methods and interpretable physics-driven estimators. First, we validate our approach in a controlled free-space anechoic chamber, showing that both direct inversion of the known $\cos^n$ beam and a low-order polynomial surrogate achieve sub-0.5 degree Mean Absolute Error (MAE). A purely unconstrained SR method can further reduce the error of the predicted angles, but produces complex formulas that lack physical insight. Then, we implement the same SR-learned inversions in a real-world, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided indoor testbed. SABER and unconstrained SR models accurately recover the true AoA with near-zero error. Finally, we benchmark SABER against the Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bounds (CRLBs). Our results demonstrate that SABER is an interpretable and accurate alternative to state-of-the-art and black-box ML-based methods for AoA estimation.</description>

      <title>HMM for short independent sequences: Multiple sequence Baum-Welch application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the classical setting, the training of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) typically relies on a single, sufficiently long observation sequence that can be regarded as representative of the underlying stochastic process. In this context, the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is applied in its specialized form for HMMs, namely the Baum Welch algorithm, which has been extensively employed in applications such as speech recognition. The objective of this work is to present pseudocode formulations for both the training and decoding procedures of HMMs in a different scenario, where the available data consist of multiple independent temporal sequences generated by the same model, each of relatively short duration, i.e., containing only a limited number of samples. Special emphasis is placed on the relevance of this formulation to longitudinal studies in population health, where datasets are naturally structured as collections of short trajectories across individuals with point data at follow up.</description>

      <title>Statistically Adaptive Differential Protection for AC Microgrids Based on Kullback-Leibler Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of inverter-based resources challenges traditional microgrid protection by introducing variable fault currents and complex transients. This paper presents a statistically adaptive differential protection scheme based on Kullback-Leibler divergence, implemented via a Bartlett-corrected G-statistic computed on logarithm-transformed current magnitudes. The method is a multivariate fault detection engine that employs the Mahalanobis distance to distinguish healthy and faulty states, enabling robust detection even in noisy environments. Detection thresholds are statistically derived from a chi-squared distribution for precise control over the false alarm rate. Upon detection, a lightweight classifier identifies the fault type by assessing per-phase G-statistics against dedicated thresholds, enhanced by a temporal persistence filter for security. Extensive simulations on a modified CIGRE 14-bus microgrid show high efficacy: sub-cycle average detection delays, high detection and classification accuracy across operating modes, resilience to high-impedance faults up to 250 Ohms, tolerance to 10 ms communication delay, and noise levels down to a 20 dB signal-to-noise ratio. These findings demonstrate a reproducible and computationally efficient solution for next-generation AC microgrid protection.</description>

      <title>Graph Guided Modulo Recovery of EEG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) often shows significant variability among people. This fluctuation disrupts reliable acquisition and may result in distortion or clipping. Modulo sampling is now a promising solution to this problem, by folding signals instead of saturating them. Recovery of the original waveform from folded observations is a highly ill-posed problem. In this work, we propose a method based on a graph neural network, referred to as GraphUnwrapNet, for the modulo recovery of EEG signals. Our core idea is to represent an EEG signal as an organized graph whose channels and temporal connections establish underlying interdependence. One of our key contributions is in introducing a pre-estimation guided feature injection module to provide coarse folding indicators that enhance stability during recovery at wrap boundaries. This design integrates structural information with folding priors into an integrated framework. We performed comprehensive experiments on the Simultaneous Task EEG Workload (STEW) dataset. The results demonstrate consistent enhancements over traditional optimization techniques and competitive accuracy relative to current deep learning models. Our findings emphasize the potential of graph-based methodology for robust modulo EEG recovery.</description>

      <title>HiMAE: Hierarchical Masked Autoencoders Discover Resolution-Specific Structure in Wearable Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wearable sensors provide abundant physiological time series, yet the principles governing their predictive utility remain unclear. We hypothesize that temporal resolution is a fundamental axis of representation learning, with different clinical and behavioral outcomes relying on structure at distinct scales. To test this resolution hypothesis, we introduce HiMAE (Hierarchical Masked Autoencoder), a self supervised framework that combines masked autoencoding with a hierarchical convolutional encoder decoder. HiMAE produces multi resolution embeddings that enable systematic evaluation of which temporal scales carry predictive signal, transforming resolution from a hyperparameter into a probe for interpretability. Across classification, regression, and generative benchmarks, HiMAE consistently outperforms state of the art foundation models that collapse scale, while being orders of magnitude smaller. HiMAE is an efficient representation learner compact enough to run entirely on watch, achieving sub millisecond inference on smartwatch class CPUs for true edge inference. Together, these contributions position HiMAE as both an efficient self supervised learning method and a discovery tool for scale sensitive structure in wearable health.</description>

      <title>Coherence-Aware Distributed Learning under Heterogeneous Downlink Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of federated learning (FL) over wireless networks critically depends on accurate and timely channel state information (CSI) across distributed devices. This requirement is tightly linked to how rapidly the channel gains vary, i.e., the coherence intervals. In practice, edge devices often exhibit unequal coherence times due to differences in mobility and scattering environments, leading to unequal demands for pilot signaling and channel estimation resources. Conventional FL schemes that overlook this coherence disparity can suffer from severe communication inefficiencies and training overhead. This paper proposes a coherence-aware, communication-efficient framework for joint channel training and model updating in practical wireless FL systems operating under heterogeneous fading dynamics. Focusing on downlink impairments, we introduce a resource-reuse strategy based on product superposition, enabling the parameter server to efficiently schedule both static and dynamic devices by embedding global model updates for static devices within pilot transmissions intended for mobile devices. We theoretically analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed scheme and quantify its gains in expected communication efficiency and training accuracy. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework under mobility-induced dynamics and offer useful insights for the practical deployment of FL over wireless channels.</description>

      <title>Duality-Based Fixed Point Iteration Algorithm for Beamforming Design in ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the beamforming design problem in an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where a multi-antenna base station simultaneously serves multiple communication users while performing radar sensing. We formulate the problem as the minimization of the total transmit power, subject to signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints for communication users and mean-squared-error (MSE) constraints for radar sensing. The core challenge arises from the complex coupling between communication SINR requirements and sensing performance metrics. To efficiently address this challenge, we first establish the equivalence between the original ISAC beamforming problem and its semidefinite relaxation (SDR), derive its Lagrangian dual formulation, and further reformulate it as a generalized downlink beamforming (GDB) problem with potentially indefinite weighting matrices. Compared to the classical DB problem, the presence of indefinite weighting matrices in the GDB problem introduces substantial analytical and computational challenges. Our key technical contributions include (i) a necessary and sufficient condition for the boundedness of the GDB problem, and (ii) a tailored efficient fixed point iteration (FPI) algorithm with a provable convergence guarantee for solving the GDB problem. Building upon these results, we develop a duality-based fixed point iteration (Dual-FPI) algorithm, which integrates an outer subgradient ascent loop with an inner FPI loop. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed Dual-FPI algorithm achieves globally optimal solutions while significantly reducing computational complexity compared with existing baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>Efficient Spectral Efficiency Maximization Design for IRS-aided MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven by the growing demand for higher spectral efficiency in wireless communications, intelligent reflecting sur- faces (IRS) have attracted considerable attention for their ability to dynamically reconfigure the propagation environment. This work addresses the spectral efficiency maximization problem in IRS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which involves the joint optimization of the transmit precoding matrix and the IRS phase shift configuration. This problem is inherently challenging due to its non-convex nature. To tackle it effectively, we introduce a computationally efficient algorithm, termed ADMM-APG, which integrates the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with the accelerated projected gradient (APG) method. The proposed framework decomposes the original problem into tractable subproblems, each admitting a closed-form solution while maintaining low computational com- plexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the ADMM-APG algorithm consistently surpasses existing benchmark methods in terms of spectral efficiency and computational complexity, achieving significant performance gains across a range of system configurations.</description>

      <title>Low-Altitude UAV-Carried Movable Antenna for Joint Wireless Power Transfer and Covert Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) networks has created an urgent need for sustainable energy solutions, particularly for the battery-constrained spatially distributed IoT nodes. While low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) employed with wireless power transfer (WPT) capabilities offer a promising solution, the line-of-sight channels that facilitate efficient energy delivery also expose sensitive operational data to adversaries. This paper proposes a novel low-altitude UAV-carried movable antenna-enhanced transmission system joint WPT and covert communications, which simultaneously performs energy supplements to IoT nodes and establishes transmission links with a covert user by leveraging wireless energy signals as a natural cover. Then, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem that jointly maximizes the total harvested energy of IoT nodes and sum achievable rate of the covert user, while minimizing the propulsion energy consumption of the low-altitude UAV. To address the non-convex and temporally coupled optimization problem, we propose a mixture-of-experts-augmented soft actor-critic (MoE-SAC) algorithm that employs a sparse Top-K gated mixture-of-shallow-experts architecture to represent multimodal policy distributions arising from the conflicting optimization objectives. We also incorporate an action projection module that explicitly enforces per-time-slot power budget constraints and antenna position constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms some baseline approaches and other state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Pareto-Optimal Sampling and Resource Allocation for Timely Communication in Shared-Spectrum Low-Altitude Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Guaranteeing stringent data freshness for low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in shared spectrum forces a critical trade-off between two operational costs: the UAV's own energy consumption and the occupation of terrestrial channel resources. The core challenge is to satisfy the aerial data freshness while finding a Pareto-optimal balance between these costs. Leveraging predictive channel models and predictive UAV trajectories, we formulate a bi-objective Pareto optimization problem over a long-term planning horizon to jointly optimize the sampling timing for aerial traffic and the power and spectrum allocation for fair coexistence. However, the problem's non-convex, mixed-integer nature renders classical methods incapable of fully characterizing the complete Pareto frontier. Notably, we show monotonicity properties of the frontier, building on which we transform the bi-objective problem into several single-objective problems. We then propose a new graph-based algorithm and prove that it can find the complete set of Pareto optima with low complexity, linear in the horizon and near-quadratic in the resource block (RB) budget. Numerical comparisons show that our approach meets the stringent timeliness requirement and achieves a six-fold reduction in RB utilization or a 6 dB energy saving compared to benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Non-Convex Over-the-Air Heterogeneous Federated Learning: A Bias-Variance Trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming \emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous} wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured, time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL baselines.</description>

      <title>Sum-Rate Maximization for Pinching Antenna-assisted NOMA Systems with Multiple Dielectric Waveguides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10060v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the resource allocation design for a pinching antenna (PA)-assisted multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system featuring multiple dielectric waveguides. To enhance model accuracy, we propose a novel frequency-dependent power attenuation model for the dielectric waveguides in PA-assisted systems. By jointly optimizing the precoder vector and the PA placement, we aim to maximize the system's sum-rate while accounting for the power attenuation across the dielectric waveguides. The design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem. To effectively address the problem at hand, we introduce an alternating optimization-based algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution in polynomial time. Our results demonstrate that the proposed PA-assisted system not only significantly outperforms the conventional system but also surpasses a naive PA-assisted system that disregards power attenuation. The performance gain compared to the naive PA-assisted system becomes more pronounced at high carrier frequencies, emphasizing the importance of considering power attenuation in system design.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning competition to grade EEG background patterns in newborns with hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has the potential to support and improve expert performance in monitoring the brain function of at-risk newborns. Developing accurate and reliable ML models depends on access to high-quality, annotated data, a resource in short supply. ML competitions address this need by providing researchers access to expertly annotated datasets, fostering shared learning through direct model comparisons, and leveraging the benefits of crowdsourcing diverse expertise. We compiled a retrospective dataset containing 353 hours of EEG from 102 individual newborns from a multi-centre study. The data was fully anonymised and divided into training, testing, and held-out validation datasets. EEGs were graded for the severity of abnormal background patterns. Next, we created a web-based competition platform and hosted a machine learning competition to develop ML models for classifying the severity of EEG background patterns in newborns. After the competition closed, the top 4 performing models were evaluated offline on a separate held-out validation dataset. Although a feature-based model ranked first on the testing dataset, deep learning models generalised better on the validation sets. All methods had a significant decline in validation performance compared to the testing performance. This highlights the challenges for model generalisation on unseen data, emphasising the need for held-out validation datasets in ML studies with neonatal EEG. The study underscores the importance of training ML models on large and diverse datasets to ensure robust generalisation. The competition's outcome demonstrates the potential for open-access data and collaborative ML development to foster a collaborative research environment and expedite the development of clinical decision-support tools for neonatal neuromonitoring.</description>

      <title>An Attention-Enhanced {\Phi}-OTDR Event Recognition Framework for Edge-Based Distributed Acoustic Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometry {\Phi}-OTDR has emerged as a promising sensing technology in Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructures, enabling large-scale distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) for real-time monitoring at the edge in smart cities, industrial pipelines, and critical infrastructures. However, accurately recognizing events from massive {\Phi}-OTDR data streams remains challenging, as existing deep learning methods either disrupt the inherent spatiotemporal structure of signals or incur prohibitive computational costs, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained edge computing scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel STFT-based Attention-Enhanced Convolutional Neural Network (STFT-AECNN), which represents multi-channel time-series data as stacked spectrograms to fully exploit their spatiotemporal characteristics while enabling efficient 2D CNN processing. A Spatial Efficient Attention Module (SEAM) is further introduced to adaptively emphasize the most informative channels, and a joint Cross-Entropy and Triplet loss is adopted to enhance the discriminability of the learned feature space. Extensive experiments on the public BJTU {\Phi}-OTDR dataset demonstrate that STFT-AECNN achieves a peak accuracy of 99.94% while maintaining high computational efficiency. These results highlight its potential for real-time, scalable, and robust event recognition in edge-based DAS systems, paving the way for reliable and intelligent IoT sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Holographic Transformers for Complex-Valued Signal Processing: Integrating Phase Interference into Self-Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex-valued signals encode both amplitude and phase, yet most deep models treat attention as real-valued correlation, overlooking interference effects. We introduce the Holographic Transformer, a physics-inspired architecture that incorporates wave interference principles into self-attention. Holographic attention modulates interactions by relative phase and coherently superimposes values, ensuring consistency between amplitude and phase. A dual-headed decoder simultaneously reconstructs the input and predicts task outputs, preventing phase collapse when losses prioritize magnitude over phase. We demonstrate that holographic attention implements a discrete interference operator and maintains phase consistency under linear mixing. Experiments on PolSAR image classification and wireless channel prediction show strong performance, achieving high classification accuracy and F1 scores, low regression error, and increased robustness to phase perturbations. These results highlight that enforcing physical consistency in attention leads to generalizable improvements in complex-valued learning and provides a unified, physics-based framework for coherent signal modeling. The code is available at https://github.com/EonHao/Holographic-Transformers.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Use-and-then-Forget (UatF) Bound: Fixed Point Algorithms for Statistical Max-Min Power Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce mathematical tools and fixed point algorithms for optimal statistical max-min power control in cellular and cell-less massive MIMO systems. Unlike previous studies that rely on the use-and-then-forget (UatF) lower bound on Shannon achievable (ergodic) rates, our proposed framework can deal with alternative bounds that explicitly consider perfect or imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the decoder. In doing so, we address limitations of UatF-based power control algorithms, which inherit the shortcomings of the UatF bound. For example, the UatF bound can be overly conservative: in extreme cases, under fully statistical (nonadaptive) beamforming in zero-mean channels, the UatF bound produces trivial (zero) rate bounds. It also lacks scale invariance: merely scaling the beamformers can change the bound drastically. In contrast, our framework is compatible with information-theoretic bounds that do not suffer from the above drawbacks. We illustrate the framework by solving a max-min power control problem considering a standard bound that exploits instantaneous CSI at the decoder.</description>

      <title>Time Weaver: A Conditional Time Series Generation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imagine generating a city's electricity demand pattern based on weather, the presence of an electric vehicle, and location, which could be used for capacity planning during a winter freeze. Such real-world time series are often enriched with paired heterogeneous contextual metadata (e.g., weather and location). Current approaches to time series generation often ignore this paired metadata. Additionally, the heterogeneity in metadata poses several practical challenges in adapting existing conditional generation approaches from the image, audio, and video domains to the time series domain. To address this gap, we introduce TIME WEAVER, a novel diffusion-based model that leverages the heterogeneous metadata in the form of categorical, continuous, and even time-variant variables to significantly improve time series generation. Additionally, we show that naive extensions of standard evaluation metrics from the image to the time series domain are insufficient. These metrics do not penalize conditional generation approaches for their poor specificity in reproducing the metadata-specific features in the generated time series. Thus, we innovate a novel evaluation metric that accurately captures the specificity of conditional generation and the realism of the generated time series. We show that TIME WEAVER outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), by up to 30% in downstream classification tasks on real-world energy, medical, air quality, and traffic datasets.</description>

      <title>Constrained Posterior Sampling: Time Series Generation with Hard Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating realistic time series samples is crucial for stress-testing models and protecting user privacy by using synthetic data. In engineering and safety-critical applications, these samples must meet certain hard constraints that are domain-specific or naturally imposed by physics or nature. Consider, for example, generating electricity demand patterns with constraints on peak demand times. This can be used to stress-test the functioning of power grids during adverse weather conditions. Existing approaches for generating constrained time series are either not scalable or degrade sample quality. To address these challenges, we introduce Constrained Posterior Sampling (CPS), a diffusion-based sampling algorithm that aims to project the posterior mean estimate into the constraint set after each denoising update. Notably, CPS scales to a large number of constraints ($\sim100$) without requiring additional training. We provide theoretical justifications highlighting the impact of our projection step on sampling. Empirically, CPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in sample quality and similarity to real time series by around 70\% and 22\%, respectively, on real-world stocks, traffic, and air quality datasets.</description>

      <title>SignalLLM: A General-Purpose LLM Agent Framework for Automated Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern signal processing (SP) pipelines, whether model-based or data-driven, often constrained by complex and fragmented workflow, rely heavily on expert knowledge and manual engineering, and struggle with adaptability and generalization under limited data. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning capabilities, broad general-purpose knowledge, in-context learning, and cross-modal transfer abilities, positioning them as powerful tools for automating and generalizing SP workflows. Motivated by these potentials, we introduce SignalLLM, the first general-purpose LLM-based agent framework for general SP tasks. Unlike prior LLM-based SP approaches that are limited to narrow applications or tricky prompting, SignalLLM introduces a principled, modular architecture. It decomposes high-level SP goals into structured subtasks via in-context learning and domain-specific retrieval, followed by hierarchical planning through adaptive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and refinement; these subtasks are then executed through prompt-based reasoning, cross-modal reasoning, code synthesis, model invocation, or data-driven LLM-assisted modeling. Its generalizable design enables the flexible selection of problem solving strategies across different signal modalities, task types, and data conditions. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of SignalLLM through five representative tasks in communication and sensing, such as radar target detection, human activity recognition, and text compression. Experimental results show superior performance over traditional and existing LLM-based methods, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot settings.</description>
