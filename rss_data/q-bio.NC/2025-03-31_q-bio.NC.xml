      <title>Meta-Representational Predictive Coding: Biomimetic Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning has become an increasingly important paradigm in the domain of machine intelligence. Furthermore, evidence for self-supervised adaptation, such as contrastive formulations, has emerged in recent computational neuroscience and brain-inspired research. Nevertheless, current work on self-supervised learning relies on biologically implausible credit assignment -- in the form of backpropagation of errors -- and feedforward inference, typically a forward-locked pass. Predictive coding, in its mechanistic form, offers a biologically plausible means to sidestep these backprop-specific limitations. However, unsupervised predictive coding rests on learning a generative model of raw pixel input (akin to ``generative AI'' approaches), which entails predicting a potentially high dimensional input; on the other hand, supervised predictive coding, which learns a mapping between inputs to target labels, requires human annotation, and thus incurs the drawbacks of supervised learning. In this work, we present a scheme for self-supervised learning within a neurobiologically plausible framework that appeals to the free energy principle, constructing a new form of predictive coding that we call meta-representational predictive coding (MPC). MPC sidesteps the need for learning a generative model of sensory input (e.g., pixel-level features) by learning to predict representations of sensory input across parallel streams, resulting in an encoder-only learning and inference scheme. This formulation rests on active inference (in the form of sensory glimpsing) to drive the learning of representations, i.e., the representational dynamics are driven by sequences of decisions made by the model to sample informative portions of its sensorium.</description>

      <title>NeuroLIP: Interpretable and Fair Cross-Modal Alignment of fMRI and Phenotypic Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) connectivity data with phenotypic textual descriptors (e.g., disease label, demographic data) holds significant potential to advance our understanding of neurological conditions. However, existing cross-modal alignment methods often lack interpretability and risk introducing biases by encoding sensitive attributes together with diagnostic-related features. In this work, we propose NeuroLIP, a novel cross-modal contrastive learning framework. We introduce text token-conditioned attention (TTCA) and cross-modal alignment via localized tokens (CALT) to the brain region-level embeddings with each disease-related phenotypic token. It improves interpretability via token-level attention maps, revealing brain region-disease associations. To mitigate bias, we propose a loss for sensitive attribute disentanglement that maximizes the attention distance between disease tokens and sensitive attribute tokens, reducing unintended correlations in downstream predictions. Additionally, we incorporate a negative gradient technique that reverses the sign of CALT loss on sensitive attributes, further discouraging the alignment of these features. Experiments on neuroimaging datasets (ABIDE and ADHD-200) demonstrate NeuroLIP's superiority in terms of fairness metrics while maintaining the overall best standard metric performance. Qualitative visualization of attention maps highlights neuroanatomical patterns aligned with diagnostic characteristics, validated by the neuroscientific literature. Our work advances the development of transparent and equitable neuroimaging AI.</description>

      <title>Population Transformer: Learning Population-level Representations of Neural Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03044v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a self-supervised framework that learns population-level codes for arbitrary ensembles of neural recordings at scale. We address key challenges in scaling models with neural time-series data, namely, sparse and variable electrode distribution across subjects and datasets. The Population Transformer (PopT) stacks on top of pretrained temporal embeddings and enhances downstream decoding by enabling learned aggregation of multiple spatially-sparse data channels. The pretrained PopT lowers the amount of data required for downstream decoding experiments, while increasing accuracy, even on held-out subjects and tasks. Compared to end-to-end methods, this approach is computationally lightweight, while achieving similar or better decoding performance. We further show how our framework is generalizable to multiple time-series embeddings and neural data modalities. Beyond decoding, we interpret the pretrained and fine-tuned PopT models to show how they can be used to extract neuroscience insights from large amounts of data. We release our code as well as a pretrained PopT to enable off-the-shelf improvements in multi-channel intracranial data decoding and interpretability.
