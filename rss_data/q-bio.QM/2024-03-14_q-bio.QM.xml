      <title>Unsupervised self-organising map of prostate cell Raman spectra shows disease-state subclustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prostate cancer is a disease which poses an interesting clinical question: should it be treated? A small subset of prostate cancers are aggressive and require removal and treatment to prevent metastatic spread. However, conventional diagnostics remain challenged to risk-stratify such patients, hence, new methods of approach to biomolecularly subclassify the disease are needed. Here we use an unsupervised, self-organising map approach to analyse live-cell Raman spectroscopy data obtained from prostate cell-lines; our aim is to test the feasibility of this method to differentiate, at the single-cell-level, cancer from normal using high-dimensional datasets with minimal preprocessing. The results demonstrate not only successful separation of normal prostate and cancer cells, but also a new subclustering of the prostate cancer cell-line into two groups. Initial analysis of the spectra from each of the cancer subclusters demonstrates a differential expression of lipids, which, against the normal control, may be linked to disease-related changes in cellular signalling.</description>

      <title>Neural, Muscular, and Perceptual responses with shoulder exoskeleton use over Days</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive shoulder exoskeletons have been widely introduced in the industry to aid upper extremity movements during repetitive overhead work. As an ergonomic intervention, it is important to understand how users adapt to these devices over time and if these induce external stress while working. The study evaluated the use of an exoskeleton over a period of 3 days by assessing the neural, physiological, and perceptual responses of twenty-four participants by comparing a physical task against the same task with an additional cognitive workload. Over days adaptation to task irrespective of task and group were identified. Electromyography (EMG) analysis of shoulder and back muscles reveals lower muscle activity in the exoskeleton group irrespective of task. Functional connectivity analysis using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) reveals that exoskeletons benefit users by reducing task demands in the motor planning and execution regions. Sex-based differences were also identified in these neuromuscular assessments.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of Anti-Arrhythmic Drug Effects on Cardiac Electrophysiology using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to accurately infer cardiac electrophysiological (EP) properties is key to improving arrhythmia diagnosis and treatment. In this work, we developed a physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) framework to predict how different myocardial EP parameters are modulated by anti-arrhythmic drugs. Using $\textit{in vitro}$ optical mapping images and the 3-channel Fenton-Karma model, we estimated the changes in ionic channel conductance caused by these drugs.
  Our framework successfully characterised the action of drugs HMR1556, nifedipine and lidocaine - respectively, blockade of $I_{K}$, $I_{Ca}$, and $I_{Na}$ currents - by estimating that they decreased the respective channel conductance by $31.8\pm2.7\%$ $(p=8.2 \times 10^{-5})$, $80.9\pm21.6\%$ $(p=0.02)$, and $8.6\pm0.5\%$ $ (p=0.03)$, leaving the conductance of other channels unchanged. For carbenoxolone, whose main action is the blockade of intercellular gap junctions, PINNs also successfully predicted no significant changes $(p&gt;0.09)$ in all ionic conductances.
  Our results are an important step towards the deployment of PINNs for model parameter estimation from experimental data, bringing this framework closer to clinical or laboratory images analysis and for the personalisation of mathematical models.</description>

      <title>Elastic shape analysis computations for clustering left atrial appendage geometries of atrial fibrillation patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Morphological variations in the left atrial appendage (LAA) are associated with different levels of ischemic stroke risk for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Studying LAA morphology can elucidate mechanisms behind this association and lead to the development of advanced stroke risk stratification tools. However, current categorical descriptions of LAA morphologies are qualitative and inconsistent across studies, which impedes advancements in our understanding of stroke pathogenesis in AF. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a quantitative pipeline that combines elastic shape analysis with unsupervised learning for the categorization of LAA morphology in AF patients. As part of our pipeline, we compute pairwise elastic distances between LAA meshes from a cohort of 20 AF patients, and leverage these distances to cluster our shape data. We demonstrate that our method clusters LAA morphologies based on distinctive shape features, overcoming the innate inconsistencies of current LAA categorization systems, and paving the way for improved stroke risk metrics using objective LAA shape groups.</description>

      <title>MolBind: Multimodal Alignment of Language, Molecules, and Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in biology and chemistry have leveraged multi-modal learning, integrating molecules and their natural language descriptions to enhance drug discovery. However, current pre-training frameworks are limited to two modalities, and designing a unified network to process different modalities (e.g., natural language, 2D molecular graphs, 3D molecular conformations, and 3D proteins) remains challenging due to inherent gaps among them. In this work, we propose MolBind, a framework that trains encoders for multiple modalities through contrastive learning, mapping all modalities to a shared feature space for multi-modal semantic alignment. To facilitate effective pre-training of MolBind on multiple modalities, we also build and collect a high-quality dataset with four modalities, MolBind-M4, including graph-language, conformation-language, graph-conformation, and conformation-protein paired data. MolBind shows superior zero-shot learning performance across a wide range of tasks, demonstrating its strong capability of capturing the underlying semantics of multiple modalities.</description>

      <title>Pre-examinations Improve Automated Metastases Detection on Cranial MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials and methods: First, a dual-time approach was assessed, for which the CNN was provided sequences of the MRI that initially depicted new MM (diagnosis MRI) as well as of a prediagnosis MRI: inclusion of only contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (CNNdual_ce) was compared with inclusion of also the native T1-weighted images, T2-weighted images, and FLAIR sequences of both time points (CNNdual_all).Second, results were compared with the corresponding single time approaches, in which the CNN was provided exclusively the respective sequences of the diagnosis MRI.Casewise diagnostic performance parameters were calculated from 5-fold cross-validation.
  Results: In total, 94 cases with 494 MMs were included. Overall, the highest diagnostic performance was achieved by inclusion of only the contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images of the diagnosis and of a prediagnosis MRI (CNNdual_ce, sensitivity = 73%, PPV = 25%, F1-score = 36%). Using exclusively contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images as input resulted in significantly less false-positives (FPs) compared with inclusion of further sequences beyond contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (FPs = 5/7 for CNNdual_ce/CNNdual_all, P &lt; 1e-5). Comparison of contrast-enhanced dual and mono time approaches revealed that exclusion of prediagnosis MRI significantly increased FPs (FPs = 5/10 for CNNdual_ce/CNNce, P &lt; 1e-9).Approaches with only native sequences were clearly inferior to CNNs that were provided contrast-enhanced sequences.
  Conclusions: Automated MM detection on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images performed with high sensitivity. Frequent FPs due to artifacts and vessels were significantly reduced by additional inclusion of prediagnosis MRI, but not by inclusion of further sequences beyond contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images. Future studies might investigate different change detection architectures for computer-aided detection.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Sleep Staging with Synthetic Time Series Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing electroencephalographic (EEG) time series can be challenging, especially with deep neural networks, due to the large variability among human subjects and often small datasets. To address these challenges, various strategies, such as self-supervised learning, have been suggested, but they typically rely on extensive empirical datasets. Inspired by recent advances in computer vision, we propose a pretraining task termed "frequency pretraining" to pretrain a neural network for sleep staging by predicting the frequency content of randomly generated synthetic time series. Our experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses fully supervised learning in scenarios with limited data and few subjects, and matches its performance in regimes with many subjects. Furthermore, our results underline the relevance of frequency information for sleep stage scoring, while also demonstrating that deep neural networks utilize information beyond frequencies to enhance sleep staging performance, which is consistent with previous research. We anticipate that our approach will be advantageous across a broad spectrum of applications where EEG data is limited or derived from a small number of subjects, including the domain of brain-computer interfaces.</description>

      <title>PTransIPs: Identification of phosphorylation sites enhanced by protein PLM embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05115v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phosphorylation is pivotal in numerous fundamental cellular processes and plays a significant role in the onset and progression of various diseases. The accurate identification of these phosphorylation sites is crucial for unraveling the molecular mechanisms within cells and during viral infections, potentially leading to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets. In this study, we develop PTransIPs, a new deep learning framework for the identification of phosphorylation sites. Independent testing results demonstrate that PTransIPs outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving AUCs of 0.9232 and 0.9660 for the identification of phosphorylated S/T and Y sites, respectively. PTransIPs contributes from three aspects. 1) PTransIPs is the first to apply protein pre-trained language model (PLM) embeddings to this task. It utilizes ProtTrans and EMBER2 to extract sequence and structure embeddings, respectively, as additional inputs into the model, effectively addressing issues of dataset size and overfitting, thus enhancing model performance; 2) PTransIPs is based on Transformer architecture, optimized through the integration of convolutional neural networks and TIM loss function, providing practical insights for model design and training; 3) The encoding of amino acids in PTransIPs enables it to serve as a universal framework for other peptide bioactivity tasks, with its excellent performance shown in extended experiments of this paper. Our code, data and models are publicly available at https://github.com/StatXzy7/PTransIPs.</description>

      <title>Modern approaches to improving phase contrast electron microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although defocus can be used to generate partial phase contrast in transmission electron microscope images, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) can be further improved by the development of phase plates which increase contrast by applying a phase shift to the unscattered part of the electron beam. Many approaches have been investigated, including the ponderomotive interaction between light and electrons. We review the recent successes achieved with this method in high-resolution, single-particle cryo-EM. We also review the status of using pulsed or near-field enhanced laser light as alternatives, along with approaches that use scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) with a segmented detector rather than a phase plate.</description>

      <title>A Hitchhiker's Guide to Geometric GNNs for 3D Atomic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in computational modelling of atomic systems, spanning molecules, proteins, and materials, represent them as geometric graphs with atoms embedded as nodes in 3D Euclidean space. In these graphs, the geometric attributes transform according to the inherent physical symmetries of 3D atomic systems, including rotations and translations in Euclidean space, as well as node permutations. In recent years, Geometric Graph Neural Networks have emerged as the preferred machine learning architecture powering applications ranging from protein structure prediction to molecular simulations and material generation. Their specificity lies in the inductive biases they leverage - such as physical symmetries and chemical properties - to learn informative representations of these geometric graphs.
  In this opinionated paper, we provide a comprehensive and self-contained overview of the field of Geometric GNNs for 3D atomic systems. We cover fundamental background material and introduce a pedagogical taxonomy of Geometric GNN architectures: (1) invariant networks, (2) equivariant networks in Cartesian basis, (3) equivariant networks in spherical basis, and (4) unconstrained networks. Additionally, we outline key datasets and application areas and suggest future research directions. The objective of this work is to present a structured perspective on the field, making it accessible to newcomers and aiding practitioners in gaining an intuition for its mathematical abstractions.</description>

      <title>AI-powered simulation-based inference of a genuinely spatial-stochastic model of early mouse embryogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how multicellular organisms reliably orchestrate cell-fate decisions is a central challenge in developmental biology. This is particularly intriguing in early mammalian development, where early cell-lineage differentiation arises from processes that initially appear cell-autonomous but later materialize reliably at the tissue level. In this study, we develop a multi-scale, spatial-stochastic simulator of mouse embryogenesis, focusing on inner-cell mass (ICM) differentiation in the blastocyst stage. Our model features biophysically realistic regulatory interactions and accounts for the innate stochasticity of the biological processes driving cell-fate decisions at the cellular scale. We advance event-driven simulation techniques to incorporate relevant tissue-scale phenomena and integrate them with Simulation-Based Inference (SBI), building on a recent AI-based parameter learning method: the Sequential Neural Posterior Estimation (SNPE) algorithm. Using this framework, we carry out a large-scale Bayesian inferential analysis and determine parameter sets that reproduce the experimentally observed system behavior. We elucidate how autocrine and paracrine feedbacks via the signaling protein FGF4 orchestrate the inherently stochastic expression of fate-specifying genes at the cellular level into reproducible ICM patterning at the tissue scale. This mechanism is remarkably independent of the system size. FGF4 not only ensures correct cell lineage ratios in the ICM, but also enhances its resilience to perturbations. Intriguingly, we find that high variability in intracellular initial conditions does not compromise, but rather can enhance the accuracy and precision of tissue-level dynamics. Our work provides a genuinely spatial-stochastic description of the biochemical processes driving ICM differentiation and the necessary conditions under which it can proceed robustly.</description>
