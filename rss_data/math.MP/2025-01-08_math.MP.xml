      <title>Dynamical space-time ray tracing and modified horizontal ray method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 'vertical modes and horizontal rays' method, commonly applied for simulating acoustic wave propagation in shallow water is advanced in this research. Our approach to this method involves the use of the so-called space-time rays, which are constructed by decomposing the time-dependent sound field into adiabatic vertical modes, the solutions to the Sturm-Liouville problem. The introduction of the time coordinate, while still considering it as an additional space coordinate instead of merely a parameter along the ray, allows us to describe the propagation of frequency-modulated signals in an effectively frequency-dispersive medium. The consideration of the extension of Hamiltonian ray-tracing methods (also used for the description of Gaussian beams and so-called quasiphotons) leads to a simple description of observable effects such as changes in modulation, time compression, differences between angles of phase and amplitude fronts, space-time caustics, etc., in dynamics - on the moving line or at some point of observation while having the general form of the source (for example, also a moving one).</description>

      <title>Atomic Higgsings of 6D SCFTs II: Induced Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a specific type of atomic Higgsings of the 6d $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ theories, which we call the induced flows. For the conformal matter theory associated with a pair of nilpotent orbits, the induced flows are given by the inductions of the orbits. We also consider the induced flows for the orbi-instanton theories (as well as some little string theories) that are associated with the homomorphisms from the discrete subgroups of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ to $E_8$. This gives a physical definition of the inductions among these discrete homomorphisms, analogous to the inductions of the nilpotent orbits. We analyze the Higgs branch dimensions, the monotonicity of the Weyl anomalies (or the 2-group structure constants for LSTs) and the brane pictures under the induced flows.</description>

      <title>On the non-submodularity of the problem of adding links to minimize the effective graph resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the optimisation problem of adding $k$ links to a given network, such that the resulting effective graph resistance is as small as possible. The problem was recently proven to be NP-hard, such that optimal solutions obtained with brute-force methods require exponentially many computation steps and thus are infeasible for any graph of realistic size. Therefore, it is common in such cases to use a simple greedy algorithm to obtain an approximation of the optimal solution. It is known that if the considered problem is submodular, the quality of the greedy solution can be guaranteed. However, it is known that the optimisation problem we are facing, is not submodular. For such cases one can use the notion of generalized submodularity, which is captured by the submodularity ratio $\gamma$. A performance bound, which is a function of $\gamma$, also exists in case of generalized submodularity. In this paper we give an example of a family of graphs where the submodularity ratio approaches zero, implying that the solution quality of the greedy algorithm cannot be guaranteed. Furthermore, we show that the greedy algorithm does not always yield the optimal solution and demonstrate that even for a small graph with 10 nodes, the ratio between the optimal and the greedy solution can be as small as 0.878.</description>

      <title>Crystals and Double Quiver Algebras from Jeffrey-Kirwan Residues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct statistical mechanical models of crystal melting describing the flavoured Witten indices of $\mathcal{N}\ge 2$ supersymmetric quiver gauge theories. Our results can be derived from the Jeffrey-Kirwan (JK) residue formulas, and generalize the previous results for quivers corresponding to toric Calabi-Yau threefolds and fourfolds to a large class of quivers satisfying the no-overlap condition, including those corresponding to some non-toric Calabi-Yau manifolds. We construct new quiver algebras which we call the double quiver Yangians/algebras, as well as their representations in terms of the aforementioned crystals. For theories with four supercharges, we compare the double quiver algebras with the existing quiver Yangians/BPS algebras, which we show can also be constructed from the JK residues. For theories with two supercharges, the double quiver algebras provide an algebraic description of the BPS states, including the information of the fixed points and their relative coefficients in the full partition functions.</description>

      <title>Breather gas and shielding for the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with nonzero backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Breathers have been experimentally and theoretically found in many physical systems -- in particular, in integrable nonlinear-wave models. A relevant problem is to study the \textit{breather gas}, which is the limit, for $N\rightarrow \infty $, of $N$-breather solutions. In this paper, we investigate the breather gas in the framework of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (NLS) equation with nonzero boundary conditions, using the inverse scattering transform and Riemann-Hilbert problem. We address aggregate states in the form of $N$-breather solutions, when the respective discrete spectra are concentrated in specific domains. We show that the breather gas coagulates into a single-breather solution whose spectral eigenvalue is located at the center of the circle domain, and a multi-breather solution for the higher-degree quadrature concentration domain. These coagulation phenomena in the breather gas are called \textit{breather shielding}. In particular, when the nonzero boundary conditions vanish, the breather gas reduces to an $n$-soliton solution. When the discrete eigenvalues are concentrated on a line, we derive the corresponding Riemann-Hilbert problem. When the discrete spectrum is uniformly distributed within an ellipse, it is equivalent to the case of the line domain. These results may be useful to design experiments with breathers in physical settings.</description>

      <title>On the $N_\infty$-soliton asymptotics for the modified Camassa-Holm equation with linear dispersion and vanishing boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the $N_{\infty}$-soliton asymptotics for the modified Camassa-Holm (mCH) equation with linear dispersion and boundaries vanishing at infinity: $m_t+(m(u^2-u_x^2)^2)_x+\kappa u_x=0,\quad m=u-u_{xx}$ with $\lim_{x\rightarrow \pm \infty }u(x,t)=0$. We mainly analyze the aggregation state of $N$-soliton solutions of the mCH equation expressed by the solution of the modified Riemann-Hilbert problem in the new $(y,t)$-space when the discrete spectra are located in different regions. Starting from the modified RH problem, we find that i) when the region is a quadrature domain with $\ell=n=1$, the corresponding $N_{\infty}$-soliton is the one-soliton solution which the discrete spectral point is the center of the region; ii) when the region is a quadrature domain with $\ell=n$, the corresponding $N_{\infty}$-soliton is an $n$-soliton solution; iii) when the discrete spectra lie in the line region, we provide its corresponding Riemann-Hilbert problem,; and iv) when the discrete spectra lie in an elliptic region, it is equivalent to the case of the line region.</description>

      <title>On Large-Space and Long-Time Asymptotic Behaviors of Kink-Soliton Gases in the Sine-Gordon Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the large-space and long-time asymptotics of kink-soliton gases in the sine-Gordon (sG) equation, addressing an important open problem highlighted in the recent work [Phys. Rev. E 109 (2024) 061001]. We focus on kink-soliton gases modeled within a Riemann-Hilbert framework and characterized by two types of generalized reflection coefficients, each defined on the interval $[\eta_1, \eta_2]$: $r_0(\lambda) = (\lambda - \eta_1)^{\beta_1} (\eta_2 - \lambda)^{\beta_2} |\lambda - \eta_0|^{\beta_0} \gamma(\lambda)$ and $r_c(\lambda) = (\lambda - \eta_1)^{\beta_1} (\eta_2 - \lambda)^{\beta_2} \chi_c(\lambda) \gamma(\lambda)$, where $0 &lt; \eta_1 &lt; \eta_0 &lt; \eta_2$ and $\beta_j &gt; -1$, \(\gamma(\lambda)\) is a continuous, strictly positive function defined on $[\eta_1, \eta_2]$. The function \(\chi_c(\lambda)\) demonstrates a step-like behavior: it is given by \(\chi_c(\lambda) = 1\) for \(\lambda \in [\eta_1, \eta_0)\) and \(\chi_c(\lambda) = c^2\) for \(\lambda \in (\eta_0, \eta_2]\), with \(c\) as a positive constant distinct from one. To rigorously derive the asymptotic results, we leverage the Deift-Zhou steepest descent method. A central component of this approach is constructing an appropriate \(g\)-function for the conjugation process. Unlike in the KdV equation, the sG presents unique challenges for \(g\)-function formulation, particularly concerning the singularity at the origin. The Riemann-Hilbert problem also requires carefully constructed local parametrices near endpoints \(\eta_j\) and the singularity \(\eta_0\). At the endpoints \(\eta_j\), we employ a modified Bessel parametrix of the first kind. For the singularity \(\eta_0\), the parametrix selection depends on the reflection coefficient: the second kind of modified Bessel parametrix is used for \(r_0(\lambda)\), while a confluent hypergeometric parametrix is applied for \(r_c(\lambda)\).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pressure function is a fundamental object in various areas of mathematics. Its regularity is studied to derive insights into phase transitions in certain physical systems or to determine the Hausdorff dimension of self-affine sets. In this paper, we prove the analyticity of the pressure function for products of non-invertible matrices satisfying an irreducibility and a contractivity assumptions. Additionally, we establish a variational principle for the pressure function, thereby generalizing previous results.</description>

      <title>Controlling the low-temperature Ising model using spatiotemporal Markov decision theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the spatiotemporal Markov decision process (STMDP), a special type of Markov decision process that models sequential decision-making problems which are not only characterized by temporal, but also by spatial interaction structures. To illustrate the framework, we construct an STMDP inspired by the low-temperature two-dimensional Ising model on a finite, square lattice, evolving according to the Metropolis dynamics. We consider the situation in which an external decision maker aims to drive the system towards the all-plus configuration by flipping spins at specified moments in time. In order to analyze this problem, we construct an auxiliary MDP by means of a reduction of the configuration space to the local minima of the Hamiltonian. Leveraging the convenient form of this auxiliary MDP, we uncover the structure of the optimal policy by solving the Bellman equations in a recursive manner. Finally, we conduct a numerical study on the performance of the optimal policy obtained from the auxiliary MDP in the original Ising STMDP.</description>

      <title>Concentration of Empirical First-Passage Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-passage properties are central to the kinetics of target-search processes. Theoretical approaches so far primarily focused on predicting first-passage statistics for a given process or model. In practice, however, one faces the reverse problem of inferring first-passage statistics from, typically sub-sampled, experimental or simulation data. Obtaining trustworthy estimates from under-sampled data and unknown underlying dynamics remains a daunting task, and the assessment of the uncertainty is imperative. In this chapter, we highlight recent progress in understanding and controlling finite-sample effects in empirical first-passage times of reversible Markov processes. Precisely, we present concentration inequalities bounding from above the deviations of the sample mean for any sample size from the true mean first-passage time and construct non-asymptotic confidence intervals. Moreover, we present two-sided bounds on the range of fluctuations, i.e, deviations of the expected maximum and minimum from the mean in any given sample, which control uncertainty even in situations where the mean is a priori not a sufficient statistic.</description>

      <title>Bekenstein Bound for Approximately Local Charged States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the energy-entropy ratio inequality in quantum field theory (QFT) established by one of us from localized states to a larger class of states. The states considered in this paper can be in a charged (non-vacuum) representation of the QFT or may be only approximately localized in the region under consideration. Our inequality is $S(\Psi |\!| \Omega) \le 2\pi R \, ( \Psi, H_\rho \Psi ) + \log d(\rho) + \varepsilon$, where $S$ is the relative entropy, where $R$ is a "radius" (width) characterizing the size of the region, $d(\rho)$ is the statistical (quantum) dimension of the given charged sector $\rho$ hosting the quantum state $\Psi$, $\Omega$ is the vacuum state, $H_\rho$ is the Hamiltonian in the charged sector, and $\varepsilon$ is a tolerance measuring the deviation of $\Psi$ from the vacuum according to observers in the causal complement of the region.</description>

Abstract: Let $R$ be a unitary operator whose spectrum is the circle. We show that the set of unitaries $U$ which essentially commute with $R$ (i.e., $[U,R]\equiv UR-RU$ is compact) is path-connected. Moreover, we also calculate the set of path-connected components of the orthogonal projections which essentially commute with $R$ and obey a non-triviality condition, and prove it is bijective with $\mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <title>Mixing times for the open ASEP at the triple point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider mixing times for the open asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) at the triple point. We show that the mixing time of the open ASEP on a segment of length $N$ for bias parameter $q$ is of order $N^{3/2+\kappa}$ if $1-q \asymp N^{-\kappa}$ for some $\kappa \in [0,\frac{1}{2})$, and the same result with poly-logarithmic corrections for $\kappa=\frac{1}{2}$. Our proof combines a fine analysis of the current of the open ASEP, moderate deviations of second class particles, the censoring inequality, and various couplings and multi-species extensions of the ASEP. Moreover, we establish a comparison between moderate deviations for the current of the open ASEP and the ASEP on the integers, as well as bounds on mixing times for the open ASEP in the weakly high density phase, which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Stabilising effect of generic anomalous diffusion independent of the Rayleigh number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the influence of a generic anomalous diffusion model on mass convection in a fluid-saturated porous medium, focusing on superdiffusive regimes. A mathematical model is developed, and tability analyses - both linear and nonlinear - are performed. Results demonstrate that the specific form of the time function describing anomalous diffusion significantly affects system stability, allowing stability to persist beyond the classical Rayleigh-B\'enard neutral threshold. Furthermore, transient perturbation growth is observed under certain conditions, followed by eventual decay. The paper systematically examines various memory functions, including power-law, exponential, and logarithmic forms, highlighting their impact on the dynamics of disturbances. The findings underscore the importance of anomalous diffusion in modulating stability and provide new insights into the transient behaviours induced by non-Fickian mass transport.</description>

      <title>Violation of Ferromagnetic Ordering of Energy Levels in Spin Rings for the Singlet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12773v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a violation of the ``ferromagnetic ordering of energy levels'' conjecture (FOEL) for even length spin rings. The FOEL conjecture was a guess made by Nachtergaele, Spitzer and an author for the Heisenberg model on certain graphs: a family of inequalities, the first of which is the statement that the spectral gap of the Heisenberg model equals the gap of the random walk. That first guess was originally a conjecture of Aldous which was later proved by Caputo, Liggett and Richthammer. We claim that for spin rings of even length $L&gt;4$, the lowest spin $S=0$ energy is lower than the lowest spin $S=1$ energy. This violates the $(L/2)$-th inequality in the FOEL conjecture.
  Our methodology is largely numerical: we have applied exact diagonalization up to $L=20$. We also rigorously consider the Hamiltonian of the Heisenberg spin ring for even length $L$ projected to the spin $S=0$ sector. We prove that it has a unique ground state. Then, using the single mode approximation the uniqueness explains the energy turn-around. Important insight comes from reconsideration of previous work by Sutherland, using the Bethe ansatz. Especially important is a work of Dhar and Shastry that goes beyond the Bethe ansatz.</description>

      <title>Connection formulae for the radial Toda equations I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16550v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is the first in a forthcoming series of works where the authors study the global asymptotic behavior of the radial solutions of the 2D periodic Toda equation of type $A_n$. The principal issue is the connection formulae between the asymptotic parameters describing the behavior of the general solution at zero and infinity. To reach this goal we are using a fusion of the PDE analysis and the Riemann-Hilbert nonlinear steepest descent method of Deift and Zhou which is applicable to 2D Toda in view of its Lax integrability. A principal technical challenge is the extension of the nonlinear steepest descent analysis to Riemann-Hilbert problems of matrix rank greater than $2$. In this paper, we meet this challenge for the case $n=2$ (the rank $3$ case) and it already captures the principal features of the general $n$ case.</description>

      <title>Generalization of Arnold's $J^+$-invariant for pairs of immersions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.04349v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the $J^{2+}$-invariant for oriented pairs of generic immersions. This invariant behaves like Arnold's $J^+$-invariant for generic immersions as it is invariant when going through inverse tangencies and triple points, but changes when traversing direct tangencies. It has several useful properties, for example its independence of the $J^+$-invariants of the single immersions forming the pair. Also it is invariant under simultaneous orientation change. Therefore, one can define two $J^{2+}$-invariants for each pair depending on its orientation, those two invariants are not independent from each other. Furthermore the invariant is extended to the $J^{n+}$-invariant for links of n oriented immersions.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of universality in the anyon model described by the $SU(2)$ Witten-Chern-Simons theory at level $k$. A classic theorem of Freedman-Larsen-Wang states that for $k \geq 3, \ k \neq 4$, braiding of the anyons of topological charge $1/2$ is universal for topological quantum computing. For the case of one qubit, we prove a stronger result that double-braiding of such anyons alone is already universal.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Reversibility and A New Theory of Causal Emergence based on SVD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15054v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of causal emergence (CE) with effective information (EI) posits that complex systems can exhibit CE, where macro-dynamics show stronger causal effects than micro-dynamics. A key challenge of this theory is its dependence on coarse-graining method. In this paper, we introduce a fresh concept of approximate dynamical reversibility and establish a novel framework for CE based on this. By applying singular value decomposition(SVD) to Markov dynamics, we find that the essence of CE lies in the presence of redundancy, represented by the irreversible and correlated information pathways. Therefore, CE can be quantified as the potential maximal efficiency increase for dynamical reversibility or information transmission. We also demonstrate a strong correlation between the approximate dynamical reversibility and EI, establishing an equivalence between the SVD and EI maximization frameworks for quantifying CE, supported by theoretical insights and numerical examples from Boolean networks, cellular automata, and complex networks. Importantly, our SVD-based CE framework is independent of specific coarse-graining techniques and effectively captures the fundamental characteristics of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Six decades of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model: A guide through its spatio-temporal dynamics and influence across disciplines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11403v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The FitzHugh-Nagumo equation, originally conceived in neuroscience during the 1960s, became a key model providing a simplified view of excitable neuron cell behavior. Its applicability, however, extends beyond neuroscience into fields like cardiac physiology, cell division, population dynamics, electronics, and other natural phenomena. In this review spanning six decades of research, we discuss the diverse spatio-temporal dynamical behaviors described by the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation. These include dynamics like bistability, oscillations, and excitability, but it also addresses more complex phenomena such as traveling waves and extended patterns in coupled systems. The review serves as a guide for modelers aiming to utilize the strengths of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model to capture generic dynamical behavior. It not only catalogs known dynamical states and bifurcations, but also extends previous studies by providing stability and bifurcation analyses for coupled spatial systems.</description>

      <title>Wave-driven phase wave patterns in a ring of FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a biomimetic model that simulates a cell, with the internal cytoplasm represented by a two-dimensional circular domain and the external cortex by a surrounding ring, both modeled using FitzHugh-Nagumo systems. The external ring is dynamically influenced by a pacemaker-driven wave originating from the internal domain, leading to the emergence of three distinct dynamical states based on the varying strengths of coupling. The range of dynamics observed includes phase patterning, the propagation of phase waves, and interactions between traveling and phase waves. A simplified linear model effectively explains the mechanisms behind the variety of phase patterns observed, providing insights into the complex interplay between a cell's internal and external environments.</description>

      <title>Lattice Models for Phases and Transitions with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05964v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-invertible categorical symmetries have emerged as a powerful tool to uncover new beyond-Landau phases of matter, both gapped and gapless, along with second order phase transitions between them. The general theory of such phases in (1+1)d has been studied using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), also known as topological holography. This has unearthed the infrared (IR) structure of these phases and transitions. In this paper, we describe how the SymTFT information can be converted into an ultraviolet (UV) anyonic chain lattice model realizing, in the IR limit, these phases and transitions. In many cases, the Hilbert space of the anyonic chain is tensor product decomposable and the model can be realized as a quantum spin-chain Hamiltonian. We also describe operators acting on the lattice models that are charged under non-invertible symmetries and act as order parameters for the phases and transitions. In order to fully describe the action of non-invertible symmetries, it is crucial to understand the symmetry twisted sectors of the lattice models, which we describe in detail. Throughout the paper, we illustrate the general concepts using the symmetry category $\mathsf{Rep}(S_3)$ formed by representations of the permutation group $S_3$, but our procedure can be applied to any fusion category symmetry.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we compute the partition functions of $\mathcal{N}=1$ SUGRA for different boundary topologies, i.e. sphere and torus, using super-Virasoro TQFT. We use fusion and modular kernels of the super-Liouville theory to compute the necklace-channel conformal block and showcase formalism by proving that the inner product holds for superconformal blocks, defined as states in the Hilbert space. Finally, we compute the out-of-time-order correlator for the torus topology with superconformal primary insertions as matter using the tools of super-Virasoro TQFT and investigate its early-time behaviour.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interacting crystalline SPT phases were first classified by Thorngren and Else through the crystalline equivalence principle, suggesting that a spatial group symmetry can be treated as if it were an internal symmetry group. Using techniques from topology we elucidate how this principle holds for one of the proposals for the interacting bosonic case and yet fails for weak free fermion phases. Last we show how a variant of the principle does hold for strong crystalline free fermion phases, showing that it is not necessary for the cohomology theory to be of Borel type.</description>

      <title>Two transitions in complex eigenvalue statistics: Hermiticity and integrability breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open quantum systems have complex energy eigenvalues which are expected to follow non-Hermitian random matrix statistics when chaotic, or 2-dimensional (2d) Poisson statistics when integrable. We investigate the spectral properties of a many-body quantum spin chain, the Hermitian XXZ Heisenberg model with imaginary disorder. Its rich complex eigenvalue statistics is found to separately break both Hermiticity and integrability at different scales of the disorder strength. With no disorder, the system is integrable and Hermitian, with spectral statistics corresponding to the 1d Poisson point process. At very small disorder, we find a transition from 1d Poisson statistics to an effective $D$-dimensional Poisson point process, showing Hermiticity breaking. At intermediate disorder we find integrability breaking, as inferred from the statistics matching that of non-Hermitian complex symmetric random matrices in class AI$^\dag$. For large disorder, as the spins align, we recover the expected integrability (now in the non-Hermitian setup), indicated by 2d Poisson statistics. These conclusions are based on fitting the spin chain data of numerically generated nearest and next-to-nearest neighbour spacing distributions to an effective 2d Coulomb gas description at inverse temperature $\beta$. We confirm such an effective description of random matrices also applies in class AI$^\dag$ and AII$^\dag$ up to next-to-nearest neighbour spacings.</description>

      <title>Unifying error-correcting code/Narain CFT correspondences via lattices over integers of cyclotomic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify Narain conformal field theories (CFTs) that correspond to code lattices for quantum error-correcting codes (QECC) over integers of cyclotomic fields $Q(\zeta_p)$ $(\zeta_p=e^{\frac{2\pi i}p})$ for general prime $p\geq 3$. This code-lattice construction is a generalization of more familiar ones such as Construction A${}_C$ for ternary codes and (after the generalization stated below) Construction A for binary codes, containing them as special cases. This code-lattice construction is redescribed in terms of root and weight lattices of Lie algebras, which allows to construct lattices for codes over rings $Z_q$ with non-prime $q$. Corresponding Narain CFTs are found for codes embedded into quotient rings of root and weight lattices of $ADE$ series, except $E_8$ and $D_k$ with $k$ even. In a sense, this provides a unified description of the relationship between various QECCs over $F_p$ (or $Z_q$) and Narain CFTs. A further extension on constructing the $E_8$ lattice from codes over the Mordell-Weil groups of extremal rational elliptic surfaces is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Truncating Dyson-Schwinger Equations Based on Lefschetz Thimble Decomposition and Borel Resummation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13364v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the zero-dimensional prototype of the path integrals in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, with the action $S(\phi)=\frac{\sigma }{2}\phi^{2}+\frac{\lambda}{4}\phi^{4}$. Using the Lefschetz thimble decomposition and the saddle point expansion, we derive multiple asymptotic formal series of the correlation function associated with the perturbative and non-perturbative saddle points. Furthermore, we reconstruct the exact correlation function employing the Borel resummation. We then consider how to truncate the Dyson-Schwinger (DS) equations beginning with the perturbation expansion of the correlation functions, analogous to the one obtained from the Feynmann diagram in higher dimensions. For the case $\sigma&lt;0$, we find that although the asymptotic series around the perturbative saddle point is Borel summable, it does not capture the full information. Consequently, contributions from non-perturbative saddle points must be included to ensure a complete truncation procedure.</description>

Abstract: The intrinsic geometry of the critical percolation cluster induced by the level set of the metric Gaussian free field on $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ has been the subject of much recent activity. (Lupu, 2016) established that the critical percolation cluster has the same law as that in a Poisson loop soup where the intensity is dictated by the Green's function of the usual random walk. A sharp Euclidean one arm exponent was proven recently in (Cai and Ding, 2023), and subsequently in (Ganguly and Nam, 2024) other results about the chemical one arm exponent, volume growth and the Alexander-Orbach conjecture were established for all $d&gt;20.$
  In this article, we introduce new methods to obtain several sharp estimates about the intrinsic geometry which hold for all $d&gt;6$. We develop two primary comparison methods. The first involves a comparison of the extrinsic (Euclidean) and intrinsic metrics allowing estimates about the former to be transferrable to the latter. The second compares intrinsic geodesics to a class of modified paths which are non-backtracking in a certain loop sense. The latter is amenable to analysis using methods of bond percolation. We finally prove that such non-backtracking paths are not much longer than geodesics allowing us to establish comparable estimates for the geodesic. As applications of such methods, we establish, for all $d&gt;6,$ the chemical one-arm exponent, as well as an averaged version of a conjecture from (Werner, 2021) which asserts that deletion of loops with diameter larger than $r^{6/d}$ do not affect the connection probabilities between points at Euclidean distance $r.$ An important ingredient of independent interest is a local connectivity estimate which asserts that the connection probability between two points at distance $r$ remains, up to constants, unchanged even if the connecting path is confined to a ball of diameter comparable to $r.$</description>

      <title>High-Rank Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Decomposition and Bases of Equivariant Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18263</link>

Abstract: Irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs) play a crucial role in the design of equivariant graph neural networks, as well as in theoretical chemistry and chemical physics. Meanwhile, the design space of available linear operations on tensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. The ICT decomposition and a basis of this equivariant space are difficult to obtain for high-order tensors. After decades of research, Bonvicini (2024) recently achieves an explicit ICT decomposition for $n=5$ with factorial time/space complexity. This work, for the first time, obtains decomposition matrices for ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by constructing what we call path matrices. The path matrices are obtained via performing chain-like contraction with Clebsch-Gordan matrices following the parentage scheme. We prove and leverage that the concatenation of path matrices is an orthonormal change-of-basis matrix between the Cartesian tensor product space and the spherical direct sum spaces. Furthermore, we identify a complete orthogonal basis for the equivariant space, rather than a spanning set (Pearce-Crump, 2023b), through this path matrices technique. We further extend our result to the arbitrary tensor product and direct sum spaces, enabling free design between different spaces while keeping symmetry. The Python code is available at https://github.com/ShihaoShao-GH/ICT-decomposition-and-equivariant-bases, where the $n=6,\dots,9$ ICT decomposition matrices are obtained in 1s, 3s, 11s, and 4m32s on on 28-cores Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6330 CPU @ 2.00GHz, respectively.</description>

      <title>On the Quantum K-theory of Quiver Varieties at Roots of Unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Psi(\mathbb{z},\mathbb{a},q)$ be the fundamental solution matrix of the quantum difference equation in the equivariant quantum K-theory for Nakajima variety $X$. In this work, we prove that the operator $$ \Psi(\mathbb{z},\mathbb{a},q) \Psi\left(\mathbb{z}^p,\mathbb{a}^p,q^{p^2}\right)^{-1} $$ has no poles at the primitive complex $p$-th roots of unity $\zeta_p$ in the curve counting parameter $q$. As a byproduct, we show that the eigenvalues of the iterated product of the operators ${\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}}$ from the quantum difference equation on $X$ $$ {\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\mathbb{z},\mathbb{a},q) {\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\mathbb{z} q^{\mathcal{L}},\mathbb{a},q) \cdots {\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\mathbb{z} q^{(p-1)\mathcal{L}},\mathbb{a},q) $$ evaluated at $\zeta_p$ are described by the Bethe equations for $X$ in which all variables are substituted by their $p$-th powers.
  Finally, upon a reduction of the quantum difference equation on $X$ to the quantum differential equation over the field with finite characteristic, the above iterated product transforms into a Grothendiek-Katz $p$-curvature of the corresponding differential connection whereas ${\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\mathbb{z}^p,\mathbb{a}^p,q^p)$ becomes a certain Frobenius twist of that connection. In this way, we are reproducing, in part, the statement of a theorem by Etingof and Varchenko.</description>
