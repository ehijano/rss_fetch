      <title>CONTUNER: Singing Voice Beautifying with Pitch and Expressiveness Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singing voice beautifying is a novel task that has application value in people's daily life, aiming to correct the pitch of the singing voice and improve the expressiveness without changing the original timbre and content. Existing methods rely on paired data or only concentrate on the correction of pitch. However, professional songs and amateur songs from the same person are hard to obtain, and singing voice beautifying doesn't only contain pitch correction but other aspects like emotion and rhythm. Since we propose a fast and high-fidelity singing voice beautifying system called ConTuner, a diffusion model combined with the modified condition to generate the beautified Mel-spectrogram, where the modified condition is composed of optimized pitch and expressiveness. For pitch correction, we establish a mapping relationship from MIDI, spectrum envelope to pitch. To make amateur singing more expressive, we propose the expressiveness enhancer in the latent space to convert amateur vocal tone to professional. ConTuner achieves a satisfactory beautification effect on both Mandarin and English songs. Ablation study demonstrates that the expressiveness enhancer and generator-based accelerate method in ConTuner are effective.</description>

      <title>EAD-VC: Enhancing Speech Auto-Disentanglement for Voice Conversion with IFUB Estimator and Joint Text-Guided Consistent Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using unsupervised learning to disentangle speech into content, rhythm, pitch, and timbre for voice conversion has become a hot research topic. Existing works generally take into account disentangling speech components through human-crafted bottleneck features which can not achieve sufficient information disentangling, while pitch and rhythm may still be mixed together. There is a risk of information overlap in the disentangling process which results in less speech naturalness. To overcome such limits, we propose a two-stage model to disentangle speech representations in a self-supervised manner without a human-crafted bottleneck design, which uses the Mutual Information (MI) with the designed upper bound estimator (IFUB) to separate overlapping information between speech components. Moreover, we design a Joint Text-Guided Consistent (TGC) module to guide the extraction of speech content and eliminate timbre leakage issues. Experiments show that our model can achieve a better performance than the baseline, regarding disentanglement effectiveness, speech naturalness, and similarity.

      <title>EfficientASR: Speech Recognition Network Compression via Attention Redundancy and Chunk-Level FFN Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Transformer networks have shown remarkable performance in speech recognition tasks. However, their deployment poses challenges due to high computational and storage resource requirements. To address this issue, a lightweight model called EfficientASR is proposed in this paper, aiming to enhance the versatility of Transformer models. EfficientASR employs two primary modules: Shared Residual Multi-Head Attention (SRMHA) and Chunk-Level Feedforward Networks (CFFN). The SRMHA module effectively reduces redundant computations in the network, while the CFFN module captures spatial knowledge and reduces the number of parameters. The effectiveness of the EfficientASR model is validated on two public datasets, namely Aishell-1 and HKUST. Experimental results demonstrate a 36% reduction in parameters compared to the baseline Transformer network, along with improvements of 0.3% and 0.2% in Character Error Rate (CER) on the Aishell-1 and HKUST datasets, respectively.</description>

      <title>ESC: Efficient Speech Coding with Cross-Scale Residual Vector Quantized Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing neural audio codecs usually sacrifice computational complexity for audio quality. They build the feature transformation layers mainly on convolutional blocks, which are not inherently appropriate for capturing local redundancies of audio signals. As compensation, either adversarial losses from a discriminator or a large number of model parameters are required to improve the codec. To that end, we propose Efficient Speech Codec (ESC), a lightweight parameter-efficient codec laid on cross-scale residual vector quantization and transformers. Our model leverages mirrored hierarchical window-attention transformer blocks and performs step-wise decoding from coarse-to-fine feature representations. To enhance codebook utilization, we design a learning paradigm that involves a pre-training stage to assist with codec training. Extensive results show that ESC can achieve high audio quality with much lower complexity, which is a prospective alternative in place of existing codecs.</description>

      <title>Deep low-latency joint speech transmission and enhancement over a gaussian channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring intelligible speech communication for hearing assistive devices in low-latency scenarios presents significant challenges in terms of speech enhancement, coding and transmission. In this paper, we propose novel solutions for low-latency joint speech transmission and enhancement, leveraging deep neural networks (DNNs). Our approach integrates two state-of-the-art DNN architectures for low-latency speech enhancement and low-latency analog joint source-channel-based transmission, creating a combined low-latency system and jointly training both systems in an end-to-end approach. Due to the computational demands of the enhancement system, this order is suitable when high computational power is unavailable in the decoder, like hearing assistive devices. The proposed system enables the configuration of total latency, achieving high performance even at latencies as low as 3 ms, which is typically challenging to attain. The simulation results provide compelling evidence that a joint enhancement and transmission system is superior to a simple concatenation system in diverse settings, encompassing various wireless channel conditions, latencies, and background noise scenarios.</description>

      <title>SemiPL: A Semi-supervised Method for Event Sound Source Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Event Sound Source Localization has been widely applied in various fields. Recent works typically relying on the contrastive learning framework show impressive performance. However, all work is based on large relatively simple datasets. It's also crucial to understand and analyze human behaviors (actions and interactions of people), voices, and sounds in chaotic events in many applications, e.g., crowd management, and emergency response services. In this paper, we apply the existing model to a more complex dataset, explore the influence of parameters on the model, and propose a semi-supervised improvement method SemiPL. With the increase in data quantity and the influence of label quality, self-supervised learning will be an unstoppable trend. The experiment shows that the parameter adjustment will positively affect the existing model. In particular, SSPL achieved an improvement of 12.2% cIoU and 0.56% AUC in Chaotic World compared to the results provided. The code is available at: https://github.com/ly245422/SSPL</description>

      <title>Fake it to make it: Using synthetic data to remedy the data shortage in joint multimodal speech-and-gesture synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although humans engaged in face-to-face conversation simultaneously communicate both verbally and non-verbally, methods for joint and unified synthesis of speech audio and co-speech 3D gesture motion from text are a new and emerging field. These technologies hold great promise for more human-like, efficient, expressive, and robust synthetic communication, but are currently held back by the lack of suitably large datasets, as existing methods are trained on parallel data from all constituent modalities. Inspired by student-teacher methods, we propose a straightforward solution to the data shortage, by simply synthesising additional training material. Specifically, we use unimodal synthesis models trained on large datasets to create multimodal (but synthetic) parallel training data, and then pre-train a joint synthesis model on that material. In addition, we propose a new synthesis architecture that adds better and more controllable prosody modelling to the state-of-the-art method in the field. Our results confirm that pre-training on large amounts of synthetic data improves the quality of both the speech and the motion synthesised by the multimodal model, with the proposed architecture yielding further benefits when pre-trained on the synthetic data.

      <title>Attention-Constrained Inference for Robust Decoder-Only Text-to-Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent popular decoder-only text-to-speech models are known for their ability of generating natural-sounding speech. However, such models sometimes suffer from word skipping and repeating due to the lack of explicit monotonic alignment constraints. In this paper, we notice from the attention maps that some particular attention heads of the decoder-only model indicate the alignments between speech and text. We call the attention maps of those heads Alignment-Emerged Attention Maps (AEAMs). Based on this discovery, we propose a novel inference method without altering the training process, named Attention-Constrained Inference (ACI), to facilitate monotonic synthesis. It first identifies AEAMs using the Attention Sweeping algorithm and then applies constraining masks on AEAMs. Our experimental results on decoder-only TTS model VALL-E show that the WER of synthesized speech is reduced by up to 20.5% relatively with ACI while the naturalness and speaker similarity are comparable.</description>

      <title>Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition based on Smoothness-inducing Regularization and Spectrogram-based Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06945v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Underwater acoustic target recognition is a challenging task owing to the intricate underwater environments and limited data availability. Insufficient data can hinder the ability of recognition systems to support complex modeling, thus impeding their advancement. To improve the generalization capacity of recognition models, techniques such as data augmentation have been employed to simulate underwater signals and diversify data distribution. However, the complexity of underwater environments can cause the simulated signals to deviate from real scenarios, resulting in biased models that are misguided by non-true data. In this study, we propose two strategies to enhance the generalization ability of models in the case of limited data while avoiding the risk of performance degradation. First, as an alternative to traditional data augmentation, we utilize smoothness-inducing regularization, which only incorporates simulated signals in the regularization term. Additionally, we propose a specialized spectrogram-based data augmentation strategy, namely local masking and replicating (LMR), to capture inter-class relationships. Our experiments and visualization analysis demonstrate the superiority of our proposed strategies.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Complex Data Diversity in Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition through Convolution-based Mixture of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Underwater acoustic target recognition is a difficult task owing to the intricate nature of underwater acoustic signals. The complex underwater environments, unpredictable transmission channels, and dynamic motion states greatly impact the real-world underwater acoustic signals, and may even obscure the intrinsic characteristics related to targets. Consequently, the data distribution of underwater acoustic signals exhibits high intra-class diversity, thereby compromising the accuracy and robustness of recognition systems.To address these issues, this work proposes a convolution-based mixture of experts (CMoE) that recognizes underwater targets in a fine-grained manner. The proposed technique introduces multiple expert layers as independent learners, along with a routing layer that determines the assignment of experts according to the characteristics of inputs. This design allows the model to utilize independent parameter spaces, facilitating the learning of complex underwater signals with high intra-class diversity. Furthermore, this work optimizes the CMoE structure by balancing regularization and an optional residual module. To validate the efficacy of our proposed techniques, we conducted detailed experiments and visualization analyses on three underwater acoustic databases across several acoustic features. The experimental results demonstrate that our CMoE consistently achieves significant performance improvements, delivering superior recognition accuracy when compared to existing advanced methods.</description>

      <title>ComposerX: Multi-Agent Symbolic Music Composition with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Music composition represents the creative side of humanity, and itself is a complex task that requires abilities to understand and generate information with long dependency and harmony constraints. While demonstrating impressive capabilities in STEM subjects, current LLMs easily fail in this task, generating ill-written music even when equipped with modern techniques like In-Context-Learning and Chain-of-Thoughts. To further explore and enhance LLMs' potential in music composition by leveraging their reasoning ability and the large knowledge base in music history and theory, we propose ComposerX, an agent-based symbolic music generation framework. We find that applying a multi-agent approach significantly improves the music composition quality of GPT-4. The results demonstrate that ComposerX is capable of producing coherent polyphonic music compositions with captivating melodies, while adhering to user instructions.</description>

      <title>Learning Separable Hidden Unit Contributions for Speaker-Adaptive Lip-Reading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05058v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel method for speaker adaptation in lip reading, motivated by two observations. Firstly, a speaker's own characteristics can always be portrayed well by his/her few facial images or even a single image with shallow networks, while the fine-grained dynamic features associated with speech content expressed by the talking face always need deep sequential networks to represent accurately. Therefore, we treat the shallow and deep layers differently for speaker adaptive lip reading. Secondly, we observe that a speaker's unique characteristics ( e.g. prominent oral cavity and mandible) have varied effects on lip reading performance for different words and pronunciations, necessitating adaptive enhancement or suppression of the features for robust lip reading. Based on these two observations, we propose to take advantage of the speaker's own characteristics to automatically learn separable hidden unit contributions with different targets for shallow layers and deep layers respectively. For shallow layers where features related to the speaker's characteristics are stronger than the speech content related features, we introduce speaker-adaptive features to learn for enhancing the speech content features. For deep layers where both the speaker's features and the speech content features are all expressed well, we introduce the speaker-adaptive features to learn for suppressing the speech content irrelevant noise for robust lip reading. Our approach consistently outperforms existing methods, as confirmed by comprehensive analysis and comparison across different settings. Besides the evaluation on the popular LRW-ID and GRID datasets, we also release a new dataset for evaluation, CAS-VSR-S68h, to further assess the performance in an extreme setting where just a few speakers are available but the speech content covers a large and diversified range.</description>
