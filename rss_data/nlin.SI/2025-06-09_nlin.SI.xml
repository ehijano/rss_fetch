      <title>Integrable deformations of cluster maps of type $D_{2N}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend one of the main results in \cite{hkm24}, of a deformed type $D_{4}$ map, to the general case of the type $D_{2N}$ for $N\geq3$. This can be achieved through a "local expansion" operation, introduced in the joint work \cite{grab} with Grabowski and Hone. This operation involves inserting a specific subquiver into the quiver arising from the Laurentification of the deformed type $D_{4}$ map. This insertion yields a new quiver, obtained through the Laurentification of the deformed type $D_{6}$ map and thus enables systematic generalization to higher ranks $D_{2N}$. We further considered the degree growth of the deformed type $D_{2N}$ map via the tropical method and conjecture that for each $N$, the deformed map is an integrable map by applying an algebraic entropy test, the criterion for detecting integrability of the dynamical system.</description>

      <title>Bennett Vorticity: Analytic solutions to a flowing, nonlinear, Shear-Flow Stabilized Z-pinch equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bennett profile is a classic form for the plasma number density of an equilibrium Z pinch that has been studied for almost a century by plasma physicists interested in nonlinear plasma pinch science, and fusion energy. By transferring the nonlinearity entirely from the number density to the plasma flow velocity the magnetic structure of the resulting flowing Z-pinch equilibrium remains unchanged whilst now being defined by a vortical flow which previously did not exist in the classic case. Due to the monotonic structure of the nonlinearities first derivative, this analytic equilibrium is investigated to determine its validity as a Shear-Flow Stabilized Z-Pinch</description>

      <title>Discrete Painlev\'e equations and pencils of quadrics in $\mathbb P^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete Painlev\'e equations constitute a famous class of integrable non-autonomous second order difference equations. A classification scheme proposed by Sakai interprets a discrete Painlev\'e equation as a birational map between generalized Halphen surfaces (surfaces obtained from $\mathbb P^1\times\mathbb P^1$ by blowing up at eight points). We propose a novel geometric interpretation of discrete Painlev\'e equations, where the family of generalized Halphen surfaces is replaced by a pencil of quadrics in $\mathbb P^3$. A discrete Painlev\'e equation is viewed as an autonomous birational transformation of $\mathbb P^3$ that preserves the pencil and maps each quadric of the pencil to a different one, according to a M\"obius transformation of the pencil parameter. Thus, our scheme is based on the classification of pencils of quadrics in $\mathbb P^3$.</description>
