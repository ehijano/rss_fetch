      <title>"Gold-Standard" $\Delta$-Machine Learned and Transferable Potential for Linear Alkanes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conformational properties of linear alkanes, C$_n$H$_{2n+2}$, have been of intense interest for many years. Experiments and corresponding electronic structure calculations were first reported in the mid-2000s and continue to the present time. These focus on the minimum chain length where the transition from the linear minimum to the hairpin minimum occurs. We recently reported a transferable many-body permutationally invariant polynomial (MB-PIP) for linear alkanes using B3LYP electronic energies, which do not account for dispersion. Here we report a $\Delta$-ML approach to elevate this B3LYP-based and new PBE0+MBD MB-PIP potentials using PNO-LCCSD(T)-F12 energies. The new $\Delta$-corrected potentials predict the difference in these minima accurately, compared to benchmark CCSD(T) results, over the range C$_{12}$H$_{28}$ to C$_{28}$H$_{58}$. Vibrational power spectra are also reported for C$_{14}$H$_{30}$ and C$_{30}$H$_{62}$ using the uncorrected and $\Delta$-ML B3LYP. These new PIP-MB potentials for linear alkanes are the most accurate ones currently available and can be used in studies of properties of linear alkanes.</description>

      <title>A scalable route to first-order response properties with correlated sampling phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To make useful connections with experimental measurements, correlated electronic structure theories must accurately predict chemical properties in addition to energies. We present a finite-difference based algorithm to compute first-order response properties with phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC) that relies on a branching correlated sampling approach. Focusing on electric dipole moments, we show that mean-field trial wave functions are sufficient to obtain high accuracy relative to CCSD(T) and experimental measurements for a set of 21 molecules, ranging in size from 2 to 18 atoms in their equilibrium geometries. As with energies, the quality of predicted dipole moments can be systematically improved with the use of correlated trial wave functions, even (or especially) in strongly correlated regimes. We show that the challenges faced by low-order perturbation theories in predicting the dipole moment of hydrogen fluoride across its dissociation coordinate are overcome with ph-AFQMC when using relatively simple trials. The key advantage of our approach over those previously reported for ph-AFQMC is its scalability to large system sizes with a phaseless bias no worse than that of a typical ground-state energy calculation; we routinely converge dipole moments for systems with more than one thousand basis functions.</description>

      <title>Biological Crowding Annihilates Terahertz Transmission Nonlinearity in Aqueous Protein Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydration water is vital for the stabilization of protein structure and function. The strong interaction of hydration water with the protein surface brings into question how dynamics and asymmetry of hydrogen bonds are perturbed for hydration water compared to bulk water. Here, z-scan transmission measurements at 0.5 Terahertz (THz) were performed for dilute and concentrated lysozyme solutions. A giant nonlinear absorption coefficient was found for dilute lysozyme solutions that is ten times greater than previous studies. This giant nonlinear response stems from the high average THz power generated by the TELBE free electron laser source, which drives the formation of a persistent thermal lens. In contrast, concentrated lysozyme solutions did not demonstrate a nonlinear response, revealing that crowding annihilates the thermal lensing effect. These results indicates that the THz nonlinear transmission of aqueous proteins solutions depends on the amount of hydration water present, and opens to the door to understanding the nonlinear optical properties of biologically relevant systems.</description>

      <title>How special are the dynamics of deep eutectic solvents? A Look at the Prototypical Case of Ethaline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the molecular dynamics of the prototypical deep eutectic solvent (DES) ethaline. We disentangled the different motions of its two constituents, namely choline chloride and ethylene glycol on a spatio-temporal range that extends from sub-nanometer to micrometer distances and from picosecond to millisecond times. This was achieved by a combination of pulsed-field-gradient NMR, time-of-flight, and backscattering quasielastic neutron scattering experiments with isotopically labelled samples. On the micrometer scale, we observe that the translational motions of the two DES constituents obey classical hydrodynamics, with distinct diffusivities that reflect their different hydrodynamic radii. This is no longer valid at the nanometer-scale, where the two DES components present similar short-ranged diffusivities, which indicates a significant effect of their supramolecular association. The sub-nanometer scale motions include jumps that precede Fickian diffusion, and localized dynamics that precede the breaking of the transient cage formed by neighboring molecules. Therein, the spatial amplitude of the localized motions mirrors their different molecular sizes, while their respective correlation times contrast with observations made for other choline-based DES such as glyceline. This result underlines the importance of more subtle effects, such as the different H-bond propensities of the polyol donor, and demonstrate the difficulty to anticipate the nanoscale dynamic behavior of DES from the knowledge of their macroscopic properties.</description>

      <title>Quantum-electrodynamical time-dependent density functional theory description of molecules in optical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum electrodynamical time-dependent density functional theory framework is applied to describe strongly coupled light--matter interactions in cavity environments. The formalism utilizes a tensor product approach, coupling real-space electronic wave functions with Fock space photonic states. Various molecular systems serve as test cases to examine how coupling parameters and cavity frequencies affect molecular geometry, polaritonic spectra, and intermolecular binding.</description>

      <title>Seniority-zero Linear Canonical Transformation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to solve the electronic Schr\"odinger equation for strongly correlated systems by applying a unitary transformation to reduce the complexity of the physical Hamiltonian. In particular, we seek a transformation that maps the Hamiltonian into the seniority-zero space, since such Hamiltonians are computationally more tractable while still capturing strong correlation within electron pairs. The unitary rotation is evaluated using the Baker--Campbell--Hausdorff (BCH) expansion, truncated to two-body operators via the operator-decomposition strategy of canonical transformation (CT) theory, which rewrites higher-rank terms approximately in terms of one- and two-body operators. The method was tested on three molecular systems: H$_6$ in the STO-6G basis, BeH$_2$ along the standard C$_{2v}$ insertion pathway, and BH in the 6-31G basis. In all cases, the Seniority-zero Linear Canonical Transformation (SZ-LCT) method delivers highly accurate results, with most errors on the order of $10^{-4}$ Hartree. Additionally, SZ-LCT has a cost of $O(N^7/n_c)$, where $n_c$ is the number of CPU cores, making it comparable to single-reference methods when the number of available cores is at least equal to the number of orbitals.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Neural Networks versus deep ensembles for uncertainty quantification in machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural-network-based machine learning interatomic potentials have emerged as powerful tools for predicting atomic energies and forces, enabling accurate and efficient simulations in atomistic modeling. A key limitation of traditional deep learning approaches, however, is their inability to provide reliable estimates of predictive uncertainty. Such uncertainty quantification is critical for assessing model reliability, especially in materials science, where often the model is applied on out-of-distribution data. Different strategies have been proposed to address this challenge, with deep ensembles and Bayesian neural networks being among the most widely used. In this work, we introduce an implementation of Bayesian neural networks with variational inference in the aenet-PyTorch framework. To evaluate their applicability to machine learning interatomic potentials, we systematically compare the performance of variational BNNs and deep ensembles on a dataset of 7,815 TiO$_{2}$ structures. The models are trained on both the full dataset and a subset to assess how variations in data representation influence predictive accuracy and uncertainty estimation. This analysis provides insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach, offering practical guidance for the development of uncertainty-aware machine learning interatomic potentials.</description>

      <title>Short-Range Solvent-Solvent and Ion-Solvent Correlations at Metal-Electrolyte Interfaces: Parameterization and Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-range correlations in electrolyte solutions lead to oscillatory profiles of water polarization and ionic concentration at electrode-electrolyte interfaces. The recently developed density-potential-polarization functional theory (DPPFT) provides a comprehensive framework to incorporate these short-range correlation effects. In the present work, the parameters describing short-range solvent-solvent and ion-solvent correlations in DPPFT are determined from the wavenumber-dependent dielectric susceptibility spectrum of pure water and from ion solvation energies derived within nonlocal electrostatics, respectively. The experimental ionic-radius-dependent hydration energies of alkali metal cations and halide anions are well reproduced by the solvation model. The charge hydration asymmetry is explained as the stronger short-range repulsion between cations and water molecules compared to that between anions and water molecules. Using these parameters, DPPFT is then applied to investigate short-range correlation effects at the Ag(111)-NaF aqueous electrolyte interface. The water polarization profiles obtained from DPPFT calculations show good agreement with AIMD simulations. Furthermore, as the strength of short-range ion-solvent repulsion increases, the peaks of anionic/layers shift from regions near centers of positive/negative polarization charges toward those of opposite sign, thereby preserving solvation configurations similar to those in bulk solution. This work establishes a consistent procedure for parameterizing short-range correlation effects within the DPPFT framework, thereby enabling a more quantitative and computationally efficient description of atomic-scale phenomena at electrochemical interfaces.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials for Long-Range Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine-learning interatomic potentials have emerged as a revolutionary class of force-field models in molecular simulations, delivering quantum-mechanical accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost and enabling the simulation of large-scale systems over extended timescales. However, they often focus on modeling local environments, neglecting crucial long-range interactions. We propose a Sum-of-Gaussians Neural Network (SOG-Net), a lightweight and versatile framework for integrating long-range interactions into machine learning force field. The SOG-Net employs a latent-variable learning network that seamlessly bridges short-range and long-range components, coupled with an efficient Fourier convolution layer that incorporates long-range effects. By learning sum-of-Gaussians multipliers across different convolution layers, the SOG-Net adaptively captures diverse long-range decay behaviors while maintaining close-to-linear computational complexity during training and simulation via non-uniform fast Fourier transforms. The method is demonstrated effective for a broad range of long-range systems.</description>

      <title>MesoNet: A Fundamental Principle for Multi-Representation Learning in Complex Chemical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of molecular properties in complex chemical systems is crucial for accelerating material discovery and chemical innovation. However, current computational methods often struggle to capture the intricate compositional interplay across complex chemical systems, from intramolecular bonds to intermolecular forces. In this work, we introduce MesoNet, a novel framework founded on the principle of multi-representation learning and specifically designed for multi-molecule modeling. The core innovation of MesoNet lies in the construction of context-aware representation-dynamically enriched atomic descriptors generated via Neural Circuit Policies. These parameters efficiently capture both intrinsic atomic properties and their dynamic compositional context through a cross-attention mechanism spanning both intramolecular and intermolecular message passing. Driven by this mechanism, the influence of the mixed system is progressively applied to each molecule and atom, making message passing both efficient and meaningful. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse public datasets, spanning both pure components and mixtures, demonstrate that MesoNet achieves superior accuracy and enhanced chemical interpretability for molecular properties. This work establishes a powerful, interpretable approach for modeling compositional complexity, aiming to advance chemical simulation and design.</description>

      <title>Local fermion-to-qudit mappings: a practical recipe for four-level systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05616v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new set of local fermion-to-qudit mappings for simulating fermionic lattice systems. We focus on the use of multi-level qudits, specifically ququarts. Traditional mappings, such as the Jordan-Wigner transformation (JWT), while useful, often result in non-local operators that scale unfavorably with system size. To address these challenges, we introduce mappings that efficiently localize fermionic operators on qudits, reducing the non-locality and operator weights associated with JWT. We propose one mapping for spinless fermions and two mappings for spinful fermions, comparing their performance in terms of qudit-weight, circuit depth, and gate complexity. By leveraging the extended local Hilbert space of qudits, we show that these mappings enable more efficient quantum simulations in terms of two-qudit gates, reducing hardware requirements without increasing computational complexity. We validate our approach by simulating prototypical models such as the spinless t-V model and the Fermi-Hubbard model in two dimensions, using Trotterized time evolution. Our results highlight the potential of qudit-based quantum simulations in achieving scalability and efficiency for fermionic systems on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding time-resolved quantum transport is crucial for developing next-generation quantum technologies, particularly in nano- and molecular junctions subjected to time-dependent perturbations. Traditional steady-state approaches to quantum transport are not designed to capture the transient dynamics necessary for controlling electronic behavior at ultrafast time scales. In this work, we present a non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, within the recently-developed iterated generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz ($i$GKBA), to study thermoelectric quantum transport beyond the wide-band limit approximation (WBLA). We employ the Meir-Wingreen formula for both charge and energy currents and analyze the transition from Lorentzian line-width functions to the WBLA, identifying unphysical divergences in the latter. Our results highlight the importance of finite-bandwidth effects and demonstrate the efficiency of the $i$GKBA approach in modeling time-resolved thermoelectric transport, also providing benchmark comparisons against the full Kadanoff-Baym theory. We exemplify the developed theory in the calculation of time-resolved thermopower and thermoelectric energy conversion efficiency in a cyclobutadiene molecular junction.</description>

      <title>STable AutoCorrelation Integral Estimator (STACIE): Robust and accurate transport properties from molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: STACIE (STable AutoCorrelation Integral Estimator) is a novel algorithm and Python package that delivers robust, uncertainty-aware estimates of autocorrelation integrals from time-correlated data. While its primary application is deriving transport properties from equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, STACIE is equally applicable to time-correlated data in other scientific fields. A key feature of STACIE is its ability to provide robust and accurate estimates without requiring manual adjustment of hyperparameters. Additionally, one can follow a simple protocol to prepare sufficient simulation data to achieve a desired relative error of the transport property. We demonstrate its application by estimating the ionic electrical conductivity of a NaCl-water electrolyte solution. We also present a massive synthetic benchmark dataset to rigorously validate STACIE, comprising 15360 sets of time-correlated inputs generated with diverse covariance kernels with known autocorrelation integrals. STACIE is open source and available on GitHub and PyPI, with comprehensive documentation and examples.</description>
