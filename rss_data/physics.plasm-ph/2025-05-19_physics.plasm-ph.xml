      <title>Enhanced energy gain through higher-order resonances during direct laser acceleration with superluminal phase velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-high intensity laser-plasma interactions can produce ultra-relativistic electrons via direct laser acceleration, assisted by quasi-static plasma magnetic and electric fields. These fields transversely confine electron motion and induce betatron oscillations. The net energy gain is strongly influenced by the interplay between two frequencies: the betatron frequency and the frequency of laser field oscillations experienced by the electron. Prior work has shown that energy gain is enabled by a resonance between the betatron oscillations and the oscillations of the laser field. In particular, higher-order resonances occur when the laser field completes multiple cycles during one betatron oscillation, allowing additional regimes of energy transfer beyond the fundamental (betatron) resonance. In this work, we demonstrate that such resonances become particularly effective when the laser's phase velocity is superluminal. Although the two frequencies generally evolve differently with increasing electron energy, which leads to detuning, a superluminal phase velocity introduces a non-monotonic frequency ratio with a global minimum. This minimum allows sustained frequency matching over a broad energy range, thereby enabling enhanced energy gain. As the phase velocity increases, the betatron resonance becomes ineffective due to premature frequency detuning. At the same time, higher-order resonances become increasingly effective, emerging as the dominant mechanisms for enhanced energy gain in this regime of direct laser acceleration.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the Plasma Boundary with a Reduced Set of Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the feasibility of reconstructing the last closed flux surface (LCFS) in the DIII-D tokamak using neural network models trained on reduced input feature sets, addressing an ill-posed task. Two models are compared: one trained solely on coil currents and another incorporating coil currents, plasma current, and loop voltage. The model trained exclusively on coil currents achieved a mean point displacement of 0.04 m on a held-out test set, while the inclusion of plasma current and loop voltage reduced the error to 0.03 m. This comparison highlights the trade-offs between input feature complexity and reconstruction accuracy, demonstrating the potential of machine learning algorithms to perform effectively in data-limited environments, such as those expected in Fusion Power Plants (FPP) due to diagnostic constraints imposed by the presence of blankets and shielding.</description>

      <title>Conservative velocity mappings for discontinuous Galerkin kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuum computational kinetic plasma models evolve the distribution function of a plasma species $f_s$ on a phase-space grid over time. In many problems of interest the distribution function has limited extent in velocity space, hence using a highly refined mesh everywhere would be costly and slow. Nonuniform velocity grids can reduce the computational cost by placing more degrees of freedom where $f_s$ is appreciable and fewer where it is not. In this work we introduce a first-of-its kind discontinuous Galerkin approach to nonuniform velocity-space discretization using mapped velocity coordinates. This new method is presented in the context of a gyrokinetic model used to study magnetized plasmas. We create discretizations of collisionless and collisional terms using mappings in a way that exactly conserves particles and energy. Numerical tests of such properties are presented, and we show that this new discretization can reproduce earlier gyrokinetic simulations using grids with up to 48 times fewer cells.</description>

      <title>Generalized Kappa Distribution Function for Mixed Fermiom-Boson Quantum Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Kappa distribution function applicable to systems comprising mixed fermions and bosons has been developed through the thermodynamic Gibbs potential utilizing the quantum versions of the Olbert kappa distributions. The generalised expressions of the partition function and the entropy have been evaluated for such mixed quantum systems. The analysis shows that boson-rich systems consistently exhibit higher entropy than fermion-rich systems. The distribution functions show heavy-tailed characteristics at low Kappa values, indicating the presence of superthermal particles. It is observed that relativistic effects lead to a significant increase in entropy.</description>

      <title>Application of the Portable Diagnostic Package to the Wisconsin HTS Axisymmetric Mirror (WHAM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an application of the Portable Diagnostic Package (PDP) on the Wisconsin HTS Axisymmetric Mirror (WHAM), which integrates an optical emission spectroscopy (OES) system and an active Thomson scattering (TS) system. Due to the designed portability of our system, we realized the installation of the PDP OES and TS measurements on WHAM in $\sim$6 months. The OES system facilitates a comprehensive impurity line survey and enables flow measurements through the Doppler effect observed on impurity lines. Notably, plasma rotation profiles were successfully derived from doubly charged carbon lines. In addition, the TS system enabled the first measurements of the electron temperature in commissioning plasmas on WHAM. These successes underscore the diagnostic package's potential for advancing experimental plasma studies.</description>

      <title>High brightness, symmetric electron bunch generation in a plasma wakefield accelerator via a radially-polarized plasma photocathode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The plasma photocathode has previously been proposed as a source of ultra-high-brightness electron bunches within plasma accelerators. Here, the scheme is extended by using a radially-polarized ionizing laser pulse to generate high-charge, high-brightness electron bunches with symmetric transverse emittance. Efficient start-to-end modelling of the scheme, from ionization and trapping until drive bunch depletion, enables a multi-objective Bayesian optimisation routine to be performed to understand the performance of the radially-polarized plasma photocathode, quantify the stability of the scheme, and explore the fundamental relation between the witness bunch charge and its emittance. Comparison of plasma photocathodes driven by radially- and linearly-polarized laser pulses show that the former yields higher brightness electron bunches when operating in the optimally-loaded regime.</description>

      <title>The Brillouin flow in a smooth-bore magnetron fed by split cathode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explosive emission from an axial cathode of a relativistic magnetron produces plasma, the radial expansion of which can cause pulse shortening. In a split cathode fed magnetron, the electron source and its explosive plasma are outside the space where the high power microwave producing interaction occurs. This electron source is a longitudinal annular electron column expanding radially. This expansion simulates the radial emission from an axial cathode. A mathematical model and numerical simulations are presented which enable to calculate the parameters of this electron column, its density, angular velocity, and potential distributions. The Hull Cutoff and Buneman-Hartree modified conditions applicable to the split cathode magnetron are formulated.</description>
