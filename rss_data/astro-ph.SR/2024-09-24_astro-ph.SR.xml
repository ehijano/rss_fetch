      <title>The Statistics and Environments of Hostless Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transient surveys routinely detect supernovae (SNe) without obvious host galaxies. To understand the demographics of these "hostless" SNe and to constrain the possible host properties, we identify 161 SNe reported to the Transient Name Server since 2016 that do not have hosts cataloged from pre-explosion wide-field galaxy surveys. Using forced aperture photometry, we detect excess flux around only 56 of these SNe. Both thermonuclear and core-collapse (CC) SNe are present in our sample. Compared to flux-limited SNe samples with known hosts, superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), particularly hydrogen-deficient SLSNe, are over-represented here relative to all other SNe types; among CC SNe, there is also a higher fraction of interacting SNe than non-interacting. On the low-luminosity side, seven SNe have host absolute magnitude upper limits fainter than M_g=-12, about 1 per cent of the Small Magellanic Cloud's luminosity; the faintest limits are close to the luminosity of globular clusters or ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (M_g~-8). Fitting multi-band forced photometry, 11 SNe have host stellar masses &lt;10^6 Msun assuming quiescent hosts, and 13 SNe have host stellar masses &lt;10^5 Msun assuming star-forming hosts. The spatial distribution of hostless SNe indicates that the majority are not associated with known galaxy groups and clusters, ruling out intracluster stellar light as the primary contributor of such SNe. Hostless Type Ia SNe tend to be more luminous and slow-fading than SNe Ia with known host galaxies, implying a hidden population of low-mass and star-forming hosts. We conclude that any undetected host galaxies are likely star-forming dwarfs in the field.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Multivariate Time Series-based Solar Flare Prediction with Multifaceted Preprocessing and Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate solar flare prediction is crucial due to the significant risks that intense solar flares pose to astronauts, space equipment, and satellite communication systems. Our research enhances solar flare prediction by utilizing advanced data preprocessing and classification methods on a multivariate time series-based dataset of photospheric magnetic field parameters. First, our study employs a novel preprocessing pipeline that includes missing value imputation, normalization, balanced sampling, near decision boundary sample removal, and feature selection to significantly boost prediction accuracy. Second, we integrate contrastive learning with a GRU regression model to develop a novel classifier, termed ContReg, which employs dual learning methodologies, thereby further enhancing prediction performance. To validate the effectiveness of our preprocessing pipeline, we compare and demonstrate the performance gain of each step, and to demonstrate the efficacy of the ContReg classifier, we compare its performance to that of sequence-based deep learning architectures, machine learning models, and findings from previous studies. Our results illustrate exceptional True Skill Statistic (TSS) scores, surpassing previous methods and highlighting the critical role of precise data preprocessing and classifier development in time series-based solar flare prediction.</description>

      <title>Simulating the formation and eruption of flux rope by magneto-friction model driven by time-dependent electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aiming to capture the formation and eruption of flux ropes (FRs) in the source active regions (ARs), we simulate the coronal magnetic field evolution of the AR 11429 employing the time-dependent magneto-friction model (TMF). The initial field is driven by electric fields that are derived from time-sequence photospheric vector magnetic field observations by invoking ad-hoc assumptions. The simulated magnetic structure evolves from potential to twisted fields over the course of two days, followed by rise motion in the later evolution, depicting the formation of FR and its slow eruption later. The magnetic configuration resembles an inverse S-sigmoidal structure, composed of a potential field enveloping the inverse J-shaped fields that are shared past one another and a low lying twisted field along the major PIL. To compare with observations, proxy emission maps based on averaged current density along the field lines are generated from the simulated field. These emission maps exhibit a remarkable one-to-one correspondence with the spatial characteristics in coronal EUV images, especially the filament-trace supported by the twisted magnetic field in the south-west subregion. Further, the topological analysis of the simulated field reveals the co-spatial flare ribbons with the quasi-separatrix layers, which is consistent with the standard flare models; therefore, the extent of the twist and orientation of the erupting FR is indicated to be the real scenario in this case. The TMF model simulates the coronal field evolution, correctly capturing the formation of the FR in the observed time scale and the twisted field generated from these simulations serve as the initial condition for the full MHD simulations.</description>

      <title>ALMASOP. The Localized and Chemically rich Features near the Bases of the Protostellar Jet in HOPS 87</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HOPS 87 is a Class 0 protostellar core known to harbor an extremely young bipolar outflow and a hot corino. We report the discovery of localized, chemically rich regions near the bases of the two-lobe bipolar molecular outflow in HOPS 87 containing molecules such as H$_2$CO, $^{13}$CS, H$_2$S, OCS, and CH$_3$OH, the simplest complex organic molecule (COM). The locations and kinematics suggest that these localized features are due to jet-driven shocks rather than being part of the hot corino region encasing the protostar. The COM compositions of the molecular gas in these jet-localized regions are relatively simpler than those in the hot corino zone. We speculate that this simplicity is due to either the liberation of ice with a less complex chemical history or the effects of shock chemistry. Our study highlights the dynamic interplay between the protostellar bipolar outflow, disk, inner core environment, and the surrounding medium, contributing to our understanding of molecular complexity in solar-like young stellar objects.</description>

      <title>The observational evidence that all microflares that accelerate electrons to high-energies are rooted in sunspots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In general, large solar flares are more efficient at accelerating high-energy electrons than microflares. Nonetheless, we sometimes observe microflares that accelerate electrons to high energies. We statistically characterize 39 microflares with strikingly hard spectra in the hard X-ray (HXR) range, which means that they are efficient in accelerating high-energy electrons. We refer to these events as "hard microflares." The statistical analysis is built upon spectral and imaging information from STIX, combined with EUV and magnetic field maps from SDO. The key observational result is that all hard microflares in this dataset have one of the footpoints rooted directly within a sunspot (either in the umbra or the penumbra). This clearly indicates that the underlying magnetic flux densities are large. For the events with the classic two-footpoints morphology, the absolute value of the mean line-of-sight magnetic flux density (and vector magnetic field strength) at the footpoint rooted within the sunspot ranges from 600 to 1800 G (1500 to 2500 G), whereas the outer footpoint measures from 10 to 200 G (100 to 400 G), therefore about 10 times weaker. Approximately 78% of hard microflares, which exhibited two HXR footpoints, have similar or even stronger HXR flux from the footpoint rooted within the sunspot. This contradicts the magnetic mirroring scenario. In addition, about 74% of the events could be approximated by a single loop geometry, demonstrating that hard microflares typically have a relatively simple morphology. We conclude that all hard microflares are rooted in sunspots, which implies that the magnetic field strength plays a key role in efficiently accelerating high-energy electrons, with hard HXR spectra associated with strong fields. This key result will allow us to further constrain our understanding of the electron acceleration mechanisms in flares and space plasmas.</description>

      <title>Deconstructing Solar Super Active Region 13664 in the Context of the Historic Geomagnetic Storm of 2024 May 10-11</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of solar-stellar activity on planetary environments is a topic of great interest within the Sun-Earth system as well as exoplanetary systems. In particular, extreme events such as flares and coronal mass ejections have a profound effect on planetary atmospheres. In May this year, a magnetic active region on the Sun (AR 13664) -- with a size exceeding hundred times that of Earth -- unleashed a large number of high energy X-class flares and associated mass ejections. The resulting Earth impact (geomagnetic storm) on May 10-11 was the strongest in the last two decades. We perform the first comprehensive analysis of the magnetic properties of the active region that spawned these flares and identify this to be a super active region with very rare physical characteristics. We also demonstrate how the rate of energization of the system is related to the flaring process. Our work illuminates how flare productive super active regions on the Sun and stars can be identified and what are their salient physical properties. Specifically, we put AR 13664 in historical context over the cumulative period of 1874 May-2024 June. We find that AR 13664 stands at 99.95 percentile in the distribution of area over 1874 May-2024 June, and at 99.10 percentile in terms of flux content among all ARs over the period 1996 April-2024 June. Our analysis indicates that five of its magnetic properties rank highest among all ARs recorded in SHARP data series during 2010 May-2024 June by the Solar Dynamic Observatory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AR 13664 reached its most dynamic flare productive state following a rapid rate of rise of its flare-relevant parameters and that the X-class flares it spawned were more frequent near their peak values. Our analyses establish AR 13644 to be solar super active region and provide a paradigm for investigating their flare-relevant physical characteristics.</description>

      <title>Strengthening of the f mode due to subsurface magnetic fields in simulations of convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies have found that localized strengthening of the f mode recedes the emergence of active regions on the Sun by one day to three days. To help interpret these observations, we have performed nonlinear simulations of convection with imposed magnetic fields at different depths. We find that the f mode is strengthened when a super-equipartition magnetic field is imposed near the top of the domain. However, neither a magnetic field of equal strength near the bottom of the domain nor an equipartition magnetic field near the top of the domain have a significant effect. Our results suggest that the magnetic precursors of active regions are present near the surface of the Sun for much longer than would be expected if active regions were formed by flux tubes rising from deep within the convection zone. Application to observations should account for the fact that the effects we observe are transient.</description>

      <title>Limb Observations of Global Solar Coronal EUV Wavefronts: the Inclination, Kinematics, Coupling with the Expanding CMEs, and Connection with the CME-driven Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We select and investigate six global solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wave events using data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). These eruptions are all on the limb but recorded as halo coronal mass ejections (CMEs) because the CME-driven shocks have expanded laterally to the opposite side. With the limb observations avoiding the projection effect, we have measured the inclination and speed of the EUV wavefront from 1.05 to 1.25 $R_\odot$. We also investigate the coupling and connection of the EUV wavefront with the CME boundary and the CME-driven shock, respectively. The major findings in the six events are: (1) the forward inclination of the primary and coronal-hole transmitted EUV wavefronts is estimated, respectively, and the origins of these inclinations and their effects on the estimate of actual wavefront speed are investigated; (2) the wavefront speed can be elevated by loop systems near the coronal base, and the average speed in the low corona has no clear correlation with the lateral expansion of the CME-driven shock in the high corona; (3) the fast magnetosonic Mach number of the wavefront is larger than unity from the coronal base; (4) the EUV wavefront is coupled with the CME driver throughout the propagation in two events; (5) after the EUV wavefront vanishes, the CME-driven shock continues traveling on the opposite side and disconnects from the EUV wavefront in four events. These results and their implications are discussed, which provide insight into the properties of global EUV waves.</description>

Abstract: We present a refined speckle-interferometric orbit of a binary system $\mu$ Cet, with the main component studied based on the analysis of photometric and spectroscopic data, obtained at the SAO RAS 6-m telescope. The object was initially classified as a giant with chemical composition anomalies. As a result of our analysis, we conclude that the star belongs to the Main Sequence, to the class of non-peculiar stars. Analysis of photometric data from the TESS mission indicates that the main component of the system belongs to the $\gamma$ Dor pulsators.</description>

      <title>Estimating the total energy content in escaping accelerated solar electron beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying the energy content of accelerated electron beams during solar eruptive events is a key outstanding objective that must be constrained to refine particle acceleration models and understand the electron component of space weather. Previous estimations have used in situ measurements near the Earth, and consequently suffer from electron beam propagation effects. In this study, we deduce properties of a rapid sequence of escaping electron beams that were accelerated during a solar flare on 22 May 2013 and produced type III radio bursts, including the first estimate of energy density from remote sensing observations. We use extreme-ultraviolet observations to infer the magnetic structure of the source active region NOAA 11745, and Nan\c{c}ay Radioheliograph imaging spectroscopy to estimate the speed and origin of the escaping electron beams. Using the observationally deduced electron beam properties from the type III bursts and co-temporal hard X-rays, we simulate electron beam properties to estimate the electron number density and energy in the acceleration region. We find an electron density (above $30\ \mathrm{keV}$) in the acceleration region of $10^{2.5}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ and an energy density of $2\times10^{-5}\ \mathrm{erg\ cm}^{-3}$. Radio observations suggest the particles travelled a very short distance before they began to produce radio emission, implying a radially narrow acceleration region. A short but plausibly wide slab-like acceleration volume of $10^{26}-10^{28}\ \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ atop the flaring loop arcade could contain a total energy of $10^{23}-10^{25}\ \mathrm{erg}$ ($\sim 100$ beams), which is comparable to energy estimates from previous studies.</description>

      <title>Modeling the effects of a lightbridge on oscillations in a solar pore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar pores are ideal magnetic structures for wave propagation and transport of energy radially-outwards across the upper layers of the solar atmosphere. We aim to model the excitation and propagation of magnetohydrodynamic waves in a pore with a lightbridge modelled as two interacting magnetic flux tubes separated by a thin, weaker field, layer. We solve the three-dimensional MHD equations numerically and calculate the circulation as a measure of net torsional motion. We find that the interaction between flux tubes results in the natural excitation of propagating torsional Alfv\'{e}n waves, but find no torsional waves in the model with a single flux tube. The torsional Alfv\'{e}n waves propagate with wave speeds matching the local Alfv\'en speed where wave amplitude peaks.</description>

      <title>Chemical Abundances for a Sample of FGK dwarfs in the Pleiades Open Cluster from APOGEE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents chemical abundances of twelve elements (C, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, and Fe) for 80 FGK dwarfs in the Pleiades open cluster, which span a temperature range of $\sim$2000 K in T$_{\rm eff}$, using the high-resolution (R$\sim$22,500) near-infrared SDSS-IV/APOGEE spectra ($\lambda$1.51--1.69 \micron). Using a 1D LTE abundance analysis, we determine an overall metallicity of [Fe/H]=+0.03$\pm$0.04 dex, with the elemental ratios [$\alpha$/Fe]=+0.01$\pm$0.05, [odd-z/Fe]=-0.04$\pm$0.08, and [iron peak/Fe]=-0.02$\pm$0.08. These abundances for the Pleiades are in line with the abundances of other open clusters at similar galactocentric distances as presented in the literature. Examination of the abundances derived from each individual spectral line revealed that several of the stronger lines displayed trends of decreasing abundance with decreasing $T_{\rm eff}$. The list of spectral lines that yield abundances that are independent of $T_{\rm eff}$ are presented and used for deriving the final abundances. An investigation into possible causes of the temperature-dependent abundances derived from the stronger lines suggests that the radiative codes and the APOGEE line list we employ may inadequately model van der Waals broadening, in particular in the cooler K dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Investigating 39 Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars with VLTI/GRAVITY: Uncovering A Long Period Binary Desert</title>

Abstract: Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs) are thought to be the final evolutionary stages of massive stars and immediate progenitors of stellar-mass black holes. Their multiplicity forms an important anchor point in single and binary population models for predicting gravitational-wave progenitors. Recent spectroscopic campaigns have suggested incompatible multiplicity fractions and period distributions for N- and C-rich Galactic WRs (WNs and WCs) at short as well as long orbital periods, in contradiction with evolutionary model predictions. In this work, we employed infrared interferometry using the $K$-band instrument GRAVITY at the VLTI to investigate the multiplicity of WRs at long periods and explore the nature of their companions. We present a survey of 39 Galactic WRs, including 11 WN, 15 WC and 13 H-rich WN (WNh) stars. We detected wide companions with GRAVITY for only four stars: WR 48, WR 89, WR 93 and WR 115. Combining with spectroscopic studies, we arrived at multiplicity fractions of $f^{\rm WN}_{\rm obs} = 0.55\pm0.15$, $f^{\rm WC}_{\rm obs} = 0.40\pm0.13$ and $f^{\rm WNh}_{\rm obs} = 0.23\pm0.12$. In addition, we also found other features in the GRAVITY dataset such as (i) a diffuse extended component in over half the WR sample; (ii) five known spectroscopic binaries resolved in differential phase data and (iii) spatially resolved winds in four stars: WR 16, WR 31a, WR 78 and WR 110. Our survey reveals a lack of intermediate (few 100s d) and long- (few years to decades) period WR systems. The 200-d peak in the period distributions of WR+OB and BH+OB binaries predicted by Case B mass-transfer binary evolution models is not seen in our data. The rich companionship of their O-type progenitors in this separation range suggest that the WR progenitor stars expand and interact with their companions, most likely through unstable mass-transfer, resulting in either a short-period system or a merger.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Kalman Filter Data Assimilation Into Surface Flux Transport Model To Infer Surface Flows: An Observing System Simulation Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge of the global magnetic field distribution and its evolution on the Sun's surface is crucial for modeling the coronal magnetic field, understanding solar wind dynamics, computing the heliospheric open flux distribution and predicting solar cycle strength. As the far side of the Sun cannot be observed directly and high-latitude observations always suffer from projection effects, we often rely on surface flux transport simulations (SFT) to model long-term global magnetic field distribution. Meridional circulation, the large-scale north-south component of the surface flow profile, is one of the key components of the SFT simulation that requires further constraints near high latitudes. Prediction of the photospheric magnetic field distribution requires knowledge of the flow profile in the future, which demands reconstruction of that same flow at the current time so that it can be estimated at a later time. By performing Observing System Simulation Experiments, we demonstrate how the Ensemble Kalman Filter technique, when used with a SFT model, can be utilized to make ``posterior'' estimates of flow profiles into the future that can be used to drive the model forward to forecast photospheric magnetic field distribution.</description>

      <title>Loki: an ancient system hidden in the Galactic plane?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse high-resolution ESPaDOnS/CFHT spectra of 20 very metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]~$&lt;-2.0$) in the solar neighbourhood (within $\sim2$ kpc) selected to be on planar orbits (maximum height of $&lt;4$ kpc). Targets include 11 prograde and 9 retrograde stars, spanning a wide range of eccentricities ($0.20-0.95$). Their chemical abundances are consistent with those observed in the Galactic halo but show a smaller spread, with no notable difference between progrades and retrogrades. This suggests a common chemical evolution and likely a shared formation site (except for one star). In this case, chemical evolution models indicate that the formation site would have had a baryonic mass of $\sim1.4\times10^9\msun$, similar to classical dwarf galaxies. High-energy supernovae and hypernovae are needed to reproduce the [X/Fe] up to the Fe-peak, while fast-rotating massive stars and neutron star merger events explain the [X/Fe] of the neutron-capture elements. The absence of Type Ia supernova signatures suggests a star formation duration of $&lt;1$Gyr. Cosmological zoom-in simulations support the scenario that an in-plane infall of a single system could disperse stars over a wide range of angular momenta during the early Galactic assembly. We propose that these stars originated in a proto-Galactic building block, which we name \textit{Loki}. Less likely, if progrades and retrogrades formed in two different systems, their chemical evolution must have been very similar, with a combined baryonic mass twice that of a single system. The low number of targets and their limited metallicity range prevent us to exclude if these stars share a common progenitor with other detected structures, like GSE. A comparison (primarily [$\alpha$/Fe]) with other VMPs moving in planar orbits suggests multiple systems contributed to the Galactic planar population, presenting some differences in their kinematical parameters.</description>

Abstract: It is demonstrated through a succinct derivation as to how the linear waves in Hall magnetohydrodynamics (HMHD) constitute a fundamental departure from the standard MHD waves. Apart from modifying the conventional MHD spectrum, the Hall current induces a distinct and new branch consisting of purely circularly polarized waves that may become the representative shear waves.</description>

      <title>Survival of the Fittest: Testing Superradiance Termination with Simulated Binary Black Hole Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superradiance instability of rotating black holes leads to the formation of an ultralight boson cloud with distinctive observational signatures, making black holes an effective probe of ultralight dark matter. However, around black holes in a binary system, the superradiance effect of such clouds can be terminated by tidal perturbations from the companion, leading to cloud depletion. In this study, we perform the first analysis of the impact of this termination effect on superradiant black hole binaries which are realistically modelled after their statistics in our Galaxy. Working with a dataset of approximately $10^7$ black hole binaries simulated using the Stellar EVolution for N-body (SEVN) population synthesis code, we identify the superradiant candidates and those that manage to survive the termination effect. We then calculate the cloud survival rate for various boson masses and black hole spin models. Our findings reveal that the $l=m=1$ cloud modes are generally stable against termination, whereas the $l=m=2$ modes can be significantly affected, with survival rates dropping below $10\%$ for boson masses below approximately $0.5\times 10^{-12}$ eV. In addition, our analysis indicates that clouds that overcome termination typically exhibit a higher superradiant growth rate and therefore a higher detectability.</description>

      <title>A High-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey of Directly Imaged Companion Hosts: I. Determination of diagnostic stellar abundances for planet formation and composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first results of an extensive spectroscopic survey of directly imaged planet host stars. The goal of the survey is the measurement of stellar properties and abundances of 15 elements (including C, O, and S) in these stars. In this work, we present the analysis procedure and the results for an initial set of five host stars, including some very well-known systems. We obtain C/O ratios using a combination of spectral modeling and equivalent width measurements for all five stars. Our analysis indicates solar C/O ratios for HR 8799 (0.59 $\pm$ 0.11), 51 Eri (0.54 $\pm$ 0.14), HD 984 (0.63 $\pm$ 0.14), and GJ 504 (0.54 $\pm$ 0.14). However, we find a super-solar C/O (0.81 $\pm$ 0.14) for HD 206893 through spectral modeling. The ratios obtained using the equivalent width method agree with those obtained using spectral modeling but have higher uncertainties ($\sim$0.3 dex). We also calculate the C/S and O/S ratios, which will help us to better constrain planet formation, especially once planetary sulfur abundances are measured using JWST. Lastly, we find no evidence of highly elevated metallicities or abundances for any of our targets, suggesting that a super metal-rich environment is not a prerequisite for large, widely separated gas planet formation. The measurement of elemental abundances beyond carbon and oxygen also provides access to additional abundance ratios, such as Mg/Si, which could aid in further modeling of their giant companions.</description>

      <title>Origin of Black Hole Spin in Lower-Mass-Gap Black Hole-Neutron Star Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the fourth observing run, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration reported the detection of a coalescing compact binary (GW230529$_{-}$181500) with component masses estimated at $2.5-4.5\, M_\odot$ and $1.2-2.0\, M_\odot$ with 90\% credibility. Given the current constraints on the maximum neutron star (NS) mass, this event is most likely a lower-mass-gap (LMG) black hole-neutron star (BHNS) binary. The spin magnitude of the BH, especially when aligned with the orbital angular momentum, is critical in determining whether the NS is tidally disrupted. An LMG BHNS merger with a rapidly spinning BH is an ideal candidate for producing electromagnetic counterparts. However, no such signals have been detected. In this study, we employ a detailed binary evolution model, incorporating new dynamical tide implementations, to explore the origin of BH spin in an LMG BHNS binary. If the NS forms first, the BH progenitor (He-rich star) must begin in orbit shorter than 0.35 days to spin up efficiently, potentially achieving a spin magnitude of $\chi_{\rm BH} &gt; 0.3$. Alternatively, if a non-spinning BH (e.g., $M_{\rm BH} = 3.6\, M_\odot$) forms first, it can accrete up to $\sim 0.2\, M_\odot$ via Case BA mass transfer (MT), reaching a spin magnitude of $\chi_{\rm BH} \sim 0.18$ under Eddington-limited accretion. With a higher Eddington accretion limit (i.e., 10.0 $\Dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$), the BH can attain a significantly higher spin magnitude of $\chi_{\rm BH} \sim\,0.65$ by accreting approximately $1.0\, M_\odot$ during Case BA MT phase.</description>

      <title>Partial disruption of a planet around a white dwarf: the effect of perturbation from the remnant planet on the accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: About 25\% -50\% of white dwarfs (WDs) are found to be polluted by heavy elements. It has been argued that the pollution could be caused by the tidal disruption of an approaching planet around the WD, during which a large number of clumps would be produced and would finally fall onto the WD. The reason that the planet approaches the WD is usually believed to be due to gravitational perturbations from another distant planet or stellar companion. However, the dynamics of the perturbation and the detailed partial disruption process are still poorly understood. In this study, we present an in-depth investigation of these issues. A triple system composed of a WD, an inner orbit planet, and an outer orbit planet is considered. The inner plant would be partially disrupted periodically in the long-term evolution. Fragments generated in the process are affected by the gravitational perturbations from the remnant planet, facilitating their falling toward the WD. The mass loss rate of the inner planet depends on both its internal structure and also on the orbital configuration of the planetary system.</description>

      <title>Recovering Injected Astrophysics from the LISA Galactic Binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the successful recovery of common envelope ejection efficiency assumed in a simulated population of double white dwarf binaries like those which may be observed by the future LISA mission. We simulate the formation of double white dwarf binaries by using the COSMIC population synthesis code to sample binary formation conditions such as initial mass function, metallicity of star formation, initial orbital period, and initial eccentricity. These binaries are placed in the m12i synthetic Milky-Way-like galaxy, and their signal-to-noise ratio for the LISA instrument is estimated, considering a galactic gravitational wave foreground informed by the population. Through the use of Fisher estimates, we construct a likelihood function for the measurement error of the LISA-bright DWD binaries (&gt; 20 SNR, fGW &gt; 5mHz), in their gravitational wave frequency (fGW) and chirp mass. By repeating this process for different assumptions of the common envelope ejection efficiency, we apply Bayesian hierarchical inference to find the best match to an injected astrophysical assumption for a fiducial population model. We conclude that the impact of common envelope ejection efficiency on the mass transfer processes involved in double white dwarf formation may be statistically relevant in the future observed LISA population, and that constraints on binary formation may be found by comparing simulated populations to a future observed population.</description>

      <title>XUV irradiation of young planetary atmospheres. Results from a joint XMM-Newton and HST observation of HIP67522</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evaporation and the chemistry of the atmospheres of warm and hot planets are strongly determined by the high-energy irradiation they receive from their parent stars. This is more crucial among young extra-solar systems, due to the high activity of stars at early ages. In particular, the EUV part of the stellar spectra drives significant processes of photo-chemical interaction, but it is not directly measurable due to strong interstellar absorption and the lack of sufficiently sensitive instrumentation. An alternative approach is to derive synthetic spectra from the analysis of FUV and X-ray emission lines, that allow to estimate the missed flux in the EUV band. We performed joint and simultaneous spectroscopy of HIP 67522 with XMM-Newton and HST aimed at reconstructing the full high-energy spectrum of this 17 Myr old solar-type (G0) star, which is the youngest known transiting multi-planet system at present time. We performed a time-resolved spectral analysis of the observations, including quiescent emission and flaring variability. Then, we derived the Emission Measure Distribution (EMD) vs. temperature of the chromospheric and coronal plasma from the high-resolution spectra obtained in X-rays with RGS and in FUV with COS. We derived broad-band X-ray and EUV luminosities from the synthetic spectrum based on the EMD, that allowed us to test alternative EUV vs. X-ray scaling laws available in literature. We also employed the total XUV flux received by the inner planet of the system to estimate its instantaneous atmospheric mass loss rate. We confirm that HIP 67522 is a very active star with a hot corona, reaching plasma temperatures above 20 MK even in quiescent state. Its EUV/X-ray flux ratio falls in between the predictions of the two scaling laws we have tested, indicating an important spread in the stellar properties, that requires further investigation.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Radiation Hydrodynamics Simulations of Supernova 1987A Shock Breakout</title>

Abstract: Shock breakout is the first electromagnetic signal from supernovae (SNe), which contains important information on the explosion energy and the size and chemical composition of the progenitor star. This paper presents the first two-dimensional (2D) multi-wavelength radiation hydrodynamics simulations of SN 1987A shock breakout by using the $\texttt{CASTRO}$ code with the opacity table, $\texttt{OPAL}$, considering eight photon groups from infrared to X-ray. To investigate the impact of the pre-supernova environment of SN 1987A, we consider three possible circumstellar medium (CSM) environments: a steady wind, an eruptive mass loss, and the existence of a companion star. In sum, the resulting breakout light curve has an hour duration and its peak luminosity of $\sim 4\times 10^{46}\,\rm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ then following a decay rate of $\sim 3.5\,\rm{mag\,hour^{-1}}$ in X-ray. The dominant band transits to UV around 3 hours after the initial breakout, and its luminosity has a decay rate of $\sim 1.5\,\rm{mag\,hour^{-1}}$ that agrees well with the observed shock breakout tail. The detailed features of breakout emission are sensitive to the pre-explosion environment. Furthermore, our 2D simulations demonstrate the importance of multidimensional mixing and its impacts on shock dynamics and radiation emission. The mixing emerging from the shock breakout may lead to a global asymmetry of SN ejecta and affect its later supernova remnant formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary mass transfer can occur at high rates due to rapid expansion of the donor's envelope. In the case where mass transfer is unstable, the binary can rapidly shrink its orbit and lead to a merger. In this work we consider the appearance of the system preceding merger, specifically for the case of a low-mass ($\approx 2.5$-$3~M_\odot$) helium star with a neutron star (NS) companion. Modeling the mass transfer history as well as the wind launched by super-Eddington accretion onto the NS, we find that such systems can power slowly rising transients with timescales as long as years, and luminosities of $\sim 10^{40}$-$10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$ from optical to UV. The final explosion following the merger (or core-collapse of the helium star in some cases) leads to an interaction-powered transient with properties resembling Type Ibn supernovae (SNe), possibly with a bright early peak powered by shock cooling emission for merger-powered explosions. We apply our model to the Type Ibn SN 2023fyq, that displayed a long-term precursor activity from years before the terminal explosion.</description>

Abstract: Recent observational constraints on the internal structure of Jupiter and Saturn suggest that these planets have ``fuzzy" cores, i.e., gradients of the concentration of heavy elements that might span a large fraction of the planet's radius. These cores could be composed of a semi-convective staircase, i.e., multiple convective layers separated by diffusive interfaces arising from double-diffusive instabilities. However, to date, no study has demonstrated how such staircases can avoid layer mergers and persist over evolutionary time scales. In fact, previous work has found that these mergers occur rapidly, leading to only a single convective layer. Using 3D simulations, we demonstrate that rotation prolongs the lifetime of a convective staircase by increasing the timescale for both layer merger and erosion of the interface between the final two layers. We present an analytic model for the erosion phase, predicting that rotation increases the erosion time by a factor of approximately $\mathrm{Ro}^{-1/2}$, where $\mathrm{Ro}$ is the Rossby number of the convective flows (the ratio of the rotation period to the convective turnover time). For Jovian conditions at early times after formation (when convection is vigorous enough to mix a large fraction of the planet), we find the erosion time to be roughly $10^{9}~\mathrm{yrs}$ in the non-rotating case and $10^{11}~\mathrm{yrs}$ in the rotating case. If these timescales are confirmed with a larger suite of numerical simulations, the existence of convective staircases within the deep interiors of giant planets is a strong possibility, and rotation could be an important factor in the preservation of their fuzzy cores.</description>
