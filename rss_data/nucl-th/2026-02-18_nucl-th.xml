      <title>Perturbative calculations of nucleon-deuteron elastic scattering in chiral effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework for calculating nucleon-deuteron scattering using strict perturbation theory for treating subleading interactions in chiral effective field theory (ChEFT). Rather than using direct evaluations in the distorted-wave expansion, our approach solves a hierarchy of integral equations to obtain subleading scattering amplitudes. A benchmark with the wave packet continuum-discretization is performed. This framework benefits from the fact that the renormalization-group invariance chiral forces involves only a limited number of two-body partial waves at leading order. We use it to calculate nucleon-deuteron elastic scattering differential cross sections and analyzing powers up to next-to-leading order.</description>

      <title>Description of nucleon elastic scattering off $^6$Li with the four-body continuum-discretized coupled-channels method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Neutron reactions off lithium isotopes up to 50 MeV are important for nuclear data science, around the International Fusion Material Irradiation Facility (IFMIF) facility in particular.
  Purpose: We aim at constructing a semi-microscopic reaction model that describes neutron elastic scattering off $^6$Li up to 50 MeV taking the breakup channels of $^6$Li into account.
  Methods: We adopt the continuum-discretized coupled-channels method (CDCC) with an $\alpha+p+n$ three-body model of $^6$Li. We employ the $g$-matrix effective interaction by Jeukenne, Lejeune, and Mahaux (JLM). The renormalization factors of the real and imaginary parts of the JLM interaction are treated as free parameters.
  Results: The renormalization parameter of the real part of the JLM interaction is found to be constant ($=1.1$), whereas that for the imaginary part has a smooth energy dependence. The four-body CDCC calculation with these parameters well describes the angular distributions of both proton and neutron elastic scatterings as well as the neutron total cross section and proton total reaction cross section. The applicable energy range is found to be from 7 MeV to 50 MeV.
  Conclusions: We have constructed a reliable reaction model for describing nucleon-$^6$Li scattering between 7 MeV and 50 MeV. This model can directly be applied to inelastic scattering and break reactions for $^6$Li with the help of the complex scaling method.</description>

      <title>Development of an accurate formalism to predict properties of two-neutron halo nuclei: case study of $^{22}$C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When moving away from stability or in loosely-bound systems, few-body clusterized structures like two-neutron halo nuclei appear. These emerge from the interplay between the many- and few-body degrees of freedom, and/or strong coupling between bound and continuum states. This motivates the development of models that can accurately describe few-body dynamics while enforcing shell effects. This work has two goals: understanding how to accurately enforce the Pauli principle in few-body models, as well as presenting new technical developments that allow for more robust and cheaper three-body calculations. We focus on properties of the two-neutron halo 22C, but expect the conclusions to apply to other few-body systems. We use a three-body, hyperspherical harmonics formalism combined with the R-matrix method. We compare predictions for properties of 22C starting from phenomenological interactions and using two methods to remove Pauli-forbidden states, the projection and supersymmetric methods. We also present the algorithms and derivations used. Additionally, we explore model space truncations that allow for reduced computational time. We show convergence of the calculation of both bound and scattering states for $K_{max}\sim 40$. The two methods to enforce the Pauli-exclusion principle lead to different predictions of 22C properties; the projection method is more accurate. We find one efficient channel truncation that reduces the computational cost of our calculations by 20%. Our study clarifies that the projection method is more accurate than the supersymmetric one to enforce the Pauli-exclusion principle. Technical and algorithmic developments enable accurate and efficient computation of two-neutron halo properties. This development paves the way to robust uncertainty quantification in three-body predictions, and is a useful starting point to tackle more complex systems and observables.</description>

      <title>Radial oscillations of pulsating neutron stars: The UCIa equation-of-state case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radial oscillations provide a clean dynamical test of the high-density stiffness of neutron-star equations of state. We study spherically symmetric pulsations of nonrotating relativistic stars built from cold, charge-neutral, $\beta$-equilibrated pure nucleonic matter described within relativistic mean-field theory. As a baseline we adopt the UCIa parameter set [Astron. Astro-phys. 689, A242 (2024)], and we implement high-density stiffening via the $\sigma$-cut scheme by adding a regulator potential $U_{\rm cut}(\sigma)$ [Phys. Rev. C 92, no.5, 052801 (2015), Phys. Rev. C 106, no.5, 055806 (2022)]. For representative choices $f_s=0$ (no cutoff) and $f_s=0.58$ (stiffened), we solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff and tidal perturbation equations to obtain equilibrium sequences, mass-radius relations, and tidal deformabilities. We then derive and solve the linear general-relativistic radial pulsation equations to compute the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of the fundamental and overtone modes. The $\sigma$-cutoff suppresses the growth of the scalar field at supranuclear density, increases the pressure, and shifts the maximum mass, radii, and $\Lambda_{1.4}$ accordingly, while systematically raising the radial-mode frequencies at fixed mass. Using the sign change of $\omega_0^2$ as a stability criterion, we identify stiffened models that remain radially stable up to the observed $\sim 2M_\odot$ mass scale and are consistent with current multimessenger constraints, demonstrating how radial spectra complement static EoS tests.</description>

      <title>Dispersive analysis of the $\boldsymbol{\phi \to \gamma \pi^0 \pi^0}$ process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the radiative decay $\phi \to \gamma \pi^0 \pi^0$ in a dispersive framework, where the two-pion subsystem undergoes strong final-state interactions that cover the $f_0(500)$ and $f_0(980)$ regions. We employ a coupled-channel Muskhelishvili-Omn\`es framework that allows for a consistent treatment of two scalar resonances and crossed-channel singularities induced by the Born and vector-meson exchanges. We explicitly verify the equivalence between the modified and standard Muskhelishvili-Omn\`es representations for vector-meson pole contributions when the isoscalar Omn\`es matrix is chosen asymptotically bounded, and we adopt the standard representation in decay kinematics. This yields, for the first time, a parameter-free dispersive prediction for the kaon Born rescattering, which provides a dominant contribution. To obtain a good fit to the KLOE and SND data, we employ a once-subtracted coupled-channel dispersion relation with heavier left-hand cut contributions and two unknown subtraction constants. The results demonstrate the consistency among the data for $\pi\pi$ scattering, $\gamma\gamma$ fusion, and $\phi $ radiative decay, thereby validating the underlying dispersive formalism and the input used for the hadronic Omn\`es matrix and left-hand cuts.</description>

      <title>Orbital eccentricity can make neutron star g-mode resonances observable with current gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical tides can provide us vital information about the properties of neutron star (NS) matter. This is particularly true for g-modes, whose frequency and tidal coupling are highly sensitive to the composition of NSs, especially in their centers, where microphysical models are the least reliable. However, due to their weak coupling to external tidal fields, their effect on the gravitational-wave (GW) signal of binary inspirals can be difficult to observe. Here we show that the detectability of these tides can be significantly enhanced by binary NSs with moderate eccentricities. This is primarily due to higher eccentric harmonics in the early phase of the binary evolution experiencing larger phase shifts, which they transport to the sensitive band of GW detectors. In addition, g-mode tides in eccentric binaries undergo several epicyclic resonances, which also amplify the total phase shift. We demonstrate that these effects increase the detectability of g-mode dynamical tides by more than an order of magnitude for eccentricities of $e_\mathrm{10Hz}\sim0.2-0.4$, making it possible to put robust constraints on g-mode properties using current GW detectors, while all relevant models could potentially be constrained with eccentric binary NSs with Einstein Telescope.</description>

      <title>Back-to-back dijet production in DIS at arbitrary Bjorken-x: TMD gluon distributions to twist-3 accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the gluon transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) operator structure of back-to-back quark-antiquark dijet production in deep inelastic scattering at arbitrary Bjorken-x to twist-3 accuracy. Working at leading order in the strong coupling and in the kinematic regime where the transverse momentum imbalance of the jets is much smaller than their individual transverse momenta, we perform a systematic gradient expansion of the quark propagator in a background gluon field. This expansion organizes multiple interactions with the target in terms of longitudinal Wilson lines and gauge-invariant field-strength insertions, yielding a TMD description valid beyond the strict high-energy eikonal (x -&gt; 0) approximation. We obtain explicit cross sections for longitudinally and transversely polarized virtual photons, identifying all contributing gluon TMD operators up to twist-3, including structures involving F_+-, F_ij, and three-gluon correlators. The full longitudinal phase associated with Bjorken-x is retained throughout. In the small-x limit, our results reproduce the known sub-eikonal expressions obtained in the Color Glass Condensate framework, establishing a direct connection between the general-x TMD expansion and high-energy factorization. We further reduce the operator basis using equations of motion, minimizing the number of independent nonperturbative matrix elements entering the cross section. This work provides a systematic foundation for extending TMD analyses of dijet production beyond leading twist, establishing a unified operator framework valid at arbitrary Bjorken x that smoothly interpolates between moderate- and small-x descriptions of gluon TMDs.</description>

      <title>Residue-Enhanced Pion-Rho Mixing as the Origin of Nonmonotonic Charged Pion Mass in Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify the dynamical origin of the non-monotonic magnetic field dependence of the charged pion mass observed in lattice QCD. Using a near-pole effective action derived from the SU(2) Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model, we show that the lowest Landau level charged pion mixes with the longitudinally polarized charged rho meson, which shares the same quantum numbers in a magnetic background. This mixing, generated by quark-loop polarization and a gauge-invariant tree-level operator matched to the vacuum decay $\rho^\pm\rightarrow\pi^\pm\gamma$, induces strong level repulsion. Crucially, this effect is dynamically amplified by a rapid suppression of the rho-meson wave function renormalization near the pole. As a result, the lower eigenmode exhibits a turnover as the magnetic field increases. The mechanism is analogous to singlet-triplet mixing in positronium and provides a natural explanation for the lattice results. Such effects are expected to be generic for charged mesons in magnetic fields when symmetry allowed mixing and near-pole residue suppression are present.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quark fragmentation functions describe the hadronization process of a quark where any of the final-state hadrons carries a fraction of its initial momentum. We compute these fragmentation functions for a cascade that includes pions, kaons, and the charmed $D$ and $D_s$ mesons, starting from the elementary quark-to-meson fragmentation process. The latter is obtained from the relevant cut diagram, and employs Poincar\'e covariant Bethe-Salpeter wave functions and quark propagators. We derive a set of twenty-five coupled jet equations that describe the cascade of emitted mesons in the fragmentation process. Their solutions yield full fragmentation functions that offer a consistent picture of the quark fragmentations across the light and heavy sectors.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore combinations of particle and anti-particle yields which can be used to test thermal models in a parameter free way. We also explore combinations which can be used to extract $\mu_B/T$, $\mu_S/T$ and $\mu_Q/T$. We use experimentally measured particle-antiparticle specific ratios for proton $p$, $\Lambda$, and cascade $\Xi$, for $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = $ 7.7-39 GeV from RHIC BES phase-1 to extract the $\mu_{B,S,Q}/T$. These compared well with published STAR freeze-out parameters. These combinations are verified to predict a similar combination of $\Omega$ and $\overline\Omega$ yields. We also extend this idea to predict (anti-)nuclei yields at energies where they are not measured. We also update parametrizations for the $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ dependence of freeze-out parameters $T$ and $\mu_B$, and present for the first time a similar parametrization of $\mu_S$.</description>

Abstract: This review has explored the fundamental principles of thermal field theory in the context of a background magnetic field, highlighting its theoretical framework and some of its applications to the thermo-magnetic QCD plasma generated in heavy-ion collisions. Our discussion has been limited to equilibrium systems for clarity and conciseness.

      <description>arXiv:2510.24325v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement is a key resource in quantum information science, yet its properties and applications in nuclear systems remain largely unexplored. Here, using proton-proton scattering as a quantum laboratory, we report the emergence of a near-pure Bell-triplet state at a laboratory energy of 151 MeV and a center-of-mass scattering angle of 90 degrees. In this unique kinematic regime, the scattering amplitude functions as a transition operator connecting distinct Bell states. Building upon this emergent resource, we propose a quantum teleportation protocol for proton spins, exploiting the intrinsic Hamiltonian of the strong interaction to perform the requisite Bell measurement. These findings effectively bridge few-body nuclear physics and quantum technology, establishing proton-proton scattering as both a source of high-fidelity entanglement and a natural processor for quantum information.</description>

      <title>Explaining higher-order correlations between elliptic and triangular flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ALICE and CMS Collaborations have analyzed a number of cumulants mixing elliptic flow ($v_2$) and triangular flow ($v_3$), involving up to $8$ particles, in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC. We unravel an unexpected simplicity in these complex mathematical quantities for collisions at fixed impact parameter. We show that as one increases the order in $v_2$, for a given order in $v_3$, the changes in the cumulants are solely determined by the mean elliptic flow in the reaction plane, which originates from the almond-shaped geometry of the overlap area between the colliding nuclei. We derive simple analytic relations between cumulants of different orders on this basis. These relations are in good agreement with recent data from the CMS Collaboration. We argue that agreement will be further improved if the analysis is repeated with a finer centrality binning. We make quantitative predictions for cumulants of order 10 which have not yet been analyzed.</description>

Abstract: Spin-1 particles, is a fundamental bound state for the two quarks, and play a crucial role in elucidating the electromagnetic properties within the realm of hadronic physics. Their intrinsic relativistic nature mandates a quantum field theory (QFT) framework for a comprehensive analysis. In this investigation, we employ both the instant form of QFT and light-front quantum field theory (LFQFT) as our theoretical tools. While conventional LFQFT approaches predominantly focus on the plus component of the electromagnetic current to extract the properties of spin-1 vector particles, our study extends this analysis by systematically incorporating the minus component as well. Our findings demonstrate that achieving a rigorous equivalence between these distinct current components necessitates the inclusion of nonvalence terms within the electromagnetic current operator. This crucial inclusion serves to restore manifest covariance and ensures a robust consistency with the results independently

      <title>Locating the QCD critical point through contours of constant entropy density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method to investigate the existence and location of the conjectured high-temperature critical point of strongly interacting matter via contours of constant entropy density. By approximating these lines as a power series in the baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$, one can extrapolate them from first-principle results at zero net-baryon density, and use them to locate the QCD critical point, including the associated first-order and spinodal lines. As a proof of principle, we employ currently available continuum-extrapolated first-principle results from the Wuppertal--Budapest collaboration to find a critical point at a temperature and a baryon chemical potential of $T_c = 114.3 \pm 6.9$ MeV and $\mu_{B,c} = 602.1 \pm 62.1$ MeV, respectively. We advocate for a more precise determination of the required expansion coefficients via lattice QCD simulations as a means of pinpointing the location of the critical endpoint in the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter.</description>

      <title>Self-similar inverse cascade from generalized symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of generalized symmetries in driving non-equilibrium and non-linear phenomena, specifically focusing on turbulent systems. While conventional turbulence studies have revealed inverse cascades driven by conserved quantities integrated over the entire space, such as helicity in three spatial dimensions, the influence of higher-form symmetries, whose conserved charges are defined by integration over subspaces, remains largely unexplored. We demonstrate a novel mechanism where higher-form symmetries naturally induce a self-similar inverse cascade. Taking axion electrodynamics with non-linear topological interaction as a paradigmatic example, we show that the conserved charge associated with its 1-form symmetry drives the system toward large-scale coherent structures through a universal scaling behavior characterized by analytically determined scaling exponents. Our findings suggest that higher-form symmetries can provide a fundamental organizing principle for understanding non-equilibrium phenomena and the emergence of coherent structures in turbulent systems.</description>

      <title>Di-nucleons do not form bound states at heavy pion mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a high-statistics lattice QCD calculation of the low-energy two-nucleon scattering amplitudes. In order to address discrepancies in the literature, the calculation is performed at a heavy pion mass in the limit that the light quark masses are equal to the physical strange quark mass, $m_\pi = m_K \simeq 714 $ MeV. Using a state-of-the-art momentum space method, we rule out the presence of a bound di-nucleon in both the isospin 0 (deuteron) and 1 (di-neutron) channels, in contrast with many previous results that made use of compact hexaquark creation operators. In order to diagnose the discrepancy, we add such hexaquark interpolating operators to our basis and find that they do not affect the determination of the two-nucleon finite volume spectrum, and thus they do not couple to deeply bound di-nucleons that are missed by the momentum-space operators. Further, we perform a high-statistics calculation of the HAL QCD potential on the same gauge ensembles and find qualitative agreement with our main results. We conclude that di-nucleons do not form bound states at heavy pion masses and that previous identification of deeply bound di-nucleons must have arisen from a misidentification of the spectrum from off-diagonal elements of a correlation function.</description>

      <title>Burgers equation for the bulk viscous pressure of quark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dissipative properties of relativistic strongly interacting nuclear matter significantly influence the damping of stellar oscillations and density fluctuations during compact star mergers. In this work, we derive the evolution equation for the bulk viscous pressure in unpaired quark matter under small deviations from equilibrium. Our analysis reveals that it behaves like a two-component Burgers fluid. We identify four key transport coefficients -- two relaxation times and two bulk viscosity coefficients -- expressed in terms of equilibrium parameters and electroweak nonleptonic and semi-leptonic decay rates. The transport coefficients are evaluated for two distinct equations of state: one based on perturbative quantum chromodynamics and the other on a modified MIT bag model, valid in different density regimes. We also determine the temperature and density region where nonleptonic electroweak processes dominate the dissipation. Our formulation establishes a new way of describing bulk viscous effects in quark matter, applicable for numerical simulations of compact star mergers.</description>

      <title>Rapidity-Dependent Spin Decomposition of the Nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the two-dimensional Fourier transform of the generalized parton distributions (GPDs) has two distinct interpretations: at zero skewness ($\eta=0$) it yields the familiar impact-parameter density, while at finite skewness ($\eta \neq 0$) it encodes a genuine parton-nucleon correlation whose norm decreases predictably with the rapidity gap $\Delta y = 2\mathrm{artanh} \eta$. This rapidity dependence produces universal rapidity-modified Ji identities linking helicity, orbital, and total angular momenta analytically. Using linear open- and closed string Regge trajectories constrained by empirical PDFs, spectroscopy and form factor data, we obtain the leading twist GPDs $H,E,\widetilde{H}$ across the full $(x,\eta,t)$ range. Numerical Mellin Barnes inversion agrees with existing lattice data and yields rapidity resolved predictions for Jefferson Lab 12 GeV, the Electron Ion Collider, and forthcoming lattice studies.</description>

      <title>String-based axial and helicity-flip GPDs: a comparison to lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an analytic, string based representation of the nucleon's axial and helicity flip conformal moments of generalized parton distributions that holds for any skewness and for both the quark and gluon channels. The starting point is the Mellin Barnes resummation of the conformal partial wave expansion, where the moments are parametrized by open (Reggeon) and closed string (Pomeron) trajectories with slopes determined by experimental form factors and meson/glueball spectroscopy. The forward limits are fixed by the empirical unpolarized and polarized parton distributions. Polynomiality, crossing symmetry and support are satisfied by construction. After NLO DGLAP ERBL evolution to $\mu=2$ GeV our analytic framework (i) reproduces some of the currently available lattice moments of $\mathbb{E}$ and $\widetilde{\mathbb{H}}$ in the non singlet sector, (ii) predicts sea quark and gluon polarized moments that will be testable by forthcoming simulations and experiments at Jefferson Lab and the future EIC, and (iii) yields axial and helicity flip GPDs in $x$ space in reasonable agreement with lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07507v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hadronic $\tau$ decays present an opportunity to determine the isovector part of the hadronic-vacuum-polarization contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon in a way complementary to $e^+e^-\to\text{hadrons}$ cross sections. However, the required isospin rotation is only exact in the isospin limit, and corrections need to be under control to draw robust conclusions, most notably for $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$ decays to determine the two-pion contribution, $a_\mu^\text{HVP, LO}[\pi\pi,\tau]$. In this work, we present a novel analysis of the required radiative corrections using dispersion relations, thereby extending in a model-independent way the previous analysis in chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) beyond the threshold region. In particular, we include the dominant structure-dependent virtual corrections from pion-pole diagrams, leading to sizable changes in the vicinity of the $\rho(770)$ resonance. Moreover, we work out the matching to ChPT and devise a strategy for a stable numerical evaluation of real-emission contributions near the two-pion threshold, which proves important to capture isospin-breaking corrections enhanced by the threshold singularity. For the numerical analysis, we use a dispersive representation of the pion form factor including the $\rho'$, $\rho''$ resonances, perform fits to the available data sets for the $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$ spectral function, and calculate the corresponding radiative correction factor $G_\text{EM}(s)$ in a self-consistent manner. Based on these results, we evaluate the $\tau$-specific isospin-breaking corrections to $a_\mu^\text{HVP, LO}[\pi\pi,\tau]$.</description>

      <title>Geometry Induced Chiral Transport and Entanglement in $AdS_2$ Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09714v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the real-time chiral dynamics of Dirac fermions in AdS$_2$ and AdS$_2$ black hole backgrounds. The spacetime curvature generates a spin connection term, acting as an effective magnetic field and a position-dependent chiral chemical potential. This leads to strongly asymmetric wave propagation, confined within an inhomogeneous Lieb-Robinson cone. The front velocities decrease with increasing fermion mass and horizon radius. The entanglement entropy grows inside the causal cone, and it saturates due to screening/dephasing in the finite inhomogeneous chain. In dipole-dipole collision, the central bipartite entropy rises when the inward Lieb-Robinson fronts intersect, forming a bright ridge in the local entanglement profile. Charge and current correlators peak at the front arrival, providing a real-time diagnostic of chiral transport. These results establish a causality-respecting framework, linking curvature and horizons to transport and entanglement in (1+1)-dimensional fermionic matter.</description>

      <title>Mass-imbalance effect on the cluster formation in a one-dimensional Fermi gas with coexistent $s$- and $p$-wave interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the mass-imbalance effect on the clustering in a one-dimensional two-component Fermi gas with coexistent even- and odd-wave interactions resulting in different configurations of clustering phases. We obtain the solutions of both stable two- and three-body cluster states with different mass ratios and configurations by solving the corresponding variational equations. We numerically map out phase diagrams consisting of the $s$- and $p$-wave pairing phases, and {trimer} phase with different configurations, in a plane of $s$- and $p$-wave pairing strengths. Within the explored ranges of $s$- and $p$-wave pairing strengths, the in-vacuum three-body states are always more deeply bound than the two-body ones. While for the in-medium case, the Cooper {trimer} phase dominates over the pairing phases when both $s$- and $p$-wave interactions are moderately strong. There is also a competition between different clustering configurations of three-body clustering.</description>

      <title>Comparing invariant-mass spectroscopy of 8B with ab initio predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Levels in 8B have been investigated experimentally using the invariant-mass technique and compared to ab initio calculations. Data sets obtained using E/A=69-MeV 9C and 13O beams on a Be target have been further analyzed to extend the level scheme of 8B for Ex&lt;10 MeV. New levels were observed in the 2p+6Li, p+3He+alpha, and the p+7Be+gamma exit channels. Momentum correlations between the decay fragments were also investigated in order to deduce the decay pathways and whether the decays are prompt or sequential. This nucleus and its mirror were also investigated in the ab initio symmetry-adapted no-core shell model. Correspondence between the newly observed and predicted levels were made based on the level energy and the decay modes. For positive parity levels with J&lt;=3, all predicted levels can be connected to an experimental counter part (as least tentatively) for Ex&lt;8.4 MeV.</description>
