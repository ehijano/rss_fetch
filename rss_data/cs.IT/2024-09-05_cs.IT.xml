      <title>Gaussian Rate-Distortion-Perception Coding and Entropy-Constrained Scalar Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the best known bounds on the quadratic Gaussian distortion-rate-perception function with limited common randomness for the Kullback-Leibler divergence-based perception measure, as well as their counterparts for the squared Wasserstein-2 distance-based perception measure, recently established by Xie et al. These bounds are shown to be nondegenerate in the sense that they cannot be deduced from each other via a refined version of Talagrand's transportation inequality. On the other hand, an improved lower bound is established when the perception measure is given by the squared Wasserstein-2 distance. In addition, it is revealed by exploiting the connection between rate-distortion-perception coding and entropy-constrained scalar quantization that all the aforementioned bounds are generally not tight in the weak perception constraint regime.</description>

      <title>Multi-Sources Fusion Learning for Multi-Points NLOS Localization in OFDM System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate localization of mobile terminals is a pivotal aspect of integrated sensing and communication systems. Traditional fingerprint-based localization methods, which infer coordinates from channel information within pre-set rectangular areas, often face challenges due to the heterogeneous distribution of fingerprints inherent in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios, particularly within orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems. To overcome this limitation, we develop a novel multi-sources information fusion learning framework referred to as the Autosync Multi-Domains NLOS Localization (AMDNLoc). Specifically, AMDNLoc employs a two-stage matched filter fused with a target tracking algorithm and iterative centroid-based clustering to automatically and irregularly segment NLOS regions, ensuring uniform distribution within channel state information across frequency, power, and time-delay domains. Additionally, the framework utilizes a segment-specific linear classifier array, coupled with deep residual network-based feature extraction and fusion, to establish the correlation function between fingerprint features and coordinates within these regions. Simulation results reveal that AMDNLoc achieves an impressive NLOS localization accuracy of 1.46 meters on typical wireless artificial intelligence research datasets and demonstrates significant improvements in interpretability, adaptability, and scalability.</description>

      <title>Learnable Wireless Digital Twins: Reconstructing Electromagnetic Field with Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully harvesting the gain of multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) requires accurate channel information. However, conventional channel acquisition methods mainly rely on pilot training signals, resulting in significant training overheads (time, energy, spectrum). Digital twin-aided communications have been proposed in [1] to reduce or eliminate this overhead by approximating the real world with a digital replica. However, how to implement a digital twin-aided communication system brings new challenges. In particular, how to model the 3D environment and the associated EM properties, as well as how to update the environment dynamics in a coherent manner. To address these challenges, motivated by the latest advancements in computer vision, 3D reconstruction and neural radiance field, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework for future generation wireless systems that can reconstruct the 3D EM field covered by a wireless access point, based on widely available crowd-sourced world-locked wireless samples between the access point and the devices. This visionary framework is grounded in classical EM theory and employs deep learning models to learn the EM properties and interaction behaviors of the objects in the environment. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed learnable digital twin can implicitly learn the EM properties of the objects, accurately predict wireless channels, and generalize to changes in the environment, highlighting the prospect of this novel direction for future generation wireless platforms.</description>

      <title>Group Information Geometry Approach for Ultra-Massive MIMO Signal Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a group information geometry approach (GIGA) for ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) signal detection. The signal detection task is framed as computing the approximate marginals of the a posteriori distribution of the transmitted data symbols of all users. With the approximate marginals, we perform the maximization of the {\textsl{a posteriori}} marginals (MPM) detection to recover the symbol of each user. Based on the information geometry theory and the grouping of the components of the received signal, three types of manifolds are constructed and the approximate a posteriori marginals are obtained through m-projections. The Berry-Esseen theorem is introduced to offer an approximate calculation of the m-projection, while its direct calculation is exponentially complex. In most cases, more groups, less complexity of GIGA. However, when the number of groups exceeds a certain threshold, the complexity of GIGA starts to increase. Simulation results confirm that the proposed GIGA achieves better bit error rate (BER) performance within a small number of iterations, which demonstrates that it can serve as an efficient detection method in ultra-massive MIMO systems.</description>

      <title>Design of a Standard-Compliant Real-Time Neural Receiver for 5G NR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We detail the steps required to deploy a multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) neural receiver (NRX) in an actual cellular communication system. This raises several exciting research challenges, including the need for real-time inference and compatibility with the 5G NR standard. As the network configuration in a practical setup can change dynamically within milliseconds, we propose an adaptive NRX architecture capable of supporting dynamic modulation and coding scheme (MCS) configurations without the need for any re-training and without additional inference cost. We optimize the latency of the neural network (NN) architecture to achieve inference times of less than 1ms on an NVIDIA A100 GPU using the TensorRT inference library. These latency constraints effectively limit the size of the NN and we quantify the resulting signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) degradation as less than 0.7 dB when compared to a preliminary non-real-time NRX architecture. Finally, we explore the potential for site-specific adaptation of the receiver by investigating the required size of the training dataset and the number of fine-tuning iterations to optimize the NRX for specific radio environments using a ray tracing-based channel model. The resulting NRX is ready for deployment in a real-time 5G NR system and the source code including the TensorRT experiments is available online.</description>

      <title>Conversational Complexity for Assessing Risk in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present a dual-use dilemma: they enable beneficial applications while harboring potential for harm, particularly through conversational interactions. Despite various safeguards, advanced LLMs remain vulnerable. A watershed case was Kevin Roose's notable conversation with Bing, which elicited harmful outputs after extended interaction. This contrasts with simpler early jailbreaks that produced similar content more easily, raising the question: How much conversational effort is needed to elicit harmful information from LLMs? We propose two measures: Conversational Length (CL), which quantifies the conversation length used to obtain a specific response, and Conversational Complexity (CC), defined as the Kolmogorov complexity of the user's instruction sequence leading to the response. To address the incomputability of Kolmogorov complexity, we approximate CC using a reference LLM to estimate the compressibility of user instructions. Applying this approach to a large red-teaming dataset, we perform a quantitative analysis examining the statistical distribution of harmful and harmless conversational lengths and complexities. Our empirical findings suggest that this distributional analysis and the minimisation of CC serve as valuable tools for understanding AI safety, offering insights into the accessibility of harmful information. This work establishes a foundation for a new perspective on LLM safety, centered around the algorithmic complexity of pathways to harm.</description>

      <title>Effective Distance of Higher Dimensional HGPs and Weight-Reduced Quantum LDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02193v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction plays a prominent role in the realization of quantum computation, and quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes are believed to be practically useful stabilizer codes. While qLDPC codes are defined to have constant weight parity-checks, the weight of these parity checks could be large constants that make implementing these codes challenging. Large constants can also result in long syndrome extraction times and bad error propagation that can impact error correction performance. Hastings recently introduced weight reduction techniques for qLDPC codes that reduce the weight of the parity checks as well as the maximum number of checks that acts on any data qubit. However, the fault tolerance of these techniques remains an open question. In this paper, we analyze the effective distance of the weight-reduced code when single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuits are considered for error correction. We prove that there exists single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuits that largely preserve the effective distance of the weight-reduced qLDPC codes. In addition, we also show that the distance balancing technique introduced by Evra et al. preserves effective distance. As a corollary, our result shows that higher-dimensional hypergraph product (HGP) codes, also known as homological product codes corresponding to the product of 1-complexes, have no troublesome hook errors when using any single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuit.</description>

      <title>Linear Convergence in Hilbert's Projective Metric for Computing Augustin Information and a R\'{e}nyi Information Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the problems of computing the Augustin information and a R\'{e}nyi information measure of statistical independence, previously explored by Lapidoth and Pfister (\textit{IEEE Information Theory Workshop}, 2018) and Tomamichel and Hayashi (\textit{IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory}, 64(2):1064--1082, 2018). Both quantities are defined as solutions to optimization problems and lack closed-form expressions. This paper analyzes two iterative algorithms: Augustin's fixed-point iteration for computing the Augustin information, and the algorithm by Kamatsuka et al. (arXiv:2404.10950) for the R\'{e}nyi information measure. Previously, it was only known that these algorithms converge asymptotically. We establish the linear convergence of Augustin's algorithm for the Augustin information of order $\alpha \in (1/2, 1) \cup (1, 3/2)$ and Kamatsuka et al.'s algorithm for the R\'{e}nyi information measure of order $\alpha \in [1/2, 1) \cup (1, \infty)$, using Hilbert's projective metric.</description>

      <title>Approximating mutual information of high-dimensional variables using learned representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mutual information (MI) is a general measure of statistical dependence with widespread application across the sciences. However, estimating MI between multi-dimensional variables is challenging because the number of samples necessary to converge to an accurate estimate scales unfavorably with dimensionality. In practice, existing techniques can reliably estimate MI in up to tens of dimensions, but fail in higher dimensions, where sufficient sample sizes are infeasible. Here, we explore the idea that underlying low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional data can be exploited to faithfully approximate MI in high-dimensional settings with realistic sample sizes. We develop a method that we call latent MI (LMI) approximation, which applies a nonparametric MI estimator to low-dimensional representations learned by a simple, theoretically-motivated model architecture. Using several benchmarks, we show that unlike existing techniques, LMI can approximate MI well for variables with $&gt; 10^3$ dimensions if their dependence structure has low intrinsic dimensionality. Finally, we showcase LMI on two open problems in biology. First, we approximate MI between protein language model (pLM) representations of interacting proteins, and find that pLMs encode non-trivial information about protein-protein interactions. Second, we quantify cell fate information contained in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) measurements of hematopoietic stem cells, and find a sharp transition during neutrophil differentiation when fate information captured by scRNA-seq increases dramatically.</description>

      <title>Key Compression Limits for $k$-Minimum Value Sketches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $k$-Minimum Values (\kmv) data sketch algorithm stores the $k$ least hash keys generated by hashing the items in a dataset. We show that compression based on ordering the keys and encoding successive differences can offer $O(\log n)$ bits per key in expected storage savings, where $n$ is the number of unique values in the data set. We also show that $O(\log n)$ expected bits saved per key is optimal for any form of compression for the $k$ least of $n$ random values -- that the encoding method is near-optimal among all methods to encode a \kmv sketch. We present a practical method to perform that compression, show that it is computationally efficient, and demonstrate that its average savings in practice is within about five percent of the theoretical minimum based on entropy. We verify that our method outperforms off-the-shelf compression methods, and we demonstrate that it is practical, using real and synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Random Staircase Generator Matrix Codes: Performance Analysis and Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a class of codes, referred to as random staircase generator matrix codes (SGMCs), which have staircase-like generator matrices. In the infinite-length region, we prove that the random SGMC is capacity-achieving over binary-input output-symmetric (BIOS) channels. In the finite-length region, we present the representative ordered statistics decoding with local constraints (LC-ROSD) algorithm for the SGMCs. The most distinguished feature of the SGMCs with LC-ROSD is that the staircase-like matrices enable parallel implementation of the Gaussian elimination (GE), avoiding the serial GE of conventional OSD and supporting a potential low decoding latency, as implied from simulations. To analyze the performance of random SGMCs in the finite-length region, we derive the ensemble weight spectrum and invoke the conventional union bound. We also derive a partially random coding union (RCU) bound, which is tighter than the conventional one and is used as a criterion to design the SGMCs. Staircase-like generator matrices allow us to derive a series of (tighter and tighter) lower bounds based on the second-order Bonferroni inequality with the incremental number of codewords. The numerical results show that the decoding performance can match well with the proposed partially RCU bound for different code rates and different profiles. The numerical results also show that the tailored SGMCs with the LC-ROSD algorithm can approach the finite-length performance bound, outperforming the 5G low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, 5G polar codes, and Reed-Muller (RM) codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to secret key establishment that appears to be resistant to currently known quantum cryptanalytic algorithms. This quantum resistance arises because the security of our method does not rely on the difficulty of integer factorization or the discrete logarithm problem. Based on the analyses of Alice's public key, the communication exchange between Alice and Bob, and the scenario where Bob behaves as Eve, we can conclude that, even if Eve has access to a quantum computer capable of solving discrete logarithms, she is unable to determine Alice's private key. Additionally, our approach achieves Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), ensuring that the security of previously used keys is not compromised by any key that becomes compromised. Notably, our system offers competitive public and private key sizes compared to those currently available.</description>

      <title>Two-Phase Channel Estimation for RIS-Assisted THz Systems with Beam Split</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted terahertz (THz) communication is emerging as a key technology to support ultra-high data rates in future sixth-generation networks. However, the acquisition of accurate channel state information (CSI) in such systems is challenging due to the passive nature of RIS and the hybrid beamforming architecture typically employed in THz systems. To address these challenges, we propose a novel low-complexity two-phase channel estimation scheme for RIS-assisted THz systems with beam split effect. In the proposed scheme, we first estimate the full CSI over a small subset of subcarriers, then extract angular information at both the base station and RIS. Subsequently, we recover the full CSI across remaining subcarriers by determining the corresponding spatial directions and angle-excluded coefficients. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance in terms of normalized mean-square error while significantly reducing computational complexity compared to existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communications for Unsourced Random Access: Fundamental Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work considers the problem of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) with a massive number of unsourced and uncoordinated users. In the proposed model, known as the unsourced ISAC system (UNISAC), all active communication and sensing users simultaneously share a short frame to transmit their signals, without requiring scheduling with the base station (BS). Hence, the signal received from each user is affected by significant interference from numerous interfering users, making it challenging to extract the transmitted signals. UNISAC aims to decode the transmitted message sequences from communication users while simultaneously detecting active sensing users and estimating their angles of arrival, regardless of the identity of the senders. In this paper, we derive an approximate achievable result for UNISAC and demonstrate its superiority over conventional approaches such as ALOHA, time-division multiple access, treating interference as noise, and multiple signal classification. Through numerical simulations, we validate the effectiveness of UNISAC's sensing and communication capabilities for a large number of users.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Channel Decoding for Wireless Federated Learning: Convergence Analysis and Adaptive Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13703</link>

Abstract: One of the most critical challenges for deploying distributed learning solutions, such as federated learning (FL), in wireless networks is the limited battery capacity of mobile clients. While it is a common belief that the major energy consumption of mobile clients comes from the uplink data transmission, this paper presents a novel finding, namely channel decoding also contributes significantly to the overall energy consumption of mobile clients in FL. Motivated by this new observation, we propose an energy-efficient adaptive channel decoding scheme that leverages the intrinsic robustness of FL to model errors. In particular, the robustness is exploited to reduce the energy consumption of channel decoders at mobile clients by adaptively adjusting the number of decoding iterations. We theoretically prove that wireless FL with communication errors can converge at the same rate as the case with error-free communication provided the bit error rate (BER) is properly constrained. An adaptive channel decoding scheme is then proposed to improve the energy efficiency of wireless FL systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method maintains the same learning accuracy while reducing the channel decoding energy consumption by ~20% when compared to an existing approach.</description>

      <title>Delay Parameter Selection in Permutation Entropy Using Topological Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04329</link>
      <description>arXiv:1905.04329v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Permutation Entropy (PE) is a powerful tool for quantifying the complexity of a signal which includes measuring the regularity of a time series. Additionally, outside of entropy and information theory, permutations have recently been leveraged as a graph representation, which opens the door for graph theory tools and analysis. Despite the successful application of permutations in a variety of scientific domains, permutations requires a judicious choice of the delay parameter $\tau$ and dimension $n$. However, $n$ is typically selected within an accepted range giving optimal results for the majority of systems. Therefore, in this work we focus on choosing the delay parameter, while giving some general guidance on the appropriate selection of $n$ based on a statistical analysis of the permutation distribution. Selecting $\tau$ is often accomplished using trial and error guided by the expertise of domain scientists. However, in this paper, we show how persistent homology, a commonly used tool from Topological Data Analysis (TDA), provides methods for the automatic selection of $\tau$. We evaluate the successful identification of a suitable $\tau$ from our TDA-based approach by comparing our results to both expert suggested parameters from published literature and optimized parameters (if possible) for a wide variety of dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Lattice sums of $I$-Bessel functions, theta functions, linear codes and heat equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend a certain type of identities on sums of $I$-Bessel functions on lattices, previously given by G. Chinta, J. Jorgenson, A. Karlsson and M. Neuhauser. Moreover we prove that, with continuum limit, the transformation formulas of theta functions such as the Dedekind eta function can be given by $I$-Bessel lattice sum identities with characters. We consider analogues of theta functions of lattices coming from linear codes and show that sums of $I$-Bessel functions defined by linear codes can be expressed by complete weight enumerators. We also prove that $I$-Bessel lattice sums appear as solutions of heat equations on general lattices. As a further application, we obtain an explicit solution of the heat equation on $\mathbb{Z}^n$ whose initial condition is given by a linear code.</description>

      <title>Privacy-aware Berrut Approximated Coded Computing for Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an interesting strategy that enables the collaborative training of an AI model among different data owners without revealing their private datasets. Even so, FL has some privacy vulnerabilities that have been tried to be overcome by applying some techniques like Differential Privacy (DP), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), or Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC). However, these techniques have some important drawbacks that might narrow their range of application: problems to work with non-linear functions and to operate large matrix multiplications and high communication and computational costs to manage semi-honest nodes. In this context, we propose a solution to guarantee privacy in FL schemes that simultaneously solves the previously mentioned problems. Our proposal is based on the Berrut Approximated Coded Computing, a technique from the Coded Distributed Computing paradigm, adapted to a Secret Sharing configuration, to provide input privacy to FL in a scalable way. It can be applied for computing non-linear functions and treats the special case of distributed matrix multiplication, a key primitive at the core of many automated learning tasks. Because of these characteristics, it could be applied in a wide range of FL scenarios, since it is independent of the machine learning models or aggregation algorithms used in the FL scheme. We provide analysis of the achieved privacy and complexity of our solution and, due to the extensive numerical results performed, a good trade-off between privacy and precision can be observed.</description>

      <title>Joint Transmission and Compression Design for 6G Networked Sensing with Limited-Capacity Backhaul</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers networked sensing in cellular network, where multiple base stations (BSs) first compress their received echo signals from multiple targets and then forward the quantized signals to the central unit (CU) via limited-capacity fronthaul links, such that the CU can leverage all useful echo signals to perform high-resolution localization. Under this setup, we manage to characterize the posterior Cramer-Rao Bound (PCRB) for localizing all the targets with random positions as a function of the transmit covariance matrix and the compression noise covariance matrix of each BS. Then, a PCRB minimization problem subject to the transmit power constraints and the fronthaul capacity constraints is formulated to jointly design the BSs' transmission and compression strategies. We propose an efficient algorithm to solve this problem based on the alternating optimization technique. Specifically, it is shown that when either the transmit covariance matrices or the compression noise covariance matrices are fixed, the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique can be leveraged to optimize the other type of covariance matrices locally optimally. Moreover, we also propose a novel estimate-then-beamform-then-compress strategy for the massive receive antenna scenario, under which each BS first estimates targets' angle-of-arrivals (AOAs) locally, then beamforms its high-dimension received signals into low-dimension ones based on the estimated AOAs, and last compresses the beamformed signals for fronthaul transmission. An efficient beamforming and compression design method is devised under this strategy. Numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.</description>
