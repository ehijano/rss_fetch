      <title>Irreversibility in Bacterial Regulatory Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Irreversibility, in which a transient perturbation leaves a system in a new state, is an emergent property in systems of interacting entities. This property has well-established implications in statistical physics but remains underexplored in biological networks, especially for bacteria and other prokaryotes whose regulation of gene expression occurs predominantly at the transcriptional level. Focusing on the reconstructed regulatory network of \emph{Escherichia coli}, we examine network responses to transient single-gene perturbations. We predict irreversibility in numerous cases and find that the incidence of irreversibility increases with the proximity of the perturbed gene to positive circuits in the network. Comparison with experimental data suggests a connection between the predicted irreversibility to transient perturbations and the evolutionary response to permanent perturbations.</description>

      <title>Non-explosivity of endotactic stochastic reaction systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reaction networks have been widely used as generic models in diverse areas of applied science, such as biology, chemistry, ecology, epidemiology, and computer science. Reaction networks incorporating noisy effect are modelled as continuous time Markov chains (CTMC), and are called stochastic reaction systems. Non-explosivity is a concept that characterizes regularity of CTMCs. In this paper, we study non-explosivity of stochastic reaction systems, in the sense of their underlying CTMCs. By constructing a simple linear Lyapunov function, we obtain non-explosivity for a class of endotactic stochastic reaction systems containing second-order endotactic stochastic mass-action systems as a subset. As a consequence, we prove that every bimolecular weakly reversible stochastic mass-action system is non-explosive. We apply our results to diverse models in biochemistry, epidemiology, ecology, and synthetic biology in the literature.</description>

      <title>When lowering temperature, the in vivo circadian clock in cyanobacteria follows and surpasses the in vitro protein clock trough the Hopf bifurcation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The in vivo circadian clock in single cyanobacteria is studied here by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy when the temperature is lowered below 25{\deg}C . We first disentangle the circadian clock behavior from the bacterial cold shock response by identifying a sequence of "death steps" based on cellular indicators. By analyzing only "alive" tracks, we show that the dynamic response of individual oscillatory tracks to a step-down temperature signal is described by a simple Stuart-Landau oscillator model. The same dynamical analysis applied to in vitro data (KaiC phosphorylation level following a temperature step-down) allows for extracting and comparing both clock's responses to a temperature step down. It appears, therefore, that both oscillators go through a similar supercritical Hopf bifurcation. Finally, to quantitatively describe the temperature dependence of the resulting in vivo and in vitro Stuart-Landau parameters $\mu(T)$ and $\omega_c(T)$, we propose two simplified analytical models: temperature-dependent positive feedback or time-delayed negative feedback that is temperature compensated. Our results provide strong constraints for future models and emphasize the importance of studying transitory regimes along temperature effects in circadian systems.</description>

      <title>Limits on the computational expressivity of non-equilibrium biophysical processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many biological decision-making processes can be viewed as performing a classification task over a set of inputs, using various chemical and physical processes as "biological hardware." In this context, it is important to understand the inherent limitations on the computational expressivity of classification functions instantiated in biophysical media. Here, we model biochemical networks as Markov jump processes and train them to perform classification tasks, allowing us to investigate their computational expressivity. We reveal several unanticipated limitations on the input-output functions of these systems, which we further show can be lifted using biochemical mechanisms like promiscuous binding. We analyze the flexibility and sharpness of decision boundaries as well as the classification capacity of these networks. Additionally, we identify distinctive signatures of networks trained for classification, including the emergence of correlated subsets of spanning trees and a creased "energy landscape" with multiple basins. Our findings have implications for understanding and designing physical computing systems in both biological and synthetic chemical settings.</description>
