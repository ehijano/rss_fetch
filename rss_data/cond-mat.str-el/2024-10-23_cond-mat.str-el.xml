      <title>Is the low-energy optical absorption in correlated insulators controlled by quantum geometry?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the discovery of a variety of correlated insulators in the moir\'e universe, controlled by interactions projected to a set of isolated bands with a narrow bandwidth, we examine here a partial sum-rule associated with the inverse frequency-weighted optical conductivity restricted to low-energies. Unlike standard sum-rules that extend out to $infinite$ frequencies, which include contributions from $all$ inter-band transitions, we focus here on transitions associated $only$ with the $projected$ degrees of freedom. We analyze the partial sum-rule in a non-perturbative but "solvable" limit for a variety of correlation-induced insulators. This includes (i) magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene at integer-filling with projected Coulomb interactions, starting from the chiral flat-band limit and including realistic perturbations, (ii) fractional fillings of Chern-bands which support generalized Laughlin-like states, starting from a Landau-level and including a periodic potential and magnetic-field, respectively, drawing connections to twisted MoTe$_2$, and (iii) integer filling in toy-models of non-topological flat-bands with a tunable quantum geometry in the presence of repulsive interactions. The partial sum-rule in all of these examples is implicitly constrained by the form of the band quantum geometry via the low-lying excitation spectrum, but is not related to it explicitly. For interacting Slater-determinant insulators, the partial sum-rule is related to a new quantity -- "many-body projected quantum geometry" -- obtained from the interaction-renormalized electronic bands. We also point out an intriguing connection between the partial sum-rule and the quantum Fisher information associated with the projected many-body position operator.</description>

      <title>Theory of excitonic order in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that kagome metals can feature an excitonic condensate of unconventional nature. Studying the recently discovered variant ScV$_6$Sn$_6$, we identify electron and hole pockets due to a pair of van Hove singularities (vHS) close to the Fermi level, with an approximate spectral particle-hole symmetry at low energies. A significant fraction of the Fermi level density of states away from the vHS is removed by the onset of high temperature charge density wave order, and makes the bands more two dimensional, setting the stage for the formation of excitons. We develop a two-orbital minimal model which captures these features, along with the sublattice support of the wavefunctions, and find $s$-wave or $d$-wave excitons depending on the microscopic interaction parameters -- the latter of which exhibits either a charge nematic or time-reversal symmetry breaking flux order depending on strain, offering an explanation of recent STM and transport experiments. The appearance of particle-type and hole-type vHS, and the excitonic resonance associated with it, may be a common thread to understanding nematicity and time-reversal symmetry breaking in kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Quantum and Thermal Fluctuations in Two-Dimensional Randomly Pinned Charge Density Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations in the presence of quenched random disorder is a long-standing open theoretical problem which has been made more urgent by advances in modern experimental techniques. The fragility of charge density wave order to impurities makes this problem of particular interest in understanding a host of real materials, including the cuprate high-temperature superconductors. To address this question, we consider the quantum version of an exactly solvable classical model of two-dimensional randomly pinned incommensurate charge density waves first introduced by us in a recent work, and use the large-$N$ technique to obtain the phase diagram and order parameter correlations. Our theory considers quantum and thermal fluctuations and disorder on equal footing by accounting for all effects non-perturbatively, which reveals a novel crossover between under-damped and over-damped dynamics of the fluctuations of the charge density wave order parameter.</description>

      <title>Stability of algebraic spin liquids coupled to quantum phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algebraic spin liquids are quantum disordered phases of insulating magnets which exhibit fractionalized gapless excitations and power-law correlations. Quantum spin liquids in this category include the experimentally established 1D Luttinger liquid, as well as the U(1) Dirac spin liquid (DSL) which has been a focus of recent candidate materials searches. Most notably, several exchange-frustrated Heisenberg materials on the triangular lattice have shown evidence of the U(1) DSL. In this work, we measure the algebraic correlations of spin-singlet excitations in the $J_1$-$J_2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the triangular lattice, prompting a detailed investigation of this model's stability under spin-phonon coupling using variational Monte Carlo. As seen before in 1D spin chains, we observe a low-temperature transition from a U(1) DSL to valence bond order and predict the parameter regime where the model realizes a stable DSL ground state. To achieve this, we employ a series of finite-size scaling Ans\"atze inspired by the low-energy DSL's conformal description in terms of quantum electrodynamics, and show that emergent monopole operators drive the instability. We compare the physics of this transition to the 1D Luttinger liquid throughout our analysis. We derive the regime of stability against spin-Peierls ordering and argue that the DSL ground state might still be achievable in candidate materials, despite its tendency to valence bond solid ordering.</description>

      <title>Quench dynamics of stripes and phase separation in the two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the fundamental dynamical process of an initial quench of the chemical potential of the two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model. Depending on the ground state phase, sharply different dynamical behavior of the charge distribution and entanglement properties are observed. In the stripe phase, the intertwining of the spin and charge density waves remains stable under time evolution. A ballistic spreading of the charge density is observed with a propagation speed that is only weakly dependent on the coupling ratio, $J/t$. Moreover, in the phase-separated regime for large $J/t$, we report a complete dynamical freezing of charge degrees of freedom within, where even under long time evolution the entanglement entropy remains bounded. Our results are obtained by combining large-scale exact diagonalizations and matrix product state techniques for time evolution.</description>

      <title>Universal time evolution of string order parameter in quantum critical systems with boundary invertible or non-invertible symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global symmetry, either invertible or non-invertible, has been extensively studied in two dimensional conformal field theories in recent years. When the theory is defined on a manifold with open boundaries, however, many interesting conformal boundary conditions will fully or partially break such global symmetry. In this work, we study the effect of symmetry-breaking boundaries or interfaces when the system is out of equilibrium. We show that the boundary or interface symmetry-breaking can be detected by the time evolution of string order parameters, which are constructed from the symmetry operators that implement the symmetry transformations. While the string order parameters are independent of time if the symmetry is preserved over the whole system, they evolve in time in a universal way if the boundary or interface breaks the symmetry. More explicitly, in the presence of boundary or interface symmetry-breaking, the string order parameters decay exponentially in time after a global quantum quench, and decay as a power-law in time after a local quantum quench. We also generalize our study to the case when the string order parameters are defined in a subsystem, which are related to the full counting statistics. It is found there are also universal features in the time evolution of string order parameters in this case. We verify our field theory results by studying the time evolution of these two different types of string order parameters in lattice models.</description>

      <title>Absence of Acoustic Phonon Anomaly in a Kagome Metal with Short-ranged Structural Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome lattice $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, and Cs) superconductors without magnetism from vanadium $d$-electrons are intriguing because they have a novel charge density wave (CDW) order around 90 K and display superconductivity at $\sim$3 K that competes with the CDW order. Recently, CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$, isostructural to $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$, was found to have concurrent structural and magnetic phase transition at $T^{\ast}\approx$ 55 K that can be suppressed by pressure to induce superconductivity [Liu \textit{et al.}, \href{https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07761-x}{Nature \textbf{632}, 1032 (2024)}]. Here, we use elastic and inelastic X-ray scattering to study the microscopic origin of the structural transition in CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$. Although our elastic measurements confirm the 4$\times$1$\times$1 superlattice order below $T^{\ast}$, its underlying correlation is rather short-ranged. Moreover, our inelastic measurements at the superlattice wavevectors around (3, 0, 0) find no evidence of a significant acoustic phonon anomaly below $T^{\ast}$, similar to the case of $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$. The absence of acoustic phonon anomaly indicates a weak electron-phonon coupling in CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$, suggesting that the structural transition is likely associated with an unconventional CDW order.</description>

      <title>Visualization of spin-orbit entangled 4f electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrons in localized 4f orbitals around lanthanide elements in solids are dominated by strong spin-orbit coupling. The resultant J multiplets are further split by the crystalline electric field, where J denotes the total angular momentum quantum number, and hence exhibit anisotropic spatial distribution. The anisotropy of spin-orbit entangled 4f electrons is closely linked to their physical properties. Here, we demonstrate the visualization of 4f electrons in pyrochlore oxides A2Ir2O7 (A = Pr, Nd, and Eu) by combining high-photon-energy X-ray diffraction and valence electron density (VED) analysis based on the core differential Fourier synthesis (CDFS) method. The observed VED distributions around the A site roughly agree with point-charge calculations, considering the relativistic spin-orbit coupling and the trigonal crystal electric field under the LS coupling scheme. The CDFS-based VED observation method can be applied to the analysis of the 4f state of various crystalline materials.</description>

      <title>$\textit{Ab initio}$ dynamical mean-field theory with natural orbitals renormalization group impurity solver: Formalism and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel implementation of density functional theory integrated with single-site dynamical mean-field theory to investigate the complex properties of strongly correlated materials. This comprehensive first-principles many-body computational toolkit, termed $\texttt{Zen}$, utilizes the Vienna $\textit{ab initio}$ simulation package and the $\texttt{Quantum ESPRESSO}$ code to perform density functional theory calculations and generate band structures for realistic materials. The challenges associated with correlated electron systems are addressed through two distinct yet complementary quantum impurity solvers: the natural orbitals renormalization group solver for zero temperature and the hybridization expansion continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo solver for finite temperature. Additionally, this newly developed toolkit incorporates several valuable post-processing tools, such as $\texttt{ACFlow}$, which employs the maximum entropy method and the stochastic pole expansion method for the analytic continuation of Matsubara Green's functions and self-energy functions. To validate the performance of this toolkit, we examine three representative cases: the correlated metal SrVO$_{3}$, the nickel-based unconventional superconductor La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$, and the wide-gap Mott insulator MnO. The results obtained demonstrate strong agreement with experimental findings and previously available theoretical results. Notably, we successfully elucidate the quasiparticle peak and band renormalization in SrVO$_{3}$, the dominance of Hund correlation in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$, and the pressure-driven insulator-metal transition as well as the high-spin to low-spin transition in MnO. These findings suggest that $\texttt{Zen}$ is proficient in accurately describing the electronic structures of $d$-electron correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phonon Dynamics Induced Spontaneous Spin-Orbit Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling in solids is typically a single-body effect arising from relativity. In this work, we propose a spontaneous generation of spin-orbit coupling from symmetry breaking. A spin-dependent electron-phonon coupling model is investigated on a half-filled square lattice, which is solved by sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The phase diagram as function of phonon frequency $\omega$ and coupling constant $\lambda$ is fully investigated. The spin-orbit coupling emerges as an order in the ground state for any $\lambda$ in the adiabatic limit, accompanied by a breathing mode of lattice distortion and a staggered loop spin-current. This phase dominates in the entire range of $\omega$ with $\lambda&lt; \lambda_{\infty}$, a critical value in the $\omega \to \infty$ limit. With increasing $\omega$ and $\lambda &gt; \lambda_{\infty}$, the emergent spin-orbit coupling is suppressed and a phase transition occurs leading to charge-density-wave degenerate with superconductivity order. Our work opens up the possibility of hidden spin-orbit coupling in materials where it is otherwise forbidden by lattice symmetry and paves the way to explore new usable materials or devices in spintronics.</description>

Abstract: Ho$_3$ScO$_6$ harbours a frustrated Maple Leaf Lattice (MLL). It crystalizes in the Mg$_3$TeO$_6$-type structure, and has a centrosymmetric trigonal space group (R$\bar{3}$). This system contains stacked layers of magnetic rings along the c-axis consisting of six magnetic Ho$^{3+}$ ions forming Ho hexagons, which are connected into a 2-dimensional network by equilateral and isosceles triangles to form a rare example of a MLL. Long range magnetic order is reached below $T_N=4.1$ K with a 120$^\circ$ spin arrangement on the equilateral triangles resulting in a positive vector chirality ground state configuration.</description>

      <title>Properties of an organic model $S=1$ Haldane chain system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the properties of a new organic $S=1$ chain system $m$-NO$_2$PhBNO (abbreviated BoNO). In this biradical system two unpaired electrons from aminoxyl groups are strongly ferromagnetically coupled ($|J_\text{FM}| \gtrsim 500$ K) which leads to the formation of an effective $S=1$ state for each molecule. The chains of BoNO diradicals propagate along the crystallographic $a$ axis. Temperature dependence of the $g$ factor and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) linewidth are consistent with a low-dimensional system with antiferromagnetic interactions. The EPR data further suggest that BoNO is the first known Haldane system with an almost isotropic $g$ factor ($2.0023 \pm 2 \unicode{x2030}$). The magnetization measurements in magnetic fields up to $40$ T and low-field susceptibility, together with $^1$H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, reveal a dominant intrachain antiferromagnetic exchange coupling of $J_\text{1D} = (11.3\pm0.1)$ K, and attainable critical magnetic fields of $\mu_0 H_\text{c1} \approx 2$ T and $\mu_0 H_\text{c2} \approx 33$ T. These measurements therefore suggest that BoNO is a unique Haldane system with extremely small magnetic anisotropy. Present results are crucial for a future in-depth NMR study of the low-temperature Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) and magnetic field-induced phases, which can be performed in the entire phase space.</description>

      <title>Engineering correlated Dirac fermions and flat bands on SiC with transition-metal adatom lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose three transition-metal adatom systems on 3C-SiC(111) surfaces as a versatile platform to realize massless Dirac fermions and flat bands with strong electronic correlations. Using density functional theory combined with the constrained random phase approximation and dynamical mean-field theory, we investigate the electronic properties of Ti, V, and Cr adatoms. The triangular surface lattices exhibit narrow bandwidths and effective two-band Hubbard models near the Fermi level, originating from partially filled, localized d-orbitals of the adatoms. Our study reveals a materials trend from a flat band Fermi liquid (Cr) via a paramagnetic Mott insulator with large local moments (V) to a Mott insulator on the verge to a heavy Dirac semimetal (Ti) showcasing the diverse nature of these strongly correlated systems. Specifically, the flat bands in the Cr and the well-defined Dirac cones in the strained metallic~Ti lattice indicate high potential for realizing topological and correlated phases.</description>

Abstract: We construct the first integrable models based on the Haagerup fusion category $H_3$. We introduce a Haagerup version of the anyonic spin chain and use the boost operator formalism to identify two integrable Hamiltonians of PXP type on this chain. The first of these is an analogue of the golden chain; it has a topological symmetry based on $H_3$ and satisfies the Temperley-Lieb algebra with parameter $\delta=(3+\sqrt{13})/2$. We prove its integrability using a Lax formalism, and construct the corresponding solution to the Yang--Baxter equation. We present numerical evidence that this model is gapless with a dynamical critical exponent $z\neq 1$. The second integrable model we find breaks the topological symmetry. We present numerical evidence that this model reduces to a CFT in the large volume limit with central charge $c\sim3/2$.</description>

Abstract: The study of undecidability in problems arising from physics has experienced a renewed interest, mainly in connection with quantum information problems. The goal of this review is to survey this recent development. After a historical introduction, we first explain the necessary results about undecidability in mathematics and computer science. Then we briefly review the first results about undecidability in physics which emerged mostly in the 80s and early 90s. Finally we focus on the most recent contributions, which we divide in two main categories: many body systems and quantum information problems.</description>

      <title>Observation of string breaking on a (2 + 1)D Rydberg quantum simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) describe a broad range of phenomena in condensed matter and particle physics. A prominent example is confinement, responsible for bounding quarks inside hadrons such as protons or neutrons. When quark-antiquark pairs are separated, the energy stored in the string of gluon fields connecting them grows linearly with their distance, until there is enough energy to create new pairs from the vacuum and break the string. While such phenomena are ubiquitous in LGTs, simulating the resulting dynamics is a challenging task. Here, we report the observation of string breaking in synthetic quantum matter using a programmable quantum simulator based on neutral atom arrays. We show that a (2+1)D LGT with dynamical matter can be efficiently implemented when the atoms are placed on a Kagome geometry, with a local U(1) symmetry emerging from the Rydberg blockade, while long-range Rydberg interactions naturally give rise to a linear confining potential for a pair of charges, allowing us to tune both their masses as well as the string tension. We experimentally map out the corresponding phase diagram by adiabatically preparing the ground state of the atom array in the presence of defects, and observe substructure of the confined phase, distinguishing regions dominated by fluctuating strings or by broken string configurations. Finally, by harnessing local control over the atomic detuning, we quench string states and observe string breaking dynamics exhibiting a many-body resonance phenomenon. Our work paves a way to explore phenomena in high-energy physics using programmable quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Doping dependence of the nonlinear Hall resistivity in electron-doped Pr$_{2-x}$Ce$_{x}$CuO$_{4 \pm \delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a systematic study of the field dependence of the Hall resistivity $\rho _{yx} (B)$ as a function of doping in thin films of electron-doped superconducting cuprate Pr$_{2-x}$Ce$_{x}$CuO$_{4 \pm \delta}$ (PCCO). Across the studied doping range from $x = 0.125$ to $x = 0.20$, we observe a nonlinear dependence of $\rho_{yx}$ with $B$. The leading $B^{3}$ nonlinear term is negative, increases with decreasing temperature and peaks around optimal doping ($x = 0.15$). The observed nonlinear contribution is consistent with the presence of two different types of free carriers (electron-like and hole-like) even for doping with only an apparent hole Fermi surface as observed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Based on an analysis using the two-carrier model, this negative nonlinear contribution to $\rho _{yx} (B)$ implies that the density of the charge carriers behaving like electrons is larger than the density of those behaving like holes for all the doping values explored. Combined with the Hall coefficient reaching $R_{H} = 0$ at specific temperatures for selected doping levels, we also conclude that the mobility of hole-like carriers is larger than that of electron-like carriers for doping around $x^{*} \approx 0.165$.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body scars as remnants of stable many-body periodic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16916v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) represent a weak ergodicity-breaking phenomenon that defies the common scenario of thermalization in closed quantum systems. They are often regarded as a many-body analog of quantum scars (QS) -- a single-particle phenomenon in quantum chaos -- due to their superficial similarities. However, unlike QS, a clear connection between QMBS and classical chaos has remained elusive. It has nevertheless been speculated that in an appropriate semiclassical limit, QMBS should have a correspondence to weakly unstable periodic orbits. In this paper, I present a counterexample to this conjecture by studying a bosonic model with a large number of flavors. The dynamics of out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) suggest that QMBS do not display chaotic behavior in the semiclassical limit. In contrast, chaotic dynamics are expected for initial states not associated with QMBS. Interestingly, the anomalous OTOC dynamics persist even under weak perturbations that eliminate the scarred eigenstates, suggesting a certain robustness in the phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical origin of suppressed quantum chaos in Rydberg chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surprisingly long-lasting oscillations observed in the dynamics of highly excited states of chains of Rydberg atoms defy the expectation that interacting systems should thermalize fast. The phenomenon is reminiscent of wavepackets in quantum billiards that trace classical periodic orbits. While analogs of the associated scarred eigenfunctions have been found for Rydberg chains, an underlying classical limit hosting periodic orbits has remained elusive. Here we generalize the Rydberg (pseudospin $S=1/2$) system to a chain of arbitrary spin $S$. Its classical limit features unexpectedly stable periodic orbits that are essential to understand the emergence of robust, parametrically suppressed quantum chaoticity, with semi-classical coherence times diverging as $\sqrt{S}$. The classical limit successfully explains several empirical features of the quantum limit.</description>

      <title>Electronic thermal resistivity and quasi-particle collision cross-section in semi-metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16984v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron-electron collisions lead to a T-square component in the electrical resistivity of Fermi liquids. The case of liquid $^3$He illustrates that the \textit{thermal} resitivity of a Fermi liquid has a T-square term, expressed in m$\cdot$W$^{-1}$. Its natural units are $\hbar/k_FE_F^2$. Here, we present a high-resolution study of the thermal conductivity in bismuth, employing magnetic field to extract the tiny electronic component of the total thermal conductivity and resolving signals as small as $\approx 60 \mu$K. We find that the electronic thermal resistivity follows a T-square temperature dependence with a prefactor twice larger than the electric T-square prefactor. Adding this information to what has been known for other semi-metals, we find that the prefactor of the T-square thermal resistivity scales with the square of the inverse of the Fermi temperature, implying that the dimensionless fermion-fermion collision cross-section is roughly proportional to the Fermi wavelength, indicating that it is not simply set by the strength of the Coulomb interaction.</description>

      <title>A Novel Perspective on Ideal Chern Bands with Strong Short-Range Repulsion: Applications to Correlated Metals, Superconductivity, and Topological Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on correlated van der Waals materials, including twisted and rhombohedral graphene and twisted WSe$_2$, we perform an analytical and numerical study of the effects of strong on-site and short-range interactions in fractionally filled ideal Chern bands. We uncover an extensive non-trivial ground state manifold within the band filling range $0 &lt; \nu &lt; 1$ and introduce a general principle, the ''three-rule'', for combining flatband wave functions, which governs their zero-energy property on the torus geometry. Based on the structure of these wave functions, we develop a variational approach that reveals distinct phases under different perturbations: metallic behavior emerges from a finite dispersion, and superconductivity is induced by attractive Cooper channel interactions. Our approach, not reliant on the commonly applied mean-field approximations, provides an analytical expression for the macroscopic wave function of the off-diagonal long-range order correlator, attributing pairing susceptibility to the set of non-trivial zero-energy ground state wave functions. Extending to finite screening lengths and beyond the ideal limit using exact diagonalization simulations, we demonstrate the peculiar structure in the many-body wave function's coefficients to be imprinted in the low-energy spectrum of the topologically ordered Halperin spin-singlet state. Our findings also make connections to frustration-free models of non-commuting projector Hamiltonians, potentially aiding the future construction of exact ground states for various fractional fillings.</description>

      <title>Method for reconstructing the self-energy from the spectral function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07682v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental question about the nature of quantum materials such as High-T$_c$ systems remain open to date -- it is unclear whether they are (some variety of) Fermi liquids, or (some variety of) non Fermi liquids. A direct avenue to determine their nature is to study the (imaginary part of the) self-energy at low energies. Here we present a novel method to extract this low $\omega$ self-energy from experimentally derived spectral functions. The method seems suited for implementation with high quality angle resolved photoemission data. It is based on a helpful Theorem proposed here, which assures us that the method has minimal (or vanishing) error at the lowest energies. We provide numerical examples showing that a few popular model systems yield distinguishably different low energy self-energies.</description>

      <title>Entanglement renormalization of fractonic anisotropic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ Laplacian models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gapped fracton phases constitute a new class of quantum states of matter which connects to topological orders but does not fit easily into existing paradigms. They host unconventional features such as sub-extensive and robust ground state degeneracies as well as sensitivity to lattice geometry. We investigate the anisotropic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ Laplacian model [1] which can describe a family of fracton phases defined on arbitrary graphs. Focusing on representative geometries where the 3D lattices are extensions of 2D square, triangular, honeycomb and Kagome lattices into the third dimension, we study their ground state degeneracies and mobility of excitations, and examine their entanglement renormalization group (ERG) flows. All models show bifurcating behaviors under ERG but have distinct ERG flows sensitive to both $N$ and lattice geometry. In particular, we show that the anisotropic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ Laplacian models defined on the extensions of triangular and honeycomb lattices are equivalent when $N$ is coprime to $3$. We also point out that, in contrast to previous expectations, the model defined on the extension of Kagome lattice is robust against local perturbations if and only if $N$ is coprime to $6$.</description>

      <title>Highly correlated two-dimensional electron fluid in best-quality GaAs quantum wells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.01035v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetotransport phenomena often provide critically important information about microscopic states and relaxation processes in two-dimensional (2D) electron systems. For example, the independence of magneto-photo-resistance of 2D electrons in best-quality quantum wells on the polarization helicity of incident radio-frequency radiation have been treated as a puzzling effect, which is important for characterization of these systems, but had no well-established explanation up to now. Here we develop a phenomenological model of dynamics of a highly correlated 2D electron fluid in moderate magnetic fields, in which the viscosity and the non-local in time contributions in inter-particle interaction are important. In this system, successive collisions of electrons joined in pairs turn out to be as important as single collisions of statistically independent electrons. The resulting photoresistance exhibits an irregular shape of magnetooscillations, the absence of the dependence on the helicity of the circular polarization of radiation, and a giant peak near the doubled cyclotron frequency. All these effects were observed in experiments on best-quality GaAs quantum wells in moderate magnetic fields at low temperatures. Although the most general conditions of applicability of the developed phenomenological model of the fluid dynamics remains unclarified now, this coincidence can point out that 2D electrons in such systems form the highly correlated viscous fluid.</description>

Abstract: The continued development of computational approaches to many-body ground-state problems in physics and chemistry calls for a consistent way to assess its overall progress. In this work, we introduce a metric of variational accuracy, the V-score, obtained from the variational energy and its variance. We provide an extensive curated dataset of variational calculations of many-body quantum systems, identifying cases where state-of-the-art numerical approaches show limited accuracy, and future algorithms or computational platforms, such as quantum computing, could provide improved accuracy. The V-score can be used as a metric to assess the progress of quantum variational methods toward a quantum advantage for ground-state problems, especially in regimes where classical verifiability is impossible.</description>

      <title>Tunneling current and current correlations for anyonic quasiparticles of {\nu} = 1/2 chiral Luttinger liquid in multi-edge geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider anyonic quasiparticles with charge e/2 described by the {\nu} = 1/2 chiral Luttinger liquid, which collide in a Hong-Ou-Mandel-like interferometer. These colliding anyonic channels can be formally viewed as hosting Laughlin-like fractional {\nu} = 1/2 quasiparticles. More specifically, two possible geometries are considered: (i) a two-edge-channel setup where anyons originate from equilibrium reservoirs; (ii) a four-edge-channel setup where nonequilibrium anyons arrive at the collider in the form of diluted beams. For both setups, we calculate the tunneling current and the current correlations. For setup (i), our results provide analytically exact expressions for the tunneling current, tunneling-current noise, and cross-correlation noise, The exact relation between conductance and noise is demonstrated. For setup (ii), we show that the tunneling current and the generalized Fano factor [defined in B. Rosenow et al. (2016)] are finite for diluted streams of {\nu} = 1/2 anyons. This is due to the processes where nonequilibrium anyons, supplied via either source edge, directly tunnel at the central QPC. Thus, to obtain meaningful results in this case, one should go beyond the so-called time-domain braiding processes, where nonequilibrium anyons do not tunnel at the collider, but rather indirectly influence the tunneling by braiding with the quasiparticle-quasihole pairs created at the collider. This suggests that the effect of direct tunneling and collisions of diluted anyons in the Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer can be important for various observables in physical quantum-Hall edges at Laughlin filling fractions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently it was shown that the topological entanglement entropy (TEE) of a two-dimensional gapped ground state obeys the universal inequality $\gamma \geq \log \mathcal{D}$, where $\gamma$ is the TEE and $\mathcal{D}$ is the total quantum dimension of all anyon excitations, $\mathcal{D} = \sqrt{\sum_a d_a^2}$. Here we present an alternative, more direct proof of this inequality. Our proof uses only the strong subadditivity property of the von Neumann entropy together with a few physical assumptions about the ground state density operator. Our derivation naturally generalizes to a variety of systems, including spatially inhomogeneous systems with defects and boundaries, higher dimensional systems, and mixed states.</description>

Abstract: Research on nickel-based superconductors has progressed from infinite-layer LaNiO$_2$ to finite-layer La$_{6}$Ni$_{5}$O$_{12}$, and most recently to the Ruddlesden-Popper-phase La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ discovered under pressure $\sim$16\,GPa, the system exhibits the onset of superconductivity at approximately $\sim$80\,K. Unlike the $d$-wave superconductivity driven by the nearly half-filled $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in finite- and infinite-layers nickelates, the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ and O-2$p$ orbitals contribute significantly to the low energy states and potentially to the superconducting electron pairing mechanism. Employing density functional calculations and multi-orbital multi-atom Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster exact diagonalization including local exchange and coulomb interactions, we delve into the pressure dependent electronic structure of the Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster. We find that several possible charge and spin ordering states are nearly degenerate at ambient pressure but become strongly mixed leading to a more homogeneous phase at high pressure. The various possible spin states and the exchange and superexchange mechanisms are quantified via the involvement of the Ni-$3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals, the apical bridging O $2p_z$ orbitals, and the orbitals involved in the formation of local Zhang-Rice singlet like states. We note that the energy difference between the charge (CDW)/spin (SDW) density wave states and the uniform high pressure phase is about 10 meV in concordance with phase transition temperatures found experimentally at ambient pressure.</description>
