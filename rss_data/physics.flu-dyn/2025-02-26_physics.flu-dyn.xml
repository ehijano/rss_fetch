      <title>Sensitivity analysis of wavy wall performance in turbulent separation control: Effects of amplitude and period variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of transversely oriented sinusoidal wall corrugation on an incompressible isothermal flow in the near-wall region, subjected to adverse pressure gradient conditions at a friction Reynolds number of $Re_{\tau} = 2500$, is investigated using Large Eddy Simulation. This study is a continuation of the work of Kami\'nski et al. (2024) devoted to dynamics of the flow in the regions of crests and downhill/uphill waviness parts, and where the impact of the local and global pressure gradient were analysed. It focuses on the influence of the waviness parameters, such as amplitude ($A$) and number of waviness periods ($N_{\lambda}$) on the turbulent boundary layer separation. In terms of the effective slope, $ES\propto|{dA}/{dx}|$, where $x$ is the streamwise direction, the analyzed cases included the configurations with $ES$ ranging from $ES=0$ (flat wall) to $ES=0.2455$ ($A/\lambda=0.051$, where $\lambda$ is the length of a single waviness). Specifically, the primary objective was to identify a combination of $A$ and $N_{\lambda}$ that would result in the greatest increase in the wall-shear stress $\tau_w$, relative to the flat plate configuration, aiming to achieve the maximum postponement of turbulent separation. It is shown that the waviness significantly affects the flow field by enhancing the turbulent kinetic energy that leads to increased $\tau_w$. In particular, it is shown that the enhancement in TKE depends mainly on $ES$ and not on particular values of $A$ and $N_{\lambda}$. Namely, the cases which are significantly diversified by $A$ and $N_{\lambda}$ but are characterised by the same $ES$ exhibit almost identical TKE profiles. The highest increase in the wall-shear stress compared to the reference flat plate configuration was observed for the combination of $A$ and $N_{\lambda}$ corresponding to $ES=0.1473$.</description>

      <title>Two-Phase Boiling in a Replaceable Embedded Heat Sink for Ultra-High Heat Flux SiC Chip Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Moore's Law has approached its physical limits lately, the high integration and miniaturisation of electronics have also brought another thermal failure obstacle. Previous studies on single-phase flow demanded significant pump power to achieve higher CHF, but this approach risked exceeding the chip's mechanical limits and complicating packaging. The elevated junction temperature (above 175 C) of third-generation semiconductors makes them ideal for two-phase water cooling which utilizes the huge latent heat during boiling of water to minimize the flow rate and maximize the COP. In this work, we designed an embedded hierarchical microchannel heat sink for heat transfer by deionised water two-phase cooling. We observed an unprecedented Critical Heat Flux (CHF) of 1682W cm-2 with COP up to 23615 at flow rate of 3.0 ml s-1, which means Only 70 mW of power is needed to take away the heat on the 1682 W per square centimetre chip, corresponding to a 3-fold increase compared to single-phase microchannels with same flowrate. At a high flow rate of 10 ml s-1, we even achieved a remarkable heat flux of 2500 W cm-2. This technology is anticipated to overcome the bottleneck in electronic thermal management.</description>

      <title>Quantum implicit representation of vortex filaments in turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled vortex filaments are essential to turbulence, serving as coherent structures that govern nonlinear fluid dynamics and support the reconstruction of fluid fields to reveal statistical properties. This study introduces an quantum implicit representation of vortex filaments in turbulence, employing a level-set method that models the filaments as the intersection of the real and imaginary zero iso-surfaces of a complex scalar field. Describing the fluid field via the wave function offers distinct advantages in capturing complex structures, topological properties, and fluid dynamics, while opening new avenues for innovative solutions through quantum computing platforms. The representation is reformulated into an eigenvalue problem for Hermitian matrices, enabling the conversion of velocity fields into complex scalar fields that embed the vortex filaments. The resulting optimization is addressed using a variational quantum eigensolver, with Pauli operator truncation and deep learning techniques applied to improve efficiency and reduce noise. The proposed quantum framework achieves a near-linear time complexity and a exponential storage reduction while maintaining a balance of accuracy, robustness, and versatility, presenting a promising tool for turbulence analysis, vortex dynamics research, and machine learning dataset generation.</description>

      <title>No-slip, slip and friction at fluid-solid interfaces: Concept of adsorption layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a fluid contacts solid surfaces, it can spread or slide, and the motion of the contact line involves a complex interplay between hydrodynamic and thermodynamic effects. Hydrodynamic theories, like the Huh &amp; Scriven and Cox &amp; Voinov models, assumeno-slip boundary condition, neglecting the macroscopic fluid slip at the fluid-solid interface. However, they cannot explain the contact line motion during droplet spreading whichthermodynamic theories is attribute to the microscopic surface diffusion of fluid molecules. To bridge these perspectives, we heed the physical origin of slip phenomenon by employing energy minimization principles to establish a force balance between solid-fluid friction, thermodynamic force, and viscous stress at the fluid-solid contact region. Our analysis reveals that slip is an intrinsic property, just like molecular surface diffusion, is also governedfluid-solid intermolecular interactions. Based on our model with slip, we extend the classical Huh &amp; Scriven and Cox &amp; Voinov theories by incorporating friction, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of droplet slide and kinetic induced contact angle hysteresis (CAH). Our results demonstrate that solid-fluid friction plays a vital role in momentum transfer between the substrate and the droplet, therefore, modifies the droplet internal fluid flow during wetting drastically. Under strong friction, classical wetting predictions with CAH are recovered, whereas weak friction suppresses internal fluid motion, leadingthe disappearance of CAH. These findings provide new insights into wetting dynamics, highlighting the importance of friction in slip behavior. This work has broad implications for droplet transport, surface engineering, and applications in microfluidics and coatings.</description>

      <title>Stokes waves in rotational flows: internal stagnation and overhanging profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic travelling waves at the free surface of an incompressible inviscid fluid in two dimensions under gravity are numerically computed for an arbitrary vorticity distribution. The fluid domain over one period is conformally mapped from a fixed rectangular one, where the governing equations along with the conformal mapping are solved using a finite difference scheme. This approach accommodates internal stagnation points, critical layers, and overhanging profiles, thereby overcoming limitations of previous studies. The numerical method is validated through comparisons with known solutions for zero and constant vorticity. Novel solutions are presented for affine vorticity functions and a two-layer constant vorticity scenario.</description>

      <title>Learning multi-phase flow and transport in fractured porous media with auto-regressive and recurrent graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past three decades, a wide array of computational methodologies and simulation frameworks has emerged to address the complexities of modeling multi-phase flow and transport processes in fractured porous media. The conformal mesh approaches which explicitly align the computational grid with fracture surfaces are considered by many to be the most accurate. However, such methods require excessive fine-scale meshing, rendering them impractical for large or complex fracture networks. In this work, we propose to learn the complex multi-phase flow and transport dynamics in fractured porous media with graph neural networks (GNN). GNNs are well suited for this task due to the unstructured topology of the computation grid resulting from the Embedded Discrete Fracture Model (EDFM) discretization. We propose two deep learning architectures, a GNN and a recurrent GNN. Both networks follow a two-stage training strategy: an autoregressive one step roll-out, followed by a fine-tuning step where the model is supervised using the whole ground-truth sequence. We demonstrate that the two-stage training approach is effective in mitigating error accumulation during autoregressive model rollouts in the testing phase. Our findings indicate that both GNNs generalize well to unseen fracture realizations, with comparable performance in forecasting saturation sequences, and slightly better performance for the recurrent GNN in predicting pressure sequences. While the second stage of training proved to be beneficial for the GNN model, its impact on the recurrent GNN model was less pronounced. Finally, the performance of both GNNs for temporal extrapolation is tested. The recurrent GNN significantly outperformed the GNN in terms of accuracy, thereby underscoring its superior capability in predicting long sequences.</description>

      <title>Critical inertia for particle capture is determined by surface geometry at forward stagnation point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aerosols are ubiquitous, and particle capture from particle-laden air as it flows past an obstacle is of widespread practical importance. Neglecting diffusion, previous work has shown that for a smooth curved surface in both Stokes flow and inviscid flow, only particles with inertia above a threshold value (quantified by the nondimensional Stokes number) collide with the surface. Here we show that the critical Stokes number decreases with increasing Reynolds number of the air flow, and the mechanism behind this threshold is the same at all finite Reynolds numbers but becomes qualitatively different in the limit of infinite Reynolds number (inviscid flow). In addition we show that in the latter case (inviscid flow) the threshold is set solely by the flow near the stagnation point, whereas at finite Reynolds numbers the threshold also depends on the flow far from the stagnation point. The threshold also depends on obstacle geometry and we show that fibers whose cross section is flattened along the flow direction have greater size selectivity than fibers with a circular cross section.</description>

      <title>Navier-Stokes bounds and scaling for compact trefoils in $(2\ell\pi)^3$ domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03578v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a perturbed trefoil vortex knot evolving under the Navier-Stokes equations, a sequence of $\nu$-independent times $t_m$ are identified corresponding to a set of scaled, volume-integrated vorticity moments $\nu^{1/4}{\it O}_{V1}$ with this hierarchy $t_\infty\le\dots\le t_m\dots t_1=t_x\approx40$ and ${\it O}_{Vm}=(\int_{V\ell}|\omega|^{2m}dV)^{1/2m}$. For $Z(t)={\it O}^2_{V1}(t)$ the volume-integrated enstrophy, convergence of $\sqrt{\nu}Z(t)$ at $t_x=t_1$ marks the end of the reconnection scaling phase. Physically, reconnection follows from the formation of a double vortex sheet, then a knot, which splits into spirals. $Z$ then accelerates, leading to approximate finite-time $\nu$-independent convergence of the energy dissipation rate $\epsilon(t)=\nu Z(t)$ at $t_\epsilon\sim 2t_x$ and sustained over a finite span $\Delta T_\epsilon\searrow 0.5 t_\epsilon$, giving Reynolds number independent finite-time, dissipation, $\Delta E_\epsilon=\int_{\Delta T_\epsilon}\epsilon dt$, and thus satisfying one definition for a {\it dissipation anomaly}. Evidence for transient Kolmogorov-like enstrophy spectra is found over ${\Delta T_\epsilon}$. A critical factor in achieving these temporal convergence laws is how the domain $V_\ell=(2\ell\pi)^3$ is increased as $\ell\sim\nu^{-1/4}$, for $\ell=2$ to 6, then to $\ell=12$, as $\nu$ decreases. $(2\ell\pi)^3$ domain compatibility with established $(2\pi)^3$ mathematics in appendix allows small $\nu$ Navier-Stokes solutions. Two spans of $\nu$ are considered. Over the first factor of 25 decrease in $\nu$, all of the $\nu^{1/4}{\it O}_{Vm}(t)$ converge to their respective $t_m$. For the next factor of 5 decrease in $\nu$, $\ell$ is increased to $\ell=12$, there is only convergence of $\nu^{1/4}\Omega_{V\infty}(t)$ to $t_\infty$ and later $\sqrt{\nu}Z(t)$ convergence at $t_1=t_x$ and $\epsilon(t)$ over $t\sim t_\epsilon$.</description>

      <title>Transient growth of a wake vortex and its initiation via inertial particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transient dynamics of a wake vortex, modelled as a strong swirling $q$-vortex, are investigated with a focus on optimal transient growth driven by continuous eigenmodes associated with continuous spectra. The pivotal contribution of viscous critical-layer eigenmodes (Lee &amp; Marcus, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 967) amongst the entire eigenmode families to optimal perturbations is numerically confirmed, utilising a spectral collocation method for a radially unbounded domain that ensures correct analyticity and far-field behaviour. The consistency of the numerical method across different sensitivity tests supports the reliability of the results and provides flexibility for tuning. Both axisymmetric and helical perturbations with axial wavenumbers of order unity or less are examined through linearised theory and non-linear simulations, yielding results that align with existing literature on energy growth curves and optimal perturbation structures. The initiation process of transient growth is also explored, highlighting its practical relevance. Inspired by ice crystals in contrails, the backward influence of inertial particles on the vortex flow, particularly through particle drag, is emphasised. In the pursuit of optimal transient growth, particles are initially distributed at the periphery of the vortex core to disturb the flow. Two-way coupled vortex-particle simulations reveal clear evidence of optimal transient growth during ongoing vortex-particle interactions, reinforcing the robustness and significance of transient growth in the original non-linear vortex system over finite time periods.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic Worthington jets \&amp; droplets produced by bursting bubbles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05089v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bubble bursting and subsequent collapse of the open cavity at free surfaces of contaminated liquids can generate aerosol droplets, facilitating pathogen transport. After film rupture, capillary waves focus at the cavity base, potentially generating fast Worthington jets that are responsible for ejecting the droplets away from the source. While extensively studied for Newtonian fluids, the influence of non-Newtonian rheology on this process remains poorly understood. Here, we employ direct numerical simulations to investigate the bubble cavity collapse in viscoelastic media, such as polymeric liquids. We find that the jet and drop formation are dictated by two dimensionless parameters: the elastocapillary number $Ec$ (the ratio of the elastic modulus and the Laplace pressure) and the Deborah number $De$ (the ratio of the relaxation time and the inertio-capillary timescale). We show that for low values of $Ec$ and $De$, the viscoelastic liquid adopts a Newtonian-like behavior, where the dynamics are governed by the solvent Ohnesorge number $Oh_s$ (the ratio of visco-capillary and inertio-capillary timescales). In contrast, for large values $Ec$ and $De$, the enhanced elastic stresses completely suppress the formation of the jet. For some cases with intermediate values of $Ec$ and $De$, smaller droplets are produced compared to Newtonian fluids, potentially enhancing aerosol dispersal. By mapping the phase space spanned by $Ec$, $De$, and $Oh_s$, we reveal three distinct flow regimes: (i) jets forming droplets, (ii) jets without droplet formation, and (iii) absence of jet formation. Our results elucidate the mechanisms underlying aerosol suppression versus fine spray formation in polymeric liquids, with implications for pathogen transmission and industrial processes involving viscoelastic fluids.</description>

      <title>Correlations for the Interphase Drag in the Two-Fluid Model of Gas--Liquid Flows through Packed-Bed Reactors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10674v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experiments conducted by NASA measured the pressure drop due to gas--liquid flow through a packed-bed reactor under microgravity conditions. From these experiments, we develop correlations for the gas--liquid $f_{gl}$ interphase drag in a two-fluid model (TFM). We use an Ergun-type closure for liquid--solid drag. Then, under a 1D flow assumption, $f_{gl}$ is the only unknown in the TFM. Using a data-driven approach, we determine $f_{gl}$ and correlate it (via composite fits) with the liquid and gas Reynolds numbers, $Re_{l}$ and $Re_{g}$, respectively, and the Suratman number $Su_{l}$. To validate the proposed $f_{gl}(Re_{l},Re_{g},Su_{l})$ closure, we perform two-dimensional transient simulations at microgravity conditions using ANSYS Fluent and employing an Euler--Euler formulation. We find good agreement between the simulations based on the proposed $f_{gl}$ closure and the experimental data.</description>

      <title>An assessment of event-based imaging velocimetry for efficient estimation of low-dimensional coordinates in turbulent flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the potential of neuromorphic Event-Based Vision (EBV) cameras for data-efficient representation of low-order model coordinates in turbulent flows. Unlike conventional imaging systems, EBV cameras asynchronously capture changes in temporal contrast at each pixel, delivering high-frequency output with reduced data bandwidth and enhanced sensitivity, particularly in low-light conditions. Pulsed Event-Based Imaging Velocimetry (EBIV) is assessed against traditional Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) through two synchronized experiments: a submerged water jet and airflow around a square rib in a channel. The assessment includes a detailed comparison of flow statistics and spectral content, alongside an evaluation of reduced-order modeling capabilities using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). The event stream from the EBV camera is converted into pseudo-snapshots, from which velocity fields are computed using standard PIV processing techniques. These fields are then compared after interpolation onto a common grid. Modal analysis demonstrates that EBIV can successfully identify dominant flow structures, along with their energy and dynamics, accurately discerning singular values, spatial modes, and temporal modes. While noise contamination primarily affects higher modes - less critical for flow control applications - overall performance remains robust. Additionally, comparisons of Low-Order Reconstruction (LOR) validate EBIV's capability to provide reliable reduced-order models of turbulent flows, essential for flow control purposes. These findings position EBV sensors as a promising technology for real-time, imaging-based closed-loop flow control systems.</description>

      <title>GPU-Native Adaptive Mesh Refinement with Application to Lattice Boltzmann Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) enables efficient computation of flows by providing high resolution in critical regions while allowing for coarsening in areas where fine detail is unnecessary. While early AMR software packages relied solely on CPU parallelization, the widespread adoption of heterogeneous computing systems has led to GPU-accelerated implementations. In these hybrid approaches, simulation data typically resides on the GPU, and mesh management and adaptation occur exclusively on the CPU, necessitating frequent data transfers between them. A more efficient strategy is to adapt and maintain the entire mesh structure exclusively on the GPU, eliminating these transfers. Because of its inherent parallelism, the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) has been widely implemented in hybrid AMR frameworks. This work presents a GPU-native algorithm for AMR using a block-based forest of octrees approach, implemented in both two and three dimensions as open-source C++/CUDA code. The implementation includes a Lattice Boltzmann solver for weakly compressible flow, though the underlying grid refinement procedure is compatible with any solver operating on cell-centered block-based grids. The lid-driven cavity and flow past a square cylinder benchmarks validate the algorithm's effectiveness across multiple velocity sets in both single- and double-precision. Tests conducted on consumer and datacenter-grade GPUs demonstrate its versatility across different hardware platforms.
