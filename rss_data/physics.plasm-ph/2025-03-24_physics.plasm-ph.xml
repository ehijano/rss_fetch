      <title>Discontinuous Galerkin Representation of the Maxwell-J\"uttner Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetic simulations of relativistic gases and plasmas are critical for understanding diverse astrophysical and terrestrial systems, but the accurate construction of the relativistic Maxwellian, the Maxwell-J\"uttner (MJ) distribution, on a discrete simulation grid is challenging. Difficulties arise from the finite velocity bounds of the domain, which may not capture the entire distribution function, as well as errors introduced by projecting the function onto a discrete grid. Here we present a novel scheme for iteratively correcting the moments of the projected distribution applicable to all grid-based discretizations of the relativistic kinetic equation. In addition, we describe how to compute the needed nonlinear quantities, such as Lorentz boost factors, in a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme through a combination of numerical quadrature and weak operations. The resulting method accurately captures the distribution function and ensures that the moments match the desired values to machine precision.</description>

      <title>HEART: A New X-Ray Tracing Code for Mosaic Crystal Spectrometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new open-source Python x-ray tracing code for modelling Bragg diffracting mosaic crystal spectrometers: High Energy Applications Ray Tracer (HEART). HEART's high modularity enables customizable workflows as well as efficient development of novel features. Utilizing Numba's just-in-time (JIT) compiler and the message-passing interface (MPI) allows running HEART in parallel leading to excellent performance. HEART is intended to be used for modelling x-ray spectra as they would be seen in experiments that measure x-ray spectroscopy with a mosaic crystal spectrometer. This enables the user to, for example, make predictions about what will be seen on a detector in experiment, perform optimizations on the design of the spectrometer setup, or to study the effect of the spectrometer on measured spectra. However, the code certainly has further uses beyond these example use cases. Here, we discuss the physical model used in the code, and explore a number of different mosaic distribution functions, intrinsic rocking curves, and sampling approaches which are available to the user. Finally, we demonstrate its strong predictive capability in comparison to spectroscopic data collected at the European XFEL in Germany.</description>

      <title>On the decay instability of electron acoustic waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron acoustic waves (EAWs) are nonlinear plasma modes characterized by electron trapping, which suppresses the usual Landau damping. Despite being predicted in the 1990s, their excitation and decay mechanisms remain a subject of active research. This study investigates the nonlinear dynamics of EAWs, focusing on their excitation, decay instability, and the role of vortex merging in phase space. Using Eulerian Vlasov-Poisson simulations, we reproduce the excitation of stable EAWs via an external resonant driving force and explore their decay under the effect of a low-amplitude perturbation. The study identifies a distinct 2 to 1 decay process, where an EAW with a shorter wavelength merges into a longer-wavelength mode, driven by vortex dynamics in phase space. We find that the instability is triggered by a small fraction of particles capable of transitioning between potential wells, facilitating energy exchange between two adjacent phase space holes and vortex merging. Our simulations highlight the chaotic nature of particle trajectories in the vicinity of the separatrix between trapped and free phase space regions, which significantly contributes to the instability growth. Additionally, we analyze the influence of the perturbation amplitude on the growth rate of the instability, shedding light on the critical role of phase-space dynamics in the decay process. These findings offer a deeper understanding of the nonlinear behavior of plasma waves and suggest future directions for studying plasma wave stability in more complex systems, as the decay mechanism discussed here is likely to be universal in plasmas with closed separatrices in phase space, underscoring its significance in nonlinear plasma dynamics.</description>

      <title>Verification of the PICLS electromagnetic upgrade in mixed variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gyrokinetic particle-in-cell code PICLS is a full-f finite element tool to simulate turbulence in the tokamak scrape-off layer. During the previous year, the capability of PICLS was extended to encompass electromagnetic effects. Successful tests using the method of manufactured solutions were conducted on the freshly added Amp\`ere's-law-solver, and shear Alfv\'en waves were simulated to verify the new electromagnetic time step. However, as a code based on the $p_{||}$-formulation of the gyrokinetic equations, PICLS is affected by the Amp\`ere-cancellation problem. In order to bring higher-beta simulations within reach of our computational capacity, we implemented the mixed-variable formulation with pullback-scheme in a similar fashion to, e.g., EUTERPE, ORB5, or XGC. Here, we present the successful verification of the different electromagnetic formulations of PICLS by simulating shear-Alfv\'en waves in a test setup designed to minimize kinetic effects.</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimisation of poloidal field coil positions in tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tokamak is a world-leading concept for producing sustainable energy via magnetically-confined nuclear fusion. Identifying where to position the magnets within a tokamak, specifically the poloidal field (PF) coils, is a design problem which requires balancing a number of competing economic, physical, and engineering objectives and constraints. In this paper, we show that multi-objective Bayesian optimisation (BO), an iterative optimisation technique utilising probabilistic machine learning models, can effectively explore this complex design space and return several optimal PF coil sets. These solutions span the Pareto front, a subset of the objective space that optimally satisfies the specified objective functions. We outline an easy-to-use BO framework and demonstrate that it outperforms alternative optimisation techniques while using significantly fewer computational resources. Our results show that BO is a promising technique for fusion design problems that rely on computationally demanding high-fidelity simulations.</description>

      <title>Universal fluctuation spectrum of Vlasov-Poisson turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal fluctuation spectrum of the electric field arising due to particle noise in a quiescent Vlasov-Poisson plasma was derived in the 1960s. Here, we derive the universal fluctuation spectrum of the electric field, at Debye and sub-Debye scales, for a turbulent Vlasov-Poisson plasma. This spectrum arises from what is likely to be the final cascade - a universal regime to be encountered at the extreme small-scale end of any turbulent cascade in a nearly collisionless plasma. The cascaded invariant is $C_2$, the quadratic Casimir invariant of the particle distribution function. $C_2$ cascades to small scales in position and velocity space via linear and nonlinear phase mixing, in such a way that the time scales of the two processes are critically balanced at every scale. We construct a scaling theory of the fluctuation spectrum of $C_2$ and of the electric field in wavenumber space. The electric-field spectrum is sufficiently steep for the nonlinear mixing to be controlled by the largest-scale electric fields, and so the $C_2$ cascade resembles the Batchelor cascade of a passive scalar. Our theory is supported by simulations of a forced 1D-1V plasma. We predict that the cascade is terminated at the wavenumber where the turbulent electric-field spectrum gives way to the thermal noise spectrum. The time scale for this small-scale cutoff to be reached is the dynamical time of phase-space mixing times a logarithmic factor in the plasma parameter - this is the first concrete demonstration of this property of Vlasov-Poisson turbulence, akin to how fluid turbulence dissipates energy at a rate independent (or nearly independent) of molecular diffusion. In the presence of the sub-Debye phase-space cascade - a scenario that may be ubiquitous - standard collisional plasma theory ceases to be valid. This calls for the development of new collision operators suited to such turbulent environments.</description>

      <title>Optical Effects in an Electric Dipole Spin Polarised Relativistic Quantum Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The covariant, spin-dependent response tensor for an electric dipole moment polarized electron gas (statistical distribution of electrons and positrons) is calculated using the formalism of quantum plasmadynamics. A simultaneous eigenfunction of both the Dirac Hamiltonian and the electric moment spin operator is constructed. Expressions for the electric moment states and the corresponding vertex functions are derived. It is shown that when the distribution of momenta is isotropic, the spin dependent response of an electric moment dependent quantum plasma is identically zero. The response is non-zero in the presence of a streaming motion perpendicular to the axis if the electron and positron distributions are different. The response has the same form as for a plasma with a nonzero, cross field current when $\langle p_{i} \rangle \neq 0$. This quantum relativistic correction is used to identify the dispersion equation for an electric moment spin polarised plasma with a streaming cold plasma background. In particular, the natural modes of an electric moment dependent quantum plasma exhibit elliptical polarisation. This is in contrast to a magnetic moment dependent electron gas, which is gyrotropic, or a helicity dependent electron gas which is optically active. The different responses, due to quantum plasmas being spin polarised by different relativistically acceptable spin operators, does not appear in other approaches to quantum plasma theory.</description>

      <title>Property of downstream turbulence driven by the special relativistic shock-clump interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional special relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations are performed to investigate properties of the downstream turbulence generated by the interaction between a relativistic shock wave and multiple clumps. We analyze the properties of the downstream turbulence by performing the Helmholtz decomposition. It is shown that, in contrast to the non-relativistic shock case, the amplitude of compressive modes is comparable to that of solenoidal modes for the relativistic shock. In addition, many reflected shocks propagate in the downstream region. The strength of the compressive mode, the solenoidal mode, the reflected shock waves, and the amplified magnetic field depend on the amplitude of the upstream density fluctuations. Our simulation results suggest that the wide distribution of the ratio of the magnetic energy to the shock kinetic energy, $\epsilon_B$, in gamma-ray burst afterglows is due to the diversity of the gamma-ray burst environment. Furthermore, the inhomogeneity of density around high-energy astrophysical objects affects the spectrum of accelerated particles because the reflected shock and turbulence can inject and accelerate non-thermal particles in the shock downstream region. The probability distribution of the downstream quantities, power spectra of turbulence, and vortex generation are also analyzed and discussed in this work.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Chaos: From Galactic Dynamics to Plasma Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary focus of this thesis is the numerical investigation of chaos in Hamiltonian models describing charged particle orbits in plasma, star motions in barred galaxies, and orbits' diffusion in multidimensional maps. We systematically explore the interplay between magnetic and kinetic chaos in toroidal fusion plasmas, where non-axisymmetric perturbations disrupt smooth magnetic flux surfaces, generating complex particle trajectories. Using the Generalized Alignment Index (GALI) method, we efficiently quantify chaos, compare the behavior of magnetic field lines and particle orbits, visualize the radial distribution of chaotic regions, and offer GALI as a valuable tool for studying plasma physics dynamics. We also study the evolution of phase space structures in a 3D barred galactic potential, following successive 2D and 3D pitchfork and period-doubling bifurcations of periodic orbits. By employing the `color and rotation' technique to visualize the system's 4D Poincar\'e surface of sections, we reveal distinct structural patterns. We further investigate the long-term diffusion transport and chaos properties of single and coupled standard maps, focusing on parameters inducing anomalous diffusion through accelerator modes exhibiting ballistic transport. Using different ensembles of initial conditions in chaotic regions influenced by these modes, we examine asymptotic diffusion rates and time scales, identifying conditions suppressing anomalous transport and leading to long-term convergence to normal diffusion across coupled maps. Lastly, we perform the first comprehensive investigation into the GALI indices for various attractors in continuous and discrete-time dissipative systems, extending the method's application to non-Hamiltonian systems. A key aspect of our work involves analyzing and comparing GALIs' with Lyapunov Exponents for systems exhibiting hyperchaotic motion.</description>

      <title>The High-Order Magnetic Near-Axis Expansion: Ill-Posedness and Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When analyzing stellarator configurations, it is common to perform an asymptotic expansion about the magnetic axis. This so-called near-axis expansion is convenient for the same reason asymptotic expansions often are, namely, it reduces the dimension of the problem. This leads to convenient and quickly computed expressions of physical quantities, such as quasisymmetry and stability criteria, which can be used to gain further insight. However, it has been repeatedly found that the expansion diverges at high orders in the distance from axis, limiting the physics the expansion can describe. In this paper, we show that the near-axis expansion diverges in vacuum due to ill-posedness and that it can be regularized to improve its convergence. Then, using realistic stellarator coil sets, we demonstrate numerical convergence of the vacuum magnetic field and flux surfaces to the true values as the order increases. We numerically find that the regularization improves the solutions of the near-axis expansion under perturbation, and we demonstrate that the radius of convergence of the vacuum near-axis expansion is correlated with the distance from the axis to the coils.</description>

      <title>Data-driven discovery of a heat flux closure for electrostatic plasma phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Progress in understanding multi-scale collisionless plasma phenomena requires employing tools which balance computational efficiency and physics fidelity. Collisionless fluid models are able to resolve spatio-temporal scales that are unfeasible with fully kinetic models. However, constructing such models requires truncating the infinite hierarchy of moment equations and supplying an appropriate closure to approximate the unresolved physics. Data-driven methods have recently begun to see increased application to this end, enabling a systematic approach to constructing closures. Here, we utilise sparse regression to search for heat flux closures for one-dimensional electrostatic plasma phenomena. We examine OSIRIS particle-in-cell simulation data of Landau-damped Langmuir waves and two-stream instabilities. Sparse regression consistently identifies six terms as physically relevant, together regularly accounting for more than 95% of the variation in the heat flux. We further quantify the relative importance of these terms under various circumstances and examine their dependence on parameters such as thermal speed and growth/damping rate. The results are discussed in the context of previously known collisionless closures and linear collisionless theory.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear particle motion and bursty periodic energy deposition in inductively coupled plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03508v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional, electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations are employed to study particle kinetics and power deposition in inductively coupled plasmas. We show that in the regime of low frequency ($\sim\mathrm{MHz}$) and low pressure, the motion of electrons can be highly nonlinear in the skin region near the antenna coil. Through most of the RF cycle, the electrons are strongly magnetized, with energy deposition being small. However, for a brief period around the null of the oscillating magnetic field, the electrons demagnetize, causing a jet-like current penetrating into the bulk plasma. During these brief periods, the power deposition becomes high, exhibiting a periodic burst nature. Based on kinetic theory, we provide new analytical expressions for the plasma current and energy deposition. A criterion for transition between the newly identified low-frequency, periodic-burst regime and the usual anomalous non-local skin effect regime is proposed and verified using a series of fully kinetic 2D particle-in-cell simulations.</description>
