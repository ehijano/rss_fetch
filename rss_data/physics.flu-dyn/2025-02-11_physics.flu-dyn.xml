      <title>Progress on surface curvature analysis for describing atomization using 2P-LIF images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To describe atomization completely it is necessary to track the liquid-gas interface morphology at any stage of the atomization process. Typically, instability analysis focuses on generic and simplified morphology: cylindrical jet, liquid sheet, ligament, and droplet to determine their stability and subsequent instability. On the other side sprays composed of spherical droplets are analyzed through their diameter distribution. However, between these situations the liquidgas interface experiences complex morphology that is more and more accessible through numerical simulation and advanced experimental imagery. To take advantage of this new information and to describe synthetically such data new analyses have been proposed. Here, we aim to analyze complex interface morphology with the surface curvature distribution (SCD) [1] but other possibilities exist [2]. The SCD allows us to describe continuously the destabilization of the initial liquid structure, through complex interfaces such as ligaments, blobs, and liquid sheets until the apparition of the first spherical structures which ultimately become droplets. Beyond the description of the interface, it has been possible to show that a careful analysis of the liquid-gas surface through the SCD allows for determining at the early stage of the atomization process the final characteristics of the spray, even its diameter distribution [3]. In the present work, we are using experimental measurements to assess the characteristics of the spray. With these data, it is possible to observe and describe the atomization process at all stages of the atomization using curvature analysis and image processing techniques.</description>

      <title>Thin ring wing as a means of flow improvement upstream of a propeller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are numerous devices currently known with the purpose of reducing the irregularity of the flow upstream of the propeller and to decrease by that means the propeller-induced vibration and noise. Many of these devices are wing-shaped vortex-generators that affect the flow with their induced (i.e. passive) longitudinal vortices. The paper's subject is the use of a ring-shaped wing as a highly effective passive vortex-generator which allows to control the flow closer to the most charged sections of propeller blades. The problem of a thin ring-shaped wing with irregular (asymmetric) geometry in the irregular steady flow has been solved in a linear approach and the intensity of the induced longitudinal vortices as a function of the irregularity of the flow and the geometry of the ring wing has been estimated using that solution. Experiments in the towing tank showing good concordance with the theoretical model confirmed the effectiveness of such a device. Some additional advantages of a ring-shaped wing incorporated into the construction of stabilizers are considered.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Reynolds stress and dynamic mechanisms in two-dimensional elasto-inertial turbulence of viscoelastic channel flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elasto-inertial turbulence (EIT) has been demonstrated to be able to sustain in two-dimensional (2D) channel flow; however the systematic investigations on 2D EIT remain scare. This study addresses this gap by examining the statistical characteristics and dynamic mechanisms of 2D EIT, while exploring its similarities to and differences from three-dimensional (3D) EIT. We demonstrate that the influence of elasticity on the statistical properties of 2D EIT follows distinct trends compared to those observed in 3D EIT and drag-reducing turbulence (DRT). These differences can be attributed to variations in the underlying dynamical processes. As nonlinear elasticity increases, the dominant dynamic evolution in 3D flows involves the gradual suppression of inertial turbulence (IT). In contrast, 2D flows exhibit a progressive enhancement of EIT. More strikingly, we identify an anomalous Reynolds stress in 2D EIT that contributes negatively to flow resistance, a behavior opposite to that of IT. Quadrant analysis of velocity fluctuations reveals the predominance of motions in the first and third quadrants. These motions are closely associated with polymer sheet-like extension structures, which are inclined from the near-wall region toward the channel center along the streamwise direction. Finally, we present the dynamical budget of 2D EIT, which shows significant similarities to that of 3D EIT, thereby providing compelling evidence for the objective existence of the 2D nature of EIT.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive and Reinforcement Learning Methods for Active Flow Control of an Airfoil with Dual-point Excitation of Plasma Actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches for active flow control over a NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics) 4412 airfoil around the static stall condition at a Reynolds number of 4*10^5. The Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations with the Scale-Adaptive Simulation (SAS) turbulence model are utilized for the numerical simulations. The dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma actuators were employed in dual excitation mode for flow separation control. The study systematically evaluates adaptive MPC, temporal difference reinforcement learning (TDRL), and deep Q-learning (DQL) based on optimizing the excitation frequency and expediting the time to identify stable conditions. Moreover, an integrated approach that combines signal processing with DQL is examined. The results demonstrate that while MPC and RL significantly improve flow control, RL approaches offer superior adaptability and performance. In optimal conditions, a lift coefficient of around 1.619 was achieved within less than 2.5 seconds with an excitation frequency of 100 or 200 Hz. This research highlights that RL-based approaches could perform better in flow control applications than MPC.</description>

      <title>A validated fluid-structure interaction simulation model for vortex-induced vibration of a flexible pipe in steady flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a validated fluid-structure interaction simulation framework based on strip methods for the vortex-induced vibration of a flexible pipe. The numerical results are compared with the experimental data from three previous steady flow conditions: uniform, linearly sheared, and bidirectionally sheared flow. The Reynolds number ranges from $10^4$ to $10^5$. The flow field is simulated via the RANS model, which is based on the open-source software OpenFOAM. The solid field is modeled based on Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, and fluid-structure coupling is implemented via a weak coupling algorithm developed in MATLAB. The vortex-induced vibration response is assessed in terms of amplitude and frequency, along with the differences in strain. Additionally, wavelet analysis and traveling wave phenomena are investigated. The numerical simulation codes and experimental data in this manuscript are openly available, providing a foundation for more complex vortex-induced vibration simulations in the future.</description>

      <title>Phase-based analysis and control of supersonic turbulent cavity flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a phase-based framework for reducing the pressure fluctuations within a spanwise-periodic supersonic turbulent cavity flow with an incoming free-stream Mach number of 1.4 and a depth-based Reynolds number of 10,000. Open cavity flows exhibit large fluctuations due to the feedback between the shear layer instabilities and the acoustic field. The dominant flow physics includes the formation, convection, and impingement of large-scale spanwise-oriented vortical structures. We formulate a flow control strategy to effectively modify the vortex convection frequency, thereby disrupting the feedback loop and suppressing pressure fluctuations within the cavity. We implement a phase-reduction approach to identify the flow response about the time-varying convective process by defining a phase variable using dynamic mode decomposition. Three-dimensional impulse perturbations are introduced from the cavity leading edge to characterize phase response in terms of advancement or delay of convection. We perform open-loop flow control through unsteady blowing using actuation frequencies slightly different from the vortex convection frequency to disrupt the feedback loop. After designing a phase-sensitivity-based actuation waveform optimized for quick flow modification, we investigate the speed of fluctuation reduction and compare it to a sinusoidal waveform. At a spanwise actuation wavenumber of $\beta=2\pi$, both perform similarly, achieving a 46% reduction of pressure fluctuations within five convective times. At $\beta=\pi$, the phase-sensitivity-based actuation performs better by achieving a 40% reduction compared to the 30% with a sinusoidal waveform within six convective times. This study shows the potential of phase-based analysis for timing-based flow control of unsteady turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Ligament mediated aerobreakup of a droplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Droplet formation is relevant in a multitude of applications spanning natural and artificial settings. Comprehending droplet aerobreakup or air-assisted secondary atomization is challenging, especially in high-speed flow scenarios. This entails multi-scale interface deformations with intricate wave dynamics that conform to a non-linear cascade. In the present study, we look into shockwave-induced breakups and associated intermediate processes happening at a smaller spatiotemporal scale over the disintegrating droplet interface at different Weber numbers ($We \sim 10^3$). We observe the undulations to follow breakup patterns that resemble a scaled-down version of a secondary atomization event. These sub-secondary breakup processes end with corrugated ligaments that generate the final daughter droplets. The size distribution of these droplets is estimated using a Depth from Defocus (DFD) technique. These illustrate the transient nature of aerobreakup, where the normalized statistics in subsequent time periods and different $We$ are observed to follow a common underlying distribution. This conforms to a gamma distribution where the associated fit parameters agree well with the coefficients determined from ligament shape factors, corresponding to the limit associated with most extreme corrugations. Scaling laws based on $We$ are deduced for the averaged statics using a high energy chaotic breakup mechanism. These observations reinforce the idea of a self-similar mechanism for the catastrophic aerobreakup of a droplet.</description>

      <title>Turbulence in stratified rotating topographic wakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence generation mechanisms in stratified, rotating flows past three-dimensional (3D) topography remain underexplored, particularly in submesoscale (SMS) regimes critical to geophysical applications. Using turbulence-resolving large-eddy simulations, we systematically dissect the interplay of stratification and rotation in governing the dynamics of wake turbulence. Our parametric study reveals that turbulent dissipation in the near wake is dominated by two distinct instabilities: (1) vertical shear-driven Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI), amplified by oblique dislocation of K\'arm\'an vortices under strong stratification, and (2) centrifugal/inertial instability (CI), which peaks at intermediate rotation rates (Rossby number order unity, SMS regime) and relatively weaker stratification. Notably, strong rotation dampens vertical shear and weakens KHI-driven turbulence, while strong stratification imposes smaller vertical length scales that restrict CI-driven turbulence. By quantifying dissipation across a broad parameter space of stratification and rotation, predictive relationships between the environmental parameters and instability dominance is established. These findings highlight the regime dependence of instability mechanisms and may inform targeted observational campaigns and numerical models of oceanic and atmospheric wakes.</description>

      <title>Influence of the particle distribution on dust explosions in the 20 L sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is essential to standardize the safety characteristics of dust explosions to mitigate their impact on the process industries. The 20 L sphere primarily investigates the safety characteristics, namely explosion pressure (P_ex) and the rate of pressure rise ((dP/dt)_ex), of dust explosions at the laboratory level. Ensuring uniform dust distribution inside the sphere is essential for accurate data acquisition and standardization. However, whirls created by the incoming flow through the nozzle yield particles to concentrate near the wall before ignition. This study simulated the explosion inside a 20 L sphere to investigate the impact of near-wall particle concentration on the safety characteristics. The OpenFOAM model based on the Euler-Lagrangian approach was benchmarked against experimental data of lycopodium dust explosions. A novel radial homogeneity parameter Phi (0 &lt;= Phi &lt;= 1) quantifies the near-wall particle concentration. The parameter Phi is calculated using a power law based on the radial component of particle coordinates, where Phi = 1 indicates a uniform distribution, and Phi = 0 represents all particles concentrating on the wall. Different particle distributions (Phi = 0.1, 0.2, ..., 1) are initiated before ignition. As Phi decreases from 1, P_ex and (dP/dt)_ex first decrease, but beyond a certain point, both parameters increase. At Phi = 0.1, both P_ex and (dP/dt)_ex reach their highest values, which are 1.75% and 10.1% higher than the uniform distribution, respectively. The lowest values arise at Phi = 0.7, with reductions of 0.25% and 5.6% compared to the uniform distribution. Thus, high near-wall concentrations enhance explosion intensity, while moderate concentrations result in lower intensity than the uniform distribution.</description>

      <title>A pencil-distributed finite-difference solver for extreme-scale calculations of turbulent wall flows at high Reynolds number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computational method for extreme-scale simulations of incompressible turbulent wall flows at high Reynolds numbers. The numerical algorithm extends a popular method for solving second-order finite differences Poisson/Helmholtz equations using a pencil-distributed parallel tridiagonal solver to improve computational performance at scale. The benefits of this approach were investigated for high-Reynolds-number turbulent channel flow simulations, with up to about 80 billion grid points and 1024 GPUs/GCDs on the European flagship supercomputers Leonardo and LUMI. An additional GPU porting effort of the entire solver had to be undertaken for the latter. Our results confirm that, while 1D domain decompositions are favorable for smaller systems, they become inefficient or even impossible at large scales. This restriction is relaxed by adopting a pencil-distributed approach. The results show that, at scale, the revised Poisson solver is about twice as fast as the baseline approach with the full-transpose algorithm for 2D domain decompositions. Strong and weak scalability tests show that the performance gains are due to the lower communication footprint. Additionally, to secure high performance when solving for wall-normal implicit diffusion, we propose a reworked flavor of parallel cyclic reduction (PCR) that is split into pre-processing and runtime steps. During pre-processing, small sub-arrays with independent 1D coefficients are computed by parallel GPU threads, without any global GPU communication. Then, at runtime, the reworked PCR enables a fast solution of implicit 1D diffusion without computational overhead. Our results show that the entire numerical solver, coupled with the PCR algorithm, enables extreme-scale simulations with 2D pencil decompositions, which do not suffer performance losses even when compared to the best 1D slab configurations available for smaller systems.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic and thermodynamic non-equilibrium characteristics of shock waves: Insights from the discrete Boltzmann method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shock waves are typical non-equilibrium phenomena in nature and engineering, driven by hydrodynamic non-equilibrium (HNE) and thermodynamic non-equilibrium (TNE) effects. However, the mechanisms underlying these non-equilibrium effects are not fully understood. This study develops the discrete Boltzmann method (DBM) by directly discretizing velocity space, allowing for the adequate capture of higher-order HNE and TNE effects. To reveal these mechanisms, we derive analytical solutions for distribution functions and TNE quantities at various orders using CE analysis, although DBM simulations do not rely on these theoretical derivations. Using argon shock structures as a case study, DBM simulations of interface profiles and thickness at the macroscopic level agree well with experimental data and direct simulation Monte Carlo results. At the mesoscopic level, DBM-derived distribution functions and TNE measures closely match their corresponding analytical solutions. The effect of Mach number on HNE is analyzed by examining the shape and thickness of density, temperature, and velocity interfaces. Key findings include: (i) Mach number induces a two-stage effect on macroscopic quantities, influencing both interface smoothness and thickness, and (ii) as Mach number increases, the region of strong compressibility shifts from the outflow region to the inflow region. As for TNE characteristics, increasing Mach number significantly amplifies TNE intensity and expands the non-equilibrium region. This research provides kinetic insights into the multiscale nature and effects of non-equilibrium characteristics in shock waves, offering theoretical references for constructing kinetic models that describe different types and orders of non-equilibrium effects.</description>

      <title>Stress field in the vicinity of a bubble/sphere moving in a dilute surfactant solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we experimentally investigate the stress field around a bubble rising in a dilute surfactant solution (20 &lt; Re &lt; 220, high Peclet numbers) whose surface gradually becomes contaminated, and compare it with that around a sphere free from surface contamination. We employ a newly developed polarization measurement technique, highly sensitive to stress fields near interfaces. First, we validate this method by measuring the flow around a solid sphere settling at Re = 120 and comparing results with numerical predictions, confirming its accuracy. We then measure the stress field around a bubble whose drag force transitions from that of a clean interface to that of a rigid interface within the observation region. The stress near the bubble's front resembles that of a clean bubble, while the rear behaves like a solid sphere. Between these regions, a discontinuous phase retardation near the cap angle indicates a transition from slip to no-slip boundary conditions. Axisymmetric stress reconstruction reveals localized stress spike at the cap angle, which shifts as surfactant accumulates and increases the drag. Remarkably, the measured cap angle versus normalized drag coefficient agrees well with numerical simulations at Re = 100 (Cuenot et al. 1997) and shows only a slight deviation from the creeping-flow stagnant cap model (Sadhal and Johnson 1983). This work demonstrates that polarization-based stress field measurements effectively capture the interplay between surface contamination and hydrodynamics at intermediate Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>Integrated Multiphysics Modeling of a Piezoelectric Micropump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an integrated multiphysics simulation approach of piezoelectric micropumps. Micropumps and micro blowers are essential devices in various cutting-edge industries like laboratory equipment, medical devices, and fuel cells. A piezoelectric micropump involves complex physics including microfluidics, flow-structure interaction, electricity, and piezoelectric material. Hence, a comprehensive analysis of the interactions between different physical phenomena, would be essential for the effective design and optimization of these micropumps. Prior studies on piezoelectric micropump were mainly focused on isolated physical aspects of these pumps, such as piezoelectric mechanics, fluid dynamics, electrical properties, and also fluid-structure Interactions. The present paper fills this gap by integrating these aspects into a holistic simulation and design approach, introducing a new methodology for micropump analysis. Advanced simulation and design tools like COMSOL and SolidWorks were employed in accordance. A brief review of piezoelectric materials, and an exploration of different types of micropumps and their operating principles is discussed. Also, a comparison of various piezoelectric materials, including their properties and applications is investigated. Further, the paper discusses the simulation process of the micropumps, using COMSOL software, and presents an in-depth analysis of the simulation results. This structured approach provides a comprehensive understanding of piezoelectric micropumps, from theoretical underpinnings to practical design considerations. ..</description>

      <title>Laser-induced droplet deformation: curvature inversion explained from instantaneous pressure impulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the shape of a tin sheet formed from a droplet struck by a nanosecond laser pulse. Specifically, we examine the dynamics of the process as a function of laser beam properties, focusing on the outstanding riddle of curvature inversion: tin sheets produced in experiments and state-of-the-art extreme ultraviolet (EUV) nanolithography light sources curve in a direction opposite to previous theoretical predictions. We resolve this discrepancy by combining direct numerical simulations with experimental data, demonstrating that curvature inversion can be explained by an instantaneous pressure impulse with low kurtosis. Specifically, we parametrize a dimensionless pressure width, $W$, using a raised cosine function and successfully reproduce the experimentally observed curvature over a wide range of laser-to-droplet diameter ratios, $0.3 &lt; d/D_0 &lt; 0.8$. The simulation process described in this work has applications in the EUV nanolithography industry, where a laser pulse deforms a droplet into a sheet, which is subsequently ionized by a second pulse to produce EUV-emitting plasma.</description>

      <title>Dynamical relevance of periodic orbits under increasing Reynolds number and connections to inviscid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large numbers of unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) have been found recently in doubly periodic, two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow at moderate Reynolds numbers $Re \in \{40, 100\}$ using gradient based-optimisation. While these solutions lead to robust statistical reconstructions at the $Re$-values where they were obtained, it is unclear how their dynamical importance evolves as $Re$ is increased. We investigate this by performing arclength continuation of these UPOs to beyond $Re \approx 1000$, and examine how the contribution of each UPO to the reconstruction of statistics evolves with $Re$. Statistical reconstruction away from the $Re$-value where the states were converged is relatively robust for the mean and root-mean-squared velocities, but challenging for complete PDFs, as a large number of solutions rapidly leave the attractor. The UPOs can be grouped into three classes based on whether the limiting dissipation rate is above, beneath or within the range of values typical for the turbulent flow, and we introduce a labelling procedure for identifying dominant vortical interactions in the turbulent UPOs by searching for point vortex periodic orbits that reproduce the dynamics of large scale coherent vortices. Convergence of the point vortex UPOs is achieved via gradient-based optimisation of a scalar loss function which both (1) matches the dynamics of the point vortices to the turbulent vortex cores at $Re=100$ and (2) insist that the point vortex evolution is itself time-periodic. The point vortex UPOs identify a wide range of simpler dynamical processes in the turbulent collection, including slowly-propagating crystals, tripolar structures and bound states. These features persist in the high-dissipation class of UPOs as $Re$ increases, while the role of the forcing diminishes, suggesting a connection to solutions of the Euler equation as $Re \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Turbulence Across Dimensions: Crossover from two- to three-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamic transition of quantum turbulence (QT) in a confined potential field as the system evolves from purely two-dimensional (2D) to quasi-two-dimensional, and ultimately to three-dimensional (3D), by fixing the lateral dimensions of the trapping box while varying its height. In the 2DQT, distinct Onsager vortex cluster formation and inverse energy cascade are observed, while 3DQT exhibits a direct energy cascade consistent with the Vinen turbulence decay rate, which display striking differences. By systematically altering the system height, we explore how dimensionality drives the differentiation of turbulence types and find that this transition is closely related to the excitation of Kelvin waves. Kelvin waves not only introduce additional dissipation mechanisms but also serve as mediators for direct energy transfer across scales. When the wavelength of the permitted Kelvin waves exceeds the critical size of vortex clusters, turbulence begins transitioning to 3D type, culminating in fully developed 3DQT at the characteristic scale. In the transitional region, we observe continuous variations in the decay rate and vortex cluster correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Rheologically tuned modes of collective transport in active viscoelastic films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While many living biological media combine both viscous and elastic properties, most theoretical studies employ either purely fluid- or solid-like descriptions. We here use a unified framework for active films on substrates capable of describing a broad range of viscoelastic behavior to explore the interplay between activity and rheology. The core of the study is a comprehensive state diagram showing a rich world of spatiotemporal dynamic states. Our results demonstrate the potential of tunable rheology to realize modes of controlled active transport on the microscale.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and clustering of sedimenting disc lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uniform arrays of particles tend to cluster as they sediment in viscous fluids. Shape anisotropy of the particles enriches these dynamics by modifying the mode-structure and the resulting instabilities of the array. A one-dimensional lattice of sedimenting spheroids in the Stokesian regime displays either an exponential or an algebraic rate of clustering depending on the initial lattice spacing (Chajwa et al. 2020). This is caused by an interplay between the Crowley mechanism which promotes clumping, and a shape-induced drift mechanism which subdues it. We theoretically and experimentally investigate the sedimentation dynamics of one-dimensional lattices of oblate spheroids or discs and show a stark difference in clustering behaviour: the Crowley mechanism results in clumps comprised of several spheroids, whereas the drift mechanism results in pairs of spheroids whose asymptotic behavior is determined by pair-hydrodynamic interactions. We find that a Stokeslet, or point-particle, approximation is insufficient to accurately describe the instability and that the corrections provided by the first-reflection are necessary for obtaining some crucial dynamical features. As opposed to a sharp boundary between exponential growth and neutral eigenvalues under the Stokeslet approximation, the first-reflection correction leads to exponential growth for all initial perturbations, but far more rapid algebraic growth than exponential growth at large lattice spacing $d$. For discs with aspect ratio 0.125, corresponding to the experimental value, the instability growth rate is found to decrease with increasing lattice spacing $d$, approximately as $d^{-4.5}$, which is faster than the $d^{-2}$ for spheres (Crowley, 1971). Sedimenting pairs predominantly come together to form '$\perp$', which our theory accounts for through an analysis that builds on Koch &amp; Shaqfeh (1989).</description>

      <title>Oscillatory collective motion in viscoelastic and elastic active fluids and solids under circular confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an inspiring recent study, Xu et al. [Nat. Phys. 19, 46 (2023)] observed for a living active biofilm under circular confinement two emergent dynamic modes of collective motion in the film. One corresponds to global rotational motion of oscillating sense of rotation, the other one to uniformly translating motion of rotating migration direction. The authors reproduced these features in a discretized theoretical model for elastic active solids. We here demonstrate that the discovered fundamental phenomena are generic and emerge abundantly for a broad range of viscoelastic fluids and solids. Elastic solids represent only one limiting case.</description>

Abstract: Viscosity is a fundamental property of liquids and determines the diffusivity of suspended particles. A gradient in viscosity leads to a gradient in diffusivity, yet it is unknown whether such a gradient can lead to directed transport of particles. In this work, we generate a steep, stable viscosity gradient in a microfluidic channel and image the resulting transport of suspended nanoparticles at the single-particle level using high-resolution microscopy. We observe high viscophoretic drift velocities that significantly exceed theoretical predictions. In addition, we utilize viscophoresis for a new type of particle trap. We provide a first quantification of a transport phenomenon that is of importance in any system and any application exhibiting viscosity gradients, for example in separation using membrane technology as well as in inter- and intracellular biomolecular transport.</description>

      <title>An Experimental Study of Noise Reduction in Wind Turbine Airfoils with Serrated Trailing Edges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12188v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the noise reduction achieved by airfoils with serrated trailing edges in a low turbulence wind tunnel, focusing on acoustic spectral characteristics and wake flow field measurements. We analyze the effects of various factors, including Reynolds number, angle of attack, serration parameters, and model type, on sound power levels and far-field radiation patterns. Our findings reveal that serrated trailing edges significantly reduce blunt vortex shedding noise and laminar separation bubble noise across a broader frequency range, particularly in the mid-to-high frequency range, with reductions delineated by two boundaries. Interestingly, the serration geometry exhibits minimal impact on noise reduction, which varies with the angle of attack and airfoil profile across all tested conditions. Additionally, while serrations effectively lower noise levels, especially at higher frequencies, they do not significantly alter the airfoil's acoustic directivity patterns. Measurements of wake flow velocity spectra demonstrate a clear correlation between reduced wake turbulence and noise reduction, as serrated edges decrease the power spectral density of turbulent velocity fluctuations, effectively disrupting larger vortex structures responsible for noise generation. These valuable insights contribute to understanding the acoustic benefits of serrated trailing edges.</description>

      <title>The atomizing pulsed jet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01959v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct Numerical Simulations of the injection of a pulsed round liquid jet in a stagnant gas are performed in a series of runs of geometrically progressing resolution. The Reynolds and Weber numbers and the density ratio are sufficiently large for reaching a complex high-speed atomization regime but not so large so that the small length scales of the flow are impossible to resolve, except for very small liquid-sheet thickness. The Weber number based on grid size is then small, an indication that the simulations are very well resolved. Computations are performed using octree adaptive mesh refinement with a finite volume method and height-function computation of curvature, down to a specified minimum grid size $\Delta$. Qualitative analysis of the flow and its topology reveals a complex structure of ligaments, sheets, droplets and bubbles that evolve and interact through impacts, ligament breakup, sheet rupture and engulfment of air bubbles in the liquid. A rich gallery of images of entangled structures is produced. Most processes occurring in this type of atomization are reproduced in detail, except at the instant of thin sheet perforation or breakup. We analyze droplet statistics, showing that as the grid resolution is increased, the small-scale part of the distribution does not converge, and contains a large number of droplets close in order of magnitude to the minimum grid size with a significant peak at $d = 3\Delta$. This non-convergence arises from the numerical sheet breakup effect, in which the interface becomes rough just before it breaks. The rough appearance of the interface is associated to a high-wavenumber oscillation of the curvature. To recover convergence, we apply the controlled "manifold death" numerical procedure, in which thin sheets are detected, and then pierced by fiat before they reach a set critical thickness $h_c$.</description>

      <title>Bounded dissipation law and profiles of turbulent velocity moments in wall flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent wall flows offer the most direct means for understanding the effects of boundaries and viscosity on turbulent fluctuations. Available data on mean-square fluctuations in these flows show apparent contradiction with classical scaling based on the {mean} wall shear stress. We had earlier proposed an alternative model based on the principle of bounded dissipation to describe the data. Despite its putative success, a conclusive outcome requires much higher Reynolds numbers than are available at present, or can be expected to be available in the near future. However, the model can be validated satisfactorily even within the Reynolds number range already available by considering high-order moments and their distributions in the wall-normal direction. Expressions for high-order moments of streamwise velocity fluctuation $u$ are derived in the form $ \langle u^{+2q} \rangle^{1/q}=\alpha_q-\beta_q y^{\ast1/4}$; here $q$ is an integer, $\alpha_q$ and $\beta_q$ are constants independent of the friction Reynolds number $Re_\tau$, and $y^{\ast} = y/\delta$ is the distance away from the wall, normalized by the flow thickness $\delta$; in particular, $\alpha_q =\mu+\sigma q$ according to the `linear q-norm Gaussian' process, where $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are flow-independent constants. Excellent agreement is found between this formula and the available data in boundary layers, pipes and channels for $1 \leq q \leq 5$. For fixed $y^+ = y^*Re_\tau$, the present formulation leads to the bounded state $\langle u^{+2q} \rangle^{1/q}=\alpha_q$ as $Re_\tau\rightarrow\infty$. This work demonstrates the success of the present model in describing the behavior of fluctuations in wall flows.</description>

      <title>A three-layer model for the flow of particulate suspensions driven by sedimentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a system of shallow water-type equations to model laboratory experiments of particle-laden flows. We explore homogeneous liquid-solid suspensions of fine, non-cohesive, monodisperse glass beads which propagate as an equivalent fluid that progressively sediments and forms a growing deposit at the bottom of a smooth channel, and simultaneously creates a thin layer of pure liquid at the surface. The novelty of this model is twofold. First, we fully characterize the first-order behavior of these flows (mean velocity, runout distances and deposits geometry) through the sole sedimentation process of the grains. The model remains very simple and turns out to be effective despite the complex nature of interactions involved in these phenomena. Secondly, the sedimentation dynamics of the grains is observed to not be strongly affected by the flow, remaining comparable to that measured in static suspensions. The mathematical model is validated by comparing the experimental kinematics and deposit profiles with the simulations. The results highlight that this simplified model is able to describe the general features of these flows as well as their deposit morphology, provided that the settling rate is properly adjusted from a threshold Reynolds number, i.e. when the flow becomes sufficiently agitated to disturb and delay the deposition processes.</description>

Abstract: A point force acting on a Brinkman fluid in confinement is always counterbalanced by the force on the porous medium, the force on the walls and the stress at open boundaries. We discuss the distribution of those forces in different geometries: a long pipe, a medium with a single no-slip planar boundary, a porous sphere with an open boundary and a porous sphere with a no-slip wall. We determine the forces using the Lorentz reciprocal theorem and additionally validate the results with explicit analytical flow solutions. We discuss the relevance of our findings for cellular processes such as cytoplasmic streaming and centrosome positioning.</description>

Abstract: We solve the Stokes equations for the flow around two parallel translating and rotating cylinders using tools from complex analysis and conformal mapping. By considering cylinders of arbitrary size and separation, we generalise the solutions known for cylinders of equal size, and a cylinder near a plane wall. We then examine the limit when the cylinders are brought into contact, finding that it affects the separation points in the flow. Namely, they move to, and are hidden in, the point of contact between the cylinders.</description>

      <title>Numerical investigation of buoyancy-aided mixed convective flow past a square cylinder inclined at 45 degrees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03124v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study numerically investigates the two-dimensional mixed convective flow of air past a square cylinder placed at an angle of incidence, ${\alpha} = 45^{\circ}$ to the free-stream. We perform direct numerical simulations (DNS) for a Reynolds number (Re) of 100, a range of Richardson numbers (Ri) between 0.0 and 1.0, and a Prandtl number (Pr) of 0.7. The critical Richardson number at which the near-field becomes a steady flow from an unsteady one lies between 0.65 and 0.7, along with a simultaneous emergence of the far-field unsteadiness. There is no range of Ri for which the entire flow field is seen to be steady. At a relatively moderate Ri, the flow field reveals the presence of vorticity inversion through the momentum addition in the downstream region. We discuss the dual wake-plume nature of the flow beyond the cylinder. The wake exhibits characteristics similar to those of a buoyant jet in the far-field at increased buoyancy. We explore the cause of the far-field unsteadiness and discuss the mechanism of the observed flow physics using instantaneous and time-averaged flow fields. The important flow quantities, such as force coefficients, vortex shedding frequency, and Nusselt number, are discussed at various Richardson numbers.</description>

      <title>A one-dimensional mixing model for the impact of ablative Rayleigh-Taylor instability on compression dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A one-dimensional mixing model, incorporating the effects of laser ablation and initial perturbations, is developed to study the influence of ablative Rayleigh-Taylor instability on compression dynamics. The length of the mixing region is determined with the buoyancy-drag model[arXiv:2411.12392v2 (2024)]. The mixing effect on laser ablation is mainly described with an additional heat source which depends on turbulent kinetic energy and initial perturbation level through a free multiplier. The model is integrated into a one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics code and validated against two-dimensional planar simulations. The further application of our model to spherical implosion simulations reveals that the model can give reasonable predictions of implosion degradation due to mixing, such as lowered shell compression, reduced stagnation pressure, and decreased areal density, etc. It is found that the time interval between the convergence of the main shock and stagnation may offer an estimate of mixing level in single-shot experiments.</description>

      <title>Generation of cosmic ray trajectories by a Diffusion Model trained on test particles in 3D magnetohydrodynamic turbulence</title>

Abstract: Models for the transport of high energy charged particles through strong magnetic turbulence play a key role in space and astrophysical studies, such as describing the propagation of solar energetic particles and high energy cosmic rays. Inspired by the recent advances in high-performance machine learning techniques, we investigate the application of generative diffusion models to synthesizing test particle trajectories obtained from a turbulent magnetohydrodynamics simulation. We consider velocity increment, spatial transport and curvature statistics, and find excellent agreement with the baseline trajectories for fixed particle energies. Additionally, we consider two synthetic turbulence models for comparison. Finally, challenges towards an application-ready transport model based on our approach are discussed.</description>

      <title>The reformed hydrodynamic Schr\"odinger equation and the effective method for eliminating pseudo-quantum potential: a case study on barotropic potential flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the discrepancies between the framework of the hydrodynamic Schr\"odinger equation (HSE) and classical fluid dynamics, we propose a reformed framework, termed the reformed hydrodynamic Schr\"odinger equation (RHSE) for clarity. The RHSE for barotropic potential flow is developed; notably, we demonstrate an alternative approach to eliminate the pseudo-quantum potential without resorting to the classical limit. We call this approach the ''correction method.'' We then examine the correction method using Noether's theorem, confirming that it enforces the conservation of energy and momentum. Furthermore, we find that the classical limit fails to completely remove redundant terms when a two-component wave function is used to introduce vorticity. This fact suggests that the classical limit is not a universal fallback, highlighting the importance of further investigating the correction method.</description>

      <title>Sliding of a liquid spherical droplet in an external insoluble liquid at low Reynolds numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The experiment shows that small liquid droplets under the action of gravity and the Archimedes force move in the external viscous liquid practically according to the Stokes drag force equation, and not in accordance with the Hadamard-Rybczynski (HR) formula, which was specially developed to describe the motion of a liquid droplet in an external viscous liquid. Various mechanisms are proposed to explain this: increased viscosity at the interface between two liquids and the presence of unaccounted surfactants. However, there is another fundamental mechanism that has not been taken into account. It can be expected that the velocities of such liquids, insoluble in each other, may not equalize at the boundary of the droplet. No slip condition may be may be unnatural at the droplet interface. In this paper, the Navier condition is applied to the liquid-liquid boundary for the first time. A generalized HR equation is obtained. If slip length {\lambda}=0 that equation transforms into the usual HR equation. At certain {\lambda}, we arrive at a model with continuity of the components of the viscous stress tensor at the interface of two fluids. For infinite viscosity of the drop, it becomes a well-known relation generalizing the Stokes drag force for a solid sphere, taking into account the boundary condition of partial slip.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Inviscid Power-Law Vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the power-law vortex $\overline{\omega}(x) = \beta |x|^{-\alpha}$, which explicitly solves the stationary unforced incompressible Euler equations in $\mathbb{R}^2$ in both physical and self-similar coordinates, is exponentially linearly stable in self-similar coordinates with the natural scaling. This answers a question from the monograph by Albritton et al. on Vishik's non-uniqueness work on the two-dimensional Euler equations. Moreover, we prove that in physical coordinates, the linearization around $\overline{\omega}$ generates a strongly continuous group of isometries and we prove that the spectrum of the linearization is contained in the imaginary axis. Our results are valid for $L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$ functions with a mild symmetry condition.</description>

      <title>Simulation of the thermocapillary assembly of a colloidal cluster during the evaporation of a liquid film in an unevenly heated cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The control of the thermocapillary assembly of colloidal particle clusters is important for a variety of applications, including the creation of photonic crystals for microelectronics and optoelectronics, membrane formation for biotechnology, and surface cleaning for laboratory-on-chip devices. It is important to understand the main mechanisms that influence the formation of such clusters. This article considers a two-dimensional mathematical model describing the transfer of particles by a thermocapillary flow in an unevenly heated cell during the evaporation of a liquid. This gave us the opportunity to study one of the main processes that triggers the formation of a particle cluster. Whether the particle will move with the flow or stop at the heater, becoming the basis for the cluster, is determined by the ratio between gravity and the drag force. The results of numerical calculations show that, for small particle concentrations, their fraction entering the cluster decreases as the volumetric heat flux density $Q$ increases. The reason for this is an increase in the thermocapillary flow with an increase in the volumetric heat flux $Q$. It reduces the probability of particles entering the cluster.</description>
