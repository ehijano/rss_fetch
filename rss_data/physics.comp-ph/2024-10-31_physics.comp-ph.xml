      <title>The Performance of MC X-ray and PENELOPE in Homogeneous Bulk Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript presents a comparative analysis of two software packages, MC X-ray and PENELOPE, focusing on their accuracy and efficiency in simulating k-ratios for binary compounds and comparing their spectra with experimental data for pure elements and compounds. Based on the Pouchou database, MC X-ray slightly outperforms PENELOPE in k-ratio calculations, achieving a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.71\% compared to 2.87\%. Discrepancies between the two programs emerge at lower beam energies (3 keV and 5 keV) when comparing simulated spectra with experimental data; however, at higher energies (20 keV and 30 keV), both software packages exhibit consistent and reliable performance across a range of atomic numbers. While both tools are effective for analyzing homogeneous bulk samples, MC X-ray offers significant advantages in processing speed and user-friendliness. This study underscores the strengths and limitations of each package, providing valuable insights for researchers engaged in X-ray simulation and microanalysis.</description>

      <title>SLICES-PLUS: A Crystal Representation Leveraging Spatial Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the realm of crystalline materials has witnessed a surge in the development of generative models, predominantly aimed at the inverse design of crystals with tailored physical properties. However, spatial symmetry, which serves as a significant inductive bias, is often not optimally harnessed in the design process. This oversight tends to result in crystals with lower symmetry, potentially limiting the practical applications of certain functional materials. To bridge this gap, we introduce SLICES-PLUS, an enhanced variant of SLICES that emphasizes spatial symmetry. Our experiments in classification and generation have shown that SLICES-PLUS exhibits greater sensitivity and robustness in learning crystal symmetries compared to the original SLICES. Furthermore, by integrating SLICES-PLUS with a customized MatterGPT model, we have demonstrated its exceptional capability to target specific physical properties and crystal systems with precision. Finally, we explore autoregressive generation towards multiple elastic properties in few-shot learning. Our research represents a significant step forward in the realm of computational materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Error Bounds for Deep Learning-based Uncertainty Propagation in SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic differential equations are commonly used to describe the evolution of stochastic processes. The uncertainty of such processes is best represented by the probability density function (PDF), whose evolution is governed by the Fokker-Planck partial differential equation (FP-PDE). However, it is generally infeasible to solve the FP-PDE in closed form. In this work, we show that physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) can be trained to approximate the solution PDF using existing methods. The main contribution is the analysis of the approximation error: we develop a theory to construct an arbitrary tight error bound with PINNs. In addition, we derive a practical error bound that can be efficiently constructed with existing training methods. Finally, we explain that this error-bound theory generalizes to approximate solutions of other linear PDEs. Several numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate and validate the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Plane stress finite element modelling of arbitrary compressible hyperelastic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modelling the large deformation of hyperelastic solids under plane stress conditions for arbitrary compressible and nearly incompressible material models is challenging. This is in contrast to the case of full incompressibility where the out-of-plane deformation can be entirely characterised by the in-plane components. A rigorous general procedure for the incorporation of the plane stress condition for the compressible case (including the nearly incompressible case) is provided here, accompanied by a robust and open source finite element code. An isochoric/volumetric decomposition is adopted for nearly incompressible materials yielding a robust single-field finite element formulation. The nonlinear equation for the out-of-plane component of the deformation gradient is solved using a Newton-Raphson procedure nested at the quadrature point level. The model's performance and accuracy are made clear via a series of simulations of benchmark problems. Additional challenging numerical examples of composites reinforced with particles and fibres further demonstrate the capability of this general computational framework.</description>

      <title>The Reconstruction of the Space-Dependent Thermal Conductivity from Sparse Temperature Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for reconstructing the thermal conductivity coefficient in 1D and 2D heat equations using moving sensors that dynamically traverse the domain to record sparse and noisy temperature measurements. We significantly reduce the computational cost associated with forward PDE evaluations by employing automatic differentiation, enabling a more efficient and scalable reconstruction process. This allows the inverse problem to be solved with fewer sensors and observations. Specifically, we demonstrate the successful reconstruction of thermal conductivity on the 1D circle and 2D torus, using one and four moving sensors, respectively, with their positions recorded over time. Our method incorporates sampling algorithms to compute confidence intervals for the reconstructed conductivity, improving robustness against measurement noise. Extensive numerical simulations of heat dynamics validate the efficacy of our approach, confirming both the accuracy and stability of the reconstructed thermal conductivity. Additionally, the method is thoroughly tested using large datasets from machine learning, allowing us to evaluate its performance across various scenarios and ensure its reliability. This approach provides a cost-effective and flexible solution for conductivity reconstruction from sparse measurements, making it a robust tool for solving inverse problems in complex domains.</description>

      <title>Conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative surrogate for particle-calorimeter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle collisions at accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider, recorded and analyzed by experiments such as ATLAS and CMS, enable exquisite measurements of the Standard Model and searches for new phenomena. Simulations of collision events at these detectors have played a pivotal role in shaping the design of future experiments and analyzing ongoing ones. However, the quest for accuracy in Large Hadron Collider (LHC) collisions comes at an imposing computational cost, with projections estimating the need for millions of CPU-years annually during the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) run \cite{collaboration2022atlas}. Simulating a single LHC event with \textsc{Geant4} currently devours around 1000 CPU seconds, with simulations of the calorimeter subdetectors in particular imposing substantial computational demands \cite{rousseau2023experimental}. To address this challenge, we propose a conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative model. Our model integrates a conditioned variational autoencoder (VAE) on the exterior with a conditioned Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) in the latent space, providing enhanced expressiveness compared to conventional VAEs. The RBM nodes and connections are meticulously engineered to enable the use of qubits and couplers on D-Wave's Pegasus-structured \textit{Advantage} quantum annealer (QA) for sampling. We introduce a novel method for conditioning the quantum-assisted RBM using \textit{flux biases}. We further propose a novel adaptive mapping to estimate the effective inverse temperature in quantum annealers. The effectiveness of our framework is illustrated using Dataset 2 of the CaloChallenge \cite{calochallenge}.</description>

      <title>Analysis and applications of the upwind conservation element and solution element scheme for compressible flow simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The upwind conservation element and solution element (CESE) scheme is an alternative discontinuity-capturing numerical approach to solving hyperbolic conservation laws. To evaluate the numerical properties of this spatiotemporal coupled scheme, a formal analysis is conducted on the upwind CESE discretization applied to the linear advection problem. The modified equation and the effective modified wavenumber are derived, which theoretically confirm the order of accuracy and reveal the dissipation and dispersion properties of this scheme. Several examples are considered to demonstrate the capabilities of the upwind CESE scheme for simulating compressible flows, including shock-vortex and shock-bubble interactions. The results of the present scheme agree well with exact solutions, results of other numerical methods, and experimental data. This demonstrates the high resolution of the scheme in capturing shock waves, material interfaces, and small-scale flow structures.</description>

      <title>Goodbye Christoffel Symbols: A Flexible and Efficient Approach for Solving Physical Problems in Curved Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional methods for solving physical equations in curved spaces, especially in fluid mechanics and general relativity, rely heavily on the use of Christoffel symbols. These symbols provide the necessary corrections to account for curvature in differential geometries but lead to significant computational complexity, particularly in numerical simulations. In this paper, we propose a novel, simplified approach that obviates the need for Christoffel symbols by symbolic programming and advanced numerical methods.
  Our approach is based on defining a symbolic mapping between Euclidean space and curved coordinate systems, enabling the transformation of spatial and temporal derivatives through Jacobians and their inverses. This eliminates the necessity of using Christoffel symbols for defining local bases and tensors, allowing for the direct application of physical laws in Cartesian coordinates even when solving problems in curved spaces.
  We demonstrate the robustness and flexibility of our method through several examples, including the derivation of the Navier-Stokes equations in cylindrical coordinates, the modeling of complex flows in bent cylindrical tubes, and the breakup of viscoelastic fluid threads. These examples highlight how our method simplifies the numerical formulation while maintaining accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, we explore how these advancements benefit free-surface flows, where mapping physical 3D domains to a simpler computational domain is essential for solving moving boundary problems.</description>

      <title>Simulation and Data Assimilation in an Idealized Coupled Atmosphere-Ocean-Sea Ice Floe Model with Cloud Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sea ice plays a crucial role in the climate system, particularly in the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ), a transitional area consisting of fragmented ice between the open ocean and consolidated pack ice. As the MIZ expands, understanding its dynamics becomes essential for predicting climate change impacts. However, the role of clouds in these processes has been largely overlooked. This paper addresses that gap by developing an idealized coupled atmosphere-ocean-ice model incorporating cloud and precipitation effects, tackling both forward (simulation) and inverse (data assimilation) problems. Sea ice dynamics are modeled using the discrete element method, which simulates floes driven by atmospheric and oceanic forces. The ocean is represented by a two-layer quasi-geostrophic (QG) model, capturing mesoscale eddies and ice-ocean drag. The atmosphere is modeled using a two-layer saturated precipitating QG system, accounting for variable evaporation over sea surfaces and ice. Cloud cover affects radiation, influencing ice melting. The idealized coupled modeling framework allows us to study the interactions between atmosphere, ocean, and sea ice floes. Specifically, it focuses on how clouds and precipitation affect energy balance, melting, and freezing processes. It also serves as a testbed for data assimilation, which allows the recovery of unobserved floe trajectories and ocean fields in cloud-induced uncertainties. Numerical results show that appropriate reduced-order models help improve data assimilation efficiency with partial observations, allowing the skillful inference of missing floe trajectories and lower atmospheric winds. These results imply the potential of integrating idealized models with data assimilation to improve our understanding of Arctic dynamics and predictions.</description>

Abstract: We study the influence of analytical regularization used in the generalized function (distribution) space to the Tikhonov regularization procedure utilized in the different versions of Moore-Penrose's inversion. By introducing a new analytical term to the Tikhonov regularization of Moore-Penrose's inversion procedure, we derive new optimization conditions that extend the Tikhonov regularization framework and influence the fitting parameter. This enhancement yields a more robust and accurate reconstruction of physical quantities, demonstrating its potential impact on various studies. We illustrate the significance of new term through schematic examples of physical applications, highlighting its relevance to diverse fields. Our findings provide a valuable tool for improving inversion methods and their applications in physics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Response Estimation and System Identification of Dynamical Systems via Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate modelling of structural dynamics is crucial across numerous engineering applications, such as Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), seismic analysis, and vibration control. Often, these models originate from physics-based principles and can be derived from corresponding governing equations, often of differential equation form. However, complex system characteristics, such as nonlinearities and energy dissipation mechanisms, often imply that such models are approximative and often imprecise. This challenge is further compounded in SHM, where sensor data is often sparse, making it difficult to fully observe the system's states. To address these issues, this paper explores the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a class of physics-enhanced machine learning (PEML) techniques, for the identification and estimation of dynamical systems. PINNs offer a unique advantage by embedding known physical laws directly into the neural network's loss function, allowing for simple embedding of complex phenomena, even in the presence of uncertainties. This study specifically investigates three key applications of PINNs: state estimation in systems with sparse sensing, joint state-parameter estimation, when both system response and parameters are unknown, and parameter estimation within a Bayesian framework to quantify uncertainties. The results demonstrate that PINNs deliver an efficient tool across all aforementioned tasks, even in presence of modelling errors. However, these errors tend to have a more significant impact on parameter estimation, as the optimization process must reconcile discrepancies between the prescribed model and the true system behavior. Despite these challenges, PINNs show promise in dynamical system modeling, offering a robust approach to handling uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Heavy-element damage seeding in proteins under XFEL illumination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10298v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (SFX) captures the structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules with high spatial and temporal resolutions. The ultrashort pulse produced by an X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) 'outruns' much of the radiation damage that impairs conventional crystallography. However, the rapid onset of 'electronic damage' due to electron ionization limits this benefit. Here, we distinguish the influence of different atomic species on the electronic damage to protein crystals in SFX by employing a plasma code that tracks the unbound electrons as a continuous energy distribution. The simulations show that trace quantities of heavy atoms ($Z &gt; 10$) contribute a substantial proportion of global radiation damage by inducing electron ionization processes that are highly damaging on the XFEL pulse timescale. Native sulfur atoms have a considerable effect on damage-induced noise. Likewise, proteins suffer less damage when the crystal solvent contains lower concentrations of heavy elements. The proximity of the X-ray energy to a heavy-element absorption edge has a strong and non-trivial influence on the damage induced in these models. In one representative protein (lysozyme substituted with selenomethionine), adjusting the X-ray energy from 14 keV to 12 keV is as effective at reducing the ionization of light atoms as compressing the pulse width from 50 fs to 5 fs. These results indicate that relatively small quantities of heavy elements can substantially affect global radiation damage in the XFEL regime.</description>

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are infamous for being hard to train. Recently, second-order methods based on natural gradient and Gauss-Newton methods have shown promising performance, improving the accuracy achieved by first-order methods by several orders of magnitude. While promising, the proposed methods only scale to networks with a few thousand parameters due to the high computational cost to evaluate, store, and invert the curvature matrix. We propose Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (KFAC) for PINN losses that greatly reduces the computational cost and allows scaling to much larger networks. Our approach goes beyond the established KFAC for traditional deep learning problems as it captures contributions from a PDE's differential operator that are crucial for optimization. To establish KFAC for such losses, we use Taylor-mode automatic differentiation to describe the differential operator's computation graph as a forward network with shared weights. This allows us to apply KFAC thanks to a recently-developed general formulation for networks with weight sharing. Empirically, we find that our KFAC-based optimizers are competitive with expensive second-order methods on small problems, scale more favorably to higher-dimensional neural networks and PDEs, and consistently outperform first-order methods and LBFGS.</description>

      <title>AMARO: All Heavy-Atom Transferable Neural Network Potentials of Protein Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17852</link>

Abstract: All-atom molecular simulations offer detailed insights into macromolecular phenomena, but their substantial computational cost hinders the exploration of complex biological processes. We introduce Advanced Machine-learning Atomic Representation Omni-force-field (AMARO), a new neural network potential (NNP) that combines an O(3)-equivariant message-passing neural network architecture, TensorNet, with a coarse-graining map that excludes hydrogen atoms. AMARO demonstrates the feasibility of training coarser NNP, without prior energy terms, to run stable protein dynamics with scalability and generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Origin of Oxygen Partial Pressure-Dependent Conductivity in SrTiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SrTiO3 (STO) displays a broad spectrum of physical properties, including superconductivity, ferroelectricity, and photoconductivity, making it a standout semiconductor material. Despite extensive researches, the oxygen partial pressure-dependent conductivity in STO has re-mained elusive. This study leverages first-principles calculations, and systematically investigates the intrinsic defect properties of STO. The results reveal that VO, VSr, and TiSr are the dominant intrinsic defects, influencing STO's conductivity under varying O chemical potentials (oxygen partial pressures). Under O-poor condition, VO is the predominant donor, while VSr is the main acceptor. As the oxygen pressure increases, TiSr emerges as a critical donor defect under O-rich condition, significantly affecting conductivity. Additionally, the study elucidates the abnormal phenomenon where VTi, typically an acceptor, exhibits donor-like behavior due to the formation of O-trimer. This work offers a comprehensive understanding of how intrinsic defects tune the Fermi level, thereby altering STO's conductivity from metallic to n-type, and eventually to p-type across different O chemical potentials. These insights resolve the long-standing issue of oxygen partial pressure-dependent conductivity and explain the observed metallic conductivity in oxygen-deficient STO.</description>
