      <title>A Reflection Principle for Potential Infinite Models of Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Denotational models of type theory, such as set-theoretic, domain-theoretic, or category-theoretic models use (actual) infinite sets of objects in one way or another. The potential infinite, seen as an extensible finite, requires a dynamic understanding of the infinite sets of objects. It follows that the type $nat$ cannot be interpreted as a set of all natural numbers, $\lbrack\!\lbrack nat \rbrack\!\rbrack = \mathbb{N}$, but as an increasing family of finite sets $\mathbb{N}_i = \{0, \dots, i-1\}$. Any reference to $\lbrack\!\lbrack nat \rbrack\!\rbrack$, either by the formal syntax or by meta-level concepts, must be a reference to a (sufficiently large) set $\mathbb{N}_i$.
  We present the basic concepts for interpreting a fragment of the simply typed $\lambda$-calculus within such a dynamic model. A type $\varrho$ is thereby interpreted as a process, which is formally a factor system together with a limit of it. A factor system is very similar to a direct or an inverse system, and its limit is also defined by a universal property. It is crucial to recognize that a limit is not necessarily an unreachable end beyond the process. Rather, it can be regarded as an intermediate state within the factor system, which can still be extended.
  The logical type $bool$ plays an important role, which we interpret classically as the set $\{true, false\}$. We provide an interpretation of simply typed $\lambda$-terms in these factor systems and limits. The main result is a reflection principle, which states that an element in the limit has a ``full representative'' at a sufficiently large stage within the factor system. For propositions, that is, terms of type $bool$, this implies that statements about the limit are true if and only if they are true at that sufficiently large stage.</description>

      <title>Learning Closed Signal Flow Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a learning algorithm for closed signal flow graphs - a graphical model of signal transducers. The algorithm relies on the correspondence between closed signal flow graphs and weighted finite automata on a singleton alphabet. We demonstrate that this procedure results in a genuine reduction of complexity: our algorithm fares better than existing learning algorithms for weighted automata restricted to the case of a singleton alphabet.</description>

      <title>An invitation to game comonads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Game comonads offer a categorical view of a number of model-comparison games central to model theory, such as pebble and Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"iss\'e games. Remarkably, the categories of coalgebras for these comonads capture preservation of several fragments of resource-bounded logics, such as (infinitary) first-order logic with n variables or bounded quantifier rank, and corresponding combinatorial parameters such as tree-width and tree-depth. In this way, game comonads provide a new bridge between categorical methods developed for semantics, and the combinatorial and algorithmic methods of resource-sensitive model theory.
  We give an overview of this framework and outline some of its applications, including the study of homomorphism counting results in finite model theory, and of equi-resource homomorphism preservation theorems in logic using the axiomatic setting of arboreal categories. Finally, we describe some homotopical ideas that arise naturally in the context of game comonads.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Craig Interpolant Generation over Unbounded Domains by Separating Semialgebraic Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpolation-based techniques become popular in recent years, as they can improve the scalability of existing verification techniques due to their inherent modularity and local reasoning capabilities. Synthesizing Craig interpolants is the cornerstone of these techniques.
  In this paper, we investigate nonlinear Craig interpolant synthesis for two polynomial formulas of the general form, essentially corresponding to the underlying mathematical problem to separate two disjoint semialgebraic sets. By combining the homogenization approach with existing techniques, we prove the existence of a novel class of non-polynomial interpolants called semialgebraic interpolants. These semialgebraic interpolants subsume polynomial interpolants as a special case. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first existence result of this kind. Furthermore, we provide complete sum-of-squares characterizations for both polynomial and semialgebraic interpolants, which can be efficiently solved as semidefinite programs. Examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.</description>

      <title>Field Knowledge as a Dual to Distributed Knowledge: A Characterization by Weighted Modal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of group knowledge concepts such as mutual, common, and distributed knowledge is well established within the discipline of epistemic logic. In this work, we incorporate epistemic abilities of agents to refine the formal definition of distributed knowledge and introduce a formal characterization of field knowledge. We propose that field knowledge serves as a dual to distributed knowledge. Our approach utilizes epistemic logics with various group knowledge constructs, interpreted through weighted models. We delve into the eight logics that stem from these considerations, explore their relative expressivity and develop sound and complete axiomatic systems.</description>

      <title>On the Number of Quantifiers Needed to Define Boolean Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of quantifiers needed to express first-order (FO) properties is captured by two-player combinatorial games called multi-structural games. We analyze these games on binary strings with an ordering relation, using a technique we call parallel play, which significantly reduces the number of quantifiers needed in many cases. Ordered structures such as strings have historically been notoriously difficult to analyze in the context of these and similar games. Nevertheless, in this paper, we provide essentially tight upper bounds on the number of quantifiers needed to characterize different-sized subsets of strings. The results immediately give bounds on the number of quantifiers necessary to define several different classes of Boolean functions. One of our results is analogous to Lupanov's upper bounds on circuit size and formula size in propositional logic: we show that every Boolean function on $n$-bit inputs can be defined by a FO sentence having $(1 + \varepsilon)n\log(n) + O(1)$ quantifiers, and that this is essentially tight. We reduce this number to $(1 + \varepsilon)\log(n) + O(1)$ when the Boolean function in question is sparse.</description>

      <title>The reverse mathematics of the pigeonhole hierarchy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The infinite pigeonhole principle for $k$ colors ($\mathsf{RT}_k$) states, for every $k$-partition $A_0 \sqcup \dots \sqcup A_{k-1} = \mathbb{N}$, the existence of an infinite subset~$H \subseteq A_i$ for some~$i &lt; k$. This seemingly trivial combinatorial principle constitutes the basis of Ramsey's theory, and plays a very important role in computability and proof theory. In this article, we study the infinite pigeonhole principle at various levels of the arithmetical hierarchy from both a computability-theoretic and reverse mathematical viewpoint. We prove that this hierarchy is strict over~$\mathsf{RCA}_0$ using an elaborate iterated jump control construction, and study its first-order consequences. This is part of a large meta-mathematical program studying the computational content of combinatorial theorems.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the complexity of classical modal logics and of their extension with fixed-point operators, using translations to transfer results across logics. In particular, we show several complexity results for multi-agent logics via translations to and from the $\mu$-calculus and modal logic, which allow us to transfer known upper and lower bounds. We also use these translations to introduce terminating and non-terminating tableau systems for the logics we study, based on Kozen's tableau for the $\mu$-calculus and the one of Fitting and Massacci for modal logic. Finally, we describe these tableaux with $\mu$-calculus formulas, thus reducing the satisfiability of each of these logics to the satisfiability of the $\mu$-calculus, resulting in a general 2EXP upper bound for satisfiability testing.</description>

      <title>On the Satisfiability of Local First-Order Logics with Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00831v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study first-order logic over unordered structures whose elements carry a finite number of data values from an infinite domain. Data values can be compared wrt.\ equality. As the satisfiability problem for this logic is undecidable in general, we introduce a family of local fragments. They restrict quantification to the neighbourhood of a given reference point that is bounded by some radius. Our first main result establishes decidability of the satisfiability problem for the local radius-1 fragment in presence of one "diagonal relation". On the other hand, extending the radius leads to undecidability. In a second part, we provide the precise decidability and complexity landscape of the satisfiability problem for the existential fragments of local logic, which are parameterized by the number of data values carried by each element and the radius of the considered neighbourhoods. Altogether, we draw a landscape of formalisms that are suitable for the specification of systems with data and open up new avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Structural Analysis of GRAFCET Control Specifications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The graphical modeling language GRAFCET is used as a formal specification language in industrial control design. This paper proposes a structural analysis that approximates the variable values of GRAFCET to allow verification on specification level. GRAFCET has different elements resulting in concurrent behavior, which in general results in a large state space for analyses like model checking. The proposed analysis approach approximates that state space and takes into consideration the entire set of GRAFCET elements leading to concurrent behavior. The analysis consists of two parts: We present an algorithm analyzing concurrent steps to approximate the step variables and we adapt analysis means from the field of Petri nets to approximate internal and output variables. The proposed approach is evaluated using an industrial-sized example to demonstrate that the analysis is capable of verifying behavioral errors and is not limited by the specification size of practical plants.</description>

      <title>Duality for Fitting's Multi-valued Modal logic via bitopology and biVietoris coalgebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fitting's Heyting-valued logic and Heyting-valued modal logic have already been studied from an algebraic viewpoint. In addition to algebraic axiomatizations with the completeness of Fitting's Heyting-valued logic and Heyting-valued modal logic, both topological and coalgebraic dualities have also been developed for algebras of Fitting's Heyting-valued modal logic. Bitopological methods have recently been employed to investigate duality for Fitting's Heyting-valued logic. However, the concepts of bitopology and biVietoris coalgebras are conspicuously absent from the development of dualities for Fitting's many-valued modal logic. With this study, we try to bridge that gap. We develop a bitopological duality for algebras of Fitting's Heyting-valued modal logic. We construct a bi-Vietoris functor on the category $PBS_{\mathcal{L}}$ of $\mathcal{L}$-valued ($\mathcal{L}$ is a Heyting algebra) pairwise Boolean spaces. Finally, we obtain a dual equivalence between categories of biVietoris coalgebras and algebras of Fitting's Heyting-valued modal logic. As a result, we conclude that Fitting's many-valued modal logic is sound and complete with respect to the coalgebras of a biVietoris functor. We discuss the application of this coalgebraic approach to bitopological duality.</description>

      <title>The Thins Ordering on Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Earlier papers \cite{VB2022,VB2023a,VB2023b} introduced the notions of a core and an index of a relation (an index being a special case of a core). A limited form of the axiom of choice was postulated -- specifically that all partial equivalence relations (pers) have an index -- and the consequences of adding the axiom to axiom systems for point-free reasoning were explored. In this paper, we define a partial ordering on relations, which we call the \textsf{thins} ordering. We show that our axiom of choice is equivalent to the property that core relations are the minimal elements of the \textsf{thins} ordering. We also characterise the relations that are maximal with respect to the \textsf{thins} ordering. Apart from our axiom of choice, the axiom system we employ is paired to a bare minimum and admits many models other than concrete relations -- we do not assume, for example, the existence of complements; in the case of concrete relations, the theorem is that the maximal elements of the \textsf{thins} ordering are the empty relation and the equivalence relations. This and other properties of \textsf{thins} provide further evidence that our axiom of choice is a desirable means of strengthening point-free reasoning on relations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13552v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that (local) confluence of terminating locally constrained rewrite systems is undecidable, even when the underlying theory is decidable. Several confluence criteria for logically constrained rewrite systems are known. These were obtained by replaying existing proofs for plain term rewrite systems in a constrained setting, involving a non-trivial effort. We present a simple transformation from logically constrained rewrite systems to term rewrite systems such that critical pairs of the latter correspond to constrained critical pairs of the former. The usefulness of the transformation is illustrated by lifting the advanced confluence results based on (almost) development closed critical pairs as well as on parallel critical pairs to the constrained setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Formalization of real analysis offers a chance to rebuild traditional proofs of important theorems as unambiguous theories that can be interactively explored. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the Lebesgue Differentiation Theorem formalized in the Coq proof assistant, from which the first Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) for the Lebesgue integral is obtained as a corollary. Proving the first FTC in this way has the advantage of decomposing into loosely-coupled theories of moderate size and of independent interest that lend themselves well to incremental and collaborative development. We explain how we formalize all the topological constructs and all the standard lemmas needed to eventually relate the definitions of derivability and of Lebesgue integration of MathComp-Analysis, a formalization of analysis developed on top of the Mathematical Components library. In the course of this experiment, we substantially enrich MathComp-Analysis and even devise a new proof for Urysohn's lemma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are interested in characterizing which classes of finite graphs are well-quasi-ordered by the induced subgraph relation. To that end, we devise an algorithm to decide whether a class of finite graphs well-quasi-ordered by the induced subgraph relation when the vertices are labelled using a finite set. In this process, we answer positively to a conjecture of Pouzet, under the extra assumption that the class is of bounded linear clique-width. As a byproduct of our approach, we obtain a new proof of an earlier result from Daliagault, Rao, and Thomass\'e, by uncovering a connection between well-quasi-orderings on graphs and the gap embedding relation of Dershowitz and Tzameret.</description>

      <title>Proof complexity of positive branching programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.06673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the proof complexity of systems based on positive branching programs, i.e. non-deterministic branching programs (NBPs) where, for any 0-transition between two nodes, there is also a 1-transition. Positive NBPs compute monotone Boolean functions, just like negation-free circuits or formulas, but constitute a positive version of (non-uniform) NL, rather than P or NC1, respectively.
  The proof complexity of NBPs was investigated in previous work by Buss, Das and Knop, using extension variables to represent the dag-structure, over a language of (non-deterministic) decision trees, yielding the system eLNDT. Our system eLNDT+ is obtained by restricting their systems to a positive syntax, similarly to how the 'monotone sequent calculus' MLK is obtained from the usual sequent calculus LK by restricting to negation-free formulas.
  Our main result is that eLNDT+ polynomially simulates eLNDT over positive sequents. Our proof method is inspired by a similar result for MLK by Atserias, Galesi and Pudl\'ak, that was recently improved to a bona fide polynomial simulation via works of Je\v{r}\'abek and Buss, Kabanets, Kolokolova and Kouck\'y. Along the way we formalise several properties of counting functions within eLNDT+ by polynomial-size proofs and, as a case study, give explicit polynomial-size poofs of the propositional pigeonhole principle.</description>

      <title>A General Verification Framework for Dynamical and Control Models via Certificate Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An emerging branch of control theory specialises in certificate learning, concerning the specification of a desired (possibly complex) system behaviour for an autonomous or control model, which is then analytically verified by means of a function-based proof. However, the synthesis of controllers abiding by these complex requirements is in general a non-trivial task and may elude the most expert control engineers. This results in a need for automatic techniques that are able to design controllers and to analyse a wide range of elaborate specifications. In this paper, we provide a general framework to encode system specifications and define corresponding certificates, and we present an automated approach to formally synthesise controllers and certificates. Our approach contributes to the broad field of safe learning for control, exploiting the flexibility of neural networks to provide candidate control and certificate functions, whilst using SMT-solvers to offer a formal guarantee of correctness. We test our framework by developing a prototype software tool, and assess its efficacy at verification via control and certificate synthesis over a large and varied suite of benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Extending Isabelle/HOL's Code Generator with support for the Go programming language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Isabelle proof assistant includes a small functional language, which allows users to write and reason about programs. So far, these programs could be extracted into a number of functional languages: Standard ML, OCaml, Scala, and Haskell. This work adds support for Go as a fifth target language for the Code Generator. Unlike the previous targets, Go is not a functional language and encourages code in an imperative style, thus many of the features of Isabelle's language (particularly data types, pattern matching, and type classes) have to be emulated using imperative language constructs in Go. The developed Code Generation is provided as an add-on library that can be simply imported into existing theories.</description>

      <title>Sound and Complete Witnesses for Template-based Verification of LTL Properties on Polynomial Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the classical problem of verifying programs with respect to formal specifications given in the linear temporal logic (LTL). We first present novel sound and complete witnesses for LTL verification over imperative programs. Our witnesses are applicable to both verification (proving) and refutation (finding bugs) settings. We then consider LTL formulas in which atomic propositions can be polynomial constraints and turn our focus to polynomial arithmetic programs, i.e. programs in which every assignment and guard consists only of polynomial expressions. For this setting, we provide an efficient algorithm to automatically synthesize such LTL witnesses. Our synthesis procedure is both sound and semi-complete. Finally, we present experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and that it can handle programs which were beyond the reach of previous state-of-the-art tools.</description>

      <title>A Direct Translation from LTL with Past to Deterministic Rabin Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a translation from linear temporal logic with past to deterministic Rabin automata. The translation is direct in the sense that it does not rely on intermediate non-deterministic automata, and asymptotically optimal, resulting in Rabin automata of doubly exponential size. It is based on two main notions. One is that it is possible to encode the history contained in the prefix of a word, as relevant for the formula under consideration, by performing simple rewrites of the formula itself. As a consequence, a formula involving past operators can (through such rewrites, which involve alternating between weak and strong versions of past operators in the formula's syntax tree) be correctly evaluated at an arbitrary point in the future without requiring backtracking through the word. The other is that this allows us to generalize to linear temporal logic with past the result that the language of a pure-future formula can be decomposed into a Boolean combination of simpler languages, for which deterministic automata with simple acceptance conditions are easily constructed.</description>

      <title>Verifying the Generalization of Deep Learning to Out-of-Distribution Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02024v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) play a crucial role in the field of machine learning, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across various application domains. However, despite their success, DNN-based models may occasionally exhibit challenges with generalization, i.e., may fail to handle inputs that were not encountered during training. This limitation is a significant challenge when it comes to deploying deep learning for safety-critical tasks, as well as in real-world settings characterized by substantial variability. We introduce a novel approach for harnessing DNN verification technology to identify DNN-driven decision rules that exhibit robust generalization to previously unencountered input domains. Our method assesses generalization within an input domain by measuring the level of agreement between independently trained deep neural networks for inputs in this domain. We also efficiently realize our approach by using off-the-shelf DNN verification engines, and extensively evaluate it on both supervised and unsupervised DNN benchmarks, including a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) system for Internet congestion control -- demonstrating the applicability of our approach for real-world settings. Moreover, our research introduces a fresh objective for formal verification, offering the prospect of mitigating the challenges linked to deploying DNN-driven systems in real-world scenarios.</description>
