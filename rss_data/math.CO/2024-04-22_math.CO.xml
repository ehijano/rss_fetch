      <title>On the $Q$-polynomial property of the full bipartite graph of a Hamming graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $Q$-polynomial property is an algebraic property of distance-regular graphs, that was introduced by Delsarte in his study of coding theory. Many distance-regular graphs admit the $Q$-polynomial property. Only recently the $Q$-polynomial property has been generalized to graphs that are not necessarily distance-regular. In [ J. Combin. Theory Ser. A, 205:105872, 2024 ], it was shown that graphs arising from the Hasse diagrams of the so-called attenuated space posets are $Q$-polynomial. These posets could be viewed as $q$-analogs of the Hamming posets, which were not studied in [ J. Combin. Theory Ser. A, 205:105872, 2024 ]. The main goal of this paper is to fill this gap by showing that the graphs arising from the Hasse diagrams of the Hamming posets are $Q$-polynomial.</description>

      <title>On 3-colourability of $(bull, H)$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $3$-colourability problem is a well-known NP-complete problem and it remains NP-complete for $bull$-free graphs, where $bull$ is the graph consisting of $K_3$ with two pendant edges attached to two of its vertices. In this paper we study $3$-colourability of $(bull,H)$-free graphs for several graphs $H$. We show that these graphs are $3$-colourable or contain an induced odd wheel $W_{2p+1}$ for some $p\geq 2$ or a spindle graph $M_{3p+1}$ for some $p\geq 1$. Moreover, for all our results we can provide certifying algorithms that run in polynomial time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Keller's conjecture on cube tilings asserted that, in any tiling of $\mathbb{R}^d$ by unit cubes, there must exist two cubes that share a $(d-1)$-dimensional face. This is now known to be true in dimensions $d\leq 7$ and false for $d\geq 8$. In this article, we investigate analogues of Keller's conjecture for integer tilings.</description>

      <title>Haar graphical representations of finite groups and an application to poset representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a group and let $S$ be a subset of $R$. The Haar graph $\mathrm{Haar}(R,S)$ of $R$ with connection set $S$ is the graph having vertex set $R\times\{-1,1\}$, where two distinct vertices $(x,-1)$ and $(y,1)$ are declared to be adjacent if and only if $yx^{-1}\in S$. The name Haar graph was coined by Toma\v{z} Pisanski in one of the first investigations on this class of graphs.
  For every $g\in R$, the mapping $\rho_g:(x,\varepsilon)\mapsto (xg,\varepsilon)$, $\forall (x,\varepsilon)\in R\times\{-1,1\}$, is an automorphism of $\mathrm{Haar}(R,S)$. In particular, the set $\hat{R}:=\{\rho_g\mid g\in R\}$ is a subgroup of the automorphism group of $\mathrm{Haar}(R,S)$ isomorphic to $R$. In the case that the automorphism group of $\mathrm{Haar}(R,S)$ equals $\hat{R}$, the Haar graph $\mathrm{Haar}(R,S)$ is said to be a Haar graphical representation of the group $R$.
  Answering a question of Feng, Kov\'{a}cs, Wang, and Yang, we classify the finite groups admitting a Haar graphical representation. Specifically, we show that every finite group admits a Haar graphical representation, with abelian groups and ten other small groups as the only exceptions.
  Our work on Haar graphs allows us to improve a 1980 result of Babai concerning representations of groups on posets, achieving the best possible result in this direction. An improvement to Babai's related result on representations of groups on distributive lattices follows.</description>

      <title>Best Simultaneous Approximation of Functions and a Generalized Minimax Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Best simultaneous approximation (BSA) for finitely or infinitely many functions are considered under the uniform norm and other important norms. Characterization theorems for a BSA from a finite-dimensional subspace are obtained by a generalized minimax theorem. From the characterization theorem a strong unicity theorem is also deduced for a BSA.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the concepts of an amazing hypercube decomposition and a double shortcut for it, and use these new ideas to formulate a conjecture implying the Combinatorial Invariance Conjecture of the Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials for the symmetric group. This conjecture has the advantage of being combinatorial in nature.</description>

      <title>A note on the Erd\H{o}s Matching Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Erd\H os Matching Conjecture states that the maximum size $f(n,k,s)$ of a family $\mathcal{F}\subseteq \binom{[n]}{k}$ that does not contain $s$ pairwise disjoint sets is $\max\{|\mathcal{A}_{k,s}|,|\mathcal{B}_{n,k,s}|\}$, where $\mathcal{A}_{k,s}=\binom{[sk-1]}{k}$ and $\mathcal{B}_{n,k,s}=\{B\in \binom{[n]}{k}:B\cap [s-1]\neq \emptyset\}$. The case $s=2$ is simply the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem on intersecting families and is well understood. The case $n=sk$ was settled by Kleitman and the uniqueness of the extremal construction was obtained by Frankl. Most results in this area show that if $k,s$ are fixed and $n$ is large enough, then the conjecture holds true. Exceptions are due to Frankl who proved the conjecture and considered variants for $n\in [sk,sk+c_{s,k}]$ if $s$ is large enough compared to $k$. A recent manuscript by Guo and Lu considers non-trivial families with matching number at most $s$ in a similar range of parameters.
  In this short note, we are concerned with the case $s\ge 3$ fixed, $k$ tending to infinity and $n\in\{sk,sk+1\}$. For $n=sk$, we show the stability of the unique extremal construction of size $\binom{sk-1}{k}=\frac{s-1}{s}\binom{sk}{k}$ with respect to minimal degree. As a consequence we derive $\lim\limits_{k\rightarrow \infty}\frac{f(sk+1,k,s)}{\binom{sk+1}{k}}&lt;\frac{s-1}{s}-\varepsilon_s$ for some positive constant $\varepsilon_s$ which depends only on $s$.</description>

      <title>Veronese sections and interlacing matrices of polynomials and formal power series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of a fully interlacing matrix of formal power series with real coefficients is introduced. This concept extends and strengthens that of an interlacing sequence of real-rooted polynomials with nonnegative coefficients, in the special case of row and column matrices. The fully interlacing property is shown to be preserved under matrix products, flips across the reverse diagonal and Veronese sections of the power series involved. These results and their corollaries generalize, unify and simplify several results which have previously appeared in the literature. An application to the theory of uniform triangulations of simplicial complexes is included.</description>

      <title>Lefschetz properties of squarefree monomial ideals via Rees algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of Rees algebras of monomial ideals has been extensively studied, and as a consequence, many (sometimes partial) equivalences between algebraic properties of monomial ideals, and combinatorial properties of simplicial complexes and hypergraphs are known. In this paper we show how this theory can be used to find interesting examples in the theory of Lefschetz properties. We explore the consequences of known results from Lefschetz properties to the Rees algebras of squarefree monomial ideals, for example in the calculation of analytic spread. In particular, we show a connection between symbolic powers and $f$-vectors of simplicial complexes. This perspective leads us to a generalization of Postnikov's "mixed Eulerian numbers". We prove the positivity of such numbers in our setting.</description>

      <title>Getting to the Root of the Problem: Sums of Squares for Infinite Trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inducibility of a graph represents its maximum density as an induced subgraph over all possible sequences of graphs of size growing to infinity. This invariant of graphs has been extensively studied since its introduction in $1975$ by Pippenger and Golumbic. In $2017$, Czabarka, Sz\'ekely and Wagner extended this notion to leaf-labeled rooted binary trees, which are objects widely studied in the field of phylogenetics. They obtain the first results and bounds for the densities and inducibilities of such trees. Following up on their work, we apply Razborov's flag algebra theory to this setting, introducing the flag algebra of rooted leaf-labeled binary trees. This framework allows us to use polynomial optimization methods, based on semidefinite programming, to efficiently obtain new upper bounds for the inducibility of trees and to improve existing ones. Additionally, we obtain the first outer approximations of profiles of trees, which represent all possible simultaneous densities of a pair of trees. Finally, we are able to prove the non-convexity of some of these profiles.</description>

      <title>Expanding the Katz Index for Link Prediction: A Case Study on a Live Fish Movement Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In aquaculture, disease spread models often neglect the dynamic interactions between farms, hindering accuracy. This study enhances the Katz index (KI) to incorporate spatial and temporal patterns of fish movement, improving the prediction of farms susceptible to disease via live fish transfers. We modified the Katz index to create models like the Weighted Katz Index (WKI), Edge Weighted Katz Index (EWKI), and combined models (e.g., KIEWKI). These incorporate spatial distances and temporal movement patterns for a comprehensive aquaculture network connection prediction framework. Model performance was evaluated using precision, recall, F1-scores, AUPR, and AUROC. The EWKI model significantly outperformed the traditional KI and other variations. It achieved high precision (0.988), recall (0.712), F1-score (0.827), and AUPR (0.970). Combined models (KIEWKI, WKIEWKI) approached, but couldn't surpass, EWKI performance. This study highlights the value of extending Katz index models to improve disease spread predictions in aquaculture networks. The EWKI model's performance demonstrates an innovative and flexible approach to tackling spatial challenges within network analysis.</description>

Abstract: We derive a path counting formula for two-dimensional lattice path model on a plane with filter restrictions. A filter is a line that restricts the path passing it to one of possible directions. Moreover, each path that touches this line is assigned a special weight. The periodic filter restrictions are motivated by the problem of tensor power decomposition for representations of quantum $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at roots of unity. Our main result is the explicit formula for the weighted number of paths from the origin to a fixed point between two filters in this model.</description>

      <title>Coloring hypergraphs with excluded minors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.13635v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hadwiger's conjecture, among the most famous open problems in graph theory, states that every graph that does not contain $K_t$ as a minor is properly $(t-1)$-colorable. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate that a natural extension of Hadwiger's problem to hypergraph coloring exists, and to derive some first partial results and applications. Generalizing ordinary graph minors to hypergraphs, we say that a hypergraph $H_1$ is a minor of a hypergraph $H_2$, if a hypergraph isomorphic to $H_1$ can be obtained from $H_2$ via a finite sequence of vertex- and hyperedge-deletions, and hyperedge contractions. We first show that a weak extension of Hadwiger's conjecture to hypergraphs holds true: For every $t \ge 1$, there exists a finite (smallest) integer $h(t)$ such that every hypergraph with no $K_t$-minor is $h(t)$-colorable, and we prove $$\left\lceil\frac{3}{2}(t-1)\right\rceil \le h(t) \le 2g(t)$$ where $g(t)$ denotes the maximum chromatic number of graphs with no $K_t$-minor. Using the recent result by Delcourt and Postle that $g(t)=O(t \log \log t)$, this yields $h(t)=O(t \log \log t)$. We further conjecture that $h(t)=\left\lceil\frac{3}{2}(t-1)\right\rceil$, i.e., that every hypergraph with no $K_t$-minor is $\left\lceil\frac{3}{2}(t-1)\right\rceil$-colorable for all $t \ge 1$, and prove this conjecture for all hypergraphs with independence number at most $2$. By considering special classes of hypergraphs, the above additionally has some interesting applications for ordinary graph coloring, such as:
  -graphs of chromatic number $C k t \log \log t$ contain $K_t$-minors with $k$-edge-connected branch-sets,
  -graphs of chromatic number $C q t \log \log t$ contain $K_t$-minors with modulo-$q$-connected branch sets,
  -by considering cycle hypergraphs of digraphs we recover known results on strong minors in digraphs of large dichromatic number as special cases.</description>

Abstract: Given any $n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$, we constructively prove the existence of covering paths and circuits in the plane which are characterized by the same link length of the minimum-link covering trails for the two-dimensional grid $G_n^2 := \{0,1, \ldots, n-1\} \times \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}$. Furthermore, we introduce a general algorithm that returns a covering cycle of analogous link length for any even value of $n$. Finally, we provide the tight upper bound $n^2 - 3 + 5 \cdot \sqrt{2}$ units for the minimum total distance travelled to visit all the nodes of $G_n^2$ with a minimum-link trail (i.e., a trail with $2 \cdot n - 2$ edges if $n$ is above two).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.09857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a natural unit interval order $P$, we describe proper colorings of the incomparability graph of $P$ in the language of heaps. We also introduce a combinatorial operation, called a \emph{local flip}, on the heaps. This operation defines an equivalence relation on the proper colorings, and the equivalence relation refines the ascent statistic introduced by Shareshian and Wachs.
  In addition, we define an analogue of noncommutative symmetric functions introduced by Fomin and Greene, with respect to $P$. We establish a duality between the chromatic quasisymmetric function of $P$ and these noncommutative symmetric functions. This duality leads us to positive expansions of the chromatic quasisymmetric functions into several symmetric function bases. In particular, we present some partial results for the $e$-positivity conjecture.</description>

      <title>Comparing list-color functions of hypergraphs with their chromatic polynomials (I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any $r$-uniform hypergraph ${\cal H}=(V,E)$, where $r\ge 3$, let $P({\cal H},k)$ and $P_l({\cal H},k)$ be its chromatic polynomial and list-color function respectively, and let $\tau'({\cal H})$ be the smallest positive integer $q$ such that $P({\cal H},k)=P_l({\cal H},k)$ holds for all $k\ge q$. Let $\gamma({\cal H})$ denote the maximum value of $\gamma_{e}({\cal H})$ over all edges $e$ in ${\cal H}$, where $\gamma_{e}({\cal H})$ is the number of edges $e'\in E$ such that $|e\cap e'|=r-1$. In this article, we show that if $2\le |E|\le 4$, then $\tau'({\cal H})\le |E|-1$; and if $|E|\ge 5$ and $\gamma({\cal H})\le 0.8(|E|-1)$, for any $k$-assignment $L$ of ${\cal H}$ with $k\ge 0.6(|E|-1)+0.5\gamma({\cal H})$, $P({\cal H},L)-P({\cal H},k)\ge 0.02 k^{|V|-r} \sum_{e\in E} (k-|\bigcap_{v\in e}L(v)|) $ holds, implying that $\tau'({\cal H})\le 0.6(|E|-1)+0.5\gamma({\cal H})\le |E|-1$ when $|E|\ge 5$ and $\gamma({\cal H})\le 0.8(|E|-1)$.</description>

      <title>The Power Domination Toolbox</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) are placed at strategic vertices in an electrical power network to monitor the flow of power. Determining the minimum number and optimal placement of PMUs is modeled by the graph theoretic process called Power Domination. This paper describes the Power Domination Toolbox (PDT), which efficiently identifies a minimum number of PMU locations that monitor the entire network. The PDT leverages graph theoretic literature to reduce the complexity of determining optimal PMU placements by: reducing the order of the graph (contraction), leveraging zero forcing forts, sorting the remaining solution space, and parallel computing. The PDT is a drop-in replacement of the current state-of-the-art exhaustive search algorithm in Python and maintains compatibility with SageMath. The PDT can identify minimum PMU placements for graphs with hundreds of vertices on personal computers and can analyze larger graphs on high performance computers. The PDT affords users the ability to investigate power domination on graphs previously considered infeasible due to the number of vertices resulting in a prohibitively long run-time.</description>

      <title>On 1-Konig-Egervary Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\alpha(G)$ denote the cardinality of a maximum independent set, while $\mu(G)$ be the size of a maximum matching in $G=\left( V,E\right) $. Let $\xi(G)$ denote the size of the intersection of all maximum independent sets. It is known that if $\alpha(G)+\mu(G)=n(G)=\left\vert V\right\vert $, then $G$ is a K\"{o}nig-Egerv\'{a}ry graph. If $\alpha(G)+\mu(G)=n(G) -1$, then $G$ is a $1$-K\"{o}nig-Egerv\'{a}ry graph. If $G$ is not a K\"{o}nig-Egerv\'{a}ry graph, and there exists a vertex $v\in V$ (an edge $e\in E$) such that $G-v$ ($G-e$) is K\"{o}nig-Egerv\'{a}ry, then $G$ is called a vertex (an edge) almost K\"{o}nig-Egerv\'{a}ry graph (respectively). The critical difference $d(G)$ is $\max\{d(I):I\in\mathrm{Ind}(G)\}$, where $\mathrm{Ind}(G)$ denotes the family of all independent sets of $G$. If $A\in\mathrm{Ind}(G)$ with $d\left( X\right) =d(G)$, then $A$ is a critical independent set. Let $diadem (G)=\bigcup\{S:S$ is a critical independent set in $G\}$, and $\varrho_{v}\left( G\right) $ denote the number of vertices $v\in V\left( G\right) $, such that $G-v$ is a K\"{o}nig-Egerv\'{a}ry graph.
  In this paper, we characterize all types of almost K\"{o}nig-Egerv\'{a}ry graphs and present interrelationships between them. We also show that if $G$ is a $1$-K\"{o}nig-Egerv\'{a}ry graph, then $\varrho_{v}\left( G\right) \leq n\left( G\right) +d\left( G\right) -\xi\left( G\right) -\beta(G)$, where $\beta(G)=\left\vert diadem(G)\right\vert $. As an application, we characterize the $1$-K\"{o}nig-Egerv\'{a}ry graphs that become K\"{o}nig-Egerv\'{a}ry after deleting any vertex.</description>

      <title>Counting Phylogenetic Networks with Few Reticulation Vertices: Galled and Reticulation-Visible Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give exact and asymptotic counting results for the number of galled networks and reticulation-visible networks with few reticulation vertices. Our results are obtained with the component graph method, which was introduced by L. Zhang and his coauthors, and generating function techniques. For galled networks, we in addition use analytic combinatorics. Moreover, in an appendix, we consider maximally reticulated reticulation-visible networks and derive their number, too.</description>

      <title>The augmented external activity complex of a matroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a matroid, we define a new simplicial complex whose facets are indexed by its independent sets. This complex contains the external activity complex as a subcomplex. We call our complex the augmented external activity complex since its definition is motivated by the recently defined augmented tautological classes of matroids. We prove that our complex is shellable and show that our shelling satisfies the stronger property of being an $H$-shelling. This explicates our result that the $h$-vector of our complex is the $f$-vector of the independence complex. We also define an augmented no broken circuit complex, which contains the usual no broken circuit complex as a subcomplex. We prove its shellability and show that our shelling is also an $H$-shelling. The $h$-vector of this complex is the $f$-vector of the no broken circuit complex.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that polynomial versions of theorems of R\"odl and Nikiforov, as conjectured by Fox and Sudakov and Nguyen, Scott and Seymour imply the classical Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal conjecture. In this note, we prove that these three conjectures are in fact equivalent, extending several previous particular results in this direction by Fox, Nguyen, Scott and Seymour; Nguyen, Scott and Seymour and Gishboliner and Shapira. We deduce that the family of string graphs satisfies the polynomial R\"odl conjecture. We also derive analogous results for hypergraphs, tournaments, ordered graphs, and colored graphs.</description>

      <title>Schubert puzzles and integrability II: multiplying motivic Segre classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.00563v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Schubert Puzzles and Integrability I we proved several "puzzle rules" for computing products of Schubert classes in K-theory (and sometimes equivariant K-theory) of d-step flag varieties. The principal tool was "quantum integrability", in several variants of the Yang--Baxter equation; this let us recognize the Schubert structure constants as q-&gt;0 limits of certain matrix entries in products of R- (and other) matrices of quantized affine algebra representations. In the present work we give direct cohomological interpretations of those same matrix entries but at finite q: they compute products of "motivic Segre classes", closely related to K-theoretic Maulik--Okounkov stable classes living on the cotangent bundles of the flag varieties. Without q-&gt;0, we avoid some divergences that blocked fuller understanding of d=3,4. The puzzle computations are then explained (in cohomology onlyin this work, not K-theory) in terms of Lagrangian convolutions between Nakajima quiver varieties. More specifically, the conormal bundle to the diagonal inclusion of a flag variety factors through a quiver variety that is not a cotangent bundle, and it is on that intermediate quiver variety that the R-matrix calculation occurs.</description>

      <title>Limit shape for regularisation of large partitions under the Plancherel measure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A celebrated result of Kerov-Vershik and Logan-Shepp gives an asymptotic shape for large partitions under the Plancherel measure. We prove that when we consider $e$-regularisations of such partitions we still have a convex limit shape, which is given by a shaking of the Kerov-Vershik-Logan-Shepp curve. We deduce an explicit form for the first asymptotics of the length of the first rows and the first columns for the $e$-regularisation.</description>

      <title>List homomorphisms to separable signed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The complexity of the list homomorphism problem for signed graphs appears difficult to classify. Existing results focus on special classes of signed graphs, such as trees and reflexive signed graphs. Irreflexive signed graphs are in a certain sense the heart of the problem, as noted by a recent paper of Kim and Siggers. We focus on a special class of irreflexive signed graphs, namely those in which the unicoloured edges form a spanning path or cycle, which we call separable signed graphs. We classify the complexity of list homomorphisms to these separable signed graphs; we believe that these signed graphs will play an important role for the general resolution of the irreflexive case. We also relate our results to a conjecture of Kim and Siggers concerning the special case of semi-balanced irreflexive signed graphs; we have proved the conjecture in another paper, and the present results add structural information to that topic.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic estimates of the diameters of the Rubik's Cube groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07337v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diameter of the Cayley graph of the Rubik's Cube group is the fewest number of turns needed to solve the Cube from any initial configurations. For the 2$\times$2$\times$2 Cube, the diameter is 11 in the half-turn metric, 14 in the quarter-turn metric, 19 in the semi-quarter-turn metric, and 10 in the bi-quarter-turn metric. For the 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cube, the diameter was determined by Rokicki et al. to be 20 in the half-turn metric and 26 in the quarter-turn metric. This study shows that a modified version of the coupon collector's problem in probabilistic theory can predict the diameters correctly for both 2$\times$2$\times$2 and 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cubes insofar as the quarter-turn metric is adopted. In the half-turn metric, the diameters are overestimated by one and two, respectively, for the 2$\times$2$\times$2 and 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cubes, whereas for the 2$\times$2$\times$2 Cube in the semi-quarter-turn and bi-quarter-turn metrics, they are overestimated by two and underestimated by one, respectively. Invoking the same probabilistic logic, the diameters of the 4$\times$4$\times$4 and 5$\times$5$\times$5 Cubes are predicted to be 48 (41) and 68 (58) in the quarter-turn (half-turn) metric, whose precise determinations are far beyond reach of classical supercomputing. It is shown that the probabilistically estimated diameter is approximated by $\ln N / \ln r + \ln N / r$, where $N$ is the number of configurations and $r$ is the branching ratio.</description>

      <title>Infinite unrestricted sumsets of the form $B+B$ in sets with large density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a set $A \subset \mathbb{N}$ we characterize in terms of its density when there exists an infinite set $B \subset \mathbb{N}$ and $t \in \{0,1\}$ such that $B+B \subset A-t$, where $B+B : =\{b_1+b_2\colon b_1,b_2 \in B\}$. Specifically, when the lower density $\underline{d}(A) &gt;1/2$ or the upper density $\overline{d}(A)&gt; 3/4$, the existence of such a set $B\subset \mathbb{N}$ and $t\in \{0,1\}$ is assured. Furthermore, whenever $\underline{d}(A) &gt; 3/4$ or $\overline{d}(A)&gt;5/6$, we show that the shift $t$ is unnecessary and we also provide examples to show that these bounds are sharp. Finally, we construct a syndetic three-coloring of the natural numbers that does not contain a monochromatic $B+B+t$ for any infinite set $B \subset \mathbb{N}$ and number $t \in \mathbb{N}$.</description>
