      <title>Search for Charged Lepton Flavor Violation at BESIII</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV) is forbidden in the Standard Model but predicted by many new physics models. We present searches for CLFV in charmonium decays using world-leading datasets collected by the BESIII detector. The processes $J/\psi\to e\tau$, $J/\psi\to e\mu$, and $\psi(3686)\to e\mu$ are investigated using world-leading $J/\psi$ and $\psi(3686)$ dataset collected by BESIII. No significant signals are observed, and upper limits on branching fractions are set at $\mathcal{B}(J/\psi\to e\tau)&lt;7.5\times10^{-8}$, $\mathcal{B}(J/\psi\to e\mu)&lt;4.5\times10^{-9}$, and $\mathcal{B}(\psi(3686)\to e\mu)&lt;1.4\times10^{-8}$ at 90\% confidence level. These results provide constraints on Wilson coefficients in effective field theory and probe new physics at high energy scales.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter emission at Belle II and NA62 in Minimal Flavor Violation framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minimal Flavor Violation (MFV) provides a compelling framework for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model, in which new QCD-singlet fields transforming under the global $\mathrm{SU}(3)^3$ quark flavor symmetry can naturally be stable and act as dark matter (DM) candidates. We show that the DM-MFV framework naturally accommodates the excess in either $K^+ \to \pi^+ \nu \bar{\nu}$ or $B^+ \to K^+ \nu \bar{\nu}$, while a unified explanation of both channels simultaneously cannot be achieved within a minimal setup containing only a single dark matter multiplet with nearly degenerate masses. Overall, our findings underscore the intricate interplay between MFV-based model building, flavored dark matter scenarios, and precision flavor experiments, highlighting flavored dark matter as a framework that is both theoretically robust and experimentally testable.</description>

      <title>Towards a Self-Driving Trigger at the LHC: Adaptive Response in Real Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time data filtering and selection -- or trigger -- systems at high-throughput scientific facilities such as the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) must process extremely high-rate data streams under stringent bandwidth, latency, and storage constraints. Yet these systems are typically designed as static, hand-tuned menus of selection criteria grounded in prior knowledge and simulation. In this work, we further explore the concept of a self-driving trigger, an autonomous data-filtering framework that reallocates resources and adjusts thresholds dynamically in real-time to optimize signal efficiency, rate stability, and computational cost as instrumentation and environmental conditions evolve. We introduce a benchmark ecosystem to emulate realistic collider scenarios and demonstrate real-time optimization of a menu including canonical energy sum triggers as well as modern anomaly-detection algorithms that target non-standard event topologies using machine learning. Using simulated data streams and publicly available collision data from the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, we demonstrate the capability to dynamically and automatically optimize trigger performance under specific cost objectives without manual retuning. Our adaptive strategy shifts trigger design from static menus with heuristic tuning to intelligent, automated, data-driven control, unlocking greater flexibility and discovery potential in future high-energy physics analyses.</description>

      <title>Hybrid-Contact Planar HPGe Process Vehicle Toward Ring-Contact Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare-event searches including dark matter, coherent elastic neutrino--nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS), and neutrinoless double-beta decay (0$\nu\beta\beta$) require high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors with ultralow noise, stable backgrounds, and electrode geometries that can scale to larger single-crystal masses. Ring-contact (ring-and-groove) designs address scalability by shaping the electric field to preserve low-capacitance readout, but their nonplanar topology motivates a lithium-contact process that is compatible with conformal deposition and robust high-voltage operation. As a process demonstration toward future ring-contact prototypes, we fabricate and characterize a hybrid-contact planar HPGe device, KL01. Here, ``hybrid'' denotes an $n^{+}$ contact formed by an in-house lithium-suspension paint followed by controlled thermal diffusion, combined with an AJA-developed a-Ge/Al $p^{+}$ contact and a-Ge sidewall passivation. At 77~K the device exhibits pA-scale leakage current under kV bias, a depletion plateau near $V_{\mathrm{dep}}\approx 1300$~V, and energy resolutions of 1.57~keV FWHM at 59.5~keV and 2.57~keV FWHM at 662~keV. These results validate the compatibility of the paint-and-diffuse lithium process with thin-film a-Ge/Al contacts and establish a practical fabrication workflow to be extended to ring-and-groove electrodes for next-generation rare-event HPGe modules.</description>

      <title>Searching for Quirks at LHCb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quirks are heavy particles connected by a flux tube from a hidden confining force that remain weakly constrained in large regions of their parameter space. This flux tube acts as a string that, at short enough distance, stretches as the quirk pair separates, then pulls the pair back together leading to interesting dynamics. We propose a novel search using the LHCb Vertex Locator (VELO), whose forward geometry and software-based trigger are uniquely suited to detecting the characteristic back-to-back, planar hit patterns produced by quirk pairs with little transverse recoil. Using detailed simulations of the VELO geometry, together with simple geometric selections, we present different sensitivity projections, demonstrating that LHCb can probe parameter regions inaccessible to existing ATLAS and CMS searches and offering a powerful, complementary path toward discovering quirks.</description>

      <title>Comments on Baryon Transition Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss in rather general terms the properties of space-like baryon transition form factors. In particular, we argue why these are necessarily complex-valued, what can be deduced from the respective phase motion and why dealing with real valued transition form factors in general leads to misleading results. For illustration the transition form factors for the Roper resonance as derived in the J\"ulich-Bonn-Washington framework are discussed.</description>

      <title>Near-threshold photon-proton production of $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the near-threshold exclusive photoproduction of heavy vector mesons (quarkonia $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$) off the proton within the framework of generalized parton distribution (GPD) factorization. The gluon GPDs are computed using a spectator model in which the proton emits a gluon and the remaining constituents are treated as a single spectator particle. Model parameters are determined by fitting the gluon unpolarized and helicity collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs) from global analyses. We compare our results with the latest near-threshold $J/\psi$ production data from the GlueX and $J/\psi$-007 experiments at Jefferson Laboratory, finding good agreement for both differential and total cross sections. Predictions are also provided for $\Upsilon$ photoproduction, which can be tested at future Electron-Ion Colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ePIC collaboration is developing a multidetector system to explore the fundamental properties of the strong interaction at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), to be built at Brookhaven National Laboratory. A key component of the ePIC detector is the Silicon Vertex Tracker (SVT), which provides high-precision tracking and microvertex reconstruction. The SVT consists of the Inner Barrel (IB), the Outer Barrel (OB), and the Forward/Backward Disks, all based on Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) that combine high granularity, low power consumption, and minimal material budget. This paper presents a concise overview of the SVT design and its development status.</description>

      <title>SMEFT effects on spin correlations and entanglement at NLO QCD in di-boson production at hadron colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform for the first time a full study of spin correlations in inclusive WZ production at the LHC with leptonic decays in the presence of NLO QCD corrections and of effects from a dimension-six operator in the SMEFT modifying the electroweak triple-gauge coupling. We carry out the complete quantum-state tomography of the di-boson system and relate its results to common purity and spin-entanglement markers, highlighting the sizeable impact of both QCD corrections and SMEFT insertions. Additionally, we show how a naive truncation at dimension-six in the SMEFT expansion of the spin-density matrix can lead to a cumbersome spin interpretation of the quantum-tomography results.</description>

      <title>Quantum properties of heavy-fermion pairs at a lepton collider with polarised beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum properties of heavy-fermion pairs, such as $t\bar t$ or $\tau^+\tau^-$, produced in lepton-lepton collisions with polarised beams. Focusing on spin correlations, entanglement, Bell-inequality violation, and quantum-information--theoretic measures such as purity and magic, we analyse how beam polarisation shapes the structure of the spin-density matrix. We derive analytic expressions for a wide range of helicity configurations, including both Standard Model contributions and generic new-physics effects parametrised by scalar, vector, and tensor four-fermion operators within an effective field theory framework. We show that beam polarisation unlocks a substantially richer set of spin configurations and significantly enhances sensitivity to non-standard interactions. As a phenomenological application, we study $t\bar t$ production at a future linear collider and demonstrate that quantum observables provide a comprehensive and complementary probe of top-quark interactions and stronger constraints on the scale of new physics.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Spectroscopy of $^{173}$Yb$^{+}$ Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compared to other stable isotopes of $\rm{Yb}^+$, $^{173}\rm{Yb}^+$ has a richer hyperfine structure, which leads to more favorable clock transitions, spectroscopic techniques for probing new physics, and more sophisticated quantum computing architectures. However, to date, its electronic spectrum remains poorly characterized. Here, we report on efficient laser cooling, state preparation, and detection of a single trapped $^{173}\rm{Yb}^+$ ion. The previously unobserved $^2\!S_{1/2} \rightarrow {}^2\!D_{3/2}$ electric quadrupole transition at 436 nm is coherently excited, and the isotope shift between $^{171}\rm{Yb}^+$ and $^{173}\rm{Yb}^+$ on this transition is determined with an uncertainty of 1.4 Hz. Using microwave spectroscopy, we resolve the hyperfine structure (HFS) of the ${}^2\!D_{3/2}$ state with a relative uncertainty below $10^{-8}$. From the HFS measurement data, we infer for ${}^{173}$Yb a nuclear magnetic octupole moment $\Omega = -0.062(8)\,({\rm b} \times \mu_N)$ with uncertainty reduced by more than 2 orders of magnitude compared to previous studies. The data also allow us to determine hyperfine anomalies for the ${}^2\!S_{1/2}$ and ${}^2\!D_{3/2}$ states.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the inclusive W and Z boson production cross sections and their ratios in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurements are presented of the W and Z boson production cross sections in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13.6 TeV. Data collected in 2022 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.01 fb$^{-1}$ with one or two identified muons in the final state are analyzed. The results for the products of total inclusive cross sections and branching fractions for muonic decays of W and Z bosons are 11.93 $\pm$ 0.08 (syst) $\pm$ 0.17 (lumi) $^{+0.07}_{-0.07}$ (acceptance) nb for W$^+$ boson production, 8.86 $\pm$ 0.06 (syst) $\pm$ 0.12 (lumi) $^{+0.05}_{-0.06}$ (acceptance) nb for W$^-$ boson production, and 2.021 $\pm$ 0.009 (syst) $\pm$ 0.028 (lumi) $^{+0.011}_{-0.013}$ (acceptance) nb for the Z boson production in the dimuon mass range of 60$-$120 GeV, all with negligible statistical uncertainties. Furthermore, the corresponding fiducial cross sections, as well as cross section ratios for both fiducial and total phase space, are provided. The ratios include charge-separated results for W boson production (W$^+$ and W$^-$) and the sum of the two contributions (W$^\pm$), each relative to the measured Z boson production cross section. Additionally, the ratio of the measured cross sections for W$^+$ and W$^-$ boson production is reported. All measurements are in agreement with theoretical predictions, calculated at next-to-next-to-leading order accuracy in quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A search for $t$-channel exchange of leptoquarks (LQs) is performed in dimuon and dielectron spectra using proton-proton collision data collected at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. Eight scenarios are considered, in which up or down quarks couple to muons or electrons via a scalar or vector LQ exchange, for dilepton invariant masses above 500 GeV. The LQ masses are probed up to 5 TeV, beyond a regime probed by previous pair-production and single-production searches. The differential distributions of dilepton events are fit to templates that model the nonresonant LQ exchange and various standard model background processes. Limits are set on LQ-fermion coupling strengths for scalar and vector LQ masses in the 1$-$5 TeV range at 95% confidence level, establishing stringent limits on first- and second-generation LQs.</description>

      <title>Towards replacing detector simulation with heterogeneous GNNs in flavour physics analyses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driven by the increasing volume of recorded data, the demand for simulation from experiments based at the Large Hadron Collider will rise sharply in the coming years. Addressing this demand solely with existing computationally intensive workflows is not feasible. This paper introduces a new fast simulation tool designed to address this demand at the LHCb experiment. This tool emulates the detector response to arbitrary multibody decay topologies at LHCb. Rather than memorising specific decay channels, the model learns generalisable patterns within the response, allowing it to interpolate to channels not present in the training data. Novel heterogeneous graph neural network architectures are employed that are designed to embed the physical characteristics of the task directly into the network structure. We demonstrate the performance of the tool across a range of decay topologies, showing the networks can correctly model the relationships between complex variables. The architectures and methods presented are generic and could readily be adapted to emulate workflows at other simulation-intensive particle physics experiments.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Integration for Knowledge Retrieval and Interaction for the DUNE Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a next-generation neutrino experiment that will generate an unprecedented volume of heterogeneous information-from documentation and technical notes to experimental data and reconstruction pipelines. Efficient knowledge retrieval and contextual understanding are increasingly critical for collaboration-wide productivity and onboarding. In this work, we present DUNE-GPT, a prototype framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enable natural-language querying of DUNE's internal documentation and technical resources. The system provides an intelligent interface for DUNE collaborators to interact with experiment-specific knowledge while maintaining data privacy and infrastructure compliance within Fermilab computing resources.</description>

      <title>Deeply virtual $\phi$-meson production near threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12343v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss exclusive $\phi$-meson electroproduction off the proton near threshold within the GPD factorization framework. We propose the `threshold approximation' in which only the leading term of the conformal partial wave expansion of the meson production amplitudes is kept in both the quark and gluon exchange channels. We test the validity of this approximation to next-to-leading order in QCD and demonstrate the strong sensitivity of the cross section to the gluon and strangeness gravitational form factors. We also perform realistic event generator simulations both for Jefferson Lab and EIC kinematics and demonstrate the capabilities of future facilities for measuring near-threshold $\phi$ electroproduction.</description>

      <title>Muon tracking in a LiquidO opaque scintillator detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LiquidO is an innovative radiation detector concept. The core idea is to exploit stochastic light confinement in a highly scattering medium to self-segment the detector volume. In this paper, we demonstrate event-by-event muon tracking in a LiquidO opaque scintillator detector prototype. The detector consists of a 30 mm cubic scintillator volume instrumented with 64 wavelength-shifting fibres arranged in an 8$\times$8 grid with a 3.2 mm pitch and read out by silicon photomultipliers. A wax-based opaque scintillator with a scattering length of approximately 0.5 mm is used. The tracking performance of this LiquidO detector is characterised with cosmic-ray muons and the position resolution is demonstrated to be 450 $\mu$m per row of fibres. These results highlight the potential of LiquidO opaque scintillator detectors to achieve fine spatial resolution, enabling precise particle tracking and imaging.</description>

      <title>Probing the Parameter Space of Axion-Like Particles Using Simulation-Based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs), hypothetical pseudoscalar particles that couple to photons, are among the most actively investigated candidates for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Their interaction with gamma rays in the presence of astrophysical magnetic fields can leave characteristic, energy-dependent modulations in observed spectra. Capturing such subtle features requires precise statistical inference, but standard likelihood-based methods often fall short when faced with complex models, large number of nuisance parameters and limited analytical tractability. In this work, we investigate the application of simulation-based inference (SBI), specifically Truncated Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (TMNRE), to constrain ALP parameters using simulated observations from the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). We model the gamma-ray emission from the active galactic nucleus NGC 1275, accounting for photon-ALP mixing, extragalactic background light (EBL) absorption, and the full CTAO instrument response. Leveraging the Swyft framework, we infer posteriors for the ALP mass and coupling strength and demonstrate its potential to extract meaningful constraints on ALPs from future real gamma-ray data with CTAO.</description>

      <title>Towards High-Efficiency Particle Detection Using Superconducting Microwire Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of an 8-channel $1\times1$ mm$^{2}$ WSi superconducting microwire single photon detector (SMSPD) array exposed to 120 GeV hadron beam and 120 GeV muon beam at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron H6 beamline. Following up on our first detailed characterization of the efficiency and response of an SMSPD fabricated on a 3 nm WSi film, we report measurements of enhanced particle detection efficiency using a sensor fabricated from a thicker 4.7nm-thick WSi film. We also report the first SMSPD detection efficiency measurement made for muons. Measurements are enabled by a silicon tracking telescope providing 10 $\mu$m in-situ spatial resolution. The results show a fill factor-normalized detection efficiency of 75% and a time resolution of about 130 ps across pixels. These findings represent a significant advancement toward developing high-efficiency SMSPD charged particle tracking systems with simultaneous precision timing, with potential applications in future accelerator-based experiments such as the FCC-ee and Muon Collider.</description>

      <title>Development &amp; Characterization of Electrodes for large-scale Xenon Time Projection Chambers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dual-phase liquid xenon time projection chambers are the core detector elements of many experiments that conduct searches for Dark Matter and rare events, as well as in neutrino and high-energy physics. As part of this detector technology, high-voltage electrodes are instrumental for the generation of observable signals and their physical interpretation. Thus, electrode design and manufacturing has to fulfill stringent requirements, and their production is associated with significant engineering challenges. In this work we describe the successful development of electrodes on the 1.5 m-scale, from their design and simulation to subsequent assembly and high-voltage testing in a gaseous argon environment. The produced electrodes were recently installed as an anode and a cathode during an upgrade to the XENONnT experiment.</description>

      <title>Insights into Meson and Baryon Structure using Continuum Schwinger Function Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The bulk of visible mass is supposed to emerge from nonperturbative dynamics within quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Following years of development and refinement, continuum and lattice Schwinger function methods have recently joined in revealing the three pillars that support this emergent hadron mass (EHM); namely, a nonzero gluon mass-scale, a process-independent effective charge, and dressed-quarks with running masses that take constituent-like values at infrared momenta. One may argue that EHM and confinement are inextricably linked; and theory is now working to expose their manifold expressions in hadron observables and highlight the types of measurements that can be made in order to validate the paradigm. This contribution sketches these ideas via the unified explanation of pion and proton electromagnetic and gravitational form factors.</description>

      <title>Decoding the Amplitude Pair with Distinct CPV Phases in Charmed Baryon Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we propose a strategy to extract information on the hierarchical amplitude pair in singly Cabibbo-suppressed (SCS) charmed baryon two-body decays, with a dominant amplitude proportional to $\lambda_s = V_{cs}^* V_{us}$ from tree operators and sub-leading one proportional to $\lambda_b = V_{cb}^* V_{ub}$ from both penguin and tree contributions. The coexistence of these two amplitudes is essential for generating nonzero CP violation (CPV) effects. Since the $\lambda_b$ amplitude is strongly suppressed, its experimental determination is highly challenging. However, by exploiting SU(3) flavor symmetry, which relates the well-measured Cabibbo-favored (CF) amplitudes to the SCS tree amplitudes, information on the $\lambda_b$ amplitude can be extracted. Using current experimental data, a conservative analysis yields $\lambda_b$ amplitudes can be as large as about $10\%$ of the corresponding tree amplitudes with a significance of $2.1\sigma$. In addition, the Lee-Yang parameters of these decays provide an independent probe of this elusive term. We further identify two golden decay channels, $\Xi_c^0 \to p K^-$ and $\Xi_c^0 \to \Sigma^+ \pi^-$, which are particularly well suited for experimental studies of CPV.</description>
