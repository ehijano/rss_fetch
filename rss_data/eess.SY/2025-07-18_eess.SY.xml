      <title>Model Predictive Black Start for Dynamic Formation of DER-Led Microgrids with Inrush Current Impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black start (BS) of the distribution system (DS) with high penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) requires advanced control frameworks to ensure secure and efficient restoration. This paper proposes a model predictive black start (MPBS) framework incorporating an inrush current feasibility module to dynamically generate real-time feasible and optimal restoration sequences. Short-term forecasts of DER output and transmission grid (TG) availability are utilized to construct adaptive cranking paths. The inrush current feasibility module analytically estimates the transient inrush current caused by energizing no-load distribution transformers (DTs). To mitigate excessive inrush current and avoid potential misoperations of protection devices, an emergency operation-inspired voltage control strategy and a switch blocking mechanism are developed. The proposed inrush model is validated against electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations in PowerFactory with estimation accuracies exceeding 90 %. Case studies on a modified IEEE 123-node feeder demonstrate that the MPBS framework prevents misoperations of fuses and reclosers, reduces unnecessary DER energy consumption, and enhances load restoration efficiency during DER-led BS processes.</description>

      <title>Deep Bilinear Koopman Model for Real-Time Vehicle Control in Frenet Frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling and control of autonomous vehicles remain a fundamental challenge due to the nonlinear and coupled nature of vehicle dynamics. While Koopman operator theory offers a framework for deploying powerful linear control techniques, learning a finite-dimensional invariant subspace for high-fidelity modeling continues to be an open problem. This paper presents a deep Koopman approach for modeling and control of vehicle dynamics within the curvilinear Frenet frame. The proposed framework uses a deep neural network architecture to simultaneously learn the Koopman operator and its associated invariant subspace from the data. Input-state bilinear interactions are captured by the algorithm while preserving convexity, which makes it suitable for real-time model predictive control (MPC) application. A multi-step prediction loss is utilized during training to ensure long-horizon prediction capability. To further enhance real-time trajectory tracking performance, the model is integrated with a cumulative error regulator (CER) module, which compensates for model mismatch by mitigating accumulated prediction errors. Closed-loop performance is evaluated through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments using a CarSim RT model as the target plant, with real-time validation conducted on a dSPACE SCALEXIO system. The proposed controller achieved significant reductions in tracking error relative to baseline controllers, confirming its suitability for real-time implementation in embedded autonomous vehicle systems.</description>

      <title>Joint Price and Power MPC for Peak Power Reduction at Workplace EV Charging Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demand charge often constitutes a significant portion of electricity costs for commercial electric vehicle charging station operators. This paper explores control methods to reduce peak power consumption at workplace EV charging stations in a joint price and power optimization framework. We optimize a menu of price options to incentivize users to select controllable charging service. Using this framework, we propose several solutions to achieve a reduction in both demand charge and overall operator costs. Through a Monte Carlo simulation, we find that model predictive control using a time series forecast can significantly reduce station operator costs.</description>

      <title>A Stackelberg Game of Demand Response from the Aggregator's Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate on the modeling of demand response activities between the single aggregator and multiple participating consumers. The model incorporates the bilevel structure that naturally occurs in the information structure and decision sequence, where the aggregator assumes the role of a leader and the participating consumers play the role of followers. The proposed model is demonstrated to be effective in load control, helping the aggregator to meet the target reduction while the consumers pay cheaper electricity bill.</description>

      <title>On the Properties of Optimal-Decay Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control barrier functions provide a powerful means for synthesizing safety filters that ensure safety framed as forward set invariance. Key to CBFs' effectiveness is the simple inequality on the system dynamics: $\dot{h} \geq - \alpha(h)$. Yet determining the class $\mathcal{K}^e$ function $\alpha$ is a user defined choice that can have a dramatic effect on the resulting system behavior. This paper formalizes the process of choosing $\alpha$ using optimal-decay control barrier functions (OD-CBFs). These modify the traditional CBF inequality to: $\dot{h} \geq - \omega \alpha(h)$, where $\omega \geq 0$ is automatically determined by the safety filter. A comprehensive characterization of this framework is elaborated, including tractable conditions on OD-CBF validity, control invariance of the underlying sets in the state space, forward invariance conditions for safe sets, and discussion on optimization-based safe controllers in terms of their feasibility, Lipschitz continuity, and closed-form expressions. The framework also extends existing higher-order CBF techniques, addressing safety constraints with vanishing relative degrees. The proposed method is demonstrated on a satellite control problem in simulation.</description>

      <title>Invariance Guarantees using Continuously Parametrized Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing a control invariant set with an appropriate shape that fits within a given state constraint is a fundamental problem in safety-critical control but is known to be difficult, especially for large or complex spaces. This paper introduces a safe control framework of utilizing PCBF: continuously parametrized control barrier functions (CBFs). In PCBF, each choice of parameter corresponds to a control invariant set of relatively simple shape. Invariance-preserving control is done by dynamically selecting a parameter whose corresponding invariant set lies within the safety bound. This eliminates the need for synthesizing a single complex CBF that matches the entire free space. It also enables easier adaptation to diverse environments. By assigning a differentiable dynamics on the parameter space, we derive a lightweight feedback controller based on quadratic programming (QP), namely PCBF-QP. We also discuss on how to build a valid PCBF for a class of systems and how to constrain the parameter so that the invariant set does not exceed the safety bound. The concept is also extended to cover continuously parametrized high-order CBFs, which is called high-order PCBF. Finally, simulation experiments are conducted to validate the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Latency-Optimal File Assignment in Geo-Distributed Storage with Preferential Demands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of data storage in a geographically distributed (or geo-distributed) network of servers (or nodes) where inter-node communication incurs certain round-trip delays. Every node serves a set of users who can request any file in the network. If the requested file is not available at the node, it communicates with other nodes to obtain the file, thus causing the user to experience latency in obtaining the file. The files can be placed uncoded, where each node stores exact copies of the files, or in coded fashion, where certain linear combination of files are placed at each node. We aim to obtain an optimal file placement on the nodes with respect to minimizing the worst-case latency at each node, as well as the system-average latency. The prior literature considered the case of equiprobable file demands at the nodes. In this paper, we investigate the generic case of non-uniform file-demand probabilities at each node. The scheme presented here is optimal within the family of uncoded schemes. It is obtained first by modeling the worst-case latency constraint as a vertex coloring problem, and then converting the system-average latency optimization to a problem of balanced-assignment.</description>

      <title>Guaranteeing and Explaining Stability across Heterogeneous Load Balancing using Calculus Network Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Load balancing between base stations (BSs) allows BS capacity to be efficiently utilised and avoid outages. Currently, data-driven mechanisms strive to balance inter-BS load and reduce unnecessary handovers. The challenge is that over a large number of BSs, networks observe an oscillatory effect of load evolution that causes high inter-BS messaging. Without a calculus function that integrates network topology to describe the evolution of load states, current data-driven algorithms cannot explain the oscillation phenomenon observed in load states, nor can they provide theoretical guarantees on the stability of the ideal synchronised state. Whilst we know load state oscillation is coupled with the load balancing process algorithms and the topology structure of inter-BS boundary relations, we do not have a theoretical framework to prove this and a pathway to improving load balancing algorithms. Here, we abstract generic and heterogeneous data-driven algorithms into a calculus dynamics space, so that we can establish the synchronization conditions for networked load balancing dynamics with any network topology. By incorporating what is known as "non-conservative error" and the eigenvalue spectrum of the networked dynamics, we can adjust the inter-BS load balancing mechanisms to achieve high efficiency and convergence guarantee, or to mitigate the oscillation when the synchronisation condition cannot be satisfied.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Cost-Aware Defense of Parallel Server Systems against Malicious Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the cyber-physical security of parallel server systems, which is relevant for a variety of engineering applications such as networking, manufacturing, and transportation. These systems rely on feedback control and may thus be vulnerable to malicious attacks such as denial-of-service, data falsification, and instruction manipulations. In this paper, we develop a learning algorithm that computes a defensive strategy to balance technological cost for defensive actions and performance degradation due to cyber attacks as mentioned above. We consider a zero-sum Markov security game. We develop an approximate minimax-Q learning algorithm that efficiently computes the equilibrium of the game, and thus a cost-aware defensive strategy. The algorithm uses interpretable linear function approximation tailored to the system structure. We show that, under mild assumptions, the algorithm converges with probability one to an approximate Markov perfect equilibrium. We first use a Lyapunov method to address the unbounded temporal-difference error due to the unbounded state space. We then use an ordinary differential equation-based argument to establish convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm converges about 50 times faster than a representative neural network-based method, with an insignificant optimality gap between 4\%--8\%, depending on the complexity of the linear approximator and the number of parallel servers.</description>

      <title>Fractional-order controller tuning via minimization of integral of time-weighted absolute error without multiple closed-loop tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a non-iterative tuning technique for a linear fractional-order (FO) controller, based on the integral of the time-weighted absolute error (ITAE) criterion. Minimizing the ITAE is a traditional approach for tuning FO controllers. This technique reduces the over/undershoot and suppresses the steady-state error. In contrast to conventional approaches of ITAE-based controller tuning, the proposed approach does not require multiple closed-loop experiments or model-based simulations to evaluate the ITAE. The one-shot input/output data is collected from the controlled plant. A fictitious reference signal is defined on the basis of the collected input and output signal, which enables us to evaluate the closed-loop response provided by the arbitrary controller parameters. To avoid repeated experiments that are necessary in the conventional approach, we reformulate the ITAE minimization problem using the fictitious reference signal. The desired FO controller parameters minimizing the ITAE are obtained by solving the optimization problem that is based on the fictitious reference signal. The validity of the proposed approach is demonstrated by a numerical study. The avoidance of repeated experiments significantly reduces the development cost of linear FO controllers, thereby facilitating their practical application.</description>

      <title>Vertical Vibration Reduction of Maglev Vehicles using Nonlinear MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) strategy for high-speed Maglev vehicles that explicitly incorporates mechanical suspension dynamics into the control model. Unlike conventional approaches, which often neglect the interaction between levitation magnet and car body motion, the proposed method enables predictive vibration mitigation by modeling both electromagnetic forces and suspension behavior. This integrated approach significantly improves passenger comfort and ride quality by reducing vertical oscillations caused by track irregularities. Moreover, it allows for a more effective tuning of the trade-off between precise air gap tracking and ride comfort. Simulations based on a detailed multibody model of the Transrapid demonstrate that the method outperforms existing controllers in vibration suppression, making it a promising solution for future high-speed Maglev applications.</description>

      <title>Dual LiDAR-Based Traffic Movement Count Estimation at a Signalized Intersection: Deployment, Data Collection, and Preliminary Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic Movement Count (TMC) at intersections is crucial for optimizing signal timings, assessing the performance of existing traffic control measures, and proposing efficient lane configurations to minimize delays, reduce congestion, and promote safety. Traditionally, methods such as manual counting, loop detectors, pneumatic road tubes, and camera-based recognition have been used for TMC estimation. Although generally reliable, camera-based TMC estimation is prone to inaccuracies under poor lighting conditions during harsh weather and nighttime. In contrast, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology is gaining popularity in recent times due to reduced costs and its expanding use in 3D object detection, tracking, and related applications. This paper presents the authors' endeavor to develop, deploy and evaluate a dual-LiDAR system at an intersection in the city of Rialto, California, for TMC estimation. The 3D bounding box detections from the two LiDARs are used to classify vehicle counts based on traffic directions, vehicle movements, and vehicle classes. This work discusses the estimated TMC results and provides insights into the observed trends and irregularities. Potential improvements are also discussed that could enhance not only TMC estimation, but also trajectory forecasting and intent prediction at intersections.</description>

      <title>QTCAJOSA: Low-Complexity Joint Offloading and Subchannel Allocation for NTN-Enabled IoMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the resource allocation problem for task offloading from Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices, to a non-terrestrial network. The architecture considers clusters of IoMT devices that offload their tasks to a dedicated unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) serving as a multi-access edge computing (MEC) server, which can compute the task or further offload it to an available high-altitude platform station (HAPS) or to a low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite for remote computing. We formulate a problem that has as objective the minimization of the weighted sum delay of the tasks. Given the non-convex nature of the problem, and acknowledging that the complexity of the optimization algorithms impact their performance, we derive a low-complexity joint subchannel allocation and offloading decision algorithm with dynamic computing resource initialization, developed as a greedy heuristic based on convex optimization criteria. Simulations show the gain obtained by including the different non-terrestrial nodes against architectures without them.</description>

      <title>Transient-Stability-Aware Frequency Provision in IBR-Rich Grids via Information Gap Decision Theory and Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework to address the critical loss of transient stability caused by reduced inertia in grids with high inverter-based resource (IBR) penetration. The proposed method integrates a predictive deep learning (DL) model with information gap decision theory (IGDT) to create a risk-averse dispatch strategy. By reformulating the conventional virtual inertia scheduling (VIS) problem, the framework uses early predictions of post-fault dynamics to proactively redispatch resources, ensuring the system's center of inertia remains stable under worst-case contingencies. Validated on the IEEE 39-bus system with 70% IBR penetration, the proposed approach prevents system collapse where a conventional VIS strategy fails, ensuring frequency stability at a cost increase of only 5%.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Fusion for Multi-Sensor Systems Under Multiple Packet Dropouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are critical components in modern cyber-physical systems, enabling efficient data collection and fusion through spatially distributed sensors. However, the inherent risks of eavesdropping and packet dropouts in such networks pose significant challenges to secure state estimation. In this paper, we address the privacy-preserving fusion estimation (PPFE) problem for multi-sensor systems under multiple packet dropouts and eavesdropping attacks. To mitigate these issues, we propose a distributed encoding-based privacy-preserving mechanism (PPM) within a control-theoretic framework, ensuring data privacy during transmission while maintaining the performance of legitimate state estimation. A centralized fusion filter is developed, accounting for the coupling effects of packet dropouts and the encoding-based PPM. Boundedness conditions for the legitimate user's estimation error covariance are derived via a modified algebraic Riccati equation. Additionally, by demonstrating the divergence of the eavesdropper's mean estimation error, the proposed PPFE algorithm's data confidentiality is rigorously analyzed. Simulation results for an Internet-based three-tank system validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, highlighting its potential to enhance privacy without compromising estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Real-time control of a magnetohydrodynamic flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the feedback control of a weakly conducting magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow via Lorentz forces generated by externally applied electric and magnetic fields. Specifically, we steer the flow of an electrolyte toward prescribed velocity or vorticity patterns using arrays of electrodes and electromagnets positioned around and beneath a fluid reservoir, with feedback provided by planar particle image velocimetry (PIV). Control is implemented using a model predictive control (MPC) framework, in which control signals are computed by minimizing a cost function over the predicted evolution of the flow. The predictor is constructed entirely from data using Koopman operator theory, which enables a linear representation of the underlying nonlinear fluid dynamics. This linearity allows the MPC problem to be solved by alternating between two small and efficiently solvable convex quadratic programs (QPs): one for the electrodes and one for the electromagnets. The resulting controller runs in a closed loop on a standard laptop, enabling real-time control of the flow. We demonstrate the functionality of the approach through experiments in which the flow is shaped to match a range of reference velocity fields and a time-varying vorticity field.</description>

      <title>Assessing the economic benefits of space weather mitigation investment decisions: Evidence from Aotearoa New Zealand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space weather events pose a growing threat to modern economies, yet their macroeconomic consequences still remain underexplored. This study presents the first dedicated economic assessment of geomagnetic storm impacts on Aotearoa New Zealand, quantifying potential GDP losses across seven disruption and mitigation scenarios due to an extreme coronal mass ejection (CME). The primary focus is upon the damaging impacts of geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) on the electrical power transmission network. The goal is to support decision-making around space weather mitigation investments by providing a first-order approximation of their potential economic benefits. We find that in the absence of mitigation, a severe but realistic storm could result in up to NZ\$8.36 billion in lost GDP, with more than half stemming from cascading supply chain effects. Yet, even less severe scenarios incur losses exceeding NZ\$3 billion. Importantly, research-led operational strategies, such as optimized switching and islanding, can avoid up to NZ\$370 million in losses for as little as NZ\$500,000 in expenditure, delivering a benefit-cost ratio of 740 to 1. Moreover, physical protections such as GIC blocking devices further reduce disruption to as low as NZ\$1.12 billion, with avoided GDP losses up to NZ\$2.3 billion, and benefit-cost returns up to 80 to 1. When also acknowledging unmodelled impacts, including multi-billion losses in capital equipment and long-term revenue, the economic rationale for pre-emptive mitigation becomes even more pertinent. Future research needs to integrate the modelling of capital and revenue losses for strategically important industrial facilities.</description>

      <title>On the factorization of matrices into products of positive definite ones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work revisits and provides a new approach on a result by Charles Ballantine, on the factorization of a square matrix with positive determinant into a product of positive definite factors. {\em Ballantine-type} factorizations, that bound the number of positive definite factors, proved central in solving a basic, yet elusive control problem--the strong controllability of a linear system via control in the form of state feedback. Ballantine's result transcends control engineering, and highlights the little appreciated fact that rotations can be realized by the successive application of irrotational motions. Our approach is constructive and is based on the theory of optimal mass transport, specifically, it relates successive rotations of Gaussian distributions to corresponding optimal transport maps that constitute the sought factors.</description>

      <title>Pathology-Guided Virtual Staining Metric for Evaluation and Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual staining has emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional histopathological staining techniques, enabling rapid, reagent-free image transformations. However, existing evaluation methods predominantly rely on full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) metrics such as structural similarity, which are originally designed for natural images and often fail to capture pathology-relevant features. Expert pathology reviews have also been used, but they are inherently subjective and time-consuming.
  In this study, we introduce PaPIS (Pathology-Aware Perceptual Image Similarity), a novel FR-IQA metric specifically tailored for virtual staining evaluation. PaPIS leverages deep learning-based features trained on cell morphology segmentation and incorporates Retinex-inspired feature decomposition to better reflect histological perceptual quality. Comparative experiments demonstrate that PaPIS more accurately aligns with pathology-relevant visual cues and distinguishes subtle cellular structures that traditional and existing perceptual metrics tend to overlook. Furthermore, integrating PaPIS as a guiding loss function in a virtual staining model leads to improved histological fidelity.
  This work highlights the critical need for pathology-aware evaluation frameworks to advance the development and clinical readiness of virtual staining technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate state estimation requires careful consideration of uncertainty surrounding the process and measurement models; these characteristics are usually not well-known and need an experienced designer to select the covariance matrices. An error in the selection of covariance matrices could impact the accuracy of the estimation algorithm and may sometimes cause the filter to diverge. Identifying noise characteristics has long been a challenging problem due to uncertainty surrounding noise sources and difficulties in systematic noise modeling. Most existing approaches try identifying unknown covariance matrices through an optimization algorithm involving innovation sequences. In recent years, learning approaches have been utilized to determine the stochastic characteristics of process and measurement models. We present a learning-based methodology with different loss functions to identify noise characteristics and test these approaches' performance for real-time vehicle state estimation</description>

      <title>Estimation of Regions of Attraction for Nonlinear Systems via Coordinate-Transformed TS Models and Piecewise Quadratic Lyapunov Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for computing enlarged Region of Attractions (ROA) for nonlinear dynamical systems through the integration of multiple coordinate transformations and piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions within the Takagi-Sugeno (TS) modeling framework. While existing methods typically follow a single-path approach of original system $\rightarrow$ TS model $\rightarrow$ ROA computation, the proposed methodology systematically applies a sequence of coordinate transformations to generate multiple system representations, each yielding distinct ROA estimations. Specifically, the approach transforms the original nonlinear system using transformation matrices $T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_N$ to obtain $N$ different coordinate representations, constructs corresponding TS models for each transformed system, and computes individual ROAs using piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions. The final ROA estimate is obtained as the union of all computed regions, leveraging the flexibility inherent in piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions compared to traditional quadratic approaches. The enhanced methodology demonstrates significant improvements in ROA size estimation compared to conventional single-transformation techniques, as evidenced through comparative analysis with existing TS-based stability methods.</description>

      <title>DEMONSTRATE: Zero-shot Language to Robotic Control via Multi-task Demonstration Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) with control systems has demonstrated significant potential in various settings, such as task completion with a robotic manipulator. A main reason for this success is the ability of LLMs to perform in-context learning, which, however, strongly relies on the design of task examples, closely related to the target tasks. Consequently, employing LLMs to formulate optimal control problems often requires task examples that contain explicit mathematical expressions, designed by trained engineers. Furthermore, there is often no principled way to evaluate for hallucination before task execution. To address these challenges, we propose DEMONSTRATE, a novel methodology that avoids the use of LLMs for complex optimization problem generations, and instead only relies on the embedding representations of task descriptions. To do this, we leverage tools from inverse optimal control to replace in-context prompt examples with task demonstrations, as well as the concept of multitask learning, which ensures target and example task similarity by construction. Given the fact that hardware demonstrations can easily be collected using teleoperation or guidance of the robot, our approach significantly reduces the reliance on engineering expertise for designing in-context examples. Furthermore, the enforced multitask structure enables learning from few demonstrations and assessment of hallucinations prior to task execution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through simulation and hardware experiments involving a robotic arm tasked with tabletop manipulation.</description>

      <title>ZipMPC: Compressed Context-Dependent MPC Cost via Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computational burden of model predictive control (MPC) limits its application on real-time systems, such as robots, and often requires the use of short prediction horizons. This not only affects the control performance, but also increases the difficulty of designing MPC cost functions that reflect the desired long-term objective. This paper proposes ZipMPC, a method that imitates a long-horizon MPC behaviour by learning a compressed and context-dependent cost function for a short-horizon MPC. It improves performance over alternative methods, such as approximate explicit MPC and automatic cost parameter tuning, in particular in terms of i) optimizing the long term objective; ii) maintaining computational costs comparable to a short-horizon MPC; iii) ensuring constraint satisfaction; and iv) generalizing control behaviour to environments not observed during training. For this purpose, ZipMPC leverages the concept of differentiable MPC with neural networks to propagate gradients of the imitation loss through the MPC optimization. We validate our proposed method in simulation and real-world experiments on autonomous racing. ZipMPC consistently completes laps faster than selected baselines, achieving lap times close to the long-horizon MPC baseline. In challenging scenarios where the short-horizon MPC baseline fails to complete a lap, ZipMPC is able to do so. In particular, these performance gains are also observed on tracks unseen during training.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Asynchronous Cross-border Market Data for Improved Day-Ahead Electricity Price Forecasting in European Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate short-term electricity price forecasting is crucial for strategically scheduling demand and generation bids in day-ahead markets. While data-driven techniques have shown considerable prowess in achieving high forecast accuracy in recent years, they rely heavily on the quality of input covariates. In this paper, we investigate whether asynchronously published prices as a result of differing gate closure times (GCTs) in some bidding zones can improve forecasting accuracy in other markets with later GCTs. Using a state-of-the-art ensemble of models, we show significant improvements of 22% and 9% in forecast accuracy in the Belgian (BE) and Swedish bidding zones (SE3) respectively, when including price data from interconnected markets with earlier GCT (Germany-Luxembourg, Austria, and Switzerland). This improvement holds for both general as well as extreme market conditions. Our analysis also yields further important insights: frequent model recalibration is necessary for maximum accuracy but comes at substantial additional computational costs, and using data from more markets does not always lead to better performance - a fact we delve deeper into with interpretability analysis of the forecast models. Overall, these findings provide valuable guidance for market participants and decision-makers aiming to optimize bidding strategies within increasingly interconnected and volatile European energy markets.</description>

Abstract: This letter proposes a method to integrate auxiliary actuators that enhance the task-space capabilities of commercial underactuated systems, while leaving the internal certified low-level controller untouched. The additional actuators are combined with a feedback-linearizing outer-loop controller, enabling full-pose tracking. We provide conditions under which legacy high-level commands and new actuator inputs can be cohesively coordinated to achieve decoupled control of all degrees of freedom. A comparative study with a standard quadrotor-originally not designed for physical interaction-demonstrates that the proposed modified platform remains stable under contact, while the baseline system diverges. Additionally, simulation results under parameter uncertainty illustrate the robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an approach to design control barrier functions (CBFs) for arbitrary state and input constraints using tools from the reference governor literature. In particular, it is shown that dynamic safety margins (DSMs) are CBFs for an augmented system obtained by concatenating the state with a virtual reference. The proposed approach is agnostic to the relative degree and can handle multiple state and input constraints using the control-sharing property of CBFs. The construction of CBFs using Lyapunov-based DSMs is then investigated in further detail. Numerical simulations show that the method outperforms existing DSM-based approaches, while also guaranteeing safety and persistent feasibility of the associated optimization program.</description>

Abstract: Representation of inductive coupling lines with conventional static phasors is the main reason of inadequacy of the existing phasors based simplified stability analysis methods for microgrids with inductive coupling lines. In the literature, dynamic phasors have been proposed for the dynamic modelling of inductive lines to conserve the simplified structure of the analysis method. In this study a generalized stability analysis method for LV AC microgrids, composed of droop controlled inverters, is presented. The proposed analysis method is based on the inclusion of dynamic phasors for inductive coupling lines into the existing phasors based stability analysis method. The results show that the stability analysis method with dynamic phasors successfully predicts the instability boundaries of LV AC microgrids.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a trust-based predictive multi-agent consensus protocol that analyses neighbours' anticipation data and makes coordination decisions. Agents in the network share their future predicted data over a finite look-ahead horizon with their neighbours and update their predictions in a rolling-horizon fashion. The prediction data is then used by agents to learn both the trust and the commitment traits exhibited by their neighbours over time. The proposed protocol is named as the Anticipatory Distributed Coordination (ADC) protocol. Lyapunov theory-based agreement convergence between agents is provided, followed by demonstrations using numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Distributed Truncated Predictive Control for Networked Systems under Uncertainty: Stability and Near-Optimality Guarantee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of distributed online control of networked systems with time-varying cost functions and disturbances, where each node only has local information of the states and forecasts of the costs and disturbances. We develop a distributed truncated predictive control (DTPC) algorithm, where each node solves a ``truncated'' predictive optimal control problem with horizon $k$, but only involving nodes in a $\kappa$-hop neighborhood (ignoring nodes outside). We show that the DTPC algorithm satisfies input-to-state stability (ISS) bounds and has regret decaying exponentially in $k$ and $\kappa$, meaning a short predictive horizon $k$ and a small truncation radius $\kappa$ is sufficient to achieve near-optimal performance. Furthermore, we show that when the future costs and disturbances are not exactly known, the regret has exponentially decaying sensitivity to the forecast errors in terms of predictive horizon, meaning near-term forecast errors play a much more important role than longer-term forecasts.</description>

      <title>Robo-Platform: A Robotic System for Recording Sensors and Controlling Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16595v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mobile smartphones compactly provide sensors such as cameras, IMUs, GNSS measurement units, and wireless and wired communication channels required for robotics projects. They are affordable, portable, and programmable, which makes them ideal for testing, data acquisition, controlling mobile robots, and many other robotic applications. A robotic system is proposed in this paper, consisting of an Android phone, a microcontroller board attached to the phone via USB, and a remote wireless controller station. In the data acquisition mode, the Android device can record a dataset of a diverse configuration of multiple cameras, IMUs, GNSS units, and external USB ADC channels in the rawest format used for, but not limited to, pose estimation and scene reconstruction applications. In robot control mode, the Android phone, a microcontroller board, and other peripherals constitute the mobile or stationary robotic system. This system is controlled using a remote server connected over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Experiments show that although the SLAM and AR applications can utilize the acquired data, the proposed system can pave the way for more advanced algorithms for processing these noisy and sporadic measurements. Moreover, the characteristics of the communication media are studied, and two example robotic projects, which involve controlling a toy car and a quadcopter, are included.</description>

      <title>Nash equilibrium seeking for a class of quadratic-bilinear Wasserstein distributionally robust games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of Wasserstein distributionally robust Nash equilibrium problems, where agents construct heterogeneous data-driven Wasserstein ambiguity sets using private samples and radii, in line with their individual risk-averse behaviour. By leveraging relevant properties of this class of games, we show that equilibria of the original seemingly infinite-dimensional problem can be obtained as a solution to a finite-dimensional Nash equilibrium problem. We then reformulate the problem as a finite-dimensional variational inequality and establish the connection between the corresponding solution sets. Our reformulation has scalable behaviour with respect to the data size and maintains a fixed number of constraints, independently of the number of samples. To compute a solution, we leverage two algorithms, based on the golden ratio algorithm. The efficiency of both algorithmic schemes is corroborated through extensive simulation studies on an illustrative example and a stochastic portfolio allocation game, where behavioural coupling among investors is modeled.</description>

      <title>The Role of Integrity Monitoring in Connected and Automated Vehicles: Current State-of-Practice and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04874v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Positioning integrity refers to the trust in the performance of a navigation system. Accurate and reliable position information is needed to meet the requirements of connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) applications, particularly in safety-critical scenarios. Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) and its variants have been widely studied for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-based vehicle positioning, often fused with kinematic (e.g., Odometry) and perception sensors (e.g., camera). However, integrity monitoring (IM) for cooperative positioning solutions leveraging Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication has received comparatively limited attention. This paper reviews existing research in the field of positioning IM and identifies various research gaps. Particular attention has been placed on identifying research that highlights cooperative IM methods. It also examines key automotive safety standards and public V2X datasets to map current research priorities and uncover critical gaps. Finally, the paper outlines promising future directions, highlighting research topics aimed at advancing and benchmarking positioning integrity.</description>

      <title>Safety-Critical Human-Machine Shared Driving for Vehicle Collision Avoidance based on Hamilton-Jacobi reachability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Road safety continues to be a pressing global issue, with vehicle collisions imposing significant human, societal, and economic burdens. Human-machine shared collision avoidance in critical collision scenarios aims to aid drivers' accident avoidance through intervening only when necessary. Existing methods count on replanning collision-free trajectories and imposing human-machine tracking, which usually interrupts the driver's intent and increases the risk of conflict. This paper introduces a Reachability-Aware Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for shared control, guided by Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis. Machine intervention is activated only when the vehicle approaches the Collision Avoidance Reachable Set (CARS), which represents states where collision is unavoidable. First, we precompute the reachability distributions and the CARS by solving the Bellman equation using offline data. To reduce human-machine conflicts, we develop a driver model for sudden obstacles and propose an authority allocation strategy considering key collision avoidance features. Finally, we train a RL agent to reduce human-machine conflicts while enforcing the hard constraint of avoiding entry into the CARS. The proposed method was tested on a real vehicle platform. Results show that the controller intervenes effectively near CARS to prevent collisions while maintaining improved original driving task performance. Robustness analysis further supports its flexibility across different driver attributes.</description>

      <title>Deep Q-Learning with Gradient Target Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Q-learning with gradient target tracking, a novel reinforcement learning framework that provides a learned continuous target update mechanism as an alternative to the conventional hard update paradigm. In the standard deep Q-network (DQN), the target network is a copy of the online network's weights, held fixed for a number of iterations before being periodically replaced via a hard update. While this stabilizes training by providing consistent targets, it introduces a new challenge: the hard update period must be carefully tuned to achieve optimal performance. To address this issue, we propose two gradient-based target update methods: DQN with asymmetric gradient target tracking (AGT2-DQN) and DQN with symmetric gradient target tracking (SGT2-DQN). These methods replace the conventional hard target updates with continuous and structured updates using gradient descent, which effectively eliminates the need for manual tuning. We provide a theoretical analysis proving the convergence of these methods in tabular settings. Additionally, empirical evaluations demonstrate their advantages over standard DQN baselines, which suggest that gradient-based target updates can serve as an effective alternative to conventional target update mechanisms in Q-learning.</description>

      <title>Latent Diffusion Model Based Denoising Receiver for 6G Semantic Communication: From Stochastic Differential Theory to Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05710v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel semantic communication framework empowered by generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is proposed, to enhance the robustness against both channel noise and transmission data distribution shifts. A theoretical foundation is established using stochastic differential equations (SDEs), from which a closed-form mapping between any signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the optimal denoising timestep is derived. Moreover, to address distribution mismatch, a mathematical scaling method is introduced to align received semantic features with the training distribution of the GAI. Built on this theoretical foundation, a latent diffusion model (LDM)-based semantic communication framework is proposed that combines a variational autoencoder for semantic features extraction, where a pretrained diffusion model is used for denoising. The proposed system is a training-free framework that supports zero-shot generalization, and achieves superior performance under low-SNR and out-of-distribution conditions, offering a scalable and robust solution for future 6G semantic communication systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed semantic communication framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in both pixel-level accuracy and semantic perceptual quality, consistently outperforming baselines across a wide range of SNRs and data distributions without any fine-tuning or post-training.</description>

      <title>Fast Bilateral Teleoperation and Imitation Learning Using Sensorless Force Control via Accurate Dynamics Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06174v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the advancement of imitation learning has led to increased interest in teleoperating low-cost manipulators to collect demonstration data. However, most existing systems rely on unilateral control, which only transmits target position values. While this approach is easy to implement and suitable for slow, non-contact tasks, it struggles with fast or contact-rich operations due to the absence of force feedback. This work demonstrates that fast teleoperation with force feedback is feasible even with force-sensorless, low-cost manipulators by leveraging 4-channel bilateral control. Based on accurately identified manipulator dynamics, our method integrates nonlinear terms compensation, velocity and external force estimation, and variable gain corresponding to inertial variation. Furthermore, using data collected by 4-channel bilateral control, we show that incorporating force information into both the input and output of learned policies improves performance in imitation learning. These results highlight the practical effectiveness of our system for high-fidelity teleoperation and data collection on affordable hardware.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Climate change is one of the defining challenges of the 21st century, and many in the robotics community are looking for ways to contribute. This paper presents a roadmap for climate-relevant robotics research, identifying high-impact opportunities for collaboration between roboticists and experts across climate domains such as energy, the built environment, transportation, industry, land use, and Earth sciences. These applications include problems such as energy systems optimization, construction, precision agriculture, building envelope retrofits, autonomous trucking, and large-scale environmental monitoring. Critically, we include opportunities to apply not only physical robots but also the broader robotics toolkit - including planning, perception, control, and estimation algorithms - to climate-relevant problems. A central goal of this roadmap is to inspire new research directions and collaboration by highlighting specific, actionable problems at the intersection of robotics and climate. This work represents a collaboration between robotics researchers and domain experts in various climate disciplines, and it serves as an invitation to the robotics community to bring their expertise to bear on urgent climate priorities.</description>
