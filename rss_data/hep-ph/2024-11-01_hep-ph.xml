      <title>Flavor Patterns of Fundamental Particles from Quantum Entanglement?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, which controls flavor mixing between the three generations of quark fermions, is a key input to the Standard Model of particle physics. In this paper, we identify a surprising connection between quantum entanglement and the degree of quark mixing. Focusing on a specific limit of $2 \to 2$ quark scattering mediated by electroweak bosons, we find that the quantum entanglement generated by scattering is minimized when the CKM matrix is almost (but not exactly) diagonal, in qualitative agreement with observation. With the discovery of neutrino masses and mixings, additional angles are needed to parametrize the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix in the lepton sector. Applying the same logic, we find that quantum entanglement is minimized when the PMNS matrix features two large angles and a smaller one, again in qualitative agreement with observation, plus a hint for suppressed CP violation. We speculate on the (unlikely but tantalizing) possibility that minimization of quantum entanglement might be a fundamental principle that determines particle physics input parameters.</description>

      <title>On the time-dependent density of quadratically coupled dark matter around ordinary matter objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave-like dark matter may feature quadratic couplings to ordinary matter. This carries profound consequences for the phenomenologies of such models. It changes the dark matter density around dense objects made from ordinary matter such as planets and stars, thereby changing the sensitivity of direct detection experiments on Earth as well as implying forces on other ordinary matter objects in the vicinity. In this note we study the time dependence of the dark matter field around spherical objects of ordinary matter. This work indicates the time-scale on which accelerating objects settle into a stationary state and delineates the applicability of stationary solutions for experimental dark matter tests. We also use this to understand (and effectively eliminate) the infinities in energies, forces, and pressures that appear when naively comparing the total energy around objects with different size but the same total number of ordinary matter particles.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Candidates and Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical observations suggest that most of the matter in the cosmos consists of a new form that has not been observed on Earth. The nature and origin of this mysterious dark matter are among the most pressing questions in fundamental science. In this review we summarize the current state of dark matter research from two perspectives. First, we provide an overview of the leading theoretical proposals for dark matter. And second, we describe how these proposals have driven a broad and diverse global search program for dark matter involving direct laboratory searches and astrophysical observations. This review is based on a Green Paper on dark matter prepared as part of the 2020 Astroparticle Community Planning initiative undertaken by the Canadian Subatomic Physics community but has been significantly updated to reflect recent advances.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics content of the QGSJET-III Monte Carlo model of high energy hadronic interactions is briefly described. The predictions of the model for extensive air shower characteristics are presented in comparison to the corresponding results of other Monte Carlo generators of cosmic ray interactions. The results of a recent quantitative analysis of uncertainties for such predictions are discussed, notably, regarding possibilities to enhance the muon content of extensive air showers or to delay the air shower development.</description>

      <title>Likelihood and Correlation Analysis of Compton Form Factors for Deeply Virtual Exclusive Scattering on the Nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A likelihood analysis of the observables in deeply virtual exclusive photoproduction off a proton target, $ep \rightarrow e' p' \gamma'$, is presented. Two processes contribute to the reaction: deeply virtual Compton scattering, where the photon is produced at the proton vertex, and the Bether-Heitler process, where the photon is radiated from the electron. We consider the unpolarized process for which the largest amount of data with all the kinematic dependences are available from corresponding datasets with unpolarized beams and unpolarized targets from Jefferson Lab. We provide and use a method which derives a joint likelihood of the Compton form factors, which parametrize the deeply virtual Compton scattering amplitude in QCD, for each observed combination of the kinematic variables defining the reaction. The unpolarized twist-two cross section likelihood fully constrains only three of the Compton form factors (CFFs). The impact of the twist-three corrections to the analysis is also explored. The derived likelihoods are explored using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Using our proposed method we derive CFF error bars and covariances. Additionally, we explore methods which may reduce the magnitude of error bars/contours in the future.</description>

      <title>The chiral transition and meson melting within improved holographic soft wall models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the chiral transition for the quark condensate and the melting of scalar and vector mesons in two-flavor holographic QCD. This is done by extending the improved holographic soft wall models proposed in [1] to finite temperature, by means of introducing an asymptotically AdS black brane. We find that the chiral transition is second order in the chiral limit and a crossover for physical quark masses, as expected in two-flavor QCD. We investigate the melting of vector and scalar mesons in the deconfined plasma through the calculation of hadronic spectral functions. Fixing the model parameters by the meson spectrum at zero temperature, we find that the mesons melt at temperatures between $90$ and $110$ MeV and the chiral transition occurs around $129$ MeV. We also provide a prediction for the hydrodynamic diffusion constant associated with a flavor current in the deconfined plasma.</description>

      <title>QCD phase transition with non-extensive NJL model in the strong magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we make use of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model to investigate thermodynamic properties of magnetized three-flavor quark matter. The non-equilibrium Tsallis distribution is characterized by a dimensionless non-extensive parameter $q$. We find that the system always undergoes a crossover transition for all given $q$ values and the pseudo-critical temperature decreases with the increasing non-extensive parameter. We show that the variation of the pressure and its anisotropy in parallel and perpendicular directions. However, the diamagnetic nature appears within a certain temperature range at zero chemical potential. Moreover, strong magnetic fields can affect the property of a non-extensive system by changing the magnetization significantly. At high temperatures, the paramagnetic nature always occur no matter how strong the magnetic field is. Finally, we study the effects of non-extensive parameter $q$ on the trace anomaly and the speed of sound of the system.</description>

      <title>Direct Detection of Dark Baryons Naturally Suppressed by $\mathcal{H}$-parity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify symmetries in a broad class of vector-like confining dark sectors that forbid the leading electromagnetic moments that would ordinarily mediate dark baryon scattering with the Standard Model. The absence of these operators implies dark baryon dark matter has much smaller cross sections for elastic scattering off nuclei, leading to suppressed direct detection signals. In the confined description, we identify an ``$\mathcal{H}$-parity'' symmetry that exists in any dark sector with dark quarks transforming under a vector-like representation of a new confining SU($N_c$) gauge theory as well as a vector-like representation of the electroweak group SU(2)$_L$. The parity is independent of $N_c$ and $N_f$, though it is essential that the dark quarks are neutral under hypercharge. This parity forbids dark hadron electric and magnetic dipole moments, charge radius, and anapole moment, while permitting dimension-7 operators that include polarizability, electroweak loop-induced interactions, as well as lower dimensional electromagnetic $\textit{transition}$ moments between different neutral dark baryon states. We work out an explicit example, $N_c=N_f=3$, that is the most minimal theory with fermionic dark baryons. In this specific model, we use the non-relativistic quark model to show the magnetic dipole moment and charge radius vanish while the transition moments are non-zero, consistent with $\mathcal{H}$-parity. We discuss the implications of a suppressed direct detection signal, emphasizing that this broad class of models provide a well-motivated target for future colliders.</description>

      <title>Polarization-dependent observables in $H\to \ell^{+}\ell^{-} \gamma$ in the SM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rare three body decay of a Higgs boson to a lepton-anti lepton pair and a photon has begun to attract attention, after the first evidence for the $H\to Z\gamma$ at CMS and ATLAS, which is a sub process of $H \to \ell^+ \ell^- \gamma$ . To investigate some important features of this process, we suggest that the polarized forward-backward and the photon polarization asymmetries could be useful to probe its important properties, such as the behavior of Yukawa coupling, resonance, and non-resonance contributions. Our analysis introduces a comprehensive framework to evaluate the aforementioned polarization-dependent observables. By analyzing the polarization effects of the final-state photon and lepton separately on forward-backward asymmetries, we demonstrate that loop-induced contributions play a significant role to investigate these asymmetries. Unlike the unpolarized case, where the interference effects of resonance and non-resonance effects are minimal, we show that polarization dependent observables offer a powerful tool to analyze these features of this decay mode. Furthermore, these observables can provide a handy tool for probing possible signatures of physics beyond the SM.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of a singlet-doublet-triplet scotogenic framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extensive phenomenological study of a scotogenic framework including a scalar singlet, a scalar doublet, a fermionic doublet, and two generations of a fermionic triplet, allowing to provide three non-zero neutrino masses and three viable dark matter candidates. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical technique, we probe the parameter space of the model in view of numerous constraints stemming from dark matter, the neutrino sector, and lepton-flavour violating transitions. The dark matter mass distribution of phenomenologically viable scenarios exhibits three very predictive peaks at 550 GeV, 1080 GeV, and 2300 GeV. In all viable parameter regions, the observed relic density is achieved through dominant co-annihilations. Future experiments will be able to probe a large number of the currently viable parameter space, while certain parameter configurations promise interesting collider signatures. For related studies, five typical parameter configurations are given in SLHA format.</description>

      <title>Hadronization in small and large systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent results on particle production in hadronic collisions at the LHC, from proton-proton (pp) to nucleus-nucleus (AA), challenge the traditional paradigm of hadronization as a universal late-time process which can be factorized from the partonic description of the rest of the event. If the violation of this description in nuclear collisions has been accepted for long -- with several hadronic observables finding a natural interpretation assuming some form of recombination of partons from a deconfined medium -- this same occurrence came as a surprise in proton-proton collisions. Actually, strong indications that hadronization cannot be simply described by universal fragmentation fractions/functions were already found in fixed-target experiments, but limited to specific kinematic regions close to the beam rapidity, so that a complete change of paradigm did not look necessary. Here we show that a wide set of observables finds a natural interpretation assuming that in all high-energy hadronic collisions, from pp to AA, a deconfined medium is formed, acting as a reservoir in which a parton can undergo local color neutralization (LCN) through recombination with an opposite color charge. Hadronization, belonging to the non-perturbative domain of QCD, will always, inevitably, require some amount of educated modelling. However, some commong features to the various proposed model in the literature can be identified, which look necessary in order to describe the most recent data. Here we decide to focus on heavy-flavor (HF) production, since in this case the origin of at least one of the consituent quarks of the final hadron is well known and attributed to an initial hard partonic process.</description>

      <title>Disentangling data contributions to the precision measurement of the largest leptonic mixing angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leptonic mixing, together with the massiveness of neutrinos, is one of the most significant discoveries in contemporary particle physics. The observed differences in the mixing patterns of quarks and leptons may shed light on our understanding of the three-generation structure of the Standard Model. This study examines the precise measurement of the largest leptonic mixing angle $\theta_{23}$ through the analysis of neutrino oscillation data samples. Our findings indicate that, contrary to common understanding, the ${\nu}_{\mu}(\bar{\nu}_{\mu})\rightarrow {\nu}_{e}(\bar{\nu}_{e})$ appearance samples, rather than the ${\nu}_{\mu}(\bar{\nu}_{\mu})\rightarrow \nu_{\mu}(\bar{\nu}_{\mu})$ disappearance samples, are sensitive to test the hypothesis of maximal mixing $\theta_{23}=\pi/4$, particularly if $\theta_{23}$ resides in the higher octant and $\sin^2\theta_{23}&lt;0.54$. The former serves as the primary source for determining the octant of the $\theta_{23}$ mixing angle; however, the latter remains relevant if $\theta_{23}$ is indeed in the lower octant with $\sin^2\theta_{23}&lt;0.42$. In a joint T2HK and DUNE analysis, utilizing only appearance sub-samples can exclude the maximal-mixing and determine the actual octant for about 60\% of the currently allowed range of the $\theta_{23}$ angle. We argue that, despite the presence of parameter degeneracy, the precise measurement of $\theta_{23}$ exhibits minimal dependence on other unknown factors, including the CP-violation phase and neutrino mass ordering.</description>

      <title>Evidence of the existence of the six-quark component of the deuteron in the energy spectra of photons emitted in proton-deuteron collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present evidence of the existence of the six-quark component of the deuteron ($d_{6q}$) found in the experimental photon energy spectra of the proton deuteron bremsstrahlung measured at the proton incident energy of 200 MeV by the Grenoble group and of 195 MeV by the Michigan state group. A comparison of these spectra with the theoretically predicted ones revealed that the experimental spectra significantly exceed the theoretical ones. We show that the excess of photons in the experimental spectra was caused by contributions of new mechanisms for the photon production in $pd$ collisions, which are due to the existence of $d_{6q}$. The mechanisms comprise the process $p+d_{6q}\to p^\prime+d_{6q}^\star$, where $p^\prime$ is the scattered proton and $d_{6q}^\star$ is the $d_{6q}$ excited state, which has the total energy below the threshold for its decay by pion emission and the quantum numbers forbidden for the $NN$ system, that experiences then either the radiative decay $d_{6q}^\star\to p+n+\gamma$ or $d_{6q}^\star\to d+\gamma$. By assuming that $d_{6q}^\star$ is the $NN$-decoupled dibaryon $d_1^\star (1956)$, we calculated the expected contribution of these mechanisms to the most precisely measured energy spectrum of photons emitted at $90^0$ for an incident proton energy of 195 MeV. After a simple subtraction of this contribution from the experimental spectrum, we found that the experimetally and theoretically predicted spectra are in good agreement.</description>

      <title>Electric, Magnetic and Quadrupole Form Factors and Charge Radii of Vector Mesons: From Light to Heavy Sector in a Contact Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed survey of electric, magnetic and quadrupole form factors of light and heavy spin-1 vector mesons. It complements our analogous analysis of the electromagnetic form factors of pseudoscalar and scalar mesons reported earlier. Our formalism is based upon the Schwinger-Dyson equations treatment of a vector $\times$ vector contact interaction and the Bethe-Salpeter equation description of relativistic two-body bound states. We compute the form factors, associated moments and charge radii, comparing these quantities to earlier theoretical studies and experimental results if and when possible. We also investigate the quark-mass dependence of the charge radii and find the anticipated hierarchy such that it decreases with increasing dressed quark masses. In addition, our analysis shows that the magnetic moment is independent of the mass of the light and heavy mesons. Our results agree with most measurements reported earlier, finding a negative quadrupole moment, implying the charge distribution is oblate.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal asymmetries in lepton and heavy-quark pair production in UPCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Azimuthal modulations in lepton and heavy-quark pair production in ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) of highly charged ions are investigated. The modulations in the azimuthal angles of the sum and difference of the transverse momenta of the pair of particles in the final state, as well as of the transverse impact parameter, arise from the collisions of unpolarized and polarized photons. A full description of the cross section in terms of Generalized Transverse Momentum Dependent parton distributions (GTMDs) for photons is given including a careful consideration of the Fourier transform to impact parameter space. In particular, this leads to a feed-in mechanism among harmonics of different orders, which in principle generates harmonics of all (even) orders. Wherever comparable, our analytical results for the azimuthal modulations agree with those presented in other papers on this topic. Compared to these other works, we separate effects that arise from the anisotropies of the GTMDs from those that do not and retain terms proportional to the mass of the produced particles, as they are relevant for muon, charm and bottom quark production. We show that the normalized differential cross section changes considerably with the produced particle mass, which should be discernible in UPCs at RHIC and LHC. For the numerical results we adopt several models for the photon GTMD correlator, and find that all of them are in fairly good agreement with each other and with UPC data from STAR. We also present results for various azimuthal modulations for RHIC kinematics and compare $e^+ e^-$ production with the production of heavier particles. These results exhibit interesting mass-dependent features in the asymmetries that may help study the anisotropies arising from the underlying photon GTMD description.</description>

      <title>Large neutrino mass in cosmology and keV sterile neutrino dark matter from a dark sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an extended seesaw model which generates active neutrino masses via the usual type-I seesaw and leads to a large number of massless fermions as well as a sterile neutrino dark matter (DM) candidate in the $\mathcal{O}(10-100) {\rm~keV}$ mass range. The dark sector comes into thermal equilibrium with Standard Model neutrinos after neutrino decoupling and before recombination via a U(1) gauge interaction in the dark sector. This suppresses the abundance of active neutrinos and therefore reconciles sizeable neutrino masses with cosmology. The DM abundance is determined by freeze-out in the dark sector, which allows avoiding bounds from X-ray searches. Our scenario predicts a slight increase in the effective number of neutrino species $N_{\rm eff}$ at recombination, potentially detectable by future CMB missions.</description>

      <title>Non-holomorphic modular $A_{5}$ symmetry for lepton masses and mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive bottom-up study of all the simplest lepton models based on non-holomorphic $A_{5}$ modular flavor symmetry, in which neutrinos are assumed to be Majorana particles and their masses are generated by the Weinberg operator or the type I seesaw mechanism. In the case that the generalized CP (gCP) symmetry is not considered, we find that 21 Weinberg operator models and 174 seesaw models can accommodate the experimental data in lepton sector, and all of them depend on six dimensionless free parameters and two overall scales. If gCP symmetry compatible with $A_{5}$ modular symmetry is imposed, one more free parameter would be reduced. Then only 4 of the 21 Weinberg operator models and 100 of the 174 seesaw models agree with the experimental data on lepton masses and mixing parameters. Furthermore, we perform a detailed numerical analysis for two example models for illustration.</description>

      <title>Dirac Leptogenesis in Left-Right Symmetric Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Left-right symmetric models which employ a generalized seesaw mechanism to generate quark and charged lepton masses are known to solve the strong CP problem via parity symmetry, without the need for the axion. These models lead to naturally light Dirac neutrinos with their masses arising through radiatve corrections. In this work, we show how baryogenesis via Dirac leptogenesis can be implemented in this framework. A pair of left-right symmetric scalar doublets $\phi_{L,R}$ carrying $(B-L)$ charge of $3$ is introduced for this purpose, which preserves the parity solution to the strong CP problem. Small neutrino masses are generated through one-loop diagrams mediated by these scalars. The decay of vector-like leptons ($E_i$) involved in the seesaw mechanism to generate charged lepton masses, $E_i \rightarrow \overline{\nu}_{jR} \,\phi_R^-$, creates a right-handed neutrino ($\nu_{R}$) asymmetry, while preserving total lepton number. The compensating lepton asymmetry is converted to baryon asymmetry via electroweak sphalerons. We show that for a large range of model parameters successful baryogenesis can be realized, with the $W_R^\pm$ gauge boson mass being as low as $10^6$ GeV.</description>

      <title>A generalized picture of colour decoherence in dense QCD media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the calculation of the soft gluon emission probability off a colour-singlet $q\bar q$ system that evolves in a quark-gluon plasma. The $q\bar q$ antenna is created in the presence of a medium and then emits a soft gluon outside. The gluon emission probability is modified with respect to the vacuum baseline due to interactions with the medium during the formation of the antenna and its propagation. Previous studies disregarded the former effect and found that the medium modification to the interference pattern of the antenna was controlled by the so-called critical angle $\theta_c$, that exclusively depends on medium properties. We find that accounting for medium interactions during the antenna formation enhances the total rate of emissions off the $q\bar q$ antenna. Interestingly, it also promotes the notion of a critical angle to a dynamic quantity, denoted $\tilde\theta_c$, that depends on both the medium and the antenna properties and is thus different for every splitting. As a consequence, depending on the region of parameter space, colour decoherence can either be delayed or accelerated with respect to previous estimates.</description>

      <title>From data to the analytic S-matrix: A Bootstrap fit of the pion scattering amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel strategy to fit experimental data using a UV complete amplitude ansatz satisfying the constraints of Analyticity, Crossing, and Unitarity. We focus on $\pi\pi$ scattering combining both experimental and lattice data. The fit strategy requires using S-matrix Bootstrap methods and non-convex Particle Swarm Optimization techniques. Using this procedure, we numerically construct a full-fledged scattering amplitude that fits the data and contains the known QCD spectrum that couples to $\pi \pi$ states below $1.4$ GeV. The amplitude constructed agrees below the two-particle threshold with the two-loop $\chi$PT prediction. Moreover, we correctly predict the $D_2$ phase shift, the appearance of a spin three state, and the behavior of the high-energy total cross-section. Finally, we find a genuine tetraquark resonance around 2 GeV, which we argue might be detected by looking into the decays of B mesons.</description>

Abstract: Black holes are extreme outcomes of General Relativity, and can form through a variety of ways, including gravitational collapse of massive stars, or quantum fluctuations in the early universe. Here, we ask the question of whether they can form via focusing of radiation by compact binaries or intense lasers, or via trapping at the light ring of black holes. We provide evidence that gravitational lensing of radiation from a small, finite number of sources is not a viable mechanism to form black holes.</description>

      <title>Observable CMB Tensor Modes from Cosmological Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A B-mode polarization signal in the cosmic microwave background is widely regarded as smoking gun evidence for gravitational waves produced during inflation. Here we demonstrate that tensor perturbations from a cosmological phase transition in the post-inflationary universe can nearly mimic the characteristic shape and power of inflationary predictions across a range of observable angular scales. Although phase transitions arise from subhorizon physics, they nevertheless exhibit a white noise power spectrum on superhorizon scales. Thus, while B-mode power is suppressed on these large scales, it is not necessarily negligible. For viable phase transition parameters, the maximal B-mode amplitude at multipole moments around the recombination peak can be comparable to nearly all single-field inflationary predictions that can be tested with current and future experiments. This approximate degeneracy can be broken if a signal is measured at different angular scales, since the inflationary power spectrum is nearly scale invariant while the phase transition predicts a distinct suppression of power on large scales.</description>

Abstract: We discuss unusual $\theta$ terms that can appear in field theories that allow global vortices. These `Cheshire $\theta$ terms' induce Aharonov-Bohm effects for some particles that move around vortices. For example, a Cheshire $\theta$ term can appear in QCD coupled to an axion and induces Aharonov-Bohm effects for baryons and leptons moving around axion strings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The linear response of a Schwarzschild black hole to an external quadrupolar perturbation is studied in analogy to a mechanical electrodynamical system, with the goal to describe the gravitational polarizability. Its causality properties imply dispersion relations that relate fluctuation and dissipative properties. We review and combine results obtained via the Regge-Wheeler equation on one side and a perturbative, worldline effective field theory description on the other, obtaining a consistent description of the dispersion relations for the gravitational polarizability of a Schwarzschild black hole. We find that the classical part of the 2-point correlation function of the black hole multipole depends on the boundary conditions of the space-time the black hole is immersed in, which is relevant for the dispersion relations considered.</description>

      <title>Growth of Gravitational Wave Spectrum from Sound Waves in a Universe with Generic Expansion Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derived here the factor $\Upsilon$, which quantifies how the gravitational wave spectrum generated by sound waves in the radiation sector grows over time, in a universe with a generic expanding rate set by another dominant energy content. When the dominant energy density satisfies $\rho \propto a^{-3(1+w)}$, we found that $\Upsilon$ has a compact analytical expression: $\Upsilon =\frac{2[1-y^{3(w-1)/2}]}{3(1-w)}$, where $y = a(t)/a(t_s)$ which is the ratio of the scale factor at a later time $t$ to that at $t_s$ when gravitational wave production from sound waves starts. This generic result reduces to that derived previously for radiation-dominated and matter-dominated cases, thus generalizing previous formulas to more general cosmological contexts and providing more accurate results. The derivation relies solely on a stationary source, implying that this generic result of $\Upsilon$ serves as an universal factor in describing the growth of the gravitational wave production and can appear beyond cosmological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Utility of a hybrid approach to the hadronic vacuum polarisation contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An accurate calculation of the leading-order hadronic vacuum polarisation (LOHVP) contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon ($a_\mu$) is key to determining whether a discrepancy, suggesting new physics, exists between the Standard Model and experimental results. This calculation can be expressed as an integral over Euclidean time of a current-current correlator $G(t)$, where $G(t)$ can be calculated using lattice QCD or, with dispersion relations, from experimental data for $e^+e^-\to\mbox{hadrons}$. The BMW/DMZ collaboration recently presented a hybrid approach in which $G(t)$ is calculated using lattice QCD for most of the contributing $t$ range, but using experimental data for the largest $t$ (lowest energy) region. Here we study the advantages of varying the position $t=t_1$ separating lattice QCD from data-driven contributions. The total LOHVP contribution should be independent of $t_1$, providing both a test of the experimental input and the robustness of the hybrid approach. We use this criterion and a correlated fit to show that Fermilab/HPQCD/MILC lattice QCD results from 2019 strongly favour the CMD-3 cross-section data for $e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^-$ over a combination of earlier experimental results for this channel. Further, the resulting total LOHVP contribution obtained is consistent with the result obtained by BMW/DMZ, and supports the scenario in which there is no significant discrepancy between the experimental value for $a_\mu$ and that expected in the Standard Model. We then discuss how improved lattice results in this hybrid approach could provide a more accurate total LOHVP across a wider range of $t_1$ values with an uncertainty that is smaller than that from either lattice QCD or data-driven approaches on their own.</description>

      <title>Mode analysis of Nambu-Goldstone modes in U(1) charged first-order relativistic viscous hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct a mode analysis of a general U(1)-charged first-order relativistic hydrodynamics within the framework of the effective field theory of dissipative fluids in a Minkowski background. The most general quadratic action for collective excitations around hydrodynamic solutions -- specifically, the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes associated with the symmetry-breaking pattern induced by external fields -- is derived. It is found that the hydrodynamical frame invariants write the first-order dispersion relations in the low energy limit. In thermodynamical viscous fluids realized by integrating out fast modes, unitarity and local KMS symmetry for its underlying UV theory are guaranteed. Then, we find that first-order hydrodynamics are stable if the null energy condition is satisfied. As the NG modes nonlinearly realize the diffeomorphism symmetries, our mode analysis is valid in any coordinate systems, including Lorentz-transformed references. We also comment on the causal structure for the diffusive modes based on the retarded Green functions for the stochastic NG mode.</description>

      <title>A two-body femtoscopy approach to the proton-deuteron correlation function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proton-deuteron correlation function measured by the ALICE collaboration in high multiplicity p+p collisions shows a momentum dependence which is in contradiction with the predictions of the Lednick\'y-Lyuboshitz formalism of the two-body interaction. This result motivated a more sophisticated three-body description in terms of a composed deuteron. Encouraged by the good description of other deuteron observables in the context of heavy-ion collisions we revisit this correlation function under the two-body approximation not relying on the Lednick\'y-Lyuboshitz approximation, but using the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation incorporating both strong and Coulomb interactions. The two-body description provides a reasonable agreement to ALICE data for natural values of the source size. Interpreting the previously assumed attractive character of the $(L,S)=(0,3/2)$ channel of the $pd$ interaction into a more-likely repulsion, the results agree better not only with the ALICE measurements but also with recent STAR data in Au+Au collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We summarise highlights from an ongoing research programme that aims, in the long run, at the ambitious goal of building a realistic, complete holographic composite-Higgs model. This contribution focuses on vacuum misalignment, by showing how to unify its description, as a phenomenon arising from weak coupling considerations, in the holographic description of a strongly coupled field theory in terms of a dual gravity theory. This is achieved by a non-trivial treatment of boundary-localised terms in the gravity action. The gravity backgrounds considered are completely regular and smooth. We provide numerical examples showing that the mass spectrum of particles in the four-dimensional theory is free of pathologies, and that a small hierarchy arises naturally, between the light states that, in this simplified set up, are analogous to the standard-model particles, and all the other, new composite states emerging in the strongly coupled theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum Inhomogeneous Field Theory: Unruh-Like Effects and Bubble Wall Friction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a free scalar field in a specific (1+1)-dimensional curved spacetime. By introducing an algebraic state that is locally Hadamard, we derive the renormalized Wightman function and explicitly calculate the covariantly conserved quantum energy-momentum tensor up to a relevant order. From this result, we show that the Hadamard renormalization scheme, which has been effective in traditional quantum field theory in curved spacetime, is also applicable in the quantum inhomogeneous field theory. As applications of this framework, we show the existence of an Unruh-like effect for an observer slightly out of the right asymptotic region, as well as a quantum frictional effect on the bubble wall expansion during the electroweak phase transition in the early universe. Consequently, this study validates the consistency of our method for constructing meaningful physical quantities in quantum inhomogeneous field theory.</description>

      <title>Precise prediction of the decay rate for $\eta_b\to \gamma \gamma$ from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the decay rate for $\eta_b \to \gamma \gamma$ in lattice QCD for the first time, providing a precise prediction for the Belle II experiment. Our calculation includes $u$, $d$, $s$ and $c$ quarks in the sea, using gluon field configurations generated by the MILC collaboration, at three values of the lattice spacing from $0.06\;\mathrm{fm}$ to $0.03\;\mathrm{fm}$. All quarks are treated in the Highly Improved Staggered Quark formalism, which enables us to reach the $b$ quark mass for our valence quarks on these fine lattices. By working at additional heavy quark masses between those of $c$ and $b$ we also map out the behaviour of the ratio $f_{\eta_h}/(M_{\eta_h}^2F_{\eta_h}(0,0))$, where $f$ is the decay constant, $M$, the mass and $F(0,0)$, the form factor for decay to two on-shell photons for the pseudoscalar heavyonium meson, $\eta_h$. This ratio takes the approximate value 0.5 in leading-order non-relativistic QCD but we are able to give a much more accurate analysis than this. Focussing on the $b$ quark mass, we find a ratio of $0.468(11)$, giving $\Gamma (\eta_b \to \gamma \gamma) = 0.557(32)_{\text{fit}}(1)_{\text{syst}} \: \mathrm{keV}$. Combined with a value for the branching fraction from potential nonrelativistic QCD, our result can be used to determine the total width of the $\eta_b$ with a $7\%$ uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Quarkonium Semiclassical Transport in Quark-Gluon Plasma: Factorization and Quantum Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.02408v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quarkonium transport in the quark-gluon plasma by using the potential nonrelativistic QCD (pNRQCD) effective field theory and the framework of open quantum systems. We argue that the coupling between quarkonium and the thermal bath is weak using separation of scales, so the initial density matrix of the total system factorizes and the time evolution of the subsystem is Markovian. We derive the semiclassical Boltzmann equation for quarkonium by applying a Wigner transform to the Lindblad equation and carrying out a semiclassical expansion. We resum relevant interactions to all orders in the coupling constant at leading power of the nonrelativistic and multipole expansions. The derivation is valid for both weakly coupled and strongly coupled quark-gluon plasmas. We find reaction rates in the transport equation factorize into a quarkonium dipole transition function and a chromoelectric gluon distribution function. For the differential reaction rate, the definition of the momentum dependent chromoelectric gluon distribution function involves staple-shaped Wilson lines. For the inclusive reaction rate, the Wilson lines collapse into a straight line along the real time axis and the distribution becomes momentum independent. The relation between the two Wilson lines is analogous to the relation between the Wilson lines appearing in the gluon parton distribution function (PDF) and the gluon transverse momentum dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF). The centrality dependence of the quarkonium nuclear modification factor measured by experiments probes the momentum independent distribution while the transverse momentum dependence and measurements of the azimuthal angular anisotropy may be able to probe the momentum dependent one. We discuss one way to indirectly constrain the quarkonium in-medium real potential by using the factorization formula and lattice calculations. The leading quantum correction to the semiclassical transport equation of quarkonium is also worked out. The study can be easily generalized to quarkonium transport in cold nuclear matter, which is relevant for quarkonium production in eA collisions in the future Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.04582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the great promise of deep learning, discoveries of new particles at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) may be imminent. Following the discovery of a new Beyond the Standard model particle in an all-hadronic channel, deep learning can also be used to identify its quantum numbers. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using jet-images can significantly improve upon existing techniques to identify the quantum chromodynamic (QCD) (`color') as well as the spin of a two-prong resonance using its substructure. Additionally, jet-images are useful in determining what information in the jet radiation pattern is useful for classification, which could inspire future taggers. These techniques improve the categorization of new particles and are an important addition to the growing jet substructure toolkit, for searches and measurements at the LHC now and in the future.</description>

Abstract: Regarding the proximity of dark energy scale and neutrino mass, one can get new insight into the probe signatures of vector field dark energy component on neutrino flavor conversion. A vector field is assumed to be conformally coupled to various matter components through a screening paradigm. We show how the oscillation probabilities evolve differently with a finite-size matter density like the Sun for different values of relevant model parameters. Considering existing neutrino flavor conversion data, we point out how this non-standard coupling affects neutrino fluxes and also we compute the discrepancy in the total flux of solar electron-neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Higgs Inflation via the Metastable Standard Model Potential, Generalised Renormalisation Frame Prescriptions and Predictions for Primordial Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16208v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higgs Inflation via a metastable Standard Model Higgs Potential is possible if the effective Planck mass in the Jordan frame increases after inflation ends. Here we consider the predictions of this model independently of the dynamics responsible for the Planck mass transition. The classical predictions are the same as for conventional Higgs Inflation. The quantum corrections are dependent upon the conformal frame in which the effective potential is calculated. We generalise beyond the usual Prescription I and II renormalisation frame choices to include intermediate frames characterised by a parameter $\alpha$. We find that the model predicts a well-defined correlation between the values of the scalar spectral index $n_{s}$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. For values of $n_{s}$ varying between the 2-$\sigma$ Planck observational limits, we find that $r$ varies between 0.002 and 0.005 as $n_{s}$ increases, compared to the classical prediction of 0.003. Therefore significantly larger or smaller values of $r$ are possible, which are correlated with larger or smaller values of $n_{s}$. In addition, the model can be compatible with the larger values of $n_{s}$ predicted by Early Dark Energy solutions to the Hubble tension, with correspondingly larger values of $r$. The model can be tested via the detection of primordial gravitational waves by the next generation of CMB polarisation experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino physics is advancing into a precision era with the construction of new experiments, particularly in the few GeV energy range. Within this energy range, neutrinos exhibit diverse interactions with nucleons and nuclei. This study delves in particular into neutrino--nucleus quasi-elastic cross sections, taking into account both standard and, for the first time, non-standard interactions, all within the framework of effective field theory (EFT). The main uncertainties in these cross sections stem from uncertainties in the nucleon-level form factors, and from the approximations necessary to solve the nuclear many-body problem. We explore how these uncertainties influence the potential of neutrino experiments to probe new physics introduced by left-handed, right-handed, scalar, pseudoscalar, and tensor interactions. For some of these interactions the cross section is enhanced, making long-baseline experiments an excellent place to search for them. Our results, including tabulated cross sections for all interaction types and all neutrino flavors, can serve as the foundation for such searches.</description>

      <title>Detectability of the Phase Transition Gravitational Waves in the DFSZ axion Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18703v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the strong first-order phase transition associated with Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking in the DFSZ axion model. We precisely calculate the phase transition dynamics and the corresponding gravitational wave spectra. It is found that this model allows a strong first-order phase transition over a broad energy scale ranging from $10^{9}~\mathrm{GeV}$ to $10^{12}~\mathrm{GeV}$. Meanwhile, our results are also consistent with current experimental constraints on axions. By comparing these gravitational wave signals with the expected sensitivity curves of Cosmic Explorer and calculating the signal-to-noise ratio, we demonstrate that Cosmic Explorer will be able to detect these signals. We also perform a Fisher matrix analysis to study the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors to different phase transition parameters. The results show that if signals are observed, the bubble wall velocity will be the first parameter to be determined. This study demonstrates that gravitational wave detection can explore axion physics complementary to other experiments.</description>

      <title>Quarkonium Polarization in Medium from Open Quantum Systems and Chromomagnetic Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spin-dependent in-medium dynamics of quarkonia by using the potential nonrelativistic QCD (pNRQCD) and the open quantum system framework. We consider the pNRQCD Lagrangian valid up to the order $\frac{r}{M^0}=r$ and $\frac{r^0}{M}=\frac{1}{M}$ in the double power counting. By considering the Markovian condition and applying the Wigner transformation upon the diagonal spin components of the quarkonium density matrix with the semiclassical expansion, we systematically derive the Boltzmann transport equation for quarkonia with polarization dependence in the quantum optical limit. Unlike the spin-independent collision terms governed by certain chromoelectric field correlators, new gauge invariant correlators of chromomagnetic fields determine the recombination and dissociation terms with polarization dependence at the order we are working. We also derive a Lindblad equation describing the in-medium transitions between spin-singlet and spin-triplet heavy quark-antiquark pairs in the quantum Brownian motion limit. The Lindblad equation is governed by new transport coefficients defined in terms of the chromomagnetic field correlators. Our formalism is generic and valid for both weakly coupled and strongly coupled quark gluon plasmas. It can be further applied to study spin alignment of vector quarkonia in heavy ion collisions.</description>

Abstract: We investigate collective excitations in magnetic topological insulators (TIs) and their impact on particle axion detection. In the three-dimensional TI model with the Hubbard term, the effective action of magnons and amplitude modes is formulated by dynamical susceptibility under the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states. One of the amplitude modes is identified as ``axionic'' quasi-particle and its effective coupling to the electromagnetic fields turns out to be enhanced by about four orders of magnitude larger than the previous estimate, which may drastically change the sensitivity of the particle axion search using ``axion'' in magnetic TIs.</description>

      <title>Precise determination of the bottom-quark on-shell mass using its four-loop relation to the $\overline{\rm MS}$-scheme running mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the properties of the bottom-quark on-shell mass ($M_b$) by using its relation to the $\overline{\rm MS}$ mass (${\overline m}_b$). At present, this $\overline{\rm MS}$-on-shell relation has been known up to four-loop QCD corrections, which however still has a $\sim 2\%$ scale uncertainty by taking the renormalization scale as ${\overline m}_b({\overline m}_b)$ and varying it within the usual range of $[{\overline m}_b({\overline m}_b)/2, 2 {\overline m}_b({\overline m}_b)]$. The principle of maximum conformality (PMC) has been adopted to achieve a more precise $\overline{\rm MS}$-on-shell relation by eliminating such scale uncertainty. As a step forward, we also estimate the magnitude of the uncalculated higher-order terms by using the Pad\'{e} approximation approach. Numerically, by using the $\overline{\rm MS}$ mass ${\overline m}_b({\overline m}_b)=4.183\pm0.007$ GeV as an input, our predicted value for the bottom-quark on-shell mass becomes $M_b\simeq 5.372^{+0.091}_{-0.075}$ GeV, where the uncertainty is the squared average of the ones caused by $\Delta \alpha_s(M_Z)$, $\Delta {\overline m}_b({\overline m}_b)$, and the estimated magnitude of the higher-order terms.</description>

Abstract: We propose the Regge trajectory relations for the heavy tetraquarks $(Qq)(\bar{Q}\bar{q}')$ $(Q=b,\,c;\,q,\,q'=u,\,d,\,s)$ with hidden bottom and charm. By employing the new relations, both the $\lambda$-trajectories and the $\rho$-trajectories for the tetraquarks $(Qq)(\bar{Q}\bar{q}')$ can be discussed. The masses of the $\lambda$-mode excited states and the $\rho$-mode excited states are estimated, and they agree with other theoretical predictions. We show that the behaviors of the $\rho$-trajectories are different from those of the $\lambda$-trajectories. The $\rho$-trajectories behave as $M{\sim}x_{\rho}^{1/2}$ $(x_{\rho}=n_r,\,l)$ while the $\lambda$-trajectories behave as $M{\sim}x_{\lambda}^{2/3}$ $(x_{\lambda}=N_r,\,L)$. Moreover, the Regge trajectory behaviors for other types of tetraquarks are investigated based on the spinless Salpeter equation. We show that both the $\lambda$-trajectories and the $\rho$-trajectories are concave downward in the $(M^2,\,x)$ plane. The Regge trajectories for the tetraquarks containing the light diquark and/or the light antidiquark also are concave in the $(M^2,\,x)$ plane when the masses of the light constituents are included and the confining potential is linear.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The QCD axion stands as one of the most promising candidates for resolving the strong CP problem. However, the value of the axion's decay constant $f_a$ and, by extension, its mass $m_a$, remain uncertain within the framework of effective field theory, posing a challenge for experimental detection. Fortunately, fields such as cosmology and astrophysics can offer crucial clues about potential mass ranges. Additionally, string theory and the more recent swampland principles might shed some light on the subject. The most straightforward string theory compactifications suggest that $f_a$ is around the GUT scale, leading to a quantum abundance of dark matter. We found that this range can be detected through hydrogen atomic transitions. The recent concept of the dark dimension scenario introduces an alternative possibility. If axions are confined to the four-dimensional Standard Model brane, their decay constant $f_a$ would be on the order of $10^{10}$ GeV. In this scenario, where axions constitute only a minor portion of dark matter, we show that a laser-interferometry setup would be an effective detection method.</description>

Abstract: The primordial neutrino asymmetry leave profound imprints on the evolution history of the universe, which can be constrained by cosmological observations, including Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), and Large-Scale Structure (LSS). We present comprehensive analysis on implications and constraints of the primordial neutrino asymmetry $\xi_\nu$, based on a precise treatment of neutrino decoupling by solving the complete (anti)neutrino quantum kinetic equations in the Closed-Time-Path formalism. The effective number of neutrinos $ N_{\rm eff}$ and (anti)neutrino spectral distortions are calculated, and we find that the non-instantaneous decoupling correction is given by $\delta N_{\rm eff} = 0.0440 + 0.0102 \, \xi_\nu^2$. Then we perform the state-of-the-art calculation for the abundance of light elements including (anti)neutrino spectral distortions, which indicate a positive asymmetry $0.032 \leq \xi_\nu \leq 0.052$ from EMPRESS data. The implications of the neutrino asymmetry for the CMB and LSS are studied in detail, and we find that the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) are also significantly affected by $\xi_\nu$ in addition to the sum of neutrino masses. A combined analysis with EMPRESS BBN, Planck CMB and BOSS BAO data yields a tighter constraint $\xi_\nu = 0.024 \pm 0.012$, which provides constraints on UV models capable of producing large asymmetries.</description>

      <title>T-Model Higgs Inflation and Metastable Cosmic Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the formation of metastable cosmic strings (CSs) in the context of a supersymmetric (SUSY) left-right model. The SU(2)R symmetry breaking occurs during a stage of T-model (Higgs) inflation (TI) driven by an SU(2)R triplet superfield which inflates away the produced monopoles. The subsequent breaking of the remaining U(1)R x U(1)B-L symmetry, triggered due to an instability arising in the system of a pair of SU(2)R doublet superfields, leads to the production of CSs. TI is based on a quartic potential, is consistent with data thanks to the adopted hyperbolic Kaehler geometry and may be followed by successful non-thermal leptogenesis. The decay of produced CSs interprets the recent observations from PTA experiments on the stochastic background of gravitational waves with values of the superpotential coupling constants close to 10^-6-10^-8 and symmetry-breaking scales a little lower than the SUSY grand unified theory scale. A solution to the mu problem of the MSSM is also accommodated provided that mu is two to three orders of magnitude lower than the gravitino mass. The issue of the gauge coupling unification is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Scalar Mass against Loop Corrections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the renormalized loop corrections to the scalar mass are suppressed if the field in the loop is heavy. Here, treating the renormalized mass is important, as it is the only observable. This means that the physics of a low-energy scalar field is insensitive to that of ultraviolet.</description>

      <title>Is the finite temperature effective potential, effective for dynamics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the applicability of the finite temperature effective potential in the equation of motion of a homogeneous "misaligned" scalar condensate $\varphi$, and find important caveats that severely restrict its domain of validity: i:) the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) is in general not warranted, ii:) we show a direct relation between the effective potential and the thermodynamic entropy density $\mathcal{S}= - \partial V_{eff}(T,\varphi)/\partial T$, which entails that for a dynamical $\varphi(t)$ the entropy becomes a non-monotonic function of time, iii:) parametric instabilities in both cases with and without spontaneous symmetry breaking lead to profuse particle production with non-thermal distribution functions, iv:) in the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking spinodal instabilities yield a complex effective potential, internal energy and entropy, an untenable situation in thermodynamics. All these caveats associated with dynamical aspects, cannot be overcome by finite temperature equilibrium resummation schemes. We argue that the dynamics of the condensate leads to decoupling and freeze-out from (LTE), and propose a closed quantum system approach based on unitary time evolution. It yields the correct equations of motion without the caveats of the effective potential, and provides a fully renormalized and thermodynamically consistent framework to study the dynamics of the "misaligned" condensate, with real and conserved energy and entropy amenable to numerical study. The evolution of the condensate leads to profuse stimulated particle production with non-thermal distribution functions. Possible emergent asymptotic non-thermal states and eventual re-thermalization are conjectured.</description>

      <title>Two-detector flavor sensitivity to ultra-high-energy cosmic neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic neutrinos, with energies above 100 PeV, could be finally discovered in the near future. Measuring their flavor composition would reveal information about their production and propagation, but new techniques are needed for UHE neutrino telescopes to have the capabilities to do it. We address this by proposing a new way to measure the UHE neutrino flavor composition that does not rely on individual telescopes having flavor-identification capabilities. We manufacture flavor sensitivity from the joint detection by one telescope sensitive to all flavors -- the radio array of IceCube-Gen2 -- and one mostly sensitive to $\nu_\tau$ -- GRAND. From this limited flavor sensitivity, predominantly to $\nu_\tau$, and even under conservative choices of neutrino flux and detector size, we extract important insight. For astrophysics, we forecast meaningful constraints on the neutrino production mechanism; for fundamental physics, vastly improved constraints on Lorentz-invariance violation. These are the first measurement forecasts of the UHE $\nu_\tau$ content.</description>

      <title>Black holes and gravitational waves from slow phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04158v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Slow first-order phase transitions generate large inhomogeneities that can lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). We show that the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum then consists of a primary component sourced by bubble collisions and a secondary one induced by large perturbations. The latter gives the dominant peak if $\beta/H_0 &lt; 12$, impacting, in particular, the interpretation of the recent PTA data. The GW signal associated with a particular PBH population is stronger than in typical scenarios because of a negative non-Gaussianity of the perturbations and it has a distinguishable shape with two peaks.</description>

      <title>Neutrino quantum kinetics in two spatial dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our understanding of neutrino flavor conversion in the innermost regions of core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers is mostly limited to spherically symmetric configurations that facilitate the numerical solution of the quantum kinetic equations. In this paper, we simulate neutrino quantum kinetics within a (2+1+1) dimensional setup: we model the flavor evolution during neutrino decoupling from matter in two spatial dimensions, one neutrino momentum variable, and time; taking into account non-forward neutral current and charged current collisions of neutrinos with the matter background, as well as neutrino advection. In order to mimic fluctuations in the neutrino emission and matter background, and explore their effect on the flavor evolution, we introduce perturbations in the collision term as well as in the vacuum term of the Hamiltonian. Because of such perturbations, the initial symmetry of the neutrino field across the simulation annulus is broken and flavor conversion is qualitatively affected, with regions of larger flavor conversion alternating across the simulation annulus. In addition, neutrino advection is responsible for spreading flavor waves across neighboring spatial regions. Although based on a simplified setup, our findings highlight the importance of modeling neutrino quantum kinetics in multi-dimensions to assess the impact of neutrinos on the physics of compact astrophysical sources and nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Holographic QCD Running Coupling for Light Quarks in Strong Magnetic Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider running coupling constant in holographic model with external magnetic field supported by Einstein-dilaton-three-Maxwell action. We obtain a significant dependence of the running coupling constant $\alpha$ on chemical potential, temperature and magnetic field. We use the boundary condition that ensures the agreement with lattice calculations of string tension between quarks at zero chemical potential. The location of the 1st order phase transitions in $(\mu, T)$-plane does not depend on the dilaton boundary conditions. We observe that running coupling $\alpha$ decreases with increasing magnetic field for the fixed values of chemical potential and temperature. At the 1st order phase transitions the functions $\alpha$ undergo jumps depending on temperature, chemical potential and magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Diffuse Neutrino Background from Magnetorotational Stellar Core Collapses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A statistically significant detection of the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) is around the corner. To this purpose, we assess the contribution to the DSNB of magnetorotational collapses of massive stars, relying on a suite of state-of-the-art three-dimensional neutrino-magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We find that neutrinos from magnetorotational core collapses boost the high-energy tail of the DSNB spectrum, similar to what is expected from neutrino-driven black hole-forming collapses. The latest data from the Super-Kamiokande Collaboration can already exclude that more than $13\%$ of all collapsing massive stars undergo magnetorotational collapses under optimistic assumptions. A DSNB detection at $3 \sigma$ could take place up to $4$ yr earlier at Super-Kamiokande-Gadolinium or JUNO if the fraction of magnetorotational collapses should be larger than $10\%$. Fascinatingly, if the fraction of magnetorotational stellar collapses should be larger than $19\%$ ($13\%$), Hyper-Kamiokande could measure such a fraction at $3\sigma$ after ($10$ yr) $20$ yr of DSNB data taking. The combination of DSNB and electromagnetic data has the potential to resolve the degenerate contributions from magnetorotational and neutrino-driven black hole-forming collapses, providing crucial insight on the properties of the population of collapsing massive stars.</description>

      <title>A universal speed limit for spreading of quantum coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discoveries of fundamental limits for the rates of physical processes, from the speed of light to the Lieb-Robinson bound for information propagation, are conceptual breakthroughs that often challenge our understanding of the underlying physics. Here we observe such a limit for a paradigmatic many-body phenomenon, the spreading of coherence during formation of a weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate. We study condensate formation in an isolated homogeneous atomic gas that is initially far from equilibrium, in an incoherent low-energy state, and condenses as it relaxes towards equilibrium. Tuning the inter-atomic interactions that drive condensation, we show that the spreading of coherence through the system is initially slower for weaker interactions, and faster for stronger ones, but always eventually reaches the same limit, where the square of the coherence length grows at a universal rate given by the ratio of Planck's constant and the particle mass. These observations are robust to changes in the initial state, the gas density, and the system size. Our results provide benchmarks for theories of universality far from equilibrium, are relevant for quantum technologies that rely on large-scale coherence, and invite similar measurements in other quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the scalar-induced one-loop correction to the power spectrum of tensor perturbations produced during single-field slow-roll inflation. We find that the correction is given by the square of the product of the slow-roll parameter and the tree-level scalar power spectrum. We also discuss the implications of the logarithmic contribution.</description>
