      <title>Relativistic multistage resonant and trailing-field acceleration induced by large-amplitude Alfv\'en waves in a strong magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a particle acceleration mechanism driven by large-amplitude Alfv\'en waves in a strong magnetic field. The acceleration process proceeds through multiple stages triggered by counterpropagating wave-particle resonant acceleration (CWRA) via decay instability. Initially, parent and daughter Alfv\'en waves resonantly accelerate particles perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field. The resultant modulational instability generates electrostatic fields within the wave packet, which are locally amplified by the ponderomotive force of the Alfv\'en wave packet. These fields subsequently drive further acceleration within a few relativistic gyroperiods via gyroresonant surfing acceleration (GRSA). During this, the v*B force facilitates momentum transfer from the perpendicular to the parallel direction. In the later stage, particles become trapped by the parent wave and gain additional energy through single wave resonant acceleration (SWRA). Furthermore, the accumulation of accelerated particles induces electrostatic trailing fields behind and at the tail of the wave packet, which drive trailing-field acceleration (TFA) of other electrons. The combined effects of these mechanisms, CWRA followed by GRSA and SWRA, result in highly relativistic electron energy. The electron energy accelerated through the above process is higher than that accelerated through TFA. This multistage acceleration process provides insights into the generation of high energy cosmic rays in astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Particle-in-cell simulations of laser crossbeam energy transfer via magnetized ion-acoustic wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large magnetic fields, either imposed externally or produced spontaneously, are often present in laser-driven high-energy-density systems. In addition to changing plasma conditions, magnetic fields also directly modify laser-plasma interactions (LPI) by changing participating waves and their nonlonear interactions. In this paper, we use two-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations to investigate how magnetic fields directly affect crossbeam energy transfer (CBET) from a pump to a seed laser beam, when the transfer is mediated by the ion-acoustic wave (IAW) quasimode. Our simulations are performed in the parameter space where CBET is the dominant process, and in a linear regime where pump depletion, distribution function evolution, and secondary instabilities are insignificant. We use a Fourier filter to separate out the seed signal, and project the seed fields to two electromagnetic eigenmodes, which become nondegenerate in magnetized plasmas. By comparing the seed energy before CBET occurs and after CBET reaches quasi-steady state, we extract CBET energy gains of both eigenmodes for lasers that are initially linearly polarized. Our simulations reveal that starting from a few MG fields, the two eigenmodes have different gains, and magnetization alters how the gains depend on laser detuning. The overall gain decreases with magnetization when the laser polarizations are initially parallel, while a nonzero gain becomes allowed when the laser polarizations are initially orthogonal. These findings qualitatively agree with theoretical expectations.</description>

      <title>First global gyrokinetic profile predictions of ITER burning plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the first global gyrokinetic simulations of the ITER baseline scenario operating at 15 MA using GENE-Tango electrostatic and electromagnetic simulations. The modeled radial region spans close to the magnetic axis up to rho_tor = 0.6. Our results show a pronounced density peaking, moderated by electromagnetic fluctuations. The predicted fusion gain for this scenario is Q = 12.2, aligning well with ITER's mission objectives. We further characterize the turbulence spectra and find that electromagnetic modes, such as microtearing modes, kinetic ballooning modes, and Alfvenic ion temperature gradient modes at low binormal wave numbers, play a critical role in the core transport of this ITER scenario, necessitating high numerical resolution for accurate modeling. Local flux-tube simulations qualitatively reproduce the key features observed in the global gyrokinetic simulations but exhibit a much higher sensitivity to profile gradients, reflecting increased stiffness, likely due to the linearization of the equilibrium profiles and safety factor. Our study also reveals that the imposed external toroidal rotation profiles have a negligible impact on turbulent transport, as their magnitudes are substantially lower than the dominant linear growth rates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the safety factor profile is of paramount importance: scenarios featuring flat q profiles with near-zero magnetic shear lead to the destabilization of kinetic ballooning modes in the plasma core, significantly enhancing turbulent transport and potentially degrading confinement. Finally, although electron temperature gradient turbulence initially appears large, sometimes exceeding ion-scale transport levels, it is ultimately quenched over long timescales by secular evolution of zonal flows, which are weakly damped under the very low collisionality conditions expected in ITER.</description>

      <title>Evolution of an Alfv\'en Wave-Driven Proton Beam in the Expanding Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the self-consistent formation and long-term evolution of proton beams in the expanding solar wind using an ensemble of one-dimensional hybrid expanding box simulations. Initial conditions are chosen to represent a range of plasma states observed by the Helios spacecraft at 0.3 AU, including an amplitude-modulated Alfv\'en wave that nonlinearly drives a proton beam aligned with the magnetic field. We compare simulation results with solar wind data out to 1.5 AU and show that our model reproduces key observed features of proton beams on average, such as the radial evolution of the drift and the relative core-to-beam density ratio. These findings support the theory that the observed evolution of the proton beam drift in the solar wind is determined by kinetic instabilities. More broadly, our results indicate that the interplay between nonlinear Alfv\'en wave dynamics, expansion effects and kinetic instabilities plays a fundamental role in solar wind dynamics, with implications for interpreting solar wind heating rate estimates.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian Magnetic Structures in the Small-Scale Turbulent Dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The small-scale turbulent dynamo is a key mechanism for amplifying galactic magnetic fields, yet the resulting field morphology remains poorly understood. Using 3D driven turbulence simulations across a range of compressibilities, characterised by Mach number, and Minkowski functionals, we quantitatively investigate the morphology of magnetic fields generated by the small-scale turbulent dynamo in both the exponentially growing kinematic stage and the statistically steady saturated stage. In both stages and across all Mach numbers, we find that the magnetic field departs significantly from a Gaussian random field. Magnetic structures are statistically less curved and more interconnected in the saturated stage than in the kinematic stage, with these morphological differences decreasing as compressibility increases. Our work provides a quantitative description of how density fluctuations in turbulence and the back-reaction of amplified magnetic fields via the Lorentz force together shape complex, non-Gaussian magnetic structures and offers a valuable framework for comparing simulations with polarisation observations.</description>
