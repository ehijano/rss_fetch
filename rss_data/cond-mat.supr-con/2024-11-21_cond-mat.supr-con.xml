      <title>Doping dependence of low-energy charge collective excitations in high-T$_c$ cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we analyze the dielectric function of high-Tc cuprates as a function of doping level, taking into account the full energy band dispersion within the CuO$_2$ monolayer. In addition to the conventional two-dimensional (2D) gapless plasmon mode, our findings reveal the existence of three anomalous branches within the plasmon spectrum. Two of these branches are overdamped modes, designated as hyperplasmons, and the third is an almost one-dimensional plasmon mode (1DP). We derive an analytic expression for dynamic part of the response function. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of the doping on these modes. Our analysis demonstrates that in the doping level range close to the optimal doping level, the properties of all three modes undergo a significant transformation.</description>

      <title>Resolving phonon-mediated superconducting pairing symmetries from first-principles calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thequest for topological superconductors triggers revived interests in resolving non-s-wave pairing channels mediated by phonons. While density functional theory and denstify functional perturbtaion theory have established a powerful framework to calculate electron-phonon couplings in real materials in a first-principles way, its application is largely limited to conventional s-wave superconductivity. Here, we formulate an efficient and simple-to-use algorithm for first-principles pairing channel analysis, and apply it to several representative material systems.</description>

      <title>Tunable surface electron gas and effect of phonons in Sr$_2$CuO$_3$: A first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the conducting CuO$_2$ planes in cuprate superconductors have been widely recognized as a crucial component in producing high superconducting $T_\text{c}$, recent experimental and theoretical studies on Ba$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_{3+}$$_\delta$ have also drawn much attention to the importance of Cu-O chains in one-dimensional (1D) cuprates. To better understand the cuprates containing Cu-O chains, here we have studied the electronic, magnetic, and phonon properties of Sr$_2$CuO$_3$ bulk and films based on the spin-polarized density functional theory calculations. We first reproduced the typical Mott insulator feature of the cuprate parent compound for bulk Sr$_2$CuO$_3$, and then built a Sr$_2$CuO$_3$ thin film with Cu-O chains exposed on the surface to directly investigate their characteristics. Different from the insulating bulk phase, the Sr$_2$CuO$_3$ surface shows interesting metallic properties. Further electronic structure calculations reveal the existence of spin-polarized electron gas between surface Sr atoms that strongly depends on the interchain coupling of Cu spins. Moreover, the phonon modes that involve the vibrations of in-chain and out-of-chain O atoms can induce strong charge and spin fluctuations in the surface layer of Sr$_2$CuO$_3$ film, which suggests significant multiple degree-of-freedom couplings that may be important for the superconductivity in 1D cuprates. Our work provides a comprehensive viewpoint of the properties of Cu-O chains in Sr$_2$CuO$_3$, facilitating a complete understanding of 1D cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Phase-Biased Andreev Diffraction Grating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In optical diffraction, the phase difference between sources in a grating or multi-slit mask is determined by the angle to the imaging screen, yielding the familiar multi-lobed diffraction image. Here, we realize a similar phenomenon in a superconductor-semiconductor hybrid circuit configured to allow Andreev scattering from multiple parallel scatterers. Phase differences between scatterers are set by tapping off of a remote superconducting meander. We investigate arrays with two, three, four, and ten Andreev scatterers, examining local and nonlocal diffraction patterns, finding good agreement with a theory of multiple Andreev scattering. Adding current-carrying taps to the meander allows individual phase control.</description>

      <title>Possible High-Temperature Superconductivity Driven by Perpendicular Electric Field in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ Single-Bilayer Film at Ambient Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC) in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has aroused a surge in the exploration of HTSC in the multilayer nickelates. Presently, while HTSC is only found in pressurized circumstance, most of the experimental detections are performed at ambient pressure (AP) due to technical problems. Here we focus on the single-bilayer film of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP, and propose that an imposed strong perpendicular electric field can strongly enhance its superconducting $T_c$. The reasons lies as follow. Under strong electric field, the layer with lower potential energy will accept electrons flowing from the other layer to fill in the Ni-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in this layer, as the nearly half-filled Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ orbital in this layer cannot accommodate more electrons. With the enhancement of the filling fraction in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in this layer, the interlayer s-wave pairing will be subjected to the pair-breaking effect and be suppressed, but the intralayer d-wave pairing in this layer is promptly and strongly enhanced, which mimics the cuprates. Our combined simplified one-orbital study and comprehensive two-orbital one under mean-field treatment consistently verify this idea and yield that an imposed voltage of about $0.1\sim0.2$ volt between the two layers is enough to get the HTSC at AP. Our results appeal for experimental verification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10245v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article comprehensively explores matrices and their prerequisites for achieving positive semidefiniteness. The study delves into a series of theorems concerning pure quantum states in the context of weighted graphs. The main objective of this study is to establish a graph-theoretic framework for the study of quantum discord and to identify the necessary and sufficient conditions for zero quantum discord states using unitary operators. This research aims to advance the understanding of quantum discord and its implications for quantum information theory with a graph-theoretic framework.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of bi-layer two-orbital model for La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ on a plaquette ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13399</link>

Abstract: The recently discovered high-$T_c$ superconductivity in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ with $T_c \approx 80K$ provides another intriguing platform to explore the microscopic mechanism of unconventional superconductivity. In this work, we study a previously proposed bi-layer two-orbital model Hamiltonian for La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ [Y. Shen, et al, Chinese Physics Letters 40, 127401 (2023)] on a plaquette ladder, which is a minimum setup with two-dimensional characteristic. We employ large-scale Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculations to accurately determine the ground state of the model. We determine the density, magnetic structure, and the pairing property of the model. We find that with large effective inter-layer anti-ferromagnetic exchange for the 3$d_{z^2}$ orbital, both spin, charge, and pairing correlation display quasi-long-range behavior, which could be viewed as a precursor of possible true long-range order in the two dimensional limit. Interestingly, sign oscillation for the pairing correlation are observed for both the 3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and 3$d_{z^2}$ orbitals, indicating the presence of possible pair density wave in the system. Even though we only study the model on a quasi one-dimensional plaquette ladder geometry due to the computational difficulty, the results on the spin, charge, and pairing correlation provide valuable insight in the clarification of the properties of La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ in the future.</description>

      <title>Impurity bands, line-nodes, and anomalous thermal Hall effect in Weyl superconductors</title>

Abstract: We investigate the anomalous thermal Hall effect (ATHE) in Weyl superconductors realized by the $E_{1u}$ ($p$-wave and $f$-wave) chiral superconducting order for the point group $D_{6h}$. Using the quasiclassical transport theory, we analyze the influence of the impurity scatterings and the line-nodal excitations on the ATHE. We compare the extrinsic (impurity-induced) ATHE with the intrinsic (topological) ATHE to identify the dominant contribution. Because the transverse response is sensitive to the slope in the density of states (DOS) at the Fermi energy, the extrinsic ATHE vanishes in both the Born (weak impurity potential) and unitarity (strong impurity potential) limits. The amplitude of the impurity contribution to the thermal Hall conductivity (THC) reaches maximum between these limits when the slope of the DOS becomes large due to impurity bands near the Fermi energy. In such situations, the extrinsic ATHE dominates the intrinsic ATHE even at low temperatures. The extrinsic ATHE is sensitive to line-nodal excitations, whereas the intrinsic ATHE is insensitive to bulk excitations. When line nodes involve the sign change of the order parameter, the impurity contribution to the THC is suppressed even though the phase space for low-energy excitation is large. In contrast, if line nodes are not accompanied by such sign changes, the extrinsic ATHE is significantly enhanced. Our results form a basis for the comprehensive analysis of anomalous thermal transport in Weyl superconductors.</description>

      <title>Accurate Electron-phonon Interactions from Advanced Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is key for understanding many properties of materials such as superconductivity and electric resistivity. Although first principles density-functional-theory (DFT) based EPC calculations are used widely, their efficacy is limited by the accuracy and efficiency of the underlying exchange-correlation functionals. These limitations become exacerbated in complex $d$- and $f$-electron materials, where beyond-DFT approaches and empirical corrections, such as the Hubbard $U$, are commonly invoked. Here, using the examples of CoO and NiO, we show how the efficient r2scan density functional correctly captures strong EPC effects in transition-metal oxides without requiring the introduction of empirical parameters. We also demonstrate the ability of r2scan to accurately model phonon-mediated superconducting properties of the main group compounds (e.g., MgB$_2$), with improved electronic bands and phonon dispersions over those of traditional density functionals. Our study provides a pathway for extending the scope of accurate first principles modeling of electron-phonon interactions to encompass complex $d$-electron materials.</description>
