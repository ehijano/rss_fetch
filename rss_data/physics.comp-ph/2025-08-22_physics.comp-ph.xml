      <title>GEN2: A Generative Prediction-Correction Framework for Long-time Emulations of Spatially-Resolved Climate Extremes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately quantifying the increased risks of climate extremes requires generating large ensembles of climate realization across a wide range of emissions scenarios, which is computationally challenging for conventional Earth System Models. We propose GEN2, a generative prediction-correction framework for an efficient and accurate forecast of the extreme event statistics. The prediction step is constructed as a conditional Gaussian emulator, followed by a non-Gaussian machine-learning (ML) correction step. The ML model is trained on pairs of the reference data and the emulated fields nudged towards the reference, to ensure the training is robust to chaos. We first validate the accuracy of our model on historical ERA5 data and then demonstrate the extrapolation capabilities on various future climate change scenarios. When trained on a single realization of one warming scenario, our model accurately predicts the statistics of extreme events in different scenarios, successfully extrapolating beyond the distribution of training data.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Analog and the Probabilistic Computing Divide: Configuring Oscillator Ising Machines as P-bit Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oscillator Ising Machines (OIMs) and probabilistic bit (p-bit)-based computing platforms have emerged as promising paradigms for tackling complex combinatorial optimization problems. Although traditionally viewed as distinct approaches, this work presents a theoretically grounded framework for configuring OIMs as p-bit engines. We demonstrate that this functionality can be enabled through a novel interplay between first- and second harmonic injection to the oscillators. Our work identifies new synergies between the two methods and broadens the scope of applications for OIMs. We further show that the proposed approach can be applied to other analog dynamical systems, such as the Dynamical Ising Machine.</description>

      <title>The CP2K Program Package Made Simple</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CP2K is a versatile open-source software package for simulations across a wide range of atomistic systems, from isolated molecules in the gas phase to low-dimensional functional materials and interfaces, as well as highly symmetric crystalline solids, disordered amorphous glasses, and weakly interacting soft-matter systems in the liquid state and in solution. This review highlights CP2K's capabilities for computing both static and dynamical properties using quantum-mechanical and classical simulation methods. In contrast to the accompanying theory and code paper [J. Chem. Phys. 152, 194103 (2020)], the focus here is on the practical usage and applications of CP2K, with underlying theoretical concepts introduced only as needed.</description>

      <title>Investigating the sliding behavior of graphene nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a Euler-Bernoulli beam finite element (FE) model to study the interlayer interaction mechanics of graphene nanoribbon (GNR) over a graphene substrate. The FE model is calibrated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations employing the potential of Kolmogorov and Crespi. This study focuses mainly on the effect of boundary conditions on sliding behavior and strain transfer between layers when the substrate is subjected to uniform biaxial deformations. The interlayer shearing or sliding behavior is found to depend on the presence of critical parameters, namely, the applied strain to the substrate and the length of the GNR. The FE results indicate that the applied strain transferred from the substrate to the GNR varies linearly up to a critical value ec beyond which it decreases suddenly. Further, ec is found to appear beyond a critical GNR length, Le is approximately 10 nm. Furthermore, a length parameter Ld is approximately 10 nm is computed, beyond which the sliding of GNR is dissipative. Through FE simulations, it is also found that for a GNR length is greater than or equal to 17 nm, the edge pulling force saturates. Our results also highlight the importance of the inertia of GNR on its sliding for different boundary conditions. It is also concluded that the maximum strain that can be transferred to GNR lies between 0.57% and 1.15%. The results of the FE approach align with MD simulations within an error of approximately 10% that can be attributed to the choice of material parameters and the simulation setup.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-spectral model of elastic-wave propagation through toothed-whale head anatomy, and implications for biosonar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sound-localization and, in particular, biosonar system of toothed whales is exceptionally performant. How this is achieved is not clear, given that: (i) toothed whales have no pinnae; (ii) while their auditory pathways have been studied in detail, no specific feature apparently replacing the pinna has been identified. In this study, we employ a pseudo-spectral time domain (PSTD) numerical scheme to model three-dimensional elastic wave propagation through a toothed-whale head including soft tissues. Computed tomography (CT) scans were utilized to build a three-dimensional velocity-density model of the specimen's head, parametrized on a high-resolution $1.11$ mm voxel grid. We first validate our wave propagation solver, identifying a range of frequencies and spatial scale lengths where the PSTD scheme captures the complexities of elastic wave propagation through toothed-whale anatomy. We next focus on the toothed whale's ability to locate sources on the median plane, where the role of anatomy is crucial. A 45 kHz central frequency burst (dolphin-like click) was modeled and directed at elevation angles from $-90^\circ$ to $+90^\circ$ in $5^\circ$ steps along the midsagittal plane. We find that the incoming sound can be localized, via correlation, from the reverberated portion of the time-domain waveforms recorded at the tympano-periotic complex locations.</description>

      <title>Non-overlapping, Schwarz-type Domain Decomposition Method for Physics and Equality Constrained Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13644v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a non-overlapping, Schwarz-type domain decomposition method with a generalized interface condition, designed for physics-informed machine learning of partial differential equations (PDEs) in both forward and inverse contexts. Our approach employs physics and equality-constrained artificial neural networks (PECANN) within each subdomain. Unlike the original PECANN method, which relies solely on initial and boundary conditions to constrain PDEs, our method uses both boundary conditions and the governing PDE to constrain a unique interface loss function for each subdomain. This modification improves the learning of subdomain-specific interface parameters while reducing communication overhead by delaying information exchange between neighboring subdomains. To address the constrained optimization in each subdomain, we apply an augmented Lagrangian method with a conditionally adaptive update strategy, transforming the problem into an unconstrained dual optimization. A distinct advantage of our domain decomposition method is its ability to learn solutions to both Poisson's and Helmholtz equations, even in cases with high-wavenumber and complex-valued solutions. Through numerical experiments with up to 64 subdomains, we demonstrate that our method consistently generalizes well as the number of subdomains increases.</description>

      <title>A fourth order sharp immersed method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with stationary and moving boundaries and interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a fourth order Navier-Stokes solver based on the immersed interface method (IIM), for flow problems with stationary and one-way coupled moving boundaries and interfaces. Our algorithm employs a Runge-Kutta-based projection method that maintains high-order temporal accuracy in both velocity and pressure for steady and unsteady velocity boundary conditions. Fourth order spatial accuracy is achieved through a novel fifth order IIM discretization scheme for the advection term, as well as existing high-order interface-corrected finite difference schemes for the other differential operators. Using a set of manufactured flow problems with stationary and moving boundaries, we demonstrate fourth order convergence of velocity and pressure in the infinity norm, both inside the domain and on the immersed boundaries. The solver's performance is further validated through a range of practical flow simulations, highlighting its efficiency over a second order scheme. Finally, we showcase the ability of our immersed discretization scheme to handle interface-coupled multiphysics problems by solving a conjugate heat transfer problem with multiple immersed solids. Overall, the proposed approach robustly combines the efficiency of high order discretization schemes with the flexibility of immersed discretizations for flow problems with complex, moving boundaries and interfaces.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Convergence of Symmetric Triangle Quadrature Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetric polynomial quadrature rules for triangles are commonly used to efficiently integrate two-dimensional domains in finite-element-type problems. While the development of such rules focuses on the maximum degree a given number of points can exactly integrate, smooth integrands are generally not polynomials of finite degree. Therefore, for such integrands, one needs to balance integration accuracy and computational cost. A natural approach to this balance is to choose the number of points such that the convergence rate with respect to the mesh size $h$ matches that of the other properties of the scheme, such as the planar or curved triangles that approximate the geometry or the basis functions that approximate the solution.
  In general, it is expected that a quadrature rule capable of integrating polynomials up to degree $d$ yields an integration error that is $\mathcal{O}(h^p)$, where $p=d+1$. However, as we describe in this paper, for symmetric triangle quadrature rules, when $d$ is even, $p=d+2$; therefore, for a $p^\text{th}$-order-accurate quadrature rule, fewer quadrature points are necessary, reducing the time required for matrix assembly in finite-element-type problems. This reduction in cost is modest for local differential operators that yield sparse matrices but appreciable for global integral operators that yield dense matrices.
  In this paper, we briefly summarize the details of symmetric triangle quadrature rules, discuss error implications for quadrature rules for one dimension and triangles, and we provide numerical examples that support our observation that polynomials that exactly integrate even maximum degrees converge faster than the conventional expectation for sequences of regular meshes.</description>

      <title>On the Performance of Linear Adaptive Filters driven by the Ergodic Chaotic Logistic Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chaotic dynamical systems are increasingly considered for use in coding and transmission systems. This stems from their parameter sensitivity and spectral characteristics. The latter are relevant for channel estimation methods. In particular the logistic map $f_\lambda =\lambda x\left( 1-x\right) $ has been employed in chaotic coding and spread spectrum transmission systems. For $\lambda =4$ the statistical properties of sequences generated by $f_4$ are considered as ideal drive signals for channel estimation schemes. This assumption is proven in the present paper. To this end the higher order statistical moments and the autocorrelation of time series generated by $f_4$ are derived. It is shown that for $\lambda =4$ the zero mean time series is uncorrelated. The adaptation performance of finite impulse response (FIR) digital adaptive filters (DAF) used for channel estimation is analyzed. It is shown that using zero mean sequences of $f_4$ leads to the maximal possible FIR DAF performance. An optimal value for the damping parameter in the LMS scheme is derived that leads to the maximal performance and ensures stability. The analytic considerations are confirmed by simulation results.</description>

      <title>Obstacle-tuned transition from chaotic to coherent vortex flows and odd diffusion in chiral active fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of a suspension of rotating colloids with a periodically patterned structure is here investigated by means of continuum theoretical predictions and hydrodynamic simulations. Close to the obstacle surface, rotors circulate opposite to their inherent direction of rotation as a result of unidirectional rotational stresses, which is in agreement with a prediction of the generalised Stokes equation. The resulting stationary background flow significantly affects the system dynamics and coexists with the intrinsic active turbulent behaviour. The relative importance of either of the two contributions can be controlled with the rotor density and the obstacle size, such that the system is either dominated by stationary vortices pinned to the obstacles or vivid active turbulent dynamics. While momentum dissipation into an underlying frictional substrate damps the related flows, small values of the friction can enhance the vortex flow around an obstacle. The colloids' diffusive dynamics are governed by odd diffusive fluxes guiding the colloids around the excluded volume introduced by obstacles, such that enhanced effective diffusive transport is obtained at finite obstruction. Our results pave the way to systematically address how confinement can be employed in order to control or harness the dynamics of colloidal chiral active turbulence and how the interplay of emerging edge currents and active turbulent dynamics at varying densities can be systematically determined.</description>

      <title>Constrained Random Phase Approximation: the spectral method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new constrained Random Phase Approximation (cRPA) method, termed spectral cRPA (s-cRPA), and compare it to established cRPA approaches for Scandium and Copper by varying the 3d shell filling. The s-cRPA consistently yields larger Hubbard $U$ interaction values. Applied to the realistic system CaFeO$_3$, s-cRPA produces interaction parameters significantly closer to those required within DFT+$U$ to induce the experimentally observed insulating state, overcoming the metallic behavior predicted by standard density functionals. We also address the issue of negative interaction values found in the projector cRPA method for filled d-shells, demonstrating that s-cRPA offers superior numerical stability through electron conversion. Overall, s-cRPA is more robust and effectively overcomes the known underestimation of $U$ in standard cRPA, making it a promising tool for the community. Additionally, we have enhanced our implementation with features for computing multi-center interactions to analyze spatial decay and developed a low-scaling variant with a compressed Matsubara grid to efficiently obtain full frequency-dependent interactions.</description>

      <title>An Uncertainty Visualization Framework for Large-Scale Cardiovascular Flow Simulations: A Case Study on Aortic Stenosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a generalizable uncertainty quantification (UQ) and visualization framework for lattice Boltzmann method simulations of high Reynolds number vascular flows, demonstrated on a patient-specific stenosed aorta. The framework combines EasyVVUQ for parameter sampling with large-eddy simulation turbulence modeling in HemeLB, and executes ensembles on the Frontier exascale supercomputer. Spatially resolved metrics, including entropy and isosurface-crossing probability, are used to map uncertainty in pressure and wall shear stress fields directly onto vascular geometries. Two sources of model variability are examined: inlet peak velocity and the Smagorinsky constant. Inlet velocity variation produces high uncertainty downstream of the stenosis where turbulence develops, while upstream regions remain stable. Smagorinsky constant variation has little effect on the large-scale pressure field but increases WSS uncertainty in localized high-shear regions. In both cases, the stenotic throat manifests low entropy, indicative of robust identification of elevated WSS. By linking quantitative UQ measures to three-dimensional anatomy, the framework improves interpretability over conventional 1D UQ plots and supports clinically relevant decision-making, with broad applicability to vascular flow problems requiring both accuracy and spatial insight.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised physics-informed generative networks for phase retrieval from a single X-ray hologram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray phase contrast imaging significantly improves the visualization of structures with weak or uniform absorption, broadening its applications across a wide range of scientific disciplines. Propagation-based phase contrast is particularly suitable for time- or dose-critical in vivo/in situ/operando (tomography) experiments because it requires only a single intensity measurement. However, the phase information of the wave field is lost during the measurement and must be recovered. Conventional algebraic and iterative methods often rely on specific approximations or boundary conditions that may not be met by many samples or experimental setups. In addition, they require manual tuning of reconstruction parameters by experts, making them less adaptable for complex or variable conditions. Here we present a self-learning approach for solving the inverse problem of phase retrieval in the near-field regime of Fresnel theory using a single intensity measurement (hologram). A physics-informed generative adversarial network is employed to reconstruct both the phase and absorbance of the unpropagated wave field in the sample plane from a single hologram. Unlike most deep learning approaches for phase retrieval, our approach does not require paired, unpaired, or simulated training data. This significantly broadens the applicability of our approach, as acquiring or generating suitable training data remains a major challenge due to the wide variability in sample types and experimental configurations. The algorithm demonstrates robust and consistent performance across diverse imaging conditions and sample types, delivering quantitative, high-quality reconstructions for both simulated data and experimental datasets acquired at beamline P05 at PETRA III (DESY, Hamburg), operated by Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon. Furthermore, it enables the simultaneous retrieval of both phase and absorption information.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning of a biflagellate model microswimmer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many microswimmers are able to swim through viscous fluids by employing periodic non-reciprocal deformations of their appendages. Here we use a simple microswimmer model inspired by swimming biflagellates which consists of a spherical cell body and two small spherical beads representing the motion of the two flagella. Using reinforcement learning we identify for different microswimmer morphologies quasi-optimized swimming strokes. For all studied cases the identified strokes result in symmetric and quasi-synchronized beating of the two flagella beads. Interestingly, the stroke-averaged flow fields are of pusher type, and the observed swimming gaits outperform previously used biflagellate microswimmer models relying on predefined circular flagella bead motion.</description>

      <title>Universal Machine Learning Potential for Systems with Reduced Dimensionality</title>

Abstract: We present a benchmark designed to evaluate the predictive capabilities of universal machine learning interatomic potentials across systems of varying dimensionality. Specifically, our benchmark tests zero- (molecules, atomic clusters, etc.), one- (nanowires, nanoribbons, nanotubes, etc.), two- (atomic layers and slabs) and three-dimensional (bulk materials) compounds. The benchmark reveals that while all tested models demonstrate excellent performance for three-dimensional systems, accuracy degrades progressively for lower-dimensional structures. The best performing models for geometry optimization are orbital version 2, equiformerV2, and the equivariant Smooth Energy Network, with the equivariant Smooth Energy Network also providing the most accurate energies. Our results indicate that the best models yield, on average, errors in the atomic positions in the range of 0.01-0.02 angstrom and errors in the energy below 10~meV/atom across all dimensionalities. These results demonstrate that state-of-the-art universal machine learning interatomic potentials have reached sufficient accuracy to serve as direct replacements for density functional theory calculations, at a small fraction of the computational cost, in simulations spanning the full range from isolated atoms to bulk solids. More significantly, the best performing models already enable efficient simulations of complex systems containing subsystems of mixed dimensionality, opening new possibilities for modeling realistic materials and interfaces.</description>

      <title>Trotter-based quantum algorithm for solving transport equations with exponentially fewer time-steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extent to which quantum computers can simulate physical phenomena and solve the partial differential equations (PDEs) that govern them remains a central open question. In this work, one of the most fundamental PDEs is addressed: the multidimensional transport equation with space- and time-dependent coefficients. We present a quantum numerical scheme based on three steps: quantum state preparation, evolution, and measurement of relevant observables. The evolution step combines a high-order centered finite difference with a time-splitting scheme based on product formula approximations, also known as Trotterization. Novel numerical analysis is introduced to bound the different sources of error and we prove that, for the product formula approximations, vector norm analysis guarantees similar accuracy with exponentially fewer time steps than operator-norm-based approaches, thereby significantly reducing the projected computational resources. We also present efficient quantum circuits and numerical simulations that confirm the predicted vector-norm scaling. We report results on real quantum hardware for the one-dimensional convection equation, and solve a non-linear ordinary differential equation via its associated Liouville equation, a particular case of transport equations. This work provides a practical framework for efficiently simulating transport phenomena on quantum computers, with potential applications in plasma physics, molecular gas dynamics and non-linear dynamical systems, including chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>Regularized Perturbation Theory for Ab initio Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) for ab initio simulations of solids is often limited by divergence or over-correlation issues, particularly in metallic, narrow-gap, and dispersion-stabilized systems. We develop and assess three regularized second-order perturbation theories: $\kappa$-MP2, $\sigma$-MP2, and the size-consistent Brillouin-Wigner approach (BW-s2), across metals, semiconductors, molecular crystals, and rare gas solids. BW-s2 achieves high accuracy for cohesive energies, lattice constants, and bulk moduli in metals, semiconductors, and molecular crystals, rivaling or surpassing coupled-cluster with singles and doubles at lower cost. In rare gas solids, where MP2 already underbinds, $\kappa$-MP2 does not make the results much worse while BW-s2 struggles. These results illustrate both the potential and the limitations of regularized perturbation theory for efficient and accurate solid-state simulations. While broader testing is warranted, BW-s2($\alpha$ = 2) appears particularly promising, with possible advantages over modern random-phase approximations and coupled-cluster theory.</description>
