      <title>Bridging the gap between micro-economics and micro-mobility: a two-dimensional risk-based microscopic model of pedestrians' and bicyclists' operational behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the inherent safety concerns associated with traffic movement in unconstrained two-dimensional settings, it is important that pedestrians' and other modes' movements such as bicyclists are modeled as a risk-taking stochastic dynamic process that may lead to errors and thus contacts and collisions. Among the existing models that may capture risk-taking behaviors are: 1) the social force models (through the interplay of the repulsion and the attraction force parameters); 2) and the discrete-choice models (through the rationality or the bounded rationality paradigm while weighing different alternatives). Given that the social force models may not readily capture the contact/collision dynamics through the Newtonian force framework, decision-making theories are hypothesized as a feasible approach to formulate a new model that can account for cognitive and behavioral dimensions such as uncertainty and risk. However, instead of relying on the bounded rationality theory, in this paper, a generalized Prospect Theory based microsimulation model is proposed. The model relies on the micro-economics Prospect Theory paradigm where pedestrians or bicyclists (i.e., micro-mobility users) evaluate their speed and directional alternatives while considering the possibility of colliding with other obstacles/users. A numerical analysis on the main model parameters is presented. The model is then calibrated and validated using two real-world data sets with trajectories recorded in naturalistic settings. With the calibrated parameters studied, simulation exercises and sensitivity analysis are conducted to recreate bottlenecks and lane formations in different conditions. The findings show that the proposed model's parameters reflect the risk-taking tendencies of different roadway users in mixed right-of-way's environments while showing realistic microscopic and macroscopic traffic flow characteristics.</description>

      <title>Characterizing limit order books in call auctions of a stock market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been little research on limit order books in call auctions of stock markets, where trades are executed at a single point in time, although there has been extensive research on continuous auctions, where trades are executed sequentially. This study focuses on the limit order books in the call auctions, with the aim of identifying their shapes and clarifying the relation between these shapes and the trading volume. Using data for all stocks listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, we found that the shape of the limit order books in call auctions are well fitted by the hyperbolic tangent function. We defined the median spread and the width of limit orders from the fitting parameters. When the median spread and the width were plotted for all stocks, we observed interesting distributions depending on the attributes of the stocks and the company performances. Furthermore, we showed that the trading volume can be represented by the median spread and the width. The main contribution of this research is to demonstrate that median spread and the width are useful indicators for characterizing the states of the limit order books in the call auctions.</description>

      <title>Gender and the influence of research environment in topic selection of early-career faculty in STEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the influence that research environments have in shaping careers of early-career faculty in terms of their research portfolio. We find that departments exert an attractive force over early-career newcomer faculty, who after their incorporation increase their within-department collaborations, and work on topics closer to those of incumbent faculty. However, these collaborations are not gender blind: Newcomers collaborate less than expected with female senior incumbents. The analysis of departments grouped by fraction of female incumbents reveals that female newcomers in departments with above the median fractions of female incumbents tend to select research topics farther from their department than female newcomers in the remaining departments -- a difference we do not observe for male newcomers. Our results suggest a relationship between the collaboration deficit with female incumbents and the selection of research topics of female early-faculty, thus highlighting the importance of studying research environments to fully understand gender differences in academia.</description>

      <title>Statistical Laws in Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical laws describe regular patterns observed in diverse scientific domains, ranging from the magnitude of earthquakes (Gutenberg-Richter law) and metabolic rates in organisms (Kleiber's law), to the frequency distribution of words in texts (Zipf's and Herdan-Heaps' laws), and productivity metrics of cities (urban scaling laws). The origins of these laws, their empirical validity, and the insights they provide into underlying systems have been subjects of scientific inquiry for centuries. This monograph provides an unifying approach to the study of statistical laws, critically evaluating their role in the theoretical understanding of complex systems and the different data-analysis methods used to evaluate them. Through a historical review and a unified analysis, we uncover that the persistent controversies on the validity of statistical laws are predominantly rooted not in novel empirical findings but in the discordance among data-analysis techniques, mechanistic models, and the interpretations of statistical laws. Starting with simple examples and progressing to more advanced time-series and statistical methods, this monograph and its accompanying repository provide comprehensive material for researchers interested in analyzing data, testing and comparing different laws, and interpreting results in both existing and new datasets.</description>

      <title>Performance of Higher-Order Networks in Reconstructing Sequential Paths: from Micro to Macro Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Activities such as the movement of passengers and goods, the transfer of physical or digital assets, web navigation and even successive passes in football, result in timestamped paths through a physical or virtual network. The need to analyse such paths has produced a new modelling paradigm in the form of higher-order networks which are able to capture temporal and topological characteristics of sequential data. This has been complemented by sequence mining approaches, a key example being sequential motifs measuring the prevalence of recurrent subsequences. Previous work on higher-order networks has focused on how to identify the optimal order for a path dataset, where the order can be thought of as the number of steps of memory encoded in the model. In this paper, we build on these approaches to consider which orders are necessary to reproduce different path characteristics, from path lengths to counts of sequential motifs, viewing paths generated from different higher-order models as null models which capture features of the data up to a certain order, and randomised otherwise. Furthermore, we provide an important extension to motif counting, whereby cases with self-loops, starting nodes, and ending nodes of paths are taken into consideration. Conducting a thorough analysis using path lengths and sequential motifs on a diverse range of path datasets, we show that our approach can shed light on precisely where models of different order overperform or underperform, and what this may imply about the original path data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the problem of community detection in signed networks. We propose SignedLouvain, an adaptation of the Louvain method to maximise signed modularity, efficiently taking advantage of the structure induced by signed relations. We begin by identifying the inherent limitations of applying the standard Louvain algorithm to signed networks, before introducing a novel variant specifically engineered to overcome these challenges. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method not only maintains the speed and scalability of its predecessor but also significantly enhances accuracy in detecting communities within signed networks.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Farmland Biodiversity Loss: A Bio-Economic Model of Land Consolidation and Pesticide Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biodiversity loss driven by agricultural intensification is a pressing global issue, with significant implications for ecosystem stability and human well-being. We design an integrated bio-economic agent-based model, informed by historical data from the French agricultural sector, to project future biodiversity trends and evaluate policy interventions. Our model predicts further biodiversity decline under a business-as-usual scenario, primarily due to intensified land consolidation. We evaluate two policy options: reducing pesticide use and subsidizing small farmers. While pesticide reduction rapidly benefits biodiversity in the beginning, it eventually leads to increased land consolidation and further biodiversity loss. In contrast, subsidizing small farmers by reallocating a small fraction of existing subsidies, stabilizes farm sizes and enhances biodiversity in the long run. The most effective strategy results from combining both policies, leveraging pesticide reduction alongside targeted subsidies to balance economic pressures and consistently improve biodiversity.</description>

      <title>Transmission grid stability with large interregional power flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general methodology for identifying critical lines in the long-distance transmission of power across large electric grids. When the system is pushed to its operational limit, for instance by large power imbalances such as those generated by high penetration of variable renewable energy sources, the network gets destabilized and loses synchrony. We investigate a model of the synchronous AC grid of continental Europe under tunable large interregional power flows. When those flows exceed some critical value, we find that instabilities emerge due to topological constraints. We identify two different scenarios triggering these instabilities. In the first one, specific sets of lines reach their maximal load simultaneously, causing the grid to split into two desynchronized zones. In the second one, one or few lines become overloaded, which eventually renders one Lyapunov exponent positive. The first scenario is obviously less generic and we develop a numerical approach to force the splitting of the AC grid into disconnected areas. Remarkably, the critical lines identified in this way match those that triggered the separation of the synchronous grid of continental Europe in two instances in 2021. We further discuss how the modes of the system provide information on which areas are more susceptible to lose synchrony with each other.</description>

      <title>Exploring the space of graphs with fixed discrete curvatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete curvatures are quantities associated to the nodes and edges of a graph that reflect the local geometry around them. These curvatures have a rich mathematical theory and they have recently found success as a tool to analyze networks across a wide range of domains. In this work, we consider the problem of constructing graphs with a prescribed set of discrete edge curvatures, and explore the space of such graphs. We address this problem in two ways: first, we develop an evolutionary algorithm to sample graphs with discrete curvatures close to a given set. We use this algorithm to explore how other network statistics vary when constrained by the discrete curvatures in the network. Second, we solve the exact reconstruction problem for the specific case of Forman-Ricci curvature. By leveraging the theory of Markov bases, we obtain a finite set of rewiring moves that connects the space of all graphs with a fixed discrete curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the robustness of random networks reinforced by adding hidden edges against targeted attacks. This study focuses on two types of reinforcement: uniform reinforcement, where edges are randomly added to all nodes, and selective reinforcement, where edges are randomly added only to the minimum degree nodes of the given network. We use generating functions to derive the giant component size and the critical threshold for the targeted attacks on reinforced networks. Applying our analysis and Monte Carlo simulations to the targeted attacks on scale-free networks, it becomes clear that selective reinforcement significantly improves the robustness of networks against the targeted attacks.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional shape and connectivity of physical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data describing the three-dimensional structure of physical networks is increasingly available, leading to a surge of interest in network science to explore the relationship between the shape and connectivity of physical networks. We contribute to this effort by standardizing and analyzing 15 data sets from different domains. Each network is made of tube-like objects bound together at junction points, which we treat as nodes, with the connections between them considered as links. We divide these networks into three categories: lattice-like networks, trees, and linked trees. The degree distribution of these physical networks is bounded, with most nodes having degrees one or three. Characterizing the physical properties of links, we show that links have an elongated shape and tend to follow a nearly straight trajectory, while a small fraction of links follow a winding path. These typical node and link properties must be reflected by physical network models. We also measure how confined a link is in space by comparing its trajectory to a randomized null model, showing that links that are central in the abstract network tend to be physically confined by their neighbors. The fact that the shape and connectivity of the physical networks are intertwined highlights that their three-dimensional layout must be taken into account to understand the evolution and function of physical networks.</description>

      <title>Bounded-Confidence Models of Opinion Dynamics with Adaptive Confidence Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07563v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: People's opinions change with time as they interact with each other. In a bounded-confidence model (BCM) of opinion dynamics, individuals (which are represented by the nodes of a network) have continuous-valued opinions and are influenced by neighboring nodes whose opinions are sufficiently similar to theirs (i.e., are within a confidence bound). In this paper, we formulate and analyze discrete-time BCMs with heterogeneous and adaptive confidence bounds. We introduce two new models: (1) a BCM with synchronous opinion updates that generalizes the Hegselmann--Krause (HK) model and (2) a BCM with asynchronous opinion updates that generalizes the Deffuant--Weisbuch (DW) model. We analytically and numerically explore our adaptive BCMs' limiting behaviors, including the confidence-bound dynamics, the formation of clusters of nodes with similar opinions, and the time evolution of an "effective graph", which is a time-dependent subgraph of a network with edges between nodes that {are currently receptive to each other.} For a variety of networks and a wide range of values of the parameters that control the increase and decrease of confidence bounds, we demonstrate numerically that our adaptive BCMs result in fewer major opinion clusters and longer convergence times than the baseline (i.e., nonadaptive) BCMs. We also show that our adaptive BCMs can have adjacent nodes that converge to the same opinion but are not {receptive to each other.} This qualitative behavior does not occur in the associated baseline BCMs.</description>

      <title>Mapping Election Polarization and Competitiveness using Election Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simplified hypothesis that an election is polarized as an explanation of recent electoral outcomes worldwide is centered on perceptions of voting patterns rather than ideological data from the electorate. While the literature focuses on measuring polarization using ideological-like data from electoral studies-which are limited to economically advantageous countries and are representative mostly to national scales-we argue that, in fact, voting patterns can lead to mapping effective proxies of citizen divisions on election day. This paper perspectives two complementary concepts, Election Polarization (EP) and Election Competitiveness (EC), as a means to understand voting patterns on Election Day. We present an agnostic approach that relies solely on election data and validate it using synthetic and real-world election data across 13 countries in the Eurozone, North America, Latin America, and New Zealand. Overall, we find that we can label and distinguish expectations of polarized and competitive elections in these countries, and we report that EP positively correlates with a metric of political polarization in the U.S., unlocking opportunities for studies of polarization at the regional level and for lower/middle-income countries where electoral studies are available, but surveys are limited.</description>

      <title>Assessing your Observatory's Impact: Best Practices in Establishing and Maintaining Observatory Bibliographies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observatories need to measure and evaluate the scientific output and overall impact of their facilities. An observatory bibliography consists of the papers published using that observatory's data, typically gathered by searching the major journals for relevant keywords. Recently, the volume of literature and methods by which the publications pool is evaluated has increased. Efficient and standardized procedures are necessary to assign meaningful metadata; enable user-friendly retrieval; and provide the opportunity to derive reports, statistics, and visualizations to impart a deeper understanding of the research output. In 2021, a group of observatory bibliographers from around the world convened online to continue the discussions presented in Lagerstrom (2015). We worked to extract general guidelines from our experiences, techniques, and lessons learnt. The paper explores the development, application, and current status of telescope bibliographies and future trends. This paper briefly describes the methodologies employed in constructing databases, along with the various bibliometric techniques used to analyze and interpret them. We explain reasons for non-standardization and why it is essential for each observatory to identify metadata and metrics that are meaningful for them; caution the (over-)use of comparisons among facilities that are, ultimately, not comparable through bibliometrics; and highlight the benefits of telescope bibliographies, both for researchers within the astronomical community and for stakeholders beyond the specific observatories. There is tremendous diversity in the ways bibliographers track publications and maintain databases, due to parameters such as resources, type of observatory, historical practices, and reporting requirements to funders and outside agencies. However, there are also common sets of Best Practices.</description>
