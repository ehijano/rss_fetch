      <title>Quantum droplets in one-dimensional mixtures of quasi Bose-Einstein condensates and Tonks-Girardeau gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While binary atomic Bose-Einstein condensates are typically prone to collapse under strong interspecies attraction, it has been shown that higher-order fluctuation corrections, known as Lee-Huang-Yang corrections, can stabilize the mixture. In this work, we demonstrate an alternative stabilization mechanism based on kinetic energy. Specifically, we consider a one-dimensional mixture of a quasi-BEC and a Tonks-Girardeau gas, and show that the kinetic energy of the TG component can counteract the interspecies attraction, thereby preventing collapse. This balance leads to the formation of a self-bound quantum droplet, which exhibits two distinct regimes: a low-density and a high-density droplet. We argue that these regimes are smoothly connected by a crossover. Furthermore, an analysis of the derivatives of the ground state energy reveals that the transition from a miscible mixture to the droplet phase is of third order. Our findings extend the theoretical understanding of quantum droplets in low-dimensional quantum gases, and the proposed system is experimentally accessible within current ultracold atom platforms.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy as a probe of topological phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy (EE) provides a powerful probe of quantum phases, yet its role in identifying topological transitions in disordered systems remains underexplored. We introduce an exact EE-based framework that captures topological phase transitions even in the presence of disorder. Specifically, for a class of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model variants, we show that the difference in EE between half-filled and near-half-filled ground states, $\Delta S^{\mathcal{A}}$, vanishes in the topological phase but remains finite in the trivial phase -- a direct consequence of edge-state localization. This behavior persists even in the presence of quasiperiodic or binary disorder. Exact phase boundaries, derived from Lyapunov exponents via transfer matrices, agree closely with numerical results from $\Delta S^{\mathcal{A}}$ and the topological invariant $\mathcal{Q}$, with instances where $\Delta S^{\mathcal{A}}$ outperforms $\mathcal{Q}$. Our results highlight EE as a robust diagnostic tool and a potential bridge between quantum information and condensed matter approaches to topological matter.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-Driven Topological Phase Transition in Quantum Open Systems Independent of system Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate dissipation-driven topological phase transitions in one-dimensional quantum open systems governed by the Lindblad equation with linear dissipation operators, which ensure the density matrix retains its Gaussian form throughout the dynamics. By employing the modular Hamiltonian framework, we rigorously demonstrate that the $\rm{Z}_2$ topological invariant characterizing steady states in one-dimensional class D systems is exclusively dependent on the dissipation operators, rather than the system Hamiltonian. Through a quench protocol where the system evolves from the steady state of one Lindbladian to another, we reveal that topological transitions can occur at analytically predictable critical times, even when the initial and final steady states share identical topological indices. These transitions are shown, both theoretically and numerically, to depend solely on dissipation parameters. Entanglement spectrum analysis demonstrates bulk-edge correspondence in non-equilibrium density matrices via coexisting single-particle gap closures (periodic boundaries) and topologically protected zero modes (open boundaries), directly underpinning the detection of dissipation-induced topology in quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Symmetry classification correspondence between quadratic Lindbladians and their steady states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry classification is crucial in understanding universal properties of quantum matter. Recently, the scope of symmetry classification has been extended to open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation. However, the classification of Lindbladians and steady states remains largely separate. Because the former requires the non-Hermitian classification framework, while the latter relies on the classification scheme for Hermitian matrices. In this paper we build connections between symmetry classes of quadratic Lindbladian and its steady state, despite their different classification frameworks. We classify the full matrix representation of generic quadratic Lindbladians with particle conservation, showing they fall into 27 non-Hermitian symmetry classes. Among these, 22 classes lead to an infinite-temperature steady state. The remaining five classes have one-to-one correspondence with five steady-state Hermitian symmetry classes. Numerical simulations of random Lindbladian dynamics confirm the convergence to the correct steady-state symmetry classes at long time.</description>

      <title>Continuously trapped matter-wave interferometry in magic Floquet-Bloch band structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11881v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trapped matter-wave interferometry offers the promise of compact high-precision local force sensing. However, noise in the trap itself can introduce new systematic errors which are absent in traditional free-fall interferometers. We describe and demonstrate an intrinsically noise-tolerant Floquet-engineered platform for continuously trapped atom interferometry. A non-interacting degenerate quantum gas undergoes position-space Bloch oscillations through an amplitude-modulated optical lattice, whose resulting Floquet-Bloch band structure includes Landau-Zener beamsplitters and Bragg mirrors, forming the components of a Mach-Zehnder interferometric force sensor. We identify, realize, and experimentally characterize magic band structures, analogous to the magic wavelengths employed in optical lattice clocks, for which the interferometric phase is insensitive to lattice intensity noise. We leverage the intrinsic programmability of the Floquet band synthesis approach to demonstrate a variety of interferometer structures, highlighting the potential of this technique for quantum force sensors which are tunable, compact, simple, and robust.</description>

      <title>Early time hydrodynamic attractor in a nearly-unitary Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic attractors paradigm aims to explain the applicability of hydrodynamics after a very short timescale in ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions at RHIC and LHC in terms of the emergence of universal behavior across different initial states. The attractors observed in theoretical models are first driven by a rapid expansion of matter, which later gives way to the decay of exponentially damped transient excitations into the viscous fluid regime. Recently, a theoretical proposal was made how to realize hydrodynamic attractors in cold atomic gases focusing on the decay of transients and opening prospects for a future experimental realization in table top experiments. Motivated by this, in the present paper we show how the far-from-equilibrium, expansion-driven part of the hydrodynamic attractor emerges in a model of a nearly-unitary Fermi gas.</description>
