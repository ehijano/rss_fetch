      <title>Trigonal warping enables linear optical spectroscopy in single-valley superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In superconductors with multiple pairing channels, Bardasis-Schrieffer modes and clapping modes arise as fluctuations in channels whose angular momenta differ from that of the pair condensate. Crystal symmetries often impose selection rules which keep these modes optically dark. We show that if pairing occurs around a single Fermi surface, trigonal warping renders both of these modes, as well as the quasiparticle excitation gap, visible in the longitudinal and Hall optical responses. Our results suggest that rhombohedral graphene multilayers, which are believe to host the required ingredients, might offer an ideal setting for the study of exotic superconducting collective modes.</description>

      <title>Oxygen incorporation in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ thin films: surface activation and degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The oxygen off-stoichiometry plays a pivotal role for the physical properties of superconducting oxides. Yet, there is a lack of knowledge on the fundamental processes of oxygen incorporation and correlated phenomena during oxygen post annealing treatments. Here, we deployed electrical probes ($\rho(T)$ and electrical conductivity relaxation (ECR) measurements) to gain a better understanding of the kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in epitaxial YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ (YBCO) thin films. We identified a new indicator for the onset temperature of oxygen incorporation and report for the first time drastic kinetic deactivation in bare YBCO. We demonstrate that surface decoration using silver micro islands both catalytically activates oxygen incorporation and bypasses surface degradation processes. Our results suggest that the ORR in the studied YBCO samples is limited by a surface reaction. Additionally, weak XRD signatures of the formation of extended bulk defects were identified, which have to be considered in the designing of an optimal oxygenation treatment to obtain best performing superconducting YBCO.</description>

      <title>Doping Evolution of Nodal Electron Dynamics in Trilayer Cuprate Superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$ Revealed by Laser-Based Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The doping evolution of the nodal electron dynamics in the trilayer cuprate superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$ (Bi2223) is investigated using high-resolution laser-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Bi2223 single crystals with different doping levels are prepared by controlled annealing which cover the underdoped, optimally-doped and overdoped regions. The electronic phase diagram of Bi2223 is established which describes the T$_\mathrm{c}$ dependence on the sample doping level. The doping dependence of the nodal Fermi momentum for the outer (OP) and inner (IP) CuO$_2$ planes is determined. Charge distribution imbalance between the OP and IP CuO$_2$ planes is quantified, showing enhanced disparity with increasing doping. Nodal band dispersions demonstrate a prominent kink at $\sim$94$\,$meV in the IP band, attributed to the unique Cu coordination in the IP plane, while a weaker $\sim$60$\,$meV kink is observed in the OP band. The nodal Fermi velocity of both OP and IP bands is nearly constant at $\sim$1.62$\,$eV\r{A} independent of doping. These results provide important information to understand the origin of high T$_\mathrm{c}$ and superconductivity mechanism in high temperature cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>2D bilayer electron-hole superfluidity with unequal and anisotropic masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of electron-hole superfluidity in two-dimensional bilayers with unequal and anisotropic effective masses. Using a zero-temperature, self-consistent Hartree-Fock approach, we study two experimentally relevant deviations from the ideal equal-mass isotropic case: (i) isotropic but unequal conduction and valence band masses ($m_c^* \neq m_v^*$), and (ii) equal average masses with orthogonal in-plane anisotropies $(m_{c,x}^*, m^*_{c,y}) = (m_1^*, m_2^*)$ and $(m^*_{v,x}, m^*_{v,y}) = (m_2^*, m_1^*)$. For both scenarios, we compute the order parameter and analyze the BEC-BCS crossover as a function of layer separation and mass ratio. We find that both mass imbalance and mass anisotropy reduce the pairing strength and suppress the inferred critical temperature $T_c$ by breaking perfect Fermi surface nesting, and shift the BEC-BCS crossover. Despite these effects, superfluidity remains robust across the full range of densities and interlayer separations considered, with no transition to an unpaired plasma state in the absence of screening. Our results provide a baseline for understanding the interplay of mass mismatch and anisotropy in current and emerging bilayer platforms, including van der Waals heterostructures and anisotropic two-dimensional semiconductors. Our work also establishes that Fermi surface nesting is not a key ingredient for the bilayer superfluidity, which is always the ground state for all electron-hole bilayers although the resultant $T_c$ depends on the parameter details and may very well be unmeasurably low for large interlayer separations.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Optical Evidence of Split Density Waves in Bilayer Nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing ultrafast optical pump-probe spectroscopy, we investigated the quasiparticle and spin dynamics in single crystals of bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Our experimental results unequivocally demonstrate the presence of two distinct density wave (DW)-like orders, manifesting with onset temperatures at $\sim$140 K and $\sim$115 K. Through time-resolved ellipticity measurements, we identified the higher-temperature order at 140 K ($T_{\rm SDW}$) as the onset of a spin density wave (SDW) with associated electronic nematicity. In contrast, the lower-temperature order is attributed to a charge order. A key finding is the differential response of these orders to photoexcitation: the charge order is entirely suppressed at a pump fluence of approximately 40 $\mu$J/cm$^2$, whereas the SDW order persists up to 200 $\mu$J/cm$^2$, albeit with its characteristic temperature suppressed to approximately 70 K. These compelling experimental observations provide critical insights into the coexistence and manipulability of density wave phenomena in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, laying a foundation for future research into their optical control.</description>

      <title>Twist-angle tunable Josephson junctions in three-dimensional superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the superconducting phase and perpendicular Josephson supercurrent in twisted three-dimensional (3D) superconductors, where two layered 3D materials are stacked with a relative twist. We formulate the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian and develop a self-consistent method to calculate the superconducting order parameter and the resulting supercurrent. Applying this framework to a toy model with Fermi surfaces located near the Brillouin zone corners, we demonstrate a phase discontinuity at the twisted interface, indicating that a Josephson junction is formed purely by the twist. Our calculations reveal that the interface supports a finite critical current even when the Fermi surfaces of the two superconductors are completely separated, unlike in the case of a twisted normal-metal interface. We further show that the critical current can be effectively controlled by the twist angle, transitioning from a high-transparency regime at small angles to a low-transparency regime at larger angles.</description>

      <title>Resonantly enhanced polariton-mediated superconductivity in a doped transition metal dichalcogenide monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a proposal for achieving light-induced superconductivity using exciton polaritons - hybrid light-matter particles of excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) and microcavity photons. In contrast to previous theories of polariton-mediated superconductivity, which typically require multiple semiconductor layers, we show that superconductivity can be induced within a single semiconductor monolayer with inverted conduction bands, such as in the tungsten-based transition metal dichalcogenides. The key ingredient is that we can resonantly excite exciton polaritons into bands that are different from those occupied by the doped electrons, thus avoiding any Pauli blocking effects. Crucially, we can exploit the trion fine structure (i.e., multiple exciton-electron bound states) and tune the electron-polariton interactions via Feshbach resonances. Our theory of polariton-mediated superconductivity includes the energy dependence of the polariton-mediated interactions between electrons, as well as the polariton-induced changes to the electron quasiparticles. We find that superconductivity at elevated temperatures is within reach of current experiments.</description>

      <title>Parasitic RF-SQUIDs in superconducting qubits due to wirebonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits show great promise to realize practical quantum computers from micro-fabricated integrated circuits. However, their solid-state architecture bears the burden of parasitic modes in qubit materials and the control circuitry which cause decoherence and interfere with qubits. Here, we present evidence that wirebonds, which are used to contact the micro-circuits and to realize chip-to-chip airbridges, may contain parasitic Josephson junctions. In our experiment, such a junction was enclosed in a superconducting loop and so gave rise to the formation an RF-SQUID which interfered with a nearby flux-tunable transmon qubit. Periodic signatures observed in magnetic field sweeps revealed a strong AC-dispersive coupling of the parasitic RF-SQUID to both the qubit and its readout resonator, in addition to the DC-inductive coupling between RF-SQUID and qubit. Our finding sheds light on a previously unknown origin of decoherence due to parasitic Josephson junctions in superconducing circuits.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Raman probe of the photoinduced superconducting to normal state transition in the cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report an ultrafast Time-Resolved Raman scattering study of the out-of-equilibrium photoinduced dynamics across the superconducting to normal state phase transition of the cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$. Using the polarization-resolved momentum space selectivity of Raman scattering, we track the superconducting condensate destruction and recovery dynamics with sub-picoseconds time resolution in the anti-nodal region of the Fermi surface where the superconducting gap is maximum. Leveraging ultrafast Raman thermometry, we find a significant dichotomy between the superconducting condensate and the quasiparticle temperature dynamics near the anti-nodes, which cannot be framed in terms of a single effective electron temperature. The present work demonstrates the ability of Time-Resolved Raman scattering to selectively probe out-of-equilibrium pathways of different electronic sub-degrees of freedom during a photoinduced phase transition.</description>

      <title>Frequency dependence of temporal spin stiffness and short-range magnetic order in the doped two-dimensional Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20714v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study doping and temperature dependencies of temporal and spatial spin stiffnesses of the Hubbard model within the mean field approach for incommensurate magnetic order. We show that the frequency dependence of temporal spin stiffness within the considered mean-field approach is crucial to obtain small values of correlation length, comparable to those observed in cuprates. Using the obtained spin stiffnesses, we obtain the temperature and doping dependence of correlation length within the large-$N$ limit of the respective nonlinear sigma model. In agreement with the experimental data on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ we obtain short range magnetic order with relatively small correlation length at $0.1 \lesssim x\lesssim 0.2$, and magnetically ordered ground state in the narrow doping region $0.05\lesssim x \lesssim 0.1$. The latter state may correspond to the spin-frosen state, observed in the experimental data on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$.</description>
