      <title>On (Newcomb-)Benford's law: a tale of two papers and of their disproportionate citations. How citation counts can become biased</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first digit (FD) phenomenon i.e., the significant digits of numbers in large data are often distributed according to a logarithmically decreasing function was first reported by S. Newcomb and then many decades later independently by F. Benford. After its century long neglect the last three decades have seen huge growth in the number of relevant publications. However, notwithstanding the rising popularity the two independent proponents of the phenomenon are not equally acknowledged an indication of which is disproportionate number of citations accumulated by Newcomb (1881) and Benford (1938). In the present study use citation analysis to show that the formalization of the eponym Benford's law, a name questionable itself for overlooking Newcomb's contribution, by Raimi (1976) had a strong adverse effect on the future citations of Newcomb (1881). Furthermore, we identify the papers published over various decades of the developmental history of the FD phenomenon, which latter turned out to be amongst the most cited ones in the field. We find that lack of its consideration, intentional or occasionally out of ignorance for referencing by the prominent papers, is responsible for a far lesser number of citations of Newcomb (1881) in comparison to Benford (1938).</description>

      <title>Modeling Policy and Resource Dynamics in the Construction Sector of Developing Countries: A System Dynamics Approach Using Sudan as a Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Construction industries in developing countries face systemic challenges such as chronic project delays, cost overruns, and regulatory inefficiencies. This paper presents a system dynamics (SD) modeling framework for analyzing policy and resource dynamics within the construction sector in Sudan, with broader applicability to Least Developed Countries (LDCs). The model incorporates key variables related to workforce, material supply, financing, and policy delays, and is calibrated using genetic algorithms (GAs) based on sectoral data and expert input. Simulation results across four policy scenarios indicate that regulatory reform and workforce training are the most effective levers for improving project performance. Specifically, implementing streamlined regulatory procedures reduced project delays by up to 32%, while investment in human capital decreased cost overruns by 28% over a 10-year simulation horizon. In contrast, scenarios focusing solely on material supply or financial inputs produced limited gains without corresponding policy or labor improvements. Sensitivity analysis further revealed that the system is highly responsive to macroeconomic stability and public investment flows. The study demonstrates that a hybrid SD-GA modeling approach offers a valuable decision-support tool for policymakers seeking to improve infrastructure delivery under uncertainty. Recommendations include phased regulatory reforms, targeted capacity building, and integrating modeling tools into strategic infrastructure planning in LDCs.</description>

      <title>Structural reducibility of hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order interactions provide a nuanced understanding of the relational structure of complex systems beyond traditional pairwise interactions. However, higher-order network analyses also incur more cumbersome interpretations and greater computational demands than their pairwise counterparts. Here we present an information-theoretic framework for determining the extent to which a hypergraph representation of a networked system is structurally redundant, and for identifying its most critical higher orders of interaction that allow us to remove these redundancies while preserving essential higher-order structure.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Estimation of Localized Treatment Effects in High-Dimensional Design Spaces using Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Population-scale agent-based simulations of the opioid epidemic help evaluate intervention strategies and overdose outcomes in heterogeneous communities and provide estimates of localized treatment effects, which support the design of locally-tailored policies for precision public health. However, it is prohibitively costly to run simulations of all treatment conditions in all communities because the number of possible treatments grows exponentially with the number of interventions and levels at which they are applied. To address this need efficiently, we develop a metamodel framework, whereby treatment outcomes are modeled using a response function whose coefficients are learned through Gaussian process regression (GPR) on locally-contextualized covariates. We apply this framework to efficiently estimate treatment effects on overdose deaths in Pennsylvania counties. In contrast to classical designs such as fractional factorial design or Latin hypercube sampling, our approach leverages spatial correlations and posterior uncertainty to sequentially sample the most informative counties and treatment conditions. Using a calibrated agent-based opioid epidemic model, informed by county-level overdose mortality and baseline dispensing rate data for different treatments, we obtained county-level estimates of treatment effects on overdose deaths per 100,000 population for all treatment conditions in Pennsylvania, achieving approximately 5% average relative error using one-tenth the number of simulation runs required for exhaustive evaluation. Our bi-level framework provides a computationally efficient approach to decision support for policy makers, enabling rapid evaluation of alternative resource-allocation strategies to mitigate the opioid epidemic in local communities. The same analytical framework can be applied to guide precision public health interventions in other epidemic settings.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models can Achieve Social Balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be deployed in situations where they process positive/negative interactions with other agents. We study how this is done under the sociological framework of social balance, which explains the emergence of one faction or multiple antagonistic ones among agents. Across different LLM models, we find that balance depends on the (i) type of interaction, (ii) update mechanism, and (iii) population size. Across (i)-(iii), we characterize the frequency at which social balance is achieved, the justifications for the social dynamics, and the diversity and stability of interactions. Finally, we explain how our findings inform the deployment of agentic systems.</description>

      <title>Integrating upstream and downstream reciprocity stabilizes cooperator-defector coexistence in others-only public goods games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human cooperation persists among strangers in large, well-mixed populations despite theoretical predictions of difficulties, leaving a fundamental evolutionary puzzle. While upstream (pay-it-forward: helping others because you were helped) and downstream (rewarding-reputation: helping those with good reputations) indirect reciprocity have been independently considered as solutions, their joint dynamics in multiplayer contexts remain unexplored. We study public goods games without self-return (often called "others-only" PGGs) with benefit b and cost c and analyze evolutionary dynamics for three strategies: unconditional cooperation (ALLC), unconditional defection (ALLD), and an integrated reciprocity strategy combining unconditional forwarding with reputation-based discrimination. We show that integrating upstream and downstream reciprocity can yield a globally asymptotically stable mixed equilibrium of ALLD and integrated reciprocators when b/c &gt; 2 in the absence of complexity costs. We analytically derive a critical threshold for complexity costs. If cognitive demands exceed this threshold, the stable equilibrium disappears via a saddle-node bifurcation. Otherwise, within the stable regime, complexity costs counterintuitively stabilize the equilibrium by preventing not only ALLC but also alternative conditional strategies from invading. Rather than requiring uniformity, our model reveals one pathway to stable cooperation through strategic diversity. ALLD serves as "evolutionary shields" preventing system collapse while integrated reciprocators flexibly combine open and discriminative responses. This framework demonstrates how pay-it-forward broadcasting and reputation systems can jointly maintain social polymorphism including cooperation despite cognitive limitations and group size challenges, offering a potential evolutionary foundation for behavioral diversity in human societies.</description>

      <title>Framing Unionization on Facebook: Communication around Representation Elections in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital media have become central to how labor unions communicate, organize, and sustain collective action. Yet little is known about how unions' online discourse relates to concrete outcomes such as representation elections. This study addresses the gap by combining National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) election data with 158k Facebook posts published by U.S. labor unions between 2015 and 2024. We focused on five discourse frames widely recognized in labor and social movement communication research: diagnostic (identifying problems), prognostic (proposing solutions), motivational (mobilizing action), community (emphasizing solidarity), and engagement (promoting social media interaction). Using a fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier, we systematically annotated unions' posts and analyzed patterns of frame usage around election events. Our findings showed that diagnostic and community frames dominated union communication overall, but that frame usage varied substantially across organizations. Greater use of diagnostic, prognostic, and community frames prior to an election was associated with higher odds of a successful outcome. After elections, framing patterns diverged depending on results: after wins, the use of prognostic and motivational frames decreased, whereas after losses, the use of prognostic and engagement frames increased. By examining variation in message-level framing, the study highlights how communication strategies correlate with organizational success, contributing open tools and data, and complementing prior research in understanding digital communication of unions and social movements.</description>
