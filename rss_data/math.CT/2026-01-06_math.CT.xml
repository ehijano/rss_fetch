      <title>Tunnel Geometry and Proliferation Logic: A Strict Categorical Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunnel Geometry and Proliferation Logic were developed as independent attempts to describe structure without assuming an underlying continuum of points. Although their languages differ, both frameworks encode the same underlying idea: that locality is not primitive but emerges from stable patterns of refinement. This paper shows that each theory admits a representation as a frame equipped with its space of ultrafilters and a compatible Lawvere metric. In this common setting the two frameworks become strictly identical. I construct explicit functors establishing a strict categorical equivalence between Tunnel Geometry and Proliferation Logic, and show that their associated Laplacian operators are unitarily equivalent. The result suggests that geometric and logical approaches to structure are not competing descriptions but two aspects of a single static ontology.</description>

      <title>Tapes as Stochastic Matrices of String Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tape diagrams provide a graphical notation for categories equipped with two monoidal products, $\otimes$ and $\oplus$, where $\oplus$ is a biproduct. Recently, they have been generalised to handle Kleisli categories of arbitrary monoidal monads. In this work, we show that for the subdistribution monad, tapes are isomorphic to stochastic matrices of subdistributions of string diagrams. We then exploit this result to provide a complete axiomatisation of probabilistic Boolean circuits.</description>

      <title>A Categorical Generalization of Counterpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00312</link>
      <description>arXiv:1810.00312v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend Mazzola's counterpoint model using category theory, generalizing from the category $\mathbf{Set}$ to other topoi with suitable properties. This generalization suggests that counterpoint's essential structure depends on specific categorical conditions rather than classical set-theoretic reasoning.
  A key contribution is identifying the minimal requirements for counterpoint theory: the topos satisfying some version of Zorn's Lemma (ZL) and being two-valued with split supports (NS).
  Within this framework, we introduce (weak) quasidichotomies alongside the classical notion of dichotomy. These structures capture varying degrees of oppositional structure between consonance and dissonance, with weak quasidichotomies preserving the non-Boolean flexibility essential to musical practice while quasidichotomies represent maximal opposition short of complete partition.
  We prove a generalized counterpoint theorem: sequences of admitted successors exist in any topos satisfying our conditions. The framework naturally accommodates counterpoint with sets instead of pure pitches, relaxing the "yes/no" character of classical consonance definitions and emphasizing context-dependence.
  Mazzola's model allows a Kuratowski closure operator induced by a polarity, which defines an internal topology enabling algebraic-topological analysis of counterpoint structure. We close proving this construction generalizes to involutive morphisms. This categorical approach provides foundations for understanding both the historical evolution of contrapuntal practice and cross-cultural divergences in interval organization.</description>

      <title>Di- is for Directed: First-Order Directed Type Theory via Dinaturality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how dinaturality plays a central role in the interpretation of directed type theory where types are interpreted as (1-)categories and directed equality is represented by $\hom$-functors. We present a general elimination principle based on dinaturality for directed equality which very closely resembles the $J$-rule used in Martin-L\"of type theory, and we highlight which syntactical restrictions are needed to interpret this rule in the context of directed equality. We then use these rules to characterize directed equality as a left relative adjoint to a functor between (para)categories of dinatural transformations which contracts together two variables appearing naturally with a single dinatural one, with the relative functor imposing the syntactic restrictions needed. We then argue that the quantifiers of such a directed type theory should be interpreted as ends and coends, which dinaturality allows us to present in adjoint-like correspondences to a weakening functor. Using these rules we give a formal interpretation to Yoneda reductions and (co)end calculus, and we use logical derivations to prove the Fubini rule for quantifier exchange, the adjointness property of Kan extensions via (co)ends, exponential objects of presheaves, and the (co)Yoneda lemma. We show transitivity (composition), congruence (functoriality), and transport (coYoneda) for directed equality by closely following the same approach of Martin-L\"of type theory, with the notable exception of symmetry. We formalize our main theorems in Agda.</description>

      <title>Hofmann-Streicher lifting of fibred categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09520v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1997, Hofmann and Streicher introduced an explicit construction to lift a Grothendieck universe from the category of sets into the category of set-valued presheaves on a small category. More recently, Awodey presented an elegant functorial analysis of this construction in terms of the categorical nerve, the right adjoint to the functor that takes a presheaf to its category of elements; in particular, the categorical nerve's functorial action on the universal small discrete fibration gives the generic family of the universe's Hofmann-Streicher lifting. Inspired by Awodey's analysis, we define a relative version of Hofmann-Streicher lifting in terms of the right pseudo-adjoint to the 2-functor given by postcomposition with a fibration. Finally, we construct a new 2-bifibration of fibrations in which the opcartesian and cartesian lifts arise from these pseudo-adjunctions.</description>

      <title>Functoriality of Enriched Data Types</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06059v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous work, categories of algebras of endofunctors were shown to be enriched in categories of coalgebras of the same endofunctor, and the extra structure of that enrichment was used to define a generalization of inductive data types. These generalized inductive data types are parametrized by a coalgebra $C$, so we call them $C$-inductive data types; we call the morphisms induced by their universal property $C$-inductive functions. We extend that work by incorporating natural transformations into the theory: given a suitable natural transformation between endofunctors, we show that this induces enriched functors between their categories of algebras which preserve $C$-inductive data types and $C$-inductive functions. Such $C$-inductive data types are often finite versions of the corresponding inductive data type, and we show how our framework can extend classical initial algebra semantics to these types. For instance, we show that our theory naturally produces partially inductive functions on lists, changes in list element types, and tree pruning functions.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Universes in Homotopy Type Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19176v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Awodey, later with Newstead, showed how polynomial functors with extra structure (termed ``natural models'') hold within them the categorical semantics for dependent type theory. Their work presented these ideas clearly but ultimately led them outside of the usual category of polynomial functors to a particular \emph{tricategory} of polynomials in order to explain all of the structure possessed by such models. This paper builds off that work -- explicating the categorical semantics of dependent type theory by axiomatizing them entirely in terms of the usual category of polynomial functors. In order to handle the higher-categorical coherences required for such an explanation, we work with polynomial functors in the language of Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT), which allows for higher-dimensional structures to be expressed purely within this category. The move to HoTT moreover enables us to express a key additional condition on polynomial functors -- \emph{univalence} -- which is sufficient to guarantee that models of type theory expressed as univalent polynomials satisfy all higher coherences of their corresponding algebraic structures, purely in virtue of being closed under the usual constructors of dependent type theory. We call polynomial functors satisfying this condition \emph{polynomial universes}. As an example of the simplification to the theory of natural models this enables, we highlight the fact that a polynomial universe being closed under dependent product types implies the existence of a distributive law of monads, which witnesses the usual distributivity of dependent products over dependent sums.</description>

Abstract: We use categorification of monoid actions to study algebraic geometry over symmetric monoidal categories. This brings together the relative algebraic geometry over symmetric monoidal categories developed by To\"{e}n and Vaqui\'{e}, along with the theory of actegories over monoidal categories. We obtain schemes over a datum $(\mathcal C,\mathcal M)$, where $(\mathcal C,\otimes,1)$ is a symmetric monoidal category and $\mathcal M$ is an actegory over $\mathcal C$. One of our main tools is using the datum $(\mathcal C,\mathcal M)$ to give a Grothendieck topology on the category of affine schemes over $(\mathcal C,\otimes,1)$ that we call the ``spectral $\mathcal M$-topology.'' This consists of ``fpqc $\mathcal M$-coverings'' with certain special properties. We provide a description of schemes over $(\mathcal C,\mathcal M)$ in terms of quotients of disjoint unions of affine schemes over a certain equivalence relation. These categories of schemes are closed under pullbacks and coproducts, and are equipped with change of base functors induced by symmetric monoidal adjuctions accompanied by lax $\mathcal C$-linear functors.</description>

      <title>Compositional Inference for Bayesian Networks and Causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00209v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inference is a fundamental reasoning technique in probability theory. When applied to a large joint distribution, it involves updating with evidence (conditioning) in one or more components (variables) and computing the outcome in other components. When the joint distribution is represented by a Bayesian network, the network structure may be exploited to proceed in a compositional manner -- with great benefits. However, the main challenge is that updating involves (re)normalisation, making it an operation that interacts badly with other operations.
  String diagrams are becoming popular as a graphical technique for probabilistic (and quantum) reasoning. Conditioning has appeared in string diagrams, in terms of a disintegration, using bent wires and shaded (or dashed) normalisation boxes. It has become clear that such normalisation boxes do satisfy certain compositional rules. This paper takes a decisive step in this development by adding a removal rule to the formalism, for the deletion of shaded boxes. Via this removal rule one can get rid of shaded boxes and terminate an inference argument. This paper illustrates via many (graphical) examples how the resulting compositional inference technique can be used for Bayesian networks, causal reasoning and counterfactuals.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we construct semiorthogonal decompositions of moduli of principal bundles on a curve into its symmetric powers, for both the moduli stack of all $G$-bundles and the coarse moduli space of semistable $G$-bundles. The essential ingredients in the proof include Borel-Weil-Bott theory for loop groups, highest weight structure of current group representation, derived $\Theta$-stratification and local-global compatibility of Kac-Moody localization.</description>
