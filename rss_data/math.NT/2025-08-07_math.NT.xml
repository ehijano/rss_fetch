      <title>Single-valued periods of meromorphic modular forms and a motivic interpretation of the Gross-Zagier conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-known conjecture of Gross and Zagier states that the values of the higher automorphic Green's function at pairs of points with complex multiplication in the upper half-plane are proportional to the logarithm of an algebraic number. It was recently settled in the case of congruence subgroups of the form $\Gamma_0(N)$ by analytic methods. In this paper we provide a geometric and motivic interpretation of the general conjecture, and show that it is a consequence of a standard conjecture in the theory of motives. In addition, we define a new class of matrix-valued higher Green's functions for both odd and even weight modular forms, and show that they are single-valued periods of a motive constructed from a suitable moduli stack of elliptic curves with marked points. The motive has the structure of a biextension involving symmetric powers of the motives of elliptic curves. This suggests a very general extension of the Gross-Zagier conjecture relating values of matrix-valued higher Green's functions at points which do not necessarily have complex multiplication to special values of $L$-functions. In particular, our motivic interpretation of the Gross-Zagier log-algebraicity conjecture enables us to give a completely geometric proof in level 1 and weight 4 by showing that the motive of the moduli stack $\mathcal{M}_{1,3}$ of elliptic curves with 3 marked points is mixed Tate.
  In the course of this paper we develop many new foundational results on: the theory of weak harmonic lifts, meromorphic modular forms, biextensions of modular motives, and their corresponding algebraic de Rham cohomology and single-valued periods, which may all be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>An extension of the linearized double shuffle Lie algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linearized double shuffle Lie algebra $\mathfrak{ls}$ is a well-studied Lie algebra, which reflects the depth-graded structure of multiple zeta values. We introduce a generalization $\mathfrak{lq}$, which is motivated from the $\mathbb{Q}$-algebraic structure of multiple q-zeta values and multiple Eisenstein series. Precisely, we show that $\mathfrak{lq}$ is a Lie algebra, where the Lie bracket is related to Ecalle's ari bracket on bimoulds, and give an embedding of $\mathfrak{ls}$ into $\mathfrak{lq}$.</description>

      <title>Squares, three fleas, sporadic integer sets, and squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the plane, three integer points ("fleas") are given. At every tick of time, two of them (say, P,Q) instantly jump to two vacant points R,S, so that PQRS is a square with that order of vertices. Description of all integers and half-integers which occur as areas of spanned triangles turns out to be unexpectedly intricate problem. For example, if one starts from a triple (0,0), (2,0), (4,1), these positive integers are missed: 2*{0, 1, 4, 15, 16, 20, 79, 84, 95, 119, 156}, with no other up to 3*10^6 (and seemingly, none at all); half-integers which are missed seem to form a 39-element set (the largest of them being 11365/2). However, there exist certain starting setups which have an "integrable" component as part of the answer. We demonstrate that for the initial triple (0,0), (2,1), (3,2), the integers missed as areas are perfect squares, and the the sporadic set {5, 29, 80, 99, 179} with no other elements up to 3*10^6 (most likely, no other at all; all half-integers serve as areas).</description>

      <title>On certain root number $1$ cases of the cube sum problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider certain families of integers $n$ determined by some congruence condition, such that the global root number of the elliptic curve $E_{-432n^2}: Y^2=X^3-432n^2$ is $1$ for every $n$, however a given $n$ may or may not be a sum of two rational cubes. We give explicit criteria in terms of the $2$-parts and $3$-parts of the ideal class groups of certain cubic number fields to determine whether such an $n$ is a cube sum. In particular, we study integers $n$ divisible by $3$ such that the global root number of $E_{-432n^2}$ is $1$. For example, for a prime $\ell \equiv 7 \pmod{9}$, we show that for $3\ell$ to be a sum of two rational cubes, it is necessary that the ideal class group of $\Q(\sqrt[3]{12\ell})$ contains $\frac{\Z}{6\Z}\oplus \frac{\Z}{3\Z}$ as a subgroup. Moreover, for a positive proportion of primes $\ell \equiv 7 \pmod{9}$, $3\ell$ can not be a sum of two rational cubes. A key ingredient in the proof is to explore the relation between the $2$-Selmer group and the $3$-isogeny Selmer group of $E_{-432n^2}$ with the ideal class groups of appropriate cubic number fields.</description>

      <title>Xeric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety over a number field $k$. The Green--Griffiths--Lang conjecture relates the question of finiteness of rational points in $X$ to the triviality of rational maps from abelian varieties to $X$ and to complex hyperbolicity. Here we investigate the phenomenon of sparsity of rational points in $X$ -- roughly speaking, when there are very few rational points if counted ordered by height. We are interested in the case when sparsity holds over every finite extension of $k$, in which case we say that the variety is \emph{xeric}. We initiate a systematic study of the relation of this property with the non-existence of rational curves in $X$ as well as with certain notion of $p$-adic hyperbolicity.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic bootstrap for RCFT: signs and bounds for quasi-characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07170v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-characters are solutions of simple modular differential equations that form an explicit basis for the space of all admissible characters that can potentially describe rational CFT. They were classified for rank-$2$ in arXiv:1810.09472 [hep-th], where it was conjectured that their $q$-series has coefficients of alternating sign that stabilise to a fixed sign at order $\frac{c}{12}$ and sometimes undergo more exotic behaviour -- where $c$ is the central charge. Here we prove some of these conjectures and estimate the growth of coefficients near the stabilisation point. We also explain what role the signs play in the construction of admissible characters from quasi-characters.</description>

      <title>Balanced Steinhaus triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Steinhaus triangle modulo $m$ is a finite down-pointing triangle of elements in the finite cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ satisfying the same local rule as the standard Pascal triangle modulo $m$. A Steinhaus triangle modulo $m$ is said to be balanced if it contains all the elements of $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ with the same multiplicity. In this paper, the existence of infinitely many balanced Steinhaus triangles modulo $m$, for any positive integer $m$, is shown. This is achieved by considering periodic triangles generated from interlaced arithmetic progressions. This positively answers a weak version of a problem, due to John C. Molluzzo in 1978, that has remained unsolved to date for the even values of $m\geqslant 12$.</description>

      <title>On possibilities of 3-adic Galois images associated to isogeny-torsion graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $E$ be a non CM elliptic curve defined over $\Q$. There is an isogeny-torsion graph associated to $E$ and there is also a Galois representation $\rho_{E,l^{\infty}} \colon \Gal(\Qbar/\Q) \to \GL_2(\ZZ_{\ell})$ associated to $E$ for every prime $\ell.$ In this article, we explore the relation between these two objects when $\ell=3$. More precisely, we give a classification of 3-adic Galois images associated to vertices of the isogeny-torsion graph of $E.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shintani's celebrated invariants are conjectured to generate abelian extensions of real quadratic number fields, offering a potential solution to Hilbert's 12th problem in that setting. In this note, we derive new expressions for Shintani's invariants by generalizing an observation of Yamamoto, who showed that these invariants - originally formulated using the double sine function - can be expressed in terms of the q-Pochhammer symbol.</description>

      <title>Elementary characterization for Galois groups of $x^{12}+ax^6+b$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f(x)=x^{12}+ax^6+b \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ be an irreducible polynomial, $g_4(x)=x^4+ax^2+b$, $g_6(x)=x^6+ax^3+b$, and let $G_4$ and $G_6$ be the Galois group of $g_4(x)$ and $g_6(x)$, respectively. Building upon known characterizations of $G_4$ and $G_6$ in the literature, this paper provides an elementary characterization of all sixteen possible Galois groups of $f(x)$. In particular, we show that the Galois group of $f(x)$ can be uniquely determined by the pair $(G_4,G_6)$ along with testing whether at most two expressions involving $a$ and $b$ are rational squares.</description>

      <title>Oscillation results for the summatory functions of fake mu's</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mossinghoff, Trudgian, and the first author~\cite{MMT23} recently introduced a family of arithmetic functions called ``fake $\mu$'s'', which are multiplicative functions for which there is a $\{-1,0,1\}$-valued sequence $(\varepsilon_j)_{j=1}^{\infty}$ such that $f(p^j) = \varepsilon_j$ for all primes $p$. They investigated comparative number-theoretic results for fake $\mu$'s and in particular proved oscillation results at scale $\sqrt{x}$ for the summatory functions of fake $\mu$'s with $\varepsilon_1=-1$ and $\varepsilon_2=1$. In this paper, we establish new oscillation results for the summatory functions of all nontrivial fake $\mu$'s at scales $x^{1/2\ell}$ where $\ell$ is a positive integer (the ``critical index'') depending on $f$; for $\ell=1$ this recovers the oscillation results in~\cite{MMT23}. Our work also recovers results on the indicator functions of powerfree and powerfull numbers; we generalize techniques applied to each of these examples to extend to all fake $\mu$'s.</description>

Abstract: We give an affirmative answer to a question asked by N. Moshchevitin \cite{m1} in his lecture at International Congress of Basic Science, Beijing, 2024 (see also \cite{m}, Section 6.3). The question is that whether the remainder $$ R_n=\sum_{j=1}^{2^n}\left(\xi_{j,n}-\frac{j}{2^n}\right)^2-2^n\int_0^1( ?(x)-x))^2\text{d}x $$ tends to $0$ when $n$ tends to infinity, where $\xi_{j,n}$ are elements of the Stern-Brocot sequence and $?(x)$ denotes Minkowski Question-Mark Function. We present some extended results and give a correct proof of a theorem on the Fourier-Stieltjes coefficient of the inverse function of $?(x)$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general approach for showing when a set of integers $\mathscr{A}$ has infinitely many $k^{th}$ powerfree numbers without relying on equidistribution estimates for $\mathscr{A}$. In particular, we show that if the Fourier transform of $\mathscr{A}$ satisfies certain $L^{\infty}$ and $L^{1}$ bounds, and is also "decreasing" in some sense, then $\mathscr{A}$ contains infinitely many $k^{th}$ powerfree numbers. We then use this method to show that there are infinitely many cubefree palindromes in base $b\ge 1100$, and in the process we obtain new $L^{1}$ bounds for the Fourier transform of the set of palindromes. We also show that there are infinitely many squarefree integers such that its reverse is also squarefree in any base $b\ge 2$. Moreover, we show that there are infinitely many squarefree integers with a missing digit in base $b\ge 5$, and infinitely many such cubefree integers in base $b\ge 3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17523v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suppose we partition the integers into finitely many cells. Can we always find a solution of the equation $x^2+y^2=z^2$ with $x,y,z$ on the same cell? What about more general homogeneous quadratic equations in three variables? These are basic questions in arithmetic Ramsey theory, which have recently been partially answered using ideas inspired by ergodic theory and tools such as Gowers-uniformity properties and concentration estimates of bounded multiplicative functions. The aim of this article is to provide an introduction to this exciting research area, explaining the main ideas behind the recent progress and some of the important challenges that lie ahead.</description>

Abstract: Polylogarithms on arbitrary higher-genus Riemann surfaces can be constructed from meromorphic integration kernels with at most simple poles, whose definition was given by Enriquez via functional properties. In this work, homotopy-invariant convolution integrals over homology cycles are shown to provide a direct construction of Enriquez kernels solely from holomorphic Abelian differentials and the prime form. Our new representation is used to demonstrate the closure of the space of Enriquez kernels under convolution over homology cycles and under variations of the moduli. The results of this work further strengthen the remarkable parallels of Enriquez kernels with the non-holomorphic modular tensors recently developed in an alternative construction of higher-genus polylogarithms.</description>
