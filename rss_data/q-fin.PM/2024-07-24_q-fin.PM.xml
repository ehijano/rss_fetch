      <title>Multi-Industry Simplex 2.0 : Temporally-Evolving Probabilistic Industry Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate industry classification is critical for many areas of portfolio management, yet the traditional single-industry framework of the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) struggles to comprehensively represent risk for highly diversified multi-sector conglomerates like Amazon. Previously, we introduced the Multi-Industry Simplex (MIS), a probabilistic extension of GICS that utilizes topic modeling, a natural language processing approach. Although our initial version, MIS-1, was able to improve upon GICS by providing multi-industry representations, it relied on an overly simple architecture that required prior knowledge about the number of industries and relied on the unrealistic assumption that industries are uncorrelated and independent over time. We improve upon this model with MIS-2, which addresses three key limitations of MIS-1 : we utilize Bayesian Non-Parametrics to automatically infer the number of industries from data, we employ Markov Updating to account for industries that change over time, and we adjust for correlated and hierarchical industries allowing for both broad and niche industries (similar to GICS). Further, we provide an out-of-sample test directly comparing MIS-2 and GICS on the basis of future correlation prediction, where we find evidence that MIS-2 provides a measurable improvement over GICS. MIS-2 provides portfolio managers with a more robust tool for industry classification, empowering them to more effectively identify and manage risk, particularly around multi-sector conglomerates in a rapidly evolving market in which new industries periodically emerge.</description>
