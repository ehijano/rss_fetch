      <title>Mathematical Discovery of Potential Therapeutic Targets: Application to Rare Melanomas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patients with rare types of melanoma such as acral, mucosal, or uveal melanoma, have lower survival rates than patients with cutaneous melanoma; these lower survival rates reflect the lower objective response rates to immunotherapy compared to cutaneous melanoma. Understanding tumor-immune dynamics in rare melanomas is critical for the development of new therapies and for improving response rates to current cancer therapies. Progress has been hindered by the lack of clinical data and the need for better preclinical models of rare melanomas. Canine melanoma provides a valuable comparative oncology model for rare types of human melanomas. We analyzed RNA sequencing data from canine melanoma patients and combined this with literature information to create a novel mechanistic mathematical model of melanoma-immune dynamics. Sensitivity analysis of the mathematical model indicated influential pathways in the dynamics, providing support for potential new therapeutic targets and future combinations of therapies. We share our learnings from this work, to help enable the application of this proof-of-concept workflow to other rare disease settings with sparse available data.</description>

      <title>Towards Scalable Proteomics: Opportunistic SMC Samplers on HTCondor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative proteomics plays a central role in uncovering regulatory mechanisms, identifying disease biomarkers, and guiding the development of precision therapies. These insights are often obtained through complex Bayesian models, whose inference procedures are computationally intensive, especially when applied at scale to biological datasets. This limits the accessibility of advanced modelling techniques needed to fully exploit proteomics data. Although Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods offer a parallelisable alternative to traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo, their high-performance implementations often rely on specialised hardware, increasing both financial and energy costs. We address these challenges by introducing an opportunistic computing framework for SMC samplers, tailored to the demands of large-scale proteomics inference. Our approach leverages idle compute resources at the University of Liverpool via HTCondor, enabling scalable Bayesian inference without dedicated high-performance computing infrastructure. Central to this framework is a novel Coordinator-Manager-Follower architecture that reduces synchronisation overhead and supports robust operation in heterogeneous, unreliable environments. We evaluate the framework on a realistic proteomics model and show that opportunistic SMC delivers accurate inference with weak scaling, increasing samples generated under a fixed time budget as more resources join. To support adoption, we release CondorSMC, an open-source package for deploying SMC samplers in opportunistic computing environments.</description>

      <title>MAESTRO: Multi-modal Adaptive Ensemble for Spectro-Temporal Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Timely and robust influenza incidence forecasting is critical for public health decision-making. To address this, we present MAESTRO, a Multi-modal Adaptive Ensemble for Spectro-Temporal Robust Optimization. MAESTRO achieves robustness by adaptively fusing multi-modal inputs-including surveillance, web search trends, and meteorological data-and leveraging a comprehensive spectro-temporal architecture. The model first decomposes time series into seasonal and trend components. These are then processed through a hybrid feature enhancement pipeline combining Transformer-based encoders, a Mamba state-space model for long-range dependencies, multi-scale temporal convolutions, and a frequency-domain analysis module. A cross-channel attention mechanism further integrates information across the different data modalities. Finally, a temporal projection head performs sequence-to-sequence forecasting, with an optional estimator to quantify prediction uncertainty. Evaluated on over 11 years of Hong Kong influenza data (excluding the COVID-19 period), MAESTRO shows strong competitive performance, demonstrating a superior model fit and relative accuracy, achieving a state-of-the-art R-square of 0.956. Extensive ablations confirm the significant contributions of both multi-modal fusion and the spectro-temporal components. Our modular and reproducible pipeline is made publicly available to facilitate deployment and extension to other regions and pathogens.Our publicly available pipeline presents a powerful, unified framework, demonstrating the critical synergy of advanced spectro-temporal modeling and multi-modal data fusion for robust epidemiological forecasting.</description>

      <title>Adding structure to generalized additive models, with applications in ecology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized additive models (GAMs) connecting a set of scalar covariates that map 1-1 to a response are commonly employed in ecology and beyond. However, covariates are often inherently non-scalar, taking multiple values for each observation of the response. They can sometimes have a temporal structure, e.g., a time series of temperatures, or a spatial structure, e.g., multiple soil pH measurements made at nearby locations. While aggregating or selectively summarizing such covariates to yield a scalar covariate allows the use of standard GAM fitting procedures, exactly how to do so can be problematic and information is necessarily lost. Naively including all $p$ components of a vector-valued covariate as $p$ separate covariates, say, without recognizing the structure, can lead to problems of multicollinearity, data sets that are excessively wide given the sample size, and difficulty extracting the primary signal provided by the covariate. Here we introduce three useful extensions to GAMs that efficiently and effectively handle vector-valued covariates without requiring one to choose aggregations or selective summarizations. These extensions are varying-coefficient, scalar-on-function and distributed lag models. While these models have existed for some time they remain relatively underused in ecology. This article aims to show when these models can be useful and how to fit them with the popular R package \mgcv{}.</description>

      <title>piCurve: an R package for modeling photosynthesis-irradiance curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photosynthesis-irradiance (PI) curves are foundational for quantifying primary production, parameterizing ecosystem and biogeochemical models, and interpreting physiological acclimation to light. Despite their broad use, researchers lack a unified, reproducible toolkit to fit, compare, and diagnose the many PI formulations that have accumulated over the last century. We introduce piCurve, an R package that standardizes the modeling of PI relationships, with a library of widely used light-limited, light-saturated, and photoinhibited formulations and a consistent statistical framework for estimation and comparison. With the total of 24 PI models, piCurve supports mean squared error (MSE) and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), provides uncertainty quantification via information matrix (Hessian), and includes automated, data-informed initialization to improve convergence. Utilities classify PI data into light-limited, light-saturated, and photoinhibited regions, while plotting and 'tidy' helpers streamline workflow and reporting. Together, these features enable reproducible analyses and fair model comparisons, including for curves exhibiting a plateau followed by photoinhibition.</description>
