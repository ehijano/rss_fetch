      <title>Mean field social optimization: feedback person-by-person optimality and the dynamic programming equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider mean field social optimization in nonlinear diffusion models. By dynamic programming with a representative agent employing cooperative optimizer selection, we derive a new Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation to be called the master equation of the value function. Under some regularity conditions, we establish $\epsilon$-person-by-person optimality of the master equation-based control laws, which may be viewed as a necessary condition for nearly attaining the social optimum. A major challenge in the analysis is to obtain tight estimates, within an error of $O(1/N)$, of the social cost having order $O(N)$. This will be accomplished by multi-scale analysis via constructing two auxiliary master equations. We illustrate explicit solutions of the master equations for the linear-quadratic (LQ) case, and give an application to systemic risk.</description>

      <title>Sequential Convex Programming with Filtering-Based Warm-Starting for Continuous-Time Multiagent Quadrotor Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing the trajectories of multiple quadrotors in a shared space is a core challenge in various applications. Many existing trajectory optimization methods enforce constraints only at the discretization points, leading to violations between discretization points. They also often lack warm-starting strategies for iterative solution methods such as sequential convex programming, causing slow convergence or sensitivity to the initial guess. We propose a framework for optimizing multiagent quadrotor trajectories that combines a sequential convex programming approach with filtering-based warm-starting. This framework not only ensures constraint satisfaction along the entire continuous-time trajectory but also provides an online warm-starting strategy that accelerates convergence and improves solution quality in numerical experiments. The key idea is to first transform continuous-time constraints into auxiliary nonlinear dynamics and boundary constraints, both of which are compatible with sequential convex programming. Furthermore, we propose a novel warm-starting strategy by approximating the trajectory optimization problem as a Bayesian state estimation problem. This approximation provides an efficient estimate of the optimal trajectories. We demonstrate the proposed framework on multiagent quadrotor trajectory optimization with collision avoidance constraints. Compared with benchmark methods, the proposed framework achieves not only continuous-time constraint satisfaction, but also reduces computation time by up to two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Singular Perturbations of Hamilton-Jacobi Equations in the Wasserstein Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a singular perturbation problem for second-order Hamilton-Jacobi equations in the Wasserstein space. Specifically, we characterize the behavior of the solutions as the perturbation parameter $\varepsilon$ tends to zero. The notion of solution we adopt is that of viscosity solutions in the sense of test functions on the Wasserstein space. Our proof utilizes the perturbed test function method, appropriately adapted to this setting. Finally, we highlight a connection with the homogenization of conditional slow-fast McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations.</description>

      <title>A generalized Hurwitz stability criterion via rectangular block Hankel matrices for nonmonic matrix polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a Hurwitz stability criterion for nonmonic matrix polynomials via column reduction, generalizing existing approaches constrained by the monic assumption, as well as Gantmacher's classical stability criterion via Markov parameters. Starting from redefining the associated Markov parameters through a column-wise adaptive splitting method, our framework constructs two structured matrices whose rectangular Hankel blocks are obtained via the extraction of these parameters. We establish an explicit interrelation between the inertias of column reduced matrix polynomials and the derived structured matrices. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Hurwitz stability of column reduced matrix polynomials can be determined by the Hermitian positive definiteness of these rectangular block Hankel matrices.</description>

      <title>Multistage Robust Optimization for Time-Decoupled Power Flexibility Aggregation with Energy Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To mitigate global climate change, distributed energy resources (DERs), such as distributed generators, flexible loads, and energy storage systems (ESSs), have witnessed rapid growth in power distribution systems. When properly managed, these DERs can provide significant flexibility to power systems, enhancing both reliability and economic efficiency. Due to their relatively small scale, DERs are typically managed by the distribution system operator (DSO), who interacts with the transmission system operator (TSO) on their behalf. Specifically, the DSO aggregates the power flexibility of the DERs under its control, representing it as a feasible variation range of aggregate active power at the substation level. This flexibility range is submitted to the TSO, who determines a setpoint within that range. The DSO then disaggregates the setpoint to dispatch DERs. This paper focuses on the DSO's power flexibility aggregation problem. First, we propose a novel multistage robust optimization model with decision-dependent uncertainty for power flexibility aggregation. Distinct from the traditional two-stage models, our multistage framework captures the sequential decision-making of the TSO and DSO and is more general (e.g., can accommodate non-ideal ESSs). Then, we develop multiple solution methods, including exact, inner, and outer approximation approaches under different assumptions, and compare their performance in terms of applicability, optimality, and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we design greedy algorithms for DSO's real-time disaggregation. We prove that the rectangular method yields greater total aggregate flexibility compared to the existing approach. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed aggregation and disaggregation methods, validating their practical applicability.</description>

      <title>Polyconvex double well functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate polyconvexity of the double well function $f(X)\,:= |X-X_1|^2|X-X_2|^2$ for given matrices $X_1, X_2 \in R^{n \times n}$. Such functions are fundamental in the modeling of phase transitions in materials, but their non-convex nature presents challenges for the analysis of variational problems. We prove that $f$ is polyconvex if and only if the singular values of the matrix difference $X_1 - X_2$ are all equal. This condition allows the function to be decomposed into the sum of a strictly convex part and a null Lagrangian. As a direct application of this result, we prove an existence and uniqueness theorem for the corresponding Dirichlet minimization problem in the calculus of variations, demonstrating that under this specific condition, there is a unique minimizer for general boundary data.</description>

      <title>Analysis and experimental validation of decentralized controllers for delayed spacing policies in vehicle-platooning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel approach to spacing policies for vehicle platoons and a framework for control design is presented. Whereas traditional approaches aim to mitigate the effect of actuation and communication delays on the spacing error, this paper presents spacing policies that account for delays. A framework for decentralized control design is presented and necessary and sufficient conditions for tracking of delayed-based spacing policies are stated. It is shown that due to the control design, string stability is induced by the spacing policy. The results are supported by experimental validations of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Distributional Adversarial Attacks and Training in Deep Hedging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the robustness of classical deep hedging strategies under distributional shifts by leveraging the concept of adversarial attacks. We first demonstrate that standard deep hedging models are highly vulnerable to small perturbations in the input distribution, resulting in significant performance degradation. Motivated by this, we propose an adversarial training framework tailored to increase the robustness of deep hedging strategies. Our approach extends pointwise adversarial attacks to the distributional setting and introduces a computationally tractable reformulation of the adversarial optimization problem over a Wasserstein ball. This enables the efficient training of hedging strategies that are resilient to distributional perturbations. Through extensive numerical experiments, we show that adversarially trained deep hedging strategies consistently outperform their classical counterparts in terms of out-of-sample performance and resilience to model misspecification. Our findings establish a practical and effective framework for robust deep hedging under realistic market uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Newton-Raphson Flow for Aggressive Quadrotor Tracking Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the Newton-Raphson flow tracking controller to aggressive quadrotor flight and demonstrate that it achieves good tracking performance over a suite of benchmark trajectories, beating the native trajectory tracking controller in the popular PX4 Autopilot. The Newton-Raphson flow tracking controller is a recently proposed integrator-type controller that aims to drive to zero the error between a future predicted system output and the reference trajectory. This controller is computationally lightweight, requiring only an imprecise predictor, and achieves guaranteed asymptotic error bounds under certain conditions. We show that these theoretical advantages are realizable on a quadrotor hardware platform. Our experiments are conducted on a Holybrox x500v2 quadrotor using a Pixhawk 6x flight controller and a Rasbperry Pi 4 companion computer which receives location information from an OptiTrack motion capture system and sends input commands through the ROS2 API for the PX4 software stack.</description>

      <title>Comparison of derivative-free and gradient-based minimization for multi-objective compositional design of shape memory alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing shape memory alloys (SMAs) that meet performance targets while remaining affordable and sustainable is a complex challenge. In this work, we focus on optimizing SMA compositions to achieve a desired martensitic start temperature (Ms) while minimizing cost. To do this, we use machine learning models as surrogate predictors and apply numerical optimization methods to search for suitable alloy combinations. We trained two types of machine learning models, a tree-based ensemble and a neural network, using a dataset of experimentally characterized alloys and physics-informed features. The tree-based model was used with a derivative-free optimizer (COBYLA), while the neural network, which provides gradient information, was paired with a gradient-based optimizer (TRUST-CONSTR). Our results show that while both models predict Ms with similar accuracy, the optimizer paired with the neural network finds better solutions more consistently. COBYLA often converged to suboptimal results, especially when the starting guess was far from the target. The TRUST-CONSTR method showed more stable behavior and was better at reaching alloy compositions that met both objectives. This study demonstrates a practical approach to exploring new SMA compositions by combining physics-informed data, machine learning models, and optimization algorithms. Although the scale of our dataset is smaller than simulation-based efforts, the use of experimental data improves the reliability of the predictions. The approach can be extended to other materials where design trade-offs must be made with limited data.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Tracking Control for Computationally Constrained Aerial Systems with the Newton-Raphson Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the performance of a lightweight tracking controller, based on a flow version of the Newton-Raphson method, applied to a miniature blimp and a mid-size quadrotor. This tracking technique has been shown to enjoy theoretical guarantees of performance and has been applied with success in simulation studies and on mobile robots with simple motion models. This paper investigates the technique through real-world flight experiments on aerial hardware platforms subject to realistic deployment and onboard computational constraints. The technique's performance is assessed in comparison with the established control frameworks of feedback linearization for the blimp, and nonlinear model predictive control for both quadrotor and blimp. The performance metrics under consideration are (i) root mean square error of flight trajectories with respect to target trajectories, (ii) algorithms' computation times, and (iii) CPU energy consumption associated with the control algorithms. The experimental findings show that the Newton-Raphson flow-based tracking controller achieves comparable or superior tracking performance to the baseline methods with substantially reduced computation time and energy expenditure.</description>

      <title>Adaptively Robust LLM Inference Optimization under Prediction Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) inference scheduling to minimize total latency. LLM inference is an online and multi-task service process and also heavily energy consuming by which a pre-trained LLM processes input requests and generates output tokens sequentially. Therefore, it is vital to improve its scheduling efficiency and reduce the power consumption while a great amount of prompt requests are arriving. A key challenge in LLM inference scheduling is that while the prompt length is known upon arrival, the output length, which critically impacts memory usage and processing time, is unknown. To address this uncertainty, we propose algorithms that leverage machine learning to predict output lengths, assuming the prediction provides an interval classification (min-max range) for each request.
  We first design a conservative algorithm, $\mathcal{A}_{\max}$, which schedules requests based on the upper bound of predicted output lengths to prevent memory overflow. However, this approach is overly conservative: as prediction accuracy decreases, performance degrades significantly due to potential overestimation. To overcome this limitation, we propose $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$, an adaptive algorithm that initially treats the predicted lower bound as the output length and dynamically refines this estimate during inferencing. We prove that $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ achieves a log-scale competitive ratio. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ often performs nearly as well as the hindsight scheduler, highlighting both its efficiency and robustness in practical scenarios. Moreover, $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ relies solely on the lower bound of the prediction interval--an advantageous design choice since upper bounds on output length are typically more challenging to predict accurately.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a Lyapunov function method to investigate the long term behavior of autonomous ordinary differential equations under a multiplicative noise of H\"older continuity, using rough path calculus and the framework of random dynamical systems. By introducing the concept of {\it strong Lyapunov functions}, we conclude that if such a function exists for the drift then the perturbed system admits the global random pullback attractor which is upper semi-continuous w.r.t. the dyadic approximation of the noise. Several applications are studied, such as the pendulum and the Fitzhugh Nagumo neuro-system. We also prove that strong Lyapunov functions could be approximated in practice by Lyapunov neural networks.</description>

      <title>Multimodal urban transportation network equilibrium including intermodality and shared mobility services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00735v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shared Mobility Services (SMSs) are transforming urban transportation systems by offering flexible travel options. These services, which help reduce the number of cars on the roads, have the potential to enhance the transportation system's performance, leading to improvements in travel times and emissions. This emphasizes the importance of assessing their impact on the system and users' choices, particularly when integrated into complex multi-modal systems that include public transport (PT). However, many studies overlook the synergies between SMSs and PT, leading to inaccurate traffic estimations and planning. This research presents an extensive review of multi-modal transportation system models incorporating SMSs. It then introduces a multimodal traffic assignment model including almost all mobility options in urban transportation systems applicable in both continuous and integer settings, leading to a Mixed-Integer Bilinear Programming (MIBLP) formulation. The model comprises diverse travel options, including SMSs, and accounts for intermodality by allowing commuters to combine modes to optimize time and monetary expense. An in-depth examination of commuters' mode and path choices on two test cases and an analysis of the price of anarchy reveals the disparities between user equilibrium and system optimum in such complex networks.</description>

Abstract: The Flow Refueling Location Problem (FRLP) is a stylized model for determining the optimal placement of refueling stations for vehicles with limited travel ranges, such as hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and electric vehicles. A notable extension, the deviation FRLP, accounts for the possibility that drivers may deviate from their preferred routes to refuel or recharge. While solution techniques based on various mathematical programming formulations have been thoroughly explored for this extension, there is a lack of theoretical insights into the relationships and strengths of these formulations.
  In this work, for the deviation extension, we study two prominent FRLP formulations from the literature and compare their strengths in terms of linear programming (LP) relaxations. We show that the LP relaxation of one formulation yields a bound that is at least as tight as that of the other, which may explain its observed superior performance. Building on these insights, we address a common modeling assumption in the FRLP that requires drivers to use the same paths for their outbound and inbound trips. Specifically, we relax this assumption and introduce the cyclic FRLP, where drivers may use different paths in each direction. We show how existing formulations can be naturally extended to accommodate this setting and describe a branch-and-cut algorithm to solve the problem. We provide numerical experiments highlighting the benefits of such asymmetric routing. For example, in an instance based on the Californian network, the cyclic FRLP serves all demands using 30% fewer facilities than the original FRLP.</description>

      <title>Optimal consumption under relaxed benchmark tracking and consumption drawdown constraint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16611v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies an optimal consumption problem with both relaxed benchmark tracking and consumption drawdown constraint, leading to a stochastic control problem with dynamic state-control constraints. In our relaxed tracking formulation, it is assumed that the fund manager can strategically inject capital to the fund account such that the total capital process always outperforms the benchmark process, which is described by a geometric Brownian motion. We first transform the original regular-singular control problem with state-control constraints into an equivalent regular control problem with a reflected state process and consumption drawdown constraint. By utilizing the dual transform and the optimal consumption behavior, we then turn to study the linear dual PDE with both Neumann boundary condition and free boundary condition in a piecewise manner across different regions. Using the smoothfit principle and the super-contact condition, we derive the closed-form solution of the dual PDE, and obtain the optimal investment and consumption in feedback form. We then prove the verification theorem on optimality by some novel arguments with the aid of an auxiliary reflected dual process and some technical estimations. Some numerical examples and financial insights are also presented.</description>

      <title>Predict-and-Optimize Robust Unit Commitment with Statistical Guarantees via Weight Combination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing uncertainty from renewable power and electricity demand brings significant challenges to unit commitment (UC). While various advanced forecasting and optimization methods have been developed to predict better and address this uncertainty, most previous studies treat forecasting and optimization as separate tasks. This separation can lead to suboptimal results due to misalignment between the objectives of the two tasks. To overcome this challenge, we propose a robust UC framework that integrates forecasting and optimization processes while ensuring statistical guarantees. In the forecasting stage, we combine multiple predictions derived from diverse data sources and methodologies for an improved prediction, aiming to optimize the UC performance. In the optimization stage, the combined prediction is used to construct an uncertainty set with statistical guarantees, based on which the robust UC model is formulated. The optimal robust UC solution provides feedback to refine the weight used for combining multiple predictions. To solve the proposed integrated forecasting-optimization framework efficiently and effectively, we develop a neural network-based surrogate model for acceleration and introduce a reshaping method for the uncertainty set based on the optimization result to reduce conservativeness. Case studies on modified IEEE 30-bus and 118-bus systems demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Distributed Asynchronous Time-Varying Quadratic Programming with Asynchronous Objective Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing works on multi-agent time-varying optimization allow agents to asynchronously communicate and/or compute, but do not allow asynchronous sampling of objectives. Sampling can be difficult to synchronize, and we therefore present a multi-agent optimization framework that allows asynchrony in sampling, communications, and computations for time-varying quadratic programs. We show that agents have bounded error when tracking the solution to the asynchronously sampled problem, which solves an open problem for quadratic programs. Simulations validate these results.</description>

      <title>Micro-Macro Decomposition of Particle Swarm Optimization Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving non-convex minimization problems using multi-particle metaheuristic derivative-free optimization methods is still an active area of research. Popular methods are Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) methods, that iteratively update a population of particles according to dynamics inspired by social interactions between individuals. We present a modification to include constrained minimization problems using exact penalization. Additionally, we utilize the hierarchical structure of PSO to introduce a micro-macro decomposition of the algorithm. The probability density of particles is written as a convex combination of microscopic and macroscopic contributions, and both parts are propagated separately. The decomposition is dynamically updated based on heuristic considerations. Numerical examples compare the results obtained using the algorithm in the microscopic scale, in the macroscopic scale, and, using the new micro-macro decomposition.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Randomized Smoothing: Nonsmooth Nonconvex Optimization Beyond Global Lipschitz Continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomized smoothing is a widely adopted technique for optimizing nonsmooth objective functions. However, its efficiency analysis typically relies on global Lipschitz continuity, a condition rarely met in practical applications. To address this limitation, we introduce a new subgradient growth condition that naturally encompasses a wide range of locally Lipschitz functions, with the classical global Lipschitz function as a special case. Under this milder condition, we prove that randomized smoothing yields a differentiable function that satisfies certain generalized smoothness properties. To optimize such functions, we propose novel randomized smoothing gradient algorithms that, with high probability, converge to $(\delta, \epsilon)$-Goldstein stationary points and achieve a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{5/2}\delta^{-1}\epsilon^{-4})$. By incorporating variance reduction techniques, we further improve the sample complexity to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}\delta^{-1}\epsilon^{-3})$, matching the optimal $\epsilon$-bound under the global Lipschitz assumption, up to a logarithmic factor. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Geometrically Decaying Step Size: Linear Convergence for Smooth or Non-Smooth Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the geometrically decaying step size given a positive condition number, under which a locally Lipschitz function shows linear convergence. The positivity does not require the function to satisfy convexity, weak convexity, quasar convexity, or sharpness, but instead amounts to a property strictly weaker than the assumptions used in existing works. We propose a clean and simple subgradient descent algorithm that requires minimal knowledge of problem constants, applicable to either smooth or non-smooth functions.</description>

      <title>Amplitude maximization in stable systems, Schur positivity, and some conjectures on polynomial interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $r &gt; 0$ and integers $t \ge n &gt; 0$, we consider the following problem: maximize the amplitude $|x_t|$ at time $t$, over all complex solutions $x = (x_0, x_1, \dots)$ of arbitrary homogeneous linear difference equations of order $n$ with the characteristic roots in the disc $\{z \in \mathbb{C}: |z| \le r\}$, and with initial values $x_0, \dots, x_{n-1}$ in the unit disc. We find that for any triple $t,n,r$, the maximum is attained with coinciding roots on the boundary circle; in particular, this implies that the peak amplitude $\sup_{t \ge n} |x_t|$ can be maximized explicitly, by studying a unique equation with the characteristic polynomial $(z-r)^n$. Moreover, the optimality of the cophase root configuration holds for origin-centered polydiscs. To prove this result, we first reduce the problem to a certain interpolation problem over monomials, then solve the latter by leveraging the theory of symmetric functions and identifying the associated Schur positivity structure. We also discuss the implications for more general Reinhardt domains. Finally, we study the problem of estimating the derivatives of a real entire function from its values at $n/2$ pairs of complex conjugate points in the unit disc. We propose conjectures on the extremality of the monomial $z^n$, and restate them in terms of Schur polynomials.</description>
