      <title>Latency Advantages in Common-Value Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In financial applications, latency advantages - the ability to make decisions later than others, even without the ability to see what others have done - can provide individual participants with an edge by allowing them to gather additional relevant information. For example, a trader who is able to act even milliseconds after another trader may receive information about changing prices on other exchanges that lets them make a profit at the expense of the latter. To better understand the economics of latency advantages, we consider a common-value auction with a reserve price in which some bidders may have more information about the value of the item than others, e.g., by bidding later. We provide a characterization of the equilibrium strategies and study the welfare and auctioneer revenue implications of the last-mover advantage. We show that the auction does not degenerate completely and that the seller is still able to capture some value. We study comparative statics of the equilibrium under different assumptions about the nature of the latency advantage. Under the assumptions of the Black-Scholes model, we derive formulas for the last mover's expected profit, as well as for the sensitivity of that profit to their timing advantage. We apply our results to the design of blockchain protocols that aim to run auctions for financial assets on-chain, where incentives to increase timing advantages can put pressure on the decentralization of the system.</description>

      <title>Imprecision Attenuates Updating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies how imprecision in noisy signals attenuates Bayesian updating toward the prior. This phenomenon is well-known under a normal prior and normal noise, where less precise signals yield posterior means closer to the prior mean. We show this effect extends to any symmetric, log-concave prior and any symmetric, quasi-concave location experiment, using a newly introduced precision order. Our main result is that for any such prior and any signal realization, the posterior mean under location experiment S is closer to the prior mean than is the posterior mean S', if and only if S is less precise than S'. We discuss applications to cognitive imprecision, prior precision, and overconfidence.</description>

      <title>The Tension between Trust and Oversight in Long-term Relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A principal continually decides whether to approve resource allocations to an agent, who exerts private effort to remain eligible. The principal must perform costly inspections to determine the agent's eligibility. We characterize Markov Perfect Equilibria and analyze the paths of trust and oversight that emerge from the dynamic interplay of effort and oversight. At high trust levels, effort is an intertemporal substitute to oversight, which leads to unique interior effort choices and random inspections. At low trust levels, effort is an intertemporal complement to oversight, which may create a coordination problem, leading to equilibrium multiplicity. Voluntary disclosure can mitigate this coordination issue.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Societal and Economic Impacts of Artificial Intelligence: A Scenario Generation Methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores artificial intelligence's potential societal and economic impacts (AI) through generating scenarios that assess how AI may influence various sectors. We categorize and analyze key factors affecting AI's integration and adoption by applying an Impact-Uncertainty Matrix. A proposed methodology involves querying academic databases, identifying emerging trends and topics, and categorizing these into an impact uncertainty framework. The paper identifies critical areas where AI may bring significant change and outlines potential future scenarios based on these insights. This research aims to inform policymakers, industry leaders, and researchers on the strategic planning required to address the challenges and opportunities AI presents</description>

      <title>Bayesian eco-evolutionary game dynamics</title>

Abstract: The symbiotic relationship between the frameworks of classical game theory and evolutionary game theory is well-established. However, evolutionary game theorists have mostly tapped into the classical game of complete information where players are completely informed of all other players' payoffs. Of late, there is a surge of interest in eco-evolutionary interactions where the environment's state is changed by the players' actions which, in turn, are influenced by the changing environment. However, in real life, the information about the true environmental state must pass through some noisy channel (like usually imperfect sensory apparatus of the players) before it is perceived by the players: The players naturally are prone to sometimes perceive the true state erroneously. Given the uncertain perceived environment, the players may adopt bet-hedging kind of strategies in which they play different actions in different perceptions. In a population of such ill-informed players, a player would be confused about the information state of her opponent, and an incomplete information situation akin to a Bayesian game surfaces. In short, we contemplate possibility of natural emergence of symbiotic relationship between the frameworks of Bayesian games and eco-evolutionary games when the players are equipped with inefficient sensory apparatus. Herein, we illustrate this connection using a setup of infinitely large, well-mixed population of players equipped with two actions for exploiting a resource (the environment) at two different rates so that the resource state evolves accordingly. The state of the resource impacts every player's decision of playing particular action. We investigate continuous state environment in the presence of a Gaussian noisy channel. Employing the formalism of replicator dynamics, we find that noisy information can be effective in preventing resource from going extinct.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of voting rules based on majority margins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of voting with ranked ballots, an important class of voting rules is the class of margin-based rules (also called pairwise rules). A voting rule is margin-based if whenever two elections generate the same head-to-head margins of victory or loss between candidates, then the voting rule yields the same outcome in both elections. Although this is a mathematically natural invariance property to consider, whether it should be regarded as a normative axiom on voting rules is less clear. In this paper, we address this question for voting rules with any kind of output, whether a set of candidates, a ranking, a probability distribution, etc. We prove that a voting rule is margin-based if and only if it satisfies some axioms with clearer normative content. A key axiom is what we call Preferential Equality, stating that if two voters both rank a candidate $x$ immediately above a candidate $y$, then either voter switching to rank $y$ immediately above $x$ will have the same effect on the election outcome as if the other voter made the switch, so each voter's preference for $y$ over $x$ is treated equally.</description>

      <title>Coarse-Grained Games: A Framework for Bounded Perception in Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17598v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In everyday life, we frequently make coarse-grained judgments. When we say that Olivia and Noah excel in mathematics, we disregard the specific differences in their mathematical abilities. Similarly, when we claim that a particular automobile manufacturer produces high-quality cars, we overlook the minor variations among individual vehicles. These coarse-grained assessments are distinct from erroneous or deceptive judgments, such as those resulting from student cheating or false advertising by corporations. Despite the prevalence of such judgments, little attention has been given to their underlying mathematical structure. In this paper, we introduce the concept of coarse-graining into game theory, analyzing games where players may perceive different payoffs as identical while preserving the underlying order structure. We call it a Coarse-Grained Game (CGG). This framework allows us to examine the rational inference processes that arise when players equate distinct micro-level payoffs at a macro level, and to explore how Nash equilibria are preserved or altered as a result. Our key findings suggest that CGGs possess several desirable properties that make them suitable for modeling phenomena in the social sciences. This paper demonstrates two such applications: first, in cases of overly minor product updates, consumers may encounter an equilibrium selection problem, resulting in market behavior that is not driven by objective quality differences; second, the lemon market can be analyzed not only through objective information asymmetry but also through asymmetries in perceptual resolution or recognition ability.</description>
