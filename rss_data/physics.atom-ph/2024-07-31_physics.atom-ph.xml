      <title>Complete three-dimensional vector polarimetry with a Rydberg atom rf electrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio frequency (rf) receivers using Rydberg atoms offer appealing features over classical sensors, such as their size, frequency tuning range, and lack of field absorption. In this work, we extend the application space by demonstrating a Rydberg atom rf polarimeter. Using rf heterodyne with three independent and orthogonal local oscillators, we are able to extract the polarization ellipse of the field in three dimensions, in addition to the total amplitude of the field. We use the relative phases and amplitudes of the three generated heterodyne signals to measure the field amplitudes and phases along three cardinal axes giving the full three-dimensional polarization. We demonstrate this polarization measurement for incoming fields at different angles around the sensor. Lastly, we investigate the reception of data symbols encoded in the horizontal and vertical signal field polarizations and the phase between them. Our measurements yield an amplitude noise of 57 $\mu$V/m/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ for horizontal polarization, 66 $\mu$V/m/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ for vertical polarization, and a standard deviation of 0.094 rad in the phase between the field components.</description>

      <title>Rydberg atom-based microwave electrometry using polarization spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigated Rydberg atom-based microwave electrometry using polarization spectroscopy in a room-temperature vapor cell. By measuring Autler-Townes splitting in the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) spectrum, we determined that the minimum measurable microwave electric field is approximately five times lower than conventional EIT techniques. The results are well reproduced by a full optical Bloch equation model, which takes into account all the hyperfine levels involved. Subsequently, the EIT setup was used to characterize a custom microwave cylindrical lens, which increases the field at the focus by a factor of three, decreasing the minimum measurable microwave electric field by the same amount. Our results indicate that the combination of polarization spectroscopy and a microwave lens may enhance microwave electrometry.</description>

      <title>Ultra-precise holographic optical tweezers array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral atoms trapped in microscopic optical tweezers have emerged as a growing platform for quantum science. Achieving homogeneity over the tweezers array is an important technical requirement, and our research focuses on improving it for holographic arrays generated with a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM). We present a series of optimization methods to calculate better holograms, fueled by precise measurement schemes. These innovations enable to achieve intensity homogeneity with a relative standard deviation of 0.3 %, shape variations below 0.5 %, and positioning errors within 70 nm. Such ultra-precise holographic optical tweezers arrays allow for the most demanding applications in quantum science with atomic arrays.</description>

      <title>Measurement of differential collisional excitation cross sections for the K$\alpha$ emission of He-like oxygen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the energy-differential cross sections for collisional excitation of the soft X-ray electric-dipole K$\alpha$ ($x+y+w$) emission from He-like oxygen (O VII), using an electron beam ion trap. Values near their excitation thresholds were extracted from the observed emissivity by rapidly cycling the energy of the exciting electron beam. This allows us to subtract time-dependent contributions of the forbidden $z$-line emission to the multiplet. We develop a time-dependent collisional-radiative model to further demonstrate the method and predict all spectral features. We then compare the extracted $x+y+w$ cross-sections with calculations based on distorted-wave and R-matrix methods from the literature and our own predictions using the Flexible Atomic Code (FAC). All R-matrix results are validated by our measurements of direct and resonant excitation, supporting the use of such state-of-the-art codes for astrophysical and plasma physics diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Investigations of electron removal processes in slow He$^{2+}$ and He$^{+}$-Ne$_2$ collisions indicate high Interatomic Coulombic Decay yield</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We implement an independent-atom and independent-electron model to investigate the collision systems of He$^{2+}$ and He$^{+}$ ion projectiles impinging on a neon dimer target. The dimer is set to be stationary at its equilibrium bond length with the projectile traveling parallel to the dimer axis at a speed corresponding to the collision energy of 10 keV/amu. Two approaches called multinomial and determinantal are used as an analysis of these collisions. Each of the analyses is broken down into two types of models that do not and do include a change in the projectile charge state due to electron capture from the dimer. All calculations are performed using both a frozen atomic target and a dynamic response model using the coupled-channel two-center basis generator method for orbital propagation. All one- and two- electron removal processes are calculated, though particular attention is paid to those that result in the Ne$^{+}$-Ne$^{+}$ fragmentation channel due to its association with interatomic Coulombic decay (ICD). We confirm in all analyses and models that Ne(2$s$) electron removal is strong so that ICD will contribute to dimer fragmentation as has been previously demonstrated. The model that takes into account the change in projectile charge state indicates that there is a pure ICD yield when utilizing a He$^{+}$ projectile.</description>

      <title>Precise, super-resolving intensity measurement by quantum jump spectroscopy of a single neutral atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present precise, sub-wavelength optical intensity measurement using a single trapped $^{87}$Rb atom as a sensor. The intensity is measured by the scalar ac Stark shift it produces on the $F=1 \rightarrow F'=2$ hyperfine transition of the D$_{2}$ line, chosen for its $F' = F+1$ structure and very small tensor polarizability. To boost signal and reduce measurement-induced perturbations, we use a quantum jump spectroscopy technique in which a single absorbed photon on a transition of interest induces the scattering of hundreds of photons on a bright closed transition. The method greatly reduces systematic effects associated with the atomic state, optical polarization, probe power, and atom heating, and gives the atomic temperature as a second spectroscopic observable. We demonstrate the method by measuring the intensity at the focus of an optical tweezer.</description>

      <title>A warm Rydberg atom-based quadrature amplitude-modulated receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms exhibit remarkable sensitivity to electromagnetic fields, making them promising candidates for revolutionizing field sensors. Unlike conventional antennas, they neither disturb the measured field nor necessitate intricate calibration procedures. In this study, we propose a protocol for signal reception near the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi frequency band, harnessing the capabilities of warm Rydberg atoms. Our focus lies on exploring various quadrature amplitude modulations and transmission frequencies through heterodyne detection. We offer a comprehensive characterization of our setup, encompassing the atomic response frequency range and attainable electric field amplitudes. Additionally, we delve into analyzing communication errors using Voronoi diagrams, along with evaluating the communication channel capacity across different modulation schemes. Our findings not only lay the groundwork for future wireless communication applications, but also present opportunities to refine protocols in classical communication and field sensing domains.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Accuracy of the Variational Energy: The Hydrogen Atom in a Magnetic Field as an Illustration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a hydrogen atom subject to a constant magnetic field, we report a numerical realization of the two-dimensional Non-Linearization Procedure (NLP) to estimate the accuracy of the variational energy associated with a given trial function. Relevant equations of the NLP, which resemble those describing a dielectric medium with a space-dependent permittivity and charge distribution, are solved numerically with high accuracy by using an orthogonal collocation method. As an illustration, we consider three different trial functions including the one proposed in Phys. Rev. A 103, (2021) 032820. For a magnetic field strength of $\gamma = 1$ a.u., we establish the accuracy of the variational energy as well as the local accuracy of the trial function. Additionally, the accuracy of the cusp parameter and the quadrupole moment, found by means of the trial function, is investigated</description>
