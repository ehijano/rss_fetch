      <title>Risk Analysis of Passive Portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present an alternative passive investment strategy. The passive investment philosophy comes from the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), and its adoption is widespread. If EMH is true, one cannot outperform market by actively managing their portfolio for a long time. Also, it requires little to no intervention. People can buy an exchange-traded fund (ETF) with a long-term perspective. As the economy grows over time, one expects the ETF to grow. For example, in India, one can invest in NETF, which suppose to mimic the Nifty50 return. However, the weights of the Nifty 50 index are based on market capitalisation. These weights are not necessarily optimal for the investor. In this work, we present that volatility risk and extreme risk measures of the Nifty50 portfolio are uniformly larger than Markowitz's optimal portfolio. However, common people can't create an optimised portfolio. So we proposed an alternative passive investment strategy of an equal-weight portfolio. We show that if one pushes the maximum weight of the portfolio towards equal weight, the idiosyncratic risk of the portfolio would be minimal. The empirical evidence indicates that the risk profile of an equal-weight portfolio is similar to that of Markowitz's optimal portfolio. Hence instead of buying Nifty50 ETFs, one should equally invest in the stocks of Nifty50 to achieve a uniformly better risk profile than the Nifty 50 ETF portfolio. We also present an analysis of how portfolios perform to idiosyncratic events like the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We found that the equal weight portfolio has a uniformly lower risk than the Nifty 50 portfolio before and during the Russia-Ukraine war.

      <title>Not feeling the buzz: Correction study of mispricing and inefficiency in online sportsbooks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01740v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a replication and correction of a recent article (Ramirez, P., Reade, J.J., Singleton, C., Betting on a buzz: Mispricing and inefficiency in online sportsbooks, International Journal of Forecasting, 39:3, 2023, pp. 1413-1423, doi: 10.1016/j.ijforecast.2022.07.011). RRS measure profile page views on Wikipedia to generate a "buzz factor" metric for tennis players and show that it can be used to form a profitable gambling strategy by predicting bookmaker mispricing. Here, we use the same dataset as RRS to reproduce their results exactly, thus confirming the robustness of their mispricing claim. However, we discover that the published betting results are significantly affected by a single bet (the "Hercog" bet), which returns substantial outlier profits based on erroneously long odds. When this data quality issue is resolved, the majority of reported profits disappear and only one strategy, which bets on "competitive" matches, remains significantly profitable in the original out-of-sample period. While one profitable strategy offers weaker support than the original study, it still provides an indication that market inefficiencies may exist, as originally claimed by RRS. As an extension, we continue backtesting after 2020 on a cleaned dataset. Results show that (a) the "competitive" strategy generates no further profits, potentially suggesting markets have become more efficient, and (b) model coefficients estimated over this more recent period are no longer reliable predictors of bookmaker mispricing. We present this work as a case study demonstrating the importance of replication studies in sports forecasting, and the necessity to clean data. We open-source release comprehensive datasets and code.</description>
