      <title>From hierarchical triangular spin liquid to multi-$q$ spin texture in spinel GeFe$_2$O$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining macroscopic measurements, neutron scattering and modeling, we identify in the GeFe$_2$O$_4$ spinel a correlated paramagnetic state resulting from the predominance of third-neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions. These interactions materialize 4 isolated families of triangular planes with 120$^{\circ}$ spins emerging from the underlying pyrochlore lattice. At lower temperatures, a phase transition occurs from this hierarchical spin liquid to a non-coplanar spin texture that is characterized by 6 propagating vectors. This unusual multi-$q$ order is triggered by the presence of weaker interactions up to the sixth neighbors. The system is remarkably successful in coupling the different triangular planes while maintaining their two-dimensional 120$^{\circ}$ order. Our study highlights the hierarchy of interactions involved in GeFe$_2$O$_4$, which is singular among spinel compounds since first-neighbor interactions are only a small fraction of the dominant third neighbor ones.</description>

      <title>The Relevance of Non-axiality and Low-lying Excited States for Slow Magnetic Relaxation in Pentagonal-bipyramidal Erbium(III) Complexes Probed by High-frequency EPR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-frequency/high-field electron paramagnetic resonance studies on a series of seven-coordinate pentagonal-bipyramidal (PBP) erbium(III) complexes Er(DAPMBH/H$_2$DAPS)X (H$_2$DAPMBH = 2,6-diacetylpyridine bis-4-methoxy benzoylhydrazone, H$_4$DAPS = 2,6-diacetylpyridine bis-(salicylhydrazone)) demonstrate the effects of different apical ligands (X = (H$_2$O)Cl (1), (CH$_3$OH)N$_3$ (2), Cl$_2$ (3)) on the local magnetic anisotropy of the central Er(III) ions. In particular, we report direct experimental determination of the effective $g$-values and zero field splittings of the energetically low-lying Kramers doublets. Our quantitative determination of the magnetic anisotropy highlights the relevance of an axial $g$-tensor for SMM behaviour and suggests that fast magnetic relaxation is mainly driven by a thermally assisted quantum tunnelling process via low-lying excited states.</description>

      <title>Surface Structure and Surface State of a Tight-Binding Model on a Diamond Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface states of a tight-binding model with nearest-neighbor hopping on a diamond lattice of finite thickness are investigated. We consider systems with (001), (110), and (111) surfaces. Even if the surface direction is fixed, there is freedom to choose the surface structure due to the two-sublattice nature of a diamond lattice. The existence of surface states is governed by the topology of the matrix elements of the bulk Hamiltonian. In this sense, the existence of surface states is determined by the bulk Hamiltonian. However, the matrix elements depend on the choice of the unit cell, which should be chosen to conform to the surface structure. Thus, the surface states depend on the surface structure. We find that for each surface direction, there are two choices of surface structure, and depending on the chosen structure, the corresponding surface states emerge in distinct regions of the surface Brillouin zone.</description>

      <title>Higgs mode in two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy of weak-coupling antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) provides insights into the nonlinear response of correlated lattice systems. We simulate multipulse excitations in the Hubbard model using nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory to extract the 2DCS signal of weak-coupling antiferromagnets with and without disorder. By comparing calculations with static and dynamic Hartree terms, and analyzing the waiting-time dependence of the signal, we identify the contribution of the collective amplitude (Higgs) mode to the spectroscopic features and the relevant underlying processes. With broadband pulses, the rephasing and nonrephasing peaks at the gap energy are found to be of predominant Higgs character, while the two-quantum signals originate from single-particle excitations. Using narrow-band pulses, we also demonstrate a strong enhancement of these Higgs-related signals at a pulse frequency of half the gap size.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Band Dispersions and an Evidence of Cooperon Excitations in a Spin-$1/2$ Trimer Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the solution of the Hamiltonian of an antiferromagnetically coupled spin-$1/2$ trimer chain in terms of three bands that host three different species of fermions. While the lowest two bands correspond to spin-$1/2$ fermions, the fermions in the highest band are of spin-$3/2$. Because the bands are for different species of fermions, the particle-hole excitation channel across the bands is closed. However, fractionalized excitations as spin-$1/2$ and spin-$3/2$ fermions in pairs open a cooperon channel of excitations in Raman scattering. The background spectral intensity profile obtained by Raman scattering measurements in Na$_2$Cu$_3$Ge$_4$O$_{12}$ having a trimer chain consisting of spin-$1/2$ Cu ions, has comprehensively been shown to be consistent with these excitations.</description>

      <title>Improved Lanczos Algorithm using Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We improve the Lanczos algorithm using the matrix product state representation proposed in Phys. Rev. B 85, 205119 (2012). As an alternative to the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), the Lanczos algorithm avoids local minima and can directly find multiple low-lying eigenstates. However, its performance and accuracy are affected by the truncation required to maintain the efficiency of the tensor network representation. In this work, we enhance its convergence by restarting with multiple states. We benchmark our method on one-dimensional instances of the Fermi-Hubbard model with 8 sites and the Heisenberg model with 16 sites in an external field, using numerical experiments targeting the first five lowest eigenstates. Across these tests, our approach obtains accuracy improvements of three to seven orders of magnitude. Finally, we extend the Heisenberg model simulation to a lattice with 30 sites to highlight its scalability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a tensor network-based method for calculating disorder-averaged expectation values in random spin chains without having to explicitly sample over disorder configurations. The algorithm exploits statistical translation invariance and works directly in the thermodynamic limit. We benchmark our method on the infinite-randomness critical point of the random transverse field Ising model.</description>

      <title>Tunable stacking-driven topological phase transitions in pnictide layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonmagnetic topological insulators (TIs) are known for their robust metallic surface/edge states that are protected by time-reversal symmetry, making them promising candidates for next-generation spintronic and nanoelectronic devices. Traditional approaches to realizing TIs have focused on inducing band inversion via strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), yet many materials with substantial SOC often remain topologically trivial. In this work, we present a materials-design strategy for engineering topologically non-trivial phases, e.g., quantum spin Hall phases, by vertically stacking topologically trivial Rashba monolayers in an inverted fashion. Using BiSb as a prototype system, we demonstrate that while the BiSb monolayer is topologically trivial (despite having significant SOC), an inverted BiSb-SbBi bilayer configuration realizes a non-trivial topological phase with enhanced spin Hall conductivity. We further reveal a delicate interplay between the SOC strength and the interlayer electron tunneling that governs the emergence of a nontrivial topological phase in the bilayer heterostructure. This phase can be systematically tuned using an external electric field, providing an experimentally accessible means of controlling the system's topology. Our magnetotransport studies further validate this interplay, by revealing g-factor suppression and the emergence a zeroth Landau level. Notably, the inverted bilayer heterostructure exhibits a robust and tunable spin Hall effect, with performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art materials. Thus, our findings unveil an alternative pathway for designing and engineering functional properties in 2D topological systems using topologically trivial constituent monolayers.</description>

      <title>Topotactical hydrogen induced single-band $d$-wave superconductivity in La$_2$NiO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: La$_2$NiO$_4$ is an antiferromagnetic insulator with a structural resemblance to its cuprate counterpart, La$_2$CuO$_4$. However, La$_2$CuO$_4$ has a Cu$^{2+}$ or 3$d^9$ electronic configuration that needs to be hole or electron doped for superconductivity, whereas La$_2$NiO$_4$ is 3$d^8$ with divalent Ni$^{2+}$. Making a cuprate analog through conventional electron doping is impractical due to the rarity of trivalent substituents for La. In this work, we propose an alternative route: intercalating topotactical hydrogen which is possible through electric-field-controlled protonation and transforms La$_2$NiO$_4$ into a 3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ single-band two-dimensional anti-ferromagnetic Mott insulator analogous to La$_2$CuO$_4$. This we find through density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory calculations. The furthergoing dynamical vertex approximation predicts that H-La$_2$NiO$_4$ can host $d$-wave superconductivity under 15\% hole doping with a critical temperature above 20\,K. Our findings not only suggest a new method for tuning the electronic structure of layered nickelates but also provides theoretical evidence for a new nickelate superconductor, awaiting experimental synthesis.</description>

      <title>A Unified Variational Framework for Quantum Excited States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining quantum excited states is crucial across physics and chemistry but presents significant challenges for variational methods, primarily due to the need to enforce orthogonality to lower-energy states, often requiring state-specific optimization, penalty terms, or specialized ansatz constructions. We introduce a novel variational principle that overcomes these limitations, enabling the \textit{simultaneous} determination of multiple low-energy excited states. The principle is based on minimizing the trace of the inverse overlap matrix multiplied by the Hamiltonian matrix, $\mathrm{Tr}(\mathbf{S}^{-1}\mathbf{H})$, constructed from a set of \textit{non-orthogonal} variational states $\{|\psi_i\rangle\}$. Here, $\mathbf{H}_{ij} = \langle\psi_i | H | \psi_j\rangle$ and $\mathbf{S}_{ij} = \langle\psi_i | \psi_j\rangle$ are the elements of the Hamiltonian and overlap matrices, respectively. This approach variationally optimizes the entire low-energy subspace spanned by $\{|\psi_i\rangle\}$ without explicit orthogonality constraints or penalty functions. We demonstrate the power and generality of this method across diverse physical systems and variational ansatzes: calculating the low-energy spectrum of 1D Heisenberg spin chains using matrix product states, finding vibrational spectrum of Morse potential using quantics tensor trains for real-space wavefunctions, and determining excited states for 2D fermionic Hubbard model with variational quantum circuits. In all applications, the method accurately and simultaneously obtains multiple lowest-lying energy levels and their corresponding states, showcasing its potential as a unified and flexible framework for calculating excited states on both classical and quantum computational platforms.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity and trimers on attractive-$U$ Hubbard ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between superconducting correlations and trimer formation in polarized two-component Fermi gases confined to multileg attractive-$U$ Hubbard ladders. Employing density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we explore the effects of spin-dependent tunneling amplitudes on these systems. Specifically, we analyze how bound states of three fermions (trimers) impact Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting correlations at commensurate charge carrier densities, where $2n_{\uparrow} = n_{\downarrow}$. In one-dimensional (1D) systems, trimer formation is known to suppress FFLO correlations exponentially. Our results demonstrate that this suppression persists on ladder lattices of small width, effectively mirroring the 1D behavior. However, we find a striking departure from the 1D regime as the ladder width increases. On ladders with a width of four legs, the influence of trimers on superconducting correlations becomes negligible, suggesting that wider ladder systems provide a distinct environment where FFLO-like pairing remains robust even in the presence of trimer states. These findings underscore the dimensional crossover in Hubbard systems and shed light on the mechanisms governing superconductivity and bound-state formation in strongly correlated fermionic systems. Our work has implications for understanding unconventional superconductivity in strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Skin Effect Induced Anomalous Dynamics from Charge-Fluctuating Initial States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium dynamics in non-Hermitian systems has attracted significant interest, particularly due to the skin effect and its associated anomalous phenomena. Previous studies have primarily focused on initial states with a definite particle number. Here, we present a systematic study of non-reciprocal quench dynamics in the pairing states with indefinite particle number. Our study uncovers a range of novel behaviors. Firstly, we demonstrate a universal tendency towards half-filling of particle density at late times. At early times for certain initial states, we observe a chiral wavefront in both particle number distribution and charge inflow, associated with a sharp decrease in particle number. Furthermore, we find that non-Hermiticity could enhance the growth of entanglement in the initial stages of evolution. In the intermediate time regime, the characteristic skin effect leads to particle accumulation on one side, leading to a pronounced reduction in entanglement entropy. Moreover, our results reveal the presence of the quantum Mpemba effect during the restoration of U(1) symmetry. Our findings open new avenues for exploring exotic dynamic phenomena in quantum many-body systems arising from the interplay of symmetry breaking and non-Hermiticity.</description>

      <title>Universal contributions to charge fluctuations in spin chains at finite temperature</title>

Abstract: At finite temperature, conserved charges undergo thermal fluctuations in a quantum many-body system in the grand canonical ensemble. The full structure of the fluctuations of the total U(1) charge $Q$ can be succinctly captured by the generating function $G(\theta)=\left\langle e^{i \theta Q}\right\rangle$. For a 1D translation-invariant spin chain, in the thermodynamic limit the magnitude $|G(\theta)|$ scales with the system size $L$ as $\ln |G(\theta)|=-\alpha(\theta)L+\gamma(\theta)$, where $\gamma(\theta)$ is the scale-invariant contribution and may encode universal information about the underlying system. In this work we investigate the behavior and physical meaning of $\gamma(\theta)$ when the system is periodic. We find that $\gamma(\theta)$ only takes nonzero values at isolated points of $\theta$, which is $\theta=\pi$ for all our examples. In two exemplary lattice systems we show that $\gamma(\pi)$ takes quantized values when the U(1) symmetry exhibits a specific type of 't Hooft anomaly with other symmetries. In other cases, we investigate how $\gamma(\theta)$ depends on microscopic conditions (such as the filling factor) in field theory and exactly solvable lattice models.</description>

      <title>Driven Critical Dynamics in Strongly Interacting Dirac Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19258v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conventional Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) and finite-time scaling (FTS) provide universal descriptions of the driven critical dynamics from gapped initial states based on the adiabatic-impulse scenario. In this paper, by leveraging the large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we investigate the driven critical dynamics in two-dimensional Dirac systems, which harbor semimetal and Mott insulator phases separated by the quantum critical point (QCP) triggered by the interplay between fluctuations of gapless Dirac fermions and order parameter bosons. A remarkable discovery is that, despite the existence of the gapless initial phase, the driven dynamics can still be captured by the FTS form. This leads us to propose a generalized criterion for the validity of KZM and FTS with a gapless initial state. Accordingly, our results significantly generalize the KZM theory to incorporate composite fluctuations and relax its requirement for a gapped initial state to systems accommodating gapless Dirac fermionic excitations. Through successfully extending the KZM and FTS theory to the strongly interacting Dirac QCP, our work not only brings new fundamental perspective into the nonequilibrium critical dynamics, but also provides a novel theoretical approach to fathom quantum critical properties in fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional fracton topological orders with boundary Toeplitz braiding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02482v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically study a class of 3D non-liquid states that show exotic boundary phenomena in the thermodynamical limit. More concretely, we focus on a class of 3D fracton topological orders formed via stacking 2D twisted \(\mathbb{Z}_N\) topologically ordered layers along \(z\)-direction. Nearby layers are coupled while maintaining translation symmetry along \(z\) direction. The effective field theory is given by the infinite-component Chern-Simons (iCS) field theory, with an integer-valued symmetric block-tridiagonal Toeplitz \(K\)-matrix whose size is thermodynamically large. With open boundary conditions (OBC) along \(z\), certain choice of \(K\)-matrices exhibits exotic boundary ``Toeplitz braiding'', where the mutual braiding phase angle between two anyons at opposite boundaries oscillates and remains non-zero in the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, in trivial case, the mutual braiding phase angle decays exponentially to zero in the thermodynamical limit. As a necessary condition, this phenomenon requires the existence of boundary zero modes in the \(K\)-matrix spectrum under OBC. We categorize nontrivial \(K\)-matrices into two distinct types. Each type-I possesses two boundary zero modes, whereas each type-II possesses only one boundary zero mode. Interestingly, the integer-valued Hamiltonian matrix of the familiar 1D ``Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model'' can be used as a non-trivial $K$ matrix. Importantly, since large-gauge-invariance ensures integer quantized \(K\)-matrix entries, global symmetries are not needed to protect these zero modes. We also present numerical simulation as well as finite size scaling, further confirming the above analytical results. Symmetry fractionalization in iCS field theory is also briefly discussed. Motivated by the present field-theoretical work, it will be interesting to ... ....</description>

      <title>Single Crystal Diffuse Neutron Scattering Study of the Dipole-Octupole Quantum Spin Ice Candidate Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$: No Apparent Octupolar Correlations Above $T = 0.05$ K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07640v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The insulating magnetic pyrochlore Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ has gained attention as a quantum spin ice candidate with dipole-octupole character arising from the crystal electric field ground state doublet for the Ce$^{3+}$ ion. This permits both spin ice phases based on magnetic dipoles and those based on more-exotic octupoles. We report low-temperature neutron diffraction measurements on single crystal Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ with $Q$-coverage both at low $Q$ where the magnetic form factor for dipoles is near maximal and at high $Q$ where the magnetic form factor for Ce$^{3+}$ octupoles is near maximal. This study was motivated by recent powder neutron diffraction studies of other Ce-based dipole-octupole pyrochlores, Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$, which each showed temperature-dependent diffuse diffraction at high $Q$ that was interpreted as arising from octupolar correlations. Our measurements use an optimized single crystal diffuse scattering instrument that allows us to screen against strong Bragg scattering from Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$. The temperature-difference neutron diffraction reveals a low-$Q$ peak consistent with dipolar spin ice correlations reported in previous work, and an alternation between positive and negative net intensity at higher $Q$. These features are consistent with our numerical-linked-cluster calculations using pseudospin interaction parameters previously reported for Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$, and Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$. Importantly, neither the measured data nor any of the NLC calculations show evidence for increased scattering at high $Q$ resulting from octupolar correlations. We conclude that at the lowest attainable temperature for our measurements ($T = 0.05$ K), scattering from octupolar correlations in Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ is not present in the neutron diffraction signal on the level of our observation threshold of ~ 0.1 % of the low-$Q$ dipole scattering.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking meets average symmetry-protected topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have unveiled new possibilities for discovering intrinsic quantum phases that are unique to open systems, including phases with average symmetry-protected topological (ASPT) order and strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) order in systems with global symmetry. In this work, we propose a new class of phases, termed the double ASPT phase, which emerges from a nontrivial extension of these two orders. This new phase is absent from prior studies and cannot exist in conventional closed systems. Using the recently developed imaginary-Lindbladian formalism, we explore the phase diagram of a one-dimensional open system with $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\sigma}\times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\tau}$ symmetry. We identify universal critical behaviors along each critical line and observe the emergence of an intermediate phase that completely breaks the $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\sigma}$ symmetry, leading to the formation of two triple points in the phase diagram. These two triple points are topologically distinct and connected by a domain-wall decoration duality map. Our results promote the establishment of a complete classification for quantum phases in open systems with various symmetry conditions.</description>

      <title>Aspects of the normal state resistivity of cuprate superconductors Bi2201, Tl2201 and Hg1201</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planar normal state resistivity data from two families of hole doped single layer cuprate superconductors $Bi2201$ (Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CuO$_{6+x}$) and $Tl2201$ (Tl$_2$Ba$_2$CuO$_{6+x}$) are calculated using the extremely correlated Fermi liquid theory (ECFL). This theory was recently employed for understanding the three families of single layer cuprate superconductors LSCO, BSLCO and NCCO. Adding these two systems accounts for essentially all single layer compounds where data is available for a range of densities and temperatures. The added case of $Bi2201$ is of particular interest since it was the original system where the almost linear in temperature resistivity was reported in 1990, and has been followed up by a systematic doping analysis only recently in 2022. The $Tl2201$ system has two distinct set of band parameters that fit the same Fermi surface, providing new challenges and insights into the ECFL theory.</description>

      <title>Square skyrmion lattice in multiorbital $f$-electron systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the emergence of a square-shaped skyrmion lattice in multi-orbital $f$-electron systems with easy-axis magnetic anisotropy on a centrosymmetric square lattice. By performing mean-field calculations for an effective localized model consisting of two Kramers doublets, we construct the low-temperature phase diagram in a static external magnetic field. Consequently, we find that a square-shaped skyrmion lattice with the skyrmion number of one appears in the intermediate-field region when the crystal field splitting between the two doublets is small. Furthermore, we identify another double-$Q$ state with a nonzero net scalar chirality at zero- and low-field regions, which is attributed to the help of the multi-orbital degree of freedom. Our results offer another route to search for skyrmion-hosting materials in centrosymmetric $f$-electron tetragonal systems with multi-orbital degrees of freedom, e.g., Ce-based compounds. This contrasts with conventional other $f$-electron systems hosting skyrmion lattices, such as Gd- and Eu-based compounds without orbital angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spin Liquid phases in Kitaev Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a gauge-invariant renormalized mean-field theory (RMFT) method, to reliably find the quantum spin liquid (QSL) states and their field response in realistic Kitaev materials. Remarkably, while our RMFT reproduces previous results based on more complicated numerical methods, it also predicts several new stable QSL states. In particular, since Kitaev spin liquid(KSL) is no longer a saddle point solution, a new exotic 2-cone state distinct from the KSL, is found to describe the experimental observations well, and hence the candidate state be realized in the Kitaev material, {\alpha}-RuCl3. We further explore the mechanism for the suppression of the observed thermal Hall conductivity at low temperatures within the fermionic framework, and show the theoretical polarangle dependence of fermionic gap that can distinguish the found 2-cone state from the KSL state in further experiment.</description>

      <title>Toroid, Altermagnetic and Noncentrosymmetric ordering in metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The article is dedicated to the 60-th anniversary of the Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics and presents a review of normal and superconducting properties of toroidal, altermagnetic and noncentrosymmetric metals. Metals with toroidal order are compounds not possessing symmetry in respect of space and time inversion but symmetric in respect of product of these operations. An electric current propagating through samples of such a material causes its magnetisation. Superconducting states in toroidal metals are a mixture of singlet and triplet states. Superconductivity is gapless even in ideal crystals without impurities. Altermegnets are antiferromagnetic metals that have a specific spin splitting of electron bands determined by time inversion in combinations with rotations and reflections of crystal lattice. Similar splitting takes place in metals whose symmetry does not have a spatial inversion operation. Both of these types materials have an anomalous Hall effect. A current propagating through a noncentrosymmetric metal causes magnetization, but this is not the case in altermagnets. On the other hand, in altermagnets there is a specific piezomagnetic Hall effect. Superconducting pairing in non-centrosymmetric metals occurs between electrons occupying states in one zone, whereas in altermagnets we are dealing with interband pairing, which is unfavorable for the formation of a superconducting state.</description>

      <title>Coupled-wire Construction of a Non-crystalline Fractional Quantum Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect, a paradigmatic topologically ordered state, has been realised in two-dimensional strongly correlated quantum gases and Chern bands of crystals. Here we construct a non-crystalline analogue by coupling quantum wires that are not periodically placed in real-space. Remarkably, the model remains solvable using bosonisation techniques. Due to the non-uniform couplings between the wires, the ground state has different degeneracy compared to the crystalline case. It displays a rich phenomenology of excitations, which can either behave like anyons confined to move in one dimension (lineons), anyons confined to hop between two wires (s-lineons), and anyonic excitations that are free to travel across the system. Both the ground state degeneracy and mutual statistics are directly determined by the real-space positions of the wires. By providing an analytically solvable model of a non-crystalline fractional quantum Hall effect, our work showcases that topological order can display richer phenomenology beyond crystals. More broadly, the non-uniform wire construction we develop can serve as a tool to explore richer many-body phenomenology in non-crystalline systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometric Kohn-Luttinger Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coulomb repulsion can, counterintuitively, mediate Cooper pairing via the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism. However, it is commonly believed that observability of the effect requires special circumstances -- e.g., vicinity of the Fermi level to van Hove singularities, significant lattice-induced band distortions, or non-trivial Fermi surface topologies. Here we establish that quantum geometric properties of the constituent electrons can dramatically promote pairing from repulsion via dependence of screening on the quantum metric. We demonstrate quantum-geometry-enhanced superconductivity in two microscopic models with tunable quantum geometry, highlighting the crucial roles of quantum metric anisotropy and inhomogeneity. Our analysis provides an experimentally accessible figure of merit for the importance of quantum geometry to inducing unconventional superconductivity, indicating its relevance to graphene multilayers.</description>
