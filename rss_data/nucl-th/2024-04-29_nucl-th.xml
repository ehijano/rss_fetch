      <title>Charged pion vortices in rotating systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Possibilities for formation of the charged pion field vortices in a rotating empty vessel (in vacuum) and in the rotating pion gas with a dynamically fixed particle number at zero temperature are studied within the $\lambda|\phi|^4$ model. It is shown that in the former case at a rapid rotation a supervortex of a charged pion field can be formed. Important role played by the electric field is demonstrated. Field configurations in presence and absence of the pion self-interaction are found. Conditions for formation of the vortex lattice at the rotation of the charged pion gas at zero temperature are studied. Observational effects are discussed.</description>

      <title>TALYS calculation and a short review of the experimental status of proton capture studies on p-nuclei: A guide to future investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TALYS calculations were performed to obtain the theoretical proton capture cross-sections on the p-nuclei. A short review on the status of related experimental studies was also conducted. Some basic properties such as Q-values, Coulomb barrier, Gamow peak, Gamow Window, and decay properties of the parent and daughter nuclei were studied. Various experimental parameters, e.g., beam energy, beam current, targets, and detectors, used in experimental investigations reported in the literature, were tabulated. The results of the TALYS calculations in the Gamow region were compared with the corresponding experimental values wherever available. This study is expected to facilitate the planning of future experiments.</description>

      <title>Bayesian and Principal Component Analyses of Neutron Star Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Bayesian method is used in this extensive work to generate a large set of minimally constrained equations of state (EOSs) for matters in neutron stars (NS). These EOSs are analyzed for their correlations with key NS properties, such as the tidal deformability, radius, and maximum mass, within the mass range of $1.2-2M_\odot$. The observed connections between the pressure of $\beta$-equilibrated matter and the properties of neutron stars at different densities offer significant insights into the behavior of NS matter in a nearly model-independent manner. The study also examines the influence of various factors on the correlation of symmetry energy parameters, such as slope and curvature parameters at saturation density ($\rho_0=0.16 ~\text{fm}^{-3}$) with the tidal deformability and radius of neutron stars. This study investigates the robustness of the observed correlations by considering the distributions and interdependence of symmetry energy parameters. Furthermore, the utilization of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed to unveil the complicated relationship between various nuclear matter parameters and properties of neutron stars. This analysis highlights the importance of employing multivariate analysis techniques in order to comprehend the variety in tidal deformability and radius observed across distinct masses of NS. This comprehensive study aims to establish a connection between the parameters of nuclear matter and the properties of neutron stars, providing significant insights into the behavior of NS matter across different circumstances.</description>

      <title>Global data-driven determination of baryon transition form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hadronic resonances emerge from strong interactions encoding the dynamics of quarks and gluons. The structure of these resonances can be probed by virtual photons parameterized in transition form factors. In this study, twelve $N^*$ and $\Delta$ transition form factors at the pole are extracted from data with the center-of-mass energy from $\pi N$ threshold to $1.8\,{\rm GeV}$, and the photon virtuality $0\leq Q^2/{\rm GeV}^2\leq 8$. For the first time, these results are determined from a simultaneous analysis of more than one state, i.e., $\sim 10^5$ $\pi N$, $\eta N$, and $K\Lambda$ electroproduction data. In addition, about $ 5\cdot 10^4$ data in the hadronic sector as well as photoproduction serve as boundary conditions. For the $\Delta(1232)$ and $N(1440)$ states our results are in qualitative agreement with previous studies, while the transition form factors at the poles of some higher excited states are estimated for the first time. Realistic uncertainties are determined by further exploring the parameter space.</description>

      <title>The extended Lipkin model: proposal for implementation in a quantum platform and machine learning analysis of its phase diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Extended Lipkin Model (ELM), whose phase diagram mirrors that of the Interacting Boson Approximation model (IBA). Unlike the standard Lipkin model, the ELM (as the IBA) features both first- and second-order quantum shape phase transitions depending on the model parameters. Our goal is to implement the ELM on a quantum platform, leveraging Machine Learning techniques to identify its quantum phase transitions and critical lines. To achieve this, we offer: i) ground state energy calculations using a variational quantum eigensolver; ii) a detailed formulation for ELM dynamics within quantum computing, facilitating experimental exploration of the IBA phase diagram; and iii) a phase diagram determination using various Machine Learning methods. We successfully replicate the ELM ground-state energy using the Adaptive Derivative-Assembled Pseudo-Trotter ansatz Variational Quantum Eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE) algorithm across the entire phase space. Our framework ensures ELM implementation on quantum platforms with controlled errors. Lastly, our ML predictions yield a meaningful phase diagram for the model.

      <title>The Theoretical Study of $p\bar{p}\to\bar{\Lambda}\Sigma\eta$ Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the production of hyperon resonances in the $p\bar{p}\to\bar{\Lambda}\Sigma\eta$ reaction within an effective Lagrangian approach. The model includes the production of $\Sigma(1750)$ and $\Lambda(1670)$ in the intermediate state excited by the $K$ and $K^*$ meson exchanges between the initial proton and antiproton. Due to the large coupling of $\Sigma(1750)\Sigma\eta$ vertex, $\Sigma(1750)$ is found a significant contribution near the threshold in this reaction. We provide total and differential cross section predictions for the reation and discuss the possible influence of $\Sigma(1750)\Sigma\eta$ vertex coupling and model parameters, which will be useful in future experimental studies. This reaction can provide a platform for studying the features of $\Sigma(1750)$ resonance, especially the coupling to $\Sigma\eta$ channel.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing charged lepton flavor violation scenarios with inelastic $\mu\rightarrow e$ conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mu2e and COMET experiments are expected to improve existing limits on charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV) by roughly four orders of magnitude. $\mu\rightarrow e$ conversion experiments are typically optimized for electrons produced without nuclear excitation, as this maximizes the electron energy and minimizes backgrounds from the free decay of the muon. Here we argue that Mu2e and COMET will be able to extract additional constraints on CLFV from inelastic $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion, given the $^{27}$Al target they have chosen and backgrounds they anticipate. We describe CLFV scenarios in which inelastic CLFV can induce measurable distortions in the near-endpoint spectrum of conversion electrons, including cases where certain contributing operators cannot be probed in elastic $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion. We extend the nonrelativistic EFT treatment of elastic $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion to include the new nuclear operators needed for the inelastic process, evaluate the associated nuclear response functions, and describe several new-physics scenarios where the inelastic process can provide additional information on CLFV.</description>

      <title>Most general neutron decay correlations: Standard Model recoil and radiative corrections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To continue from our previous work \textit{Phys.Rev.D\textbf{109}(2024),073007}, we derive the full Standard Model prediction of the most general free neutron differential decay rate with all massive particles (neutron, proton and electron) polarized, including the $\mathcal{O}(1/m_N)$ recoil corrections and $\mathcal{O}(\alpha/\pi)$ radiative corrections. For the latter we adopt the newly-developed pseudo-neutrino formalism which is compatible to realistic experimental setups, in which neutrinos and photons are not detected. We also provide readily-executable \textit{Mathematica} notebooks to evaluate these corrections.</description>

      <title>Spiral flow of quantum quartic oscillator with energy cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theory of the quantum quartic oscillator is developed with close attention to the energy cutoff one needs to impose on the system in order to approximate the smallest eigenvalues and corresponding eigenstates of its Hamiltonian by diagonalizing matrices of limited size. The matrices are obtained by evaluating matrix elements of the Hamiltonian between the associated harmonic-oscillator eigenstates and by correcting the computed matrices to compensate for their limited dimension, using the Wilsonian renormalization-group procedure. The cutoff dependence of the corrected matrices is found to be described by a spiral motion of a three-dimensional vector. This behavior is shown to result from a combination of a limit-cycle and a floating fixed-point behaviors, a distinct feature of the foundational quantum system that warrants further study. A brief discussion of the research directions concerning renormalization of polynomial interactions of degree higher than four, spontaneous symmetry breaking and coupling of more than one oscillator through the near neighbor couplings known in condensed matter and quantum field theory, is included.</description>

      <title>Skeletal Kinetics Reduction for Astrophysical Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel methodology is developed to extract accurate skeletal reaction models for nuclear combustion. Local sensitivities of isotope mass fractions with respect to reaction rates are modeled based on the forced optimally time-dependent (f-OTD) scheme. These sensitivities are then analyzed temporally to generate skeletal models. The methodology is demonstrated by conducting skeletal reduction of constant density and temperature burning of carbon and oxygen relevant to SNe Ia. The 495-isotopes Torch model is chosen as the detailed reaction network. A map of maximum production of $^{56}\text{Ni}$ in SNe Ia is produced for different temperatures, densities, and proton to neutron ratios. The f-OTD simulations and the sensitivity analyses are then performed with initial conditions from this map. A series of skeletal models are derived and their performances are assessed by comparison against currently existing skeletal models. Previous models have been constructed intuitively by assuming the dominance of $\alpha$-chain reactions. The comparison of the newly generated skeletal models against previous models is based on the predicted energy release and $^{44}\text{Ti}$ and $^{56}\text{Ni}$ abundances by each model. The consequences of $\mathtt{y}_e \neq 0.5$ in the initial composition are also explored where $\mathtt{y}_e$ is the electron fraction. The simulated results show that $^{56}\text{Ni}$ production decreases by decreasing $\mathtt{y}_e$ as expected, and that the $^{43}\text{Sc}$ is a key isotope in proton and neutron channels toward $^{56}\text{Ni}$ production. It is shown that an f-OTD skeletal model with 150 isotopes can accurately predict the $^{56}\text{Ni}$ abundance in SNe Ia for $\mathtt{y}_e \lesssim 0.5$ initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Moments of inertia in light deformed nuclei: pairing and mean-field impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dependence of the moment of inertia $\cal J$ on the pairing and axial quadrupole deformation $\beta$ in $^{24}$Mg and $^{20}$Ne was investigated. The study is based on quadrupole-constrained calculations with three cranking approaches for $\cal J$ (Inglis-Belyaev, Thouless-Valatin, adiabatic time-dependent Hartree-Fock) and a representative set of Skyrme forces (SVbas, SkM*, SLy6). At variance with macroscopic collective models, the calculations predict the specific regime $d{\cal J}/d\beta&lt;0$ at $\beta \ge 0.5$ ($^{24}$Mg) and $\beta \ge 0.6$ ($^{20}$Ne), where the pairing breaks down. This regime is explained by two effects: full break up of the pairing and specific evolution of a {\it single} dominant particle-hole (1ph) configuration with $\beta$. The analysis of experimental data for the ground-state rotational bands in $^{24}$Mg and $^{20}$Ne shows that such regime is possible at low spins.</description>

      <title>Spectra of correlators in the relaxation time approximation of kinetic theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relaxation time approximation (RTA) of the kinetic Boltzmann equation is likely the simplest window into the microscopic properties of collective real-time transport. Within this framework, we analytically compute all retarded two-point Green's functions of the energy-momentum tensor and a conserved $U(1)$ current in thermal states with classical massless particles (a `CFT') at non-zero density, and in the absence and presence of broken translational symmetry. This is done in $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions. RTA allows a full explicit analysis of the analytic structure of different correlators (poles versus branch cuts) and the transport properties that they imply (the thermoelectric conductivities, and the hydrodynamic, quasihydrodynamic and gapped mode dispersion relations). Our inherently weakly coupled analysis thereby also enables a direct comparison with previously known strongly coupled results in holographic CFTs dual to the Einstein-Maxwell-axion theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic attractor is a concept that describes universal equilibration behavior in which systems lose microscopic details before hydrodynamics becomes applicable. We propose a setup to observe hydrodynamic attractors in ultracold atomic gases, taking advantage of the fact that driving the two-body $s$-wave scattering length causes phenomena equivalent to isotropic fluid expansions. We specifically consider two-component fermions with contact interactions in three dimensions and discuss their dynamics under a power-law drive of the scattering length in a uniform system, employing a hydrodynamic relaxation model. We analytically solve their dynamics and find the hydrodynamic attractor solution. Our results establish the cold atom systems as a new platform for exploring hydrodynamic attractors.</description>

      <title>Electric and magnetic dipole strength in $^{58}$Ni from forward-angle inelastic proton scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of the present work is a state-by-state analysis of possible E1 and M1 transitions in $^{58}$Ni with a high-resolution (p,p') experiment at 295 MeV and very forward angles including 0{\deg} and a comparison to results from studies of the dipole strength with the $(\gamma,\gamma')$ and (e,e') reactions. The E1 and M1 cross sections of individual peaks in the spectra are deduced with a multipole decomposition analysis and converted to reduced E1 and spin-M1 transition strengths using the virtual photon and the unit cross-section method, respectively. Despite the high level density good agreement is obtained for the deduced excitation energies of J = 1 states in the three types of experiments indicating that the same states are excited. The B(E1) and B(M1) strengths from the $(\gamma,\gamma^\prime)$ experiments are systematically smaller than in the present work because of the lack of information on branching ratios to lower-lying excited states and the competition of particle emission. Fair agreement with the B(M1) strengths extracted from the (e,e') data is obtained after removal of E1 transitions uniquely assigned in the present work, which belong to a low-energy toroidal mode with unusual properties mimicking M1 excitations in electron scattering. The experimental M1 strength distribution is compared to large-scale shell-model calculations with the effective GXPF1A and KB3G interactions. They provide a good description of the isospin splitting and the running sum of the M1 strength. A quenching factor 0.74 for the spin-isospin part of the M1 operator is needed to attain quantitative agreement with the data.</description>
