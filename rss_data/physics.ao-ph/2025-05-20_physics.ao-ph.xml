      <title>Predicting temperatures in Brazilian states capitals via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change refers to substantial long-term variations in weather patterns. In this work, we employ a Machine Learning (ML) technique, the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, to forecast the monthly average temperature for Brazilian's states capitals (27 cities) and the whole country, from January 1961 until December 2022. To forecast the temperature at $k$-month, we consider as features in RF: $i)$ global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), methane (CH$_4$), and nitrous oxide (N$_2$O) at $k$-month; $ii)$ temperatures from the previous three months, i.e., $(k-1)$, $(k-2)$ and $(k-3)$-month; $iii)$ combination of $i$ and $ii$. By investigating breakpoints in the time series, we discover that 24 cities and the gases present breakpoints in the 80's and 90's. After the breakpoints, we find an increase in the temperature and the gas emission. Thereafter, we separate the cities according to their geographical position and employ the RF algorithm to forecast the temperature from 2010-08 until 2022-12. Based on $i$, $ii$, and $iii$, we find that the three inputs result in a very precise forecast, with a normalized root mean squared error (NMRSE) less than 0.083 for the considered cases. From our simulations, the better forecasted region is Northeast through $iii$ (NMRSE = 0.012). Furthermore, we also investigate the forecasting of anomalous temperature data by removing the annual component of each time series. In this case, the best forecasting is obtained with strategy $i$, with the best region being Northeast (NRMSE = 0.090).</description>

      <title>An outlook on the Rapid Decline of Carbon Sequestration in French Forests and associated reporting needs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present and discuss changes in carbon storage in the French forests from 1990 to 2022, derived from CITEPA statistics on forest carbon accounting, fed by National Forest Inventory (NFI) data collected through an extensive network of measurement sites across Metropolitan France, and other data sources as regards forest removals. The NFI is designed to provide statistical estimations of growing stock, gains and losses at the national or subnational levels but is unable, in its classical form, to provide detailed spatial outlook, such as on abrupt losses during fires, droughts and insect attacks. A continuing removal of CO2 from the atmosphere by the French forests occurred from 1990 to 2022, because harvest and mortality CO2 losses remained smaller than CO2 removals by forest growth and the increase in forest area (70,000 ha per year but insignificant in terms of increased carbon stocks at present). The CO2 removal by forests was 49.3 MtCO2 yr-1 in 1990, increased to reach a peak of 74.1 MtCO2 yr-1 in 2008 and then quickly decreased down to 37.8 Mton CO2 yr-1 in 2022. After 2017, the sink remained low and mortality rates stayed larger than during any of the previous years. This recent period is marked by climate shocks such as summer droughts and heatwaves in 2015, 2018, 2022, 2023. The full impacts of the droughts in 2022 and 2023 are not yet covered with full precision, as some of the sites measured by the national inventory before those droughts are still pending a second visit. The different regions of France show contrasted trajectories. Southern Mediterranean regions where forests have a low harvest rate have experienced a lower increase in mortality and a sustained CO2 uptake.</description>

      <title>Improving Medium Range Severe Weather Prediction through Transformer Post-processing of AI Weather Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11750v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving the skill of medium-range (1-8 day) severe weather prediction is crucial for mitigating societal impacts. This study introduces a novel approach leveraging decoder-only transformer networks to post-process AI-based weather forecasts, specifically from the Pangu-Weather model, for improved severe weather guidance. Unlike traditional post-processing methods that use a dense neural network to predict the probability of severe weather using discrete forecast samples, our method treats forecast lead times as sequential ``tokens'', enabling the transformer to learn complex temporal relationships within the evolving atmospheric state. We compare this approach against post-processing of the Global Forecast System (GFS) using both a traditional dense neural network and our transformer, as well as configurations that exclude convective parameters to fairly evaluate the impact of using the Pangu-Weather AI model. Results demonstrate that the transformer-based post-processing significantly enhances forecast skill compared to dense neural networks. Furthermore, AI-driven forecasts, particularly Pangu-Weather initialized from high resolution analysis, exhibit superior performance to GFS in the medium-range, even without explicit convective parameters. Our approach offers improved accuracy, and reliability, which also provides interpretability through feature attribution analysis, advancing medium-range severe weather prediction capabilities.</description>

      <title>Terrain-aware Deep Learning for Wind Energy Applications: From Kilometer-scale Forecasts to Fine Wind Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution wind information is essential for wind energy planning and power forecasting, particularly in regions with complex terrain. However, most AI-based weather forecasting models operate at kilometer-scale resolution, constrained by the reanalysis datasets they are trained on. Here we introduce FuXi-CFD, an AI-based downscaling framework designed to generate detailed three-dimensional wind fields at 30-meter horizontal resolution, using only coarse-resolution atmospheric inputs. The model is trained on a large-scale dataset generated via computational fluid dynamics (CFD), encompassing a wide range of terrain types, surface roughness, and inflow conditions. Remarkably, FuXi-CFD predicts full 3D wind structures -- including vertical wind and turbulent kinetic energy -- based solely on horizontal wind input at 10 meters above ground, the typical output of AI-based forecast systems. It achieves CFD-comparable accuracy while reducing inference time from hours to seconds. By bridging the resolution gap between regional forecasts and site-specific wind dynamics, FuXi-CFD offers a scalable and operationally efficient solution to support the growing demands of renewable energy deployment.</description>

      <title>WHALES: an optimized retracker for satellite radar altimeter waveforms in sea state applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The latest version of the European Space Agency's Sea State Climate Change Initiative database adopts a dedicated algorithm (retracker) to reprocess two decades of satellite altimetry measurements and provide long time series of significant wave height in the global ocean. This paper describes the main characteristics of this algorithm, called WHALES, and analyzes the impact of algorithm choices on measurement physics, particularly the weighted analysis of residuals in the cost function. Moreover, the impact of WHALES on the sea state database is analyzed in terms of noise reduction and scatter index with in situ data, with a particular focus on the coastal zone, where WHALES primarily improves data quality and quantity compared to previous approaches. We found that valid data records increased by 30% at 5 km from the coast after applying the retracker discussed here.</description>

      <title>Filamentation near monotone zonal vortex caps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Euler equations on a rotating unit sphere, focusing on the dynamics of vortex caps. Leveraging the $L^1$-stability of monotone, longitude-independent profiles, we demonstrate that certain ill-prepared initial data within the vortex cap class exhibit an instability characterized by the growth of the interface perimeter. These configurations are nearly equivalent in area to a zonal vortex cap but are perturbed by a localized latitudinal bump. By comparing the longitudinal flows at points along the zonal interface and within the bump region, we track the induced stretching and capture the underlying instability mechanism.</description>

      <title>CloudCast -- Total Cloud Cover Nowcasting with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cloud cover plays a critical role in weather prediction and impacts several sectors, including agriculture, solar power generation, and aviation. Despite advancements in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, forecasting total cloud cover remains challenging due to the small-scale nature of cloud formation processes. In this study, we introduce CloudCast, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the U-Net architecture, designed to predict total cloud cover (TCC) up to five hours ahead. Trained on five years of satellite data, CloudCast significantly outperforms traditional NWP models and optical flow methods. Compared to a reference NWP model, CloudCast achieves a 24% lower mean absolute error and reduces multi-category prediction errors by 46%. The model demonstrates strong performance, particularly in capturing the large-scale structure of cloud cover in the first few forecast hours, though later predictions are subject to blurring and underestimation of cloud formation. An ablation study identified the optimal input features and loss functions, with MAE-based models performing the best. CloudCast has been integrated into the Finnish Meteorological Institute's operational nowcasting system, where it improves cloud cover forecasts used by public and private sector clients. While CloudCast is limited by a relatively short skillful lead time of about three hours, future work aims to extend this through more complex network architectures and higher-resolution data. CloudCast code is available at https://github.com/fmidev/cloudcast.</description>

      <title>Tunamis on a deep open sea and on a sloping beach -- a mathematical theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17269v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approaching a sloping beach, shallow water surface waves of Airy get suddenly $ +\infty$ or $ -\infty$ propagation speed at the point of surface $x = x_0$, say, where the tangent $\varGamma_x$ of the surface $y = \varGamma$ "coincide" with that $b_x$ of the water-bottom $y = b(x)$, losing the cruising sound speed of propagation so high on a deep open sea. That is, the tunamis gain instantaneously a $ +\infty$ propagation speed just before the crest as $(\varGamma_x - b_x)(x) \to +0$, $x \to x_0\!-\!0$ , and a $ -\infty$ propagation speed just after the trough as $(\varGamma_x - b_x)(x) \to -0$, $x \to x_0\!-\!0$. We would have thus a big crush between the crest rushing forward and the trough rushing backward. This is a mathematical structure of tunamis "on" a sloping beach, in particular.</description>

      <title>TCP-Diffusion: A Multi-modal Diffusion Model for Global Tropical Cyclone Precipitation Forecasting with Change Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precipitation from tropical cyclones (TCs) can cause disasters such as flooding, mudslides, and landslides. Predicting such precipitation in advance is crucial, giving people time to prepare and defend against these precipitation-induced disasters. Developing deep learning (DL) rainfall prediction methods offers a new way to predict potential disasters. However, one problem is that most existing methods suffer from cumulative errors and lack physical consistency. Second, these methods overlook the importance of meteorological factors in TC rainfall and their integration with the numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. Therefore, we propose Tropical Cyclone Precipitation Diffusion (TCP-Diffusion), a multi-modal model for global tropical cyclone precipitation forecasting. It forecasts TC rainfall around the TC center for the next 12 hours at 3 hourly resolution based on past rainfall observations and multi-modal environmental variables. Adjacent residual prediction (ARP) changes the training target from the absolute rainfall value to the rainfall trend and gives our model the ability of rainfall change awareness, reducing cumulative errors and ensuring physical consistency. Considering the influence of TC-related meteorological factors and the useful information from NWP model forecasts, we propose a multi-model framework with specialized encoders to extract richer information from environmental variables and results provided by NWP models. The results of extensive experiments show that our method outperforms other DL methods and the NWP method from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF).</description>
