      <title>A Faster Quantum Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an asymptotically improved algorithm for implementing the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) in both the exact and approximate settings. Historically, the approximate QFT has been implemented in $\Theta(n \log n)$ gates, and the exact in $\Theta(n^2)$ gates. In this work, we show that these costs can be reduced by leveraging a novel formulation of the QFT that recurses on two partitions of the qubits. Specifically, our approach yields an $\Theta(n(\log \log n)^2)$ algorithm for the approximate QFT using $\Theta(\log n)$ ancillas, and an $\Theta(n(\log n)^2)$ algorithm for the exact QFT requiring $\Theta(n)$ ancillas.</description>

      <title>Long-distance genuine multipartite Entanglement between Magnetic Defects in Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence and properties of long-distance genuine multipartite entanglement, induced via three localized magnetic defects, in a one-dimensional transverse-field XX spin-$1/2$ chain. Using both analytical and numerical techniques, we determine the conditions for the existence of bound states localized at the defects. We find that the reduced density matrix (RDM) of the defects exhibits long-distance genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) across the whole range of the Hamiltonian parameter space, including regions where the two-qubit concurrence is zero. We quantify the entanglement by using numerical lower bounds for the GME concurrence, as well as by analytically deriving the GME concurrence in regions where the RDM is of rank two. Our work provides insights into generating multipartite entanglement in many-body quantum systems via local control techniques.</description>

      <title>Tight relations and equivalences between smooth relative entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise one-shot characterisation of operational tasks in classical and quantum information theory relies on different forms of smooth entropic quantities. A particularly important connection is between the hypothesis testing relative entropy and the smoothed max-relative entropy, which together govern many operational settings. We first strengthen this connection into a type of equivalence: we show that the hypothesis testing relative entropy is equivalent to a variant of the smooth max-relative entropy based on the information spectrum divergence, which can be alternatively understood as a measured smooth max-relative entropy. Furthermore, we improve a fundamental lemma due to Datta and Renner that connects the different variants of the smoothed max-relative entropy, introducing a modified proof technique based on matrix geometric means and a tightened gentle measurement lemma. We use the unveiled connections and tools to strictly improve on previously known one-shot bounds and duality relations between the smooth max-relative entropy and the hypothesis testing relative entropy, sharpening also bounds that connect the max-relative entropy with R\'enyi divergences.</description>

      <title>Efficient Compilation for Shuttling Trapped-Ion Machines via the Position Graph Architectural Abstraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growth of quantum platforms for gate-based quantum computation, compilation holds a crucial factor in deciding the success of the implementation. There has been rich research and development in compilation techniques for the superconducting-qubit regime. In contrast, the trapped-ion architectures, currently leading in robust quantum computations due to their reliable operations, do not have many competitive compilation strategies. This work presents a novel unifying abstraction, called the position graph, for different types of hardware architectures. Using this abstraction, we model trapped-ion Quantum Charge-Coupled Device (QCCD) architectures and enable high-quality, scalable superconducting compilation methods. In particular, we devise a scheduling algorithm called SHuttling-Aware PERmutative heuristic search algorithm (SHAPER) to tackle the complex constraints and dynamics of trapped-ion QCCD with the cooperation of state-of-the-art permutation-aware mapping. This approach generates native, executable circuits and ion instructions on the hardware that adheres to the physical constraints of shuttling-based quantum computers. Using the position graph abstraction, we evaluate our algorithm on theorized and actual architectures. Our algorithm can successfully compile programs for these architectures where other state-of-the-art algorithms fail. In the cases when other algorithms complete, our algorithm produces a schedule that is $14\%$ faster on average, up to $69\%$ in the best case.\\ {\bf Reproducibility:} source code and computational results are available at $[$will be added upon acceptance$]$</description>

      <title>Enriched Categories for Parameterized Circuit Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that combinatorial circuits are modeled mathematically by string diagrams in a monoidal category. Given a gate set $\Sigma$, the circuits over $\Sigma$ can be thought of as string diagrams in the free monoidal category generated by $\Sigma$. In this model, circuit semantics are then given by monoidal functors out of this free category. For quantum circuits, this functor is often valued in the category of unitary matrices. This model suffices for concrete quantum circuits, but fails to describe parameterized families of quantum circuits, such as those which arise in the analysis of ansatz circuits. Intuitively, this functor should be valued in parameterized families of unitary matices, though it is not immediately clear what this mean through a categorical lens. In this paper, we show that the parameterized semantics studied in prior work can be understood through enrichment and internal constructions. We determine sufficient conditions under which this construction yields a symmetric monoidal category, and suggest how these semantics could be extended to classical circuit analysis and parameterized equivalence checking.</description>

      <title>QuSplit: Achieving Both High Fidelity and Throughput via Job Splitting on Noisy Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As we enter the quantum utility era, the computing paradigm shifts toward quantum-centric computing, where multiple quantum processors collaborate with classical computers, exemplified by platforms like IBM Quantum and Amazon Braket. In this paradigm, efficient resource management is crucial; however, unlike classical computing, quantum processors face significant challenges due to noise, which raises fidelity concerns in quantum applications. Compounding this issue, the noise characteristics across different quantum processors are inherently heterogeneous, making resource optimization even more complex. Existing resource management strategies primarily focus on mapping and scheduling jobs to these heterogeneous backends, which leads to some jobs suffering extremely low fidelity. Targeting quantum optimization jobs (e.g., VQC, VQE, QAOA) - one of the most promising quantum applications in the NISQ era, we hypothesize that running the later stages of a job on a high-fidelity quantum processor can significantly enhance overall fidelity. To validate this hypothesis, we use the VQE as a case study and propose a novel and efficient Genetic Algorithm-based scheduling framework with the consideration of job splitting. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach maintains high fidelity across all jobs and significantly improves system throughput. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm shows excellent scalability with respect to the number of quantum processors and the volume of jobs, making it a robust solution for emerging quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Waveguide arrays interaction to second neighbors: Exact solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an analytical framework for describing the propagation of light in waveguide arrays, considering both infinite and semi-infinite cases. The interaction up to second neighbors is taken into account, which makes for a more realistic setup. We show that these solutions follow a distinctive structural pattern. This pattern reflects a transition from conventional Bessel functions to the lesser-known one-parameter generalized Bessel functions, offering new insights into the propagation dynamics in these systems.</description>

      <title>Energy Landscape Shaping for Robust Control of Atoms in Optical Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust quantum control is crucial for realizing practical quantum technologies. Energy landscape shaping offers an alternative to conventional dynamic control, providing theoretically enhanced robustness and simplifying implementation for certain applications. This work demonstrates the feasibility of robust energy landscape control in a practical implementation with ultracold atoms. We leverage a digital mirror device (DMD) to shape optical potentials, creating complex energy landscapes. To achieve a desired objective, such as efficient quantum state transfer, we formulate a novel hybrid optimization approach that effectively handles both continuous (laser power) and discrete (DMD pixel activation) control parameters. This approach combines constrained quasi-Newton methods with surrogate models for efficient exploration of the vast parameter space. Furthermore, we introduce a framework for analyzing the robustness of the resulting control schemes against experimental uncertainties. By modeling uncertainties as structured perturbations, we systematically assess controller performance and identify robust solutions. We apply these techniques to maximize spin transfer in a chain of trapped atoms, achieving high-fidelity control while maintaining robustness. Our findings provide insights into the experimental viability of controlled spin transfer in cold atom systems. More broadly, the presented optimization and robustness analysis methods apply to a wide range of quantum control problems, offering a toolkit for designing and evaluating robust controllers in complex experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum algorithms for characters of the symmetric group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characters of irreducible representations are ubiquitous in group theory. However, computing characters of some groups such as the symmetric group $S_n$ is a challenging problem known to be $\#P$-hard in the worst case. Here we describe a Matrix Product State (MPS) algorithm for characters of $S_n$. The algorithm computes an MPS encoding all irreducible characters of a given permutation. It relies on a mapping from characters of $S_n$ to quantum spin chains proposed by Crichigno and Prakash. We also provide a simpler derivation of this mapping. We complement this result by presenting a $poly(n)$ size quantum circuit that prepares the corresponding MPS, obtaining an efficient quantum algorithm for certain sampling problems based on characters of $S_n$. To assess classical hardness of these problems we present a general reduction from strong simulation (computing a given probability) to weak simulation (sampling with a small error). This reduction applies to any sampling problem with a certain granularity structure and may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics in collision models and entanglement quilts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the entanglement dynamics of a family of quantum collision models by analytically solving the pairwise concurrence for all qubit pairs. We introduce a diagrammatic method that offers an intuitive, frame-by-frame understanding of these dynamics. This allows us to monitor how a single collision affects the entanglement of the whole many-body system in some special cases. We focus on a class of models where the square of concurrence is a conserved quantity in the qubit collisions, aiding us to formulate general rules of entanglement propagation. In particular, among the multiple examples we will be showing, we identify a type of genuine multipartite entanglement, which we refer to as \textit{entanglement quilt}, where every qubit is entangled with every other qubit. We find that in some models, an entanglement quilt is hypersensitive to local excitation fluctuations: The presence of even a single excited qubit can destroy the entanglement quilts. We offer a detailed mathematical treatment on the phenomena, which can help us understand the disappearance of long-range entanglement in condensed matter systems above zero temperature. We also speculate about a possible property of the entanglement quilt: Every subsystem of it is entangled with every other subsystem.</description>

      <title>Linear-optical four-dimensional Bell state measurement with two-photon interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the distinguishability of a set of mutually orthogonal four-dimensional Bell states of photon system in path degree of freedom using only linear optics, resorting to the two-photon interference. With quantum interference effect, we find that the 16 four-dimensional Bell states can be classified into 7 groups, which can support the transmission of $log_2 7 = 2.81$ bits classical information with just sending one photon in the quantum superdense coding protocol. When an auxiliary two-dimensional polarization entanglement is introduced, the 16 four-dimensional Bell states then can be classified into 12 groups, which can promote the channel capacity to $log_2 12 = 3.58$ bits with encoding one photon. Our results are significant for photonic superdense coding, and can be useful for other quantum information technologies involved linear-optical high-dimensional Bell state measurement.</description>

      <title>Practical quantum federated learning and its experimental demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning is essential for decentralized, privacy-preserving model training in the data-driven era. Quantum-enhanced federated learning leverages quantum resources to address privacy and scalability challenges, offering security and efficiency advantages beyond classical methods. However, practical and scalable frameworks addressing privacy concerns in the quantum computing era remain undeveloped. Here, we propose a practical quantum federated learning framework on quantum networks, utilizing distributed quantum secret keys to protect local model updates and enable secure aggregation with information-theoretic security. We experimentally validate our framework on a 4-client quantum network with a scalable structure. Extensive numerical experiments on both quantum and classical datasets show that adding a quantum client significantly enhances the trained global model's ability to classify multipartite entangled and non-stabilizer quantum datasets. Simulations further demonstrate scalability to 200 clients with classical models trained on the MNIST dataset, reducing communication costs by $75\%$ through advanced model compression techniques and achieving rapid training convergence. Our work provides critical insights for building scalable, efficient, and quantum-secure machine learning systems for the coming quantum internet era.</description>

      <title>Cavity Mode Initialization via a Rabi Driven Qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microwave cavity modes with long coherence times are used in many different quantum computing systems. During normal operation of such systems, these modes, called memory modes, often need to be set to different coherent photonic occupations. In this work we present a novel technique we call Rabi Driven Reset in which the state of a memory mode is transferred into a decaying mode. This is done through a Rabi driven qubit which is coupled to both modes via sideband driving tones. The outcome of the method is the initialization of the memory mode at any required coherent state. Simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique, along with a comparison to an existing coupling method. Our simulations predict an improvement of an order of magnitude in initialization times compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Data re-uploading in Quantum Machine Learning for time series: application to traffic forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting plays a crucial role in modern Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), as it enables real-time traffic flow management, reduces congestion, and improves the overall efficiency of urban transportation networks. With the rise of Quantum Machine Learning (QML), it has emerged a new paradigm possessing the potential to enhance predictive capabilities beyond what classical machine learning models can achieve. In the present work we pursue a heuristic approach to explore the potential of QML, and focus on a specific transport issue. In particular, as a case study we investigate a traffic forecast task for a major urban area in Athens (Greece), for which we possess high-resolution data. In this endeavor we explore the application of Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), and, notably, we present the first application of quantum data re-uploading in the context of transport forecasting. This technique allows quantum models to better capture complex patterns, such as traffic dynamics, by repeatedly encoding classical data into a quantum state. Aside from providing a prediction model, we spend considerable effort in comparing the performance of our hybrid quantum-classical neural networks with classical deep learning approaches. Our results show that hybrid models achieve competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art classical methods, especially when the number of qubits and re-uploading blocks is increased. While the classical models demonstrate lower computational demands, we provide evidence that increasing the complexity of the quantum model improves predictive accuracy. These findings indicate that QML techniques, and specifically the data re-uploading approach, hold promise for advancing traffic forecasting models and could be instrumental in addressing challenges inherent in ITS environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tremendous progress in experimental quantum optics during the past decades enabled the advent of quantum technologies, one of which is quantum communication. Aimed at novel methods for more secure or efficient information transfer, quantum communication has developed into an active field of research and proceeds toward full-scale implementations and industrialization. Continuous-variable methods of multi-photon quantum state preparation, manipulation, and coherent detection, as well as the respective theoretical tools of phase-space quantum optics, offer the possibility to make quantum communication efficient, applicable and accessible, thus boosting the development of the field. We review the methodology, techniques and protocols of continuous-variable quantum communication, from the first theoretical ideas, through milestone implementations, to the recent developments, covering quantum key distribution as well as other quantum communication schemes, suggested on the basis of continuous-variable states and measurements.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal and nonconservative forces on binary systems of identical atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical and radiative features of an excited system of two identical atoms are analysed. The metastability of the system, the directionality of its emission and its internal forces are studied. Closed-form expressions are derived for the time-evolution of the system, for the angular distribution of its spontaneous emission, and for its internal dipole forces, both conservative and nonconservative. The latter reveals the presence of nonreciprocal forces, which leads to a net oscillatory force upon the system. We estimate that, for a free binary system of Li Rydberg atoms, the net internal force may cause a displacement of its center of mass as large as $120 nm$ over a lifetime.</description>

      <title>Impossibility of Quantum Private Queries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetric private information retrieval is a cryptographic task allowing a user to query a database and obtain exactly one entry without revealing to the owner of the database which element was accessed. The task is a variant of general two-party protocols called one-sided secure function evaluation and is closely related to oblivious transfer. Under the name quantum private queries, quantum protocols have been proposed to solve this problem in a cheat-sensitive way: In such protocols, it is not impossible for dishonest participants to cheat, but they risk detection [V. Giovannetti, S. Lloyd, and L. Maccone, Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 230502 (2008)]. We give an explicit attack against any cheat-sensitive symmetric private information retrieval protocol, showing that any protocol that is secure for the user cannot have non-trivial security guarantees for the owner of the database.</description>

      <title>Temporal nonlocality from indefinite causal orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A temporal counterpart to Bell nonlocality would intuitively refer to the presence of non-classical correlations between timelike-separated events. The hypothesis of temporal nonlocality has received recent support in the literature, and its existence would likely influence the future development of physical theories. This paper shows how Adlam's principle of temporal locality can be violated within a protocol involving indefinite causal orders. While the derivations of Leggett-Garg inequalities or the temporal CHSH inequality are said to involve problematic assumptions preventing a targeted probing of a well-defined notion of temporal nonlocality, the present test is free from such worries. However, it is shown that the test, in its current formulation, fails to be fully model-independent. We provide several considerations regarding the physicality of ICOs that could help alleviate this drawback. In the present work, a specific physical interpretation of ICOs in terms of retrocausal influences would explain the presence of temporally nonlocal correlations. It is argued that, as the physical underpinnings of temporal nonlocality might also account for standard Bell nonlocality, focusing on the former as a consequence of ICOs might support under-explored strategies to make sense of the latter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we address a task denoted as deimaginarity, which is to transform a state into a real state with the aid of random covariant-free unitary operations. We consider the minimum cost of randomness required for deimaginarity in the scenario of infinite copies and suiciently small error, and we prove that the deimaginarity cost of a state $\rho$ is equal to its regularized relative entropy of imaginarity, which can be seen as an operational interpretation of the relative entropy of imaginarity.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced L\'evy flights of quantum information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a model of free fermions in one dimension, subject to frustrated (non-commuting) local measurements across adjacent sites, which resolves the fermions into non-orthogonal orbitals, misaligned from the underlying lattice. For maximal misalignment, superdiffusive behavior emerges from the vanishing of the measurement-induced quasiparticle decay rate at one point in the Brillouin zone, which generates fractal-scaling entanglement entropy $S \propto \ell^{1/3}$ for a subsystem of length $\ell$. We derive an effective non-linear sigma model with long-range couplings responsible for L\'evy flights in entanglement propagation, which we confirm with large-scale numerical simulations. When the misalignment is reduced, the entanglement exhibits, with increasing $\ell$, consecutive regimes of superdiffusive, $S\propto \ell^{1/3}$, diffusive, $S\propto \ln \ell$, and localized, $S = \rm{const}$, behavior. Our findings show how intricate fractal-scaling entanglement can be produced for local Hamiltonians and measurements.</description>

      <title>Unraveling quantum phase estimation: exploring the impact of multi-photon interference on the quantum Fisher information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum interference is known to become extinct with distinguishing information, as illustrated by the ubiquitous double-slit experiment or the two-photon HOM effect. In the former case single particle interference is destroyed with which-path information while in the latter bunching interference tails-off as photons become distinguishable. It has been observed that when more than two particles are involved, these interference patterns are in general a non monotonic function of the distinguishability. Here we perform a comprehensive characterization, both theoretically and experimentally, of four-photon interference by analyzing the corresponding correlation functions, contemplating several degrees of distinguishability across different parameters. This study provides all the necessary tools to quantify the impact of multi-photon interference on precision measurements of parameters such as phase, frequency, and time difference. We apply these insights to quantify the precision in the estimation of an interferometric phase in a two-port interferometer using a four-photon state. Our results reveal that, for certain phase values, partially distinguishable multi-photon states can achieve higher Fisher information values compared to the two-photon experiment. These findings highlight the potential of distinguishable multi-photon states for enhanced precision in quantum metrology and related applications.</description>

      <title>Neural network enhanced cross entropy benchmark for monitored circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the interplay of quantum computing and machine learning to advance experimental protocols for observing measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT) in quantum devices. In particular, we focus on trapped ion monitored circuits and apply the cross entropy benchmark recently introduced by [Li et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 220404 (2023)], which can mitigate the post-selection problem. By doing so, we reduce the number of projective measurements -- the sample complexity -- required per random circuit realization, which is a critical limiting resource in real devices. Since these projective measurement outcomes form a classical probability distribution, they are suitable for learning with a standard machine learning generative model. In this paper, we use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to learn a representation of the measurement record for a native trapped-ion MIPT, and show that using this generative model can substantially reduce the number of measurements required to accurately estimate the cross entropy. This illustrates the potential of combining quantum computing and machine learning to overcome practical challenges in realizing quantum experiments.</description>

      <title>Probing the Quantum Nature of Gravity through Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quest to determine whether gravity is quantum has challenged physicists since the mid 20th century, due to the impracticability of accessing the Planck scale, where potential quantum gravity effects are expected to become relevant. While recent entanglement-based tests have provided a more promising theoretical path forward, the difficulty of preparing and controlling large quantum states has hindered practical progress. We present an alternative strategy that shifts the focus from complex quantum state manipulation to the simpler observation of a probe's motion. By proving that a classical and local gravitational field must inherently display randomness to interact consistently with quantum matter, we show that this randomness induces measurable diffusion in a probe's motion, even when the probe is in a classical state. This diffusion serves as a distinctive signature of classical gravity coupling to quantum matter. Our approach leverages existing experimental techniques, requiring only the accurate tracking of a probe's classical center of mass motion, and does not need any quantum state preparation, thereby positioning this method as a promising and practical avenue for advancing the investigation into the quantum nature of gravity.</description>

      <title>Efficient simulation of parametrized quantum circuits under non-unital noise through Pauli backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum devices continue to grow in size but remain affected by noise, it is crucial to determine when and how they can outperform classical computers on practical tasks. A central piece in this effort is to develop the most efficient classical simulation algorithms possible. Among the most promising approaches are Pauli backpropagation algorithms, which have already demonstrated their ability to efficiently simulate certain classes of parameterized quantum circuits-a leading contender for near-term quantum advantage-under random circuit assumptions and depolarizing noise. However, their efficiency was not previously established for more realistic non-unital noise models, such as amplitude damping, that better capture noise on existing hardware. Here, we close this gap by adapting Pauli backpropagation to non-unital noise, proving that it remains efficient even under these more challenging conditions. Our proof leverages a refined combinatorial analysis to handle the complexities introduced by non-unital channels, thus strengthening Pauli backpropagation as a powerful tool for simulating near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Irreducible matrix representations for the walled Brauer algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the representation theory of the algebra of partially transposed permutation operators, $\mathcal{A}^d_{p,p}$, which provides a matrix representation for the abstract walled Brauer algebra. This algebra has recently gained significant attention due to its relevance in quantum information theory, particularly in the efficient quantum circuit implementation of the mixed Schur-Weyl transform. In contrast to previous Gelfand-Tsetlin type approaches, our main technical contribution is the explicit construction of irreducible matrix units in the second-highest ideal that are group-adapted to the action of $\mathbb{C}[\mathcal{S}_p]\times \mathbb{C}[\mathcal{S}_p]$ subalgebra, where $\mathcal{S}_p$ is the symmetric group. This approach suggests a recursive method for constructing irreducible matrix units in the remaining ideals of the algebra. The framework is general and applies to systems with arbitrary numbers of components and local dimensions. The obtained results are applied to a special class of operators motivated by the mathematical formalism appearing in all variants of the port-based teleportation protocols through the mixed Schur-Weyl duality. We demonstrate that the given irreducible matrix units are, in fact, eigenoperators for the considered class.</description>

      <title>Creation of Wavepackets for Quantum Chromodynamics on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most ambitious goals of quantum simulation of quantum field theory is the description of scattering in real time, which would allow not only for computation of scattering amplitudes, but also for studying the collision process step by step. The initial state of such simulation is made of typically two wavepackets moving on top of the vacuum, whose preparation is hard. Some proposals are based on a modified adiabatic transformation of free wavepackets into interacting wavepackets, but this is not suitable for quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Other approaches used in one-dimensional lattice gauge theories rely on an adiabatic transformation from the strong coupling limit, or on ansatzes to create the wavepackets from the full, interacting vacuum. Here we extend a previous work to create wavepackets of a general kind of particle from the vacuum in lattice gauge theories in one and three dimensions, including QCD. The conceptual foundation of this approach is the Haag-Ruelle scattering theory, and the only theoretical limitation is given by massless particles. In the context of digital quantum computation, the wavepacket creation from the vacuum is implemented with the technique known as LCU (linear combination of unitaries). The preparation is performed successfully with a certain success probability, which may represent the main obstacle of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sunny is a Julia package designed to serve the needs of the quantum magnetism community. It supports the specification of a very broad class of spin models and a diverse suite of numerical solvers. These include powerful methods for simulating spin dynamics both in and out of equilibrium. Uniquely, it features a broad generalization of classical and semiclassical approaches to SU(N) coherent states, which is useful for studying systems exhibiting strong spin-orbit coupling or local entanglement effects. Sunny also offers a well-developed framework for calculating the dynamical spin structure factor, enabling direct comparison with scattering experiments. Ease of use is a priority, with tools for symmetry-guided modeling and interactive visualization.</description>

      <title>Preparing low-variance states using a distributed quantum algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers are a highly promising tool for efficiently simulating quantum many-body systems. The preparation of their eigenstates is of particular interest and can be addressed, e.g., by quantum phase estimation algorithms. The routine then acts as an effective filtering operation, reducing the energy variance of the initial state. In this work, we present a distributed quantum algorithm inspired by iterative phase estimation to prepare low-variance states. Our method uses a single auxiliary qubit per quantum device, which controls its dynamics, and a postselection strategy for a joint quantum measurement on such auxiliary qubits. In the multi-device case, the result of this measurement heralds the successful runs of the protocol. This allows us to demonstrate that our distributed algorithm reduces the energy variance significantly faster compared to single-device implementations, thereby highlighting the potential of distributed algorithms for near-term and early fault-tolerant devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a long-standing apparent conflict between the existence of diamagnetism and causality as expressed through the Kramers-Kronig relations. In essence, using causality arguments, along with a handful of other seemingly well-justified assumptions, one can show that diamagnetism is impossible. Nature naturally does not mind this, and experiments show diamagnetic responses from magnetic media. We present a resolution to this issue, which also explains the absence of observed dia-electric responses in optical media.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum circuits with arbitrary local noise using Pauli Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a polynomial-time classical algorithm for estimating expectation values of arbitrary observables on typical quantum circuits under any incoherent local noise, including non-unital or dephasing. Although previous research demonstrated that some carefully designed quantum circuits affected by non-unital noise cannot be efficiently simulated, we show that this does not apply to average-case circuits, as these can be efficiently simulated using Pauli-path methods. Specifically, we prove that, with high probability over the circuit gates choice, Pauli propagation algorithms with tailored truncation strategies achieve an inversely polynomially small simulation error. This result holds for arbitrary circuit topologies and for any local noise, under the assumption that the distribution of each circuit layer is invariant under single-qubit random gates. Under the same minimal assumptions, we also prove that most noisy circuits can be truncated to an effective logarithmic depth for the task of {estimating} expectation values of observables, thus generalizing prior results to a significantly broader class of circuit ensembles. We further numerically validate our algorithm with simulations on a $6\times6$ lattice of qubits under the effects of amplitude damping and dephasing noise, as well as real-time dynamics on an $11\times11$ lattice of qubits affected by amplitude damping.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore covert communication of qubits over the general quantum channel. Covert communication conceals the transmissions in the channel noise, ensuring that an adversary is unable to detect their presence. We show achievability of a \emph{square root law} (SRL) for quantum covert communication similar to that for classical: $M(n)\propto\sqrt{n}$ qubits can be transmitted covertly and reliably over $n$ uses of a general quantum channel. We lower bound $M(n)$ with and without the assistance from a full-duplex covert classical channel. In the former case, we quantify the number of classical covert bits sufficient for our protocol.</description>

      <title>Critical Dynamics of Spin Boson Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the low-energy properties of the spin-boson model (SBM), which describes the dynamics of a 1/2 spin associated with a thermostat characterized by a power law spectral density, $f(\omega)\propto |\omega|^s$. The theoretical description is constructed in the Schwinger--Keldysh technique, based on the representation of the 1/2-spin by Majorana fermions. We study the critical dynamics of the system near the quantum phase transition by constructing and analyzing the system of renormalization group equations. Our theoretical approach is more universal, contrary to the one based on quantum classical mapping, since it is applicable for $0&lt;s\leq 1$. We show that in both the ohmic case $s=1$, and subohmic case $0&lt;s&lt;1$, the second order quantum phase transition is observed in the model considered, and the critical magnetization exponent agrees with the exact hyperscaling result, $1/\delta=(1-s)/(1+s)$. Furthermore, we obtain the dependence of the critical value of the spin-boson coupling constant on the temperature of the bosonic thermal bath.</description>

      <title>Entanglement asymmetry dynamics in random quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of entanglement asymmetry in random unitary circuits (RUCs). Focusing on a local $U(1)$ charge, we consider symmetric initial states evolved by both local one-dimensional circuits and geometrically non-local RUCs made of two-qudit gates. We compute the entanglement asymmetry of subsystems of arbitrary size, analyzing the relaxation time scales. We show that the entanglement asymmetry of the whole system approaches its stationary value in a time independent of the system size for both local and non-local circuits. For subsystems, we find qualitative differences depending on their size. When the subsystem is larger than half of the full system, the equilibration time scales are again independent of the system size for both local and non-local circuits and the entanglement asymmetry grows monotonically in time. Conversely, when the subsystems are smaller than half of the full system, we show that the entanglement asymmetry is non-monotonic in time and that it equilibrates in a time proportional to the quantum-information scrambling time, providing a physical intuition. As a consequence, the subsystem-equilibration time depends on the locality of interactions, scaling linearly and logarithmically in the system size, respectively, for local and non-local RUCs. Our work confirms the entanglement asymmetry as a versatile and computable probe of symmetry in many-body physics and yields a phenomenological overview of entanglement-asymmetry evolution in typical non-integrable dynamics.</description>

      <title>Tunable extraordinary optical transmission for integrated photonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The propagation of light through opaque materials, served by periodic arrays of subwavelength holes, has revolutionized imaging and sensor technology with a breakthrough of extraordinary optical transmission (EOT). The enhanced optical transmission assisted by surface plasmon resonances (SPR) has become the most ingenious phenomenon in the field of light-matter interaction. Active tuning of SPR presents a new and simple way to control spectral features of the EOT signal (without the need to change the geometrical structure of the device). This provides a new possibility to integrate an active EOT device with tunable operational frequencies on a single chip of photonic integrated circuits (PIC)- a new scalable instrument in the optoelectronic industry, and quantum technology for improving subwavelength optical imaging and biomedical sensing. In this review, we discuss the fundamentals of EOT, the role of SPR, and how the active quantum plasmonic control of the EOT device makes it a feasible on-chip electro-optic programmable element for integrated photonics.</description>

      <title>Global symmetries of quantum lattice models under non-invertible dualities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-invertible dualities/symmetries have become an important tool in the study of quantum field theories and quantum lattice models in recent years. One of the most studied examples is non-invertible dualities obtained by gauging a discrete group. When the physical system has more global symmetries than the gauged symmetry, it has not been thoroughly investigated how those global symmetries transform under non-invertible duality. In this paper, we study the change of global symmetries under non-invertible duality of gauging a discrete group $G$ in the context of (1+1)-dimensional quantum lattice models. We obtain the global symmetries of the dual model by focusing on different Hilbert space sectors determined by the $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry. We provide general conjectures of global symmetries of the dual model forming an algebraic ring of the double cosets. We present concrete examples of the XXZ models and the duals, providing strong evidence for the conjectures.</description>

      <title>Tuning the topological winding number by rolling up graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoscrolls, radial superlattices formed by rolling up a nanomembrane, exhibit distinct electronic and magneto-transport properties compared to their flat counterparts. In this study, we theoretically demonstrate that the conductance can be precisely enhanced N times by rolling up graphene into an N-turn nanoscroll and applying a longitudinal magnetic field. This tunable positive magnetoconductance stems from the topological winding number which is activated in a carbon nanoscroll with magnetic flux and its maximum value purely increases with the scroll winding number (the number of turns). By integrating material geometry and topology, our work opens the door to artificially creating, customizing, and designing topological materials in rolled-up graphene-like systems.</description>

      <title>An Advanced Hybrid Quantum Tabu Search Approach to Vehicle Routing Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing (QC) is expected to solve incredibly difficult problems, including finding optimal solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. However, to date, QC alone is still far to demonstrate this capability except on small-sized problems. Hybrid approaches where QC and classical computing work together have shown the most potential for solving real-world scale problems. This work aims to show that we can enhance a classical optimization algorithm with QC so that it can overcome this limitation. We present a new hybrid quantum-classical tabu search (HQTS) algorithm to solve the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP). Based on our prior work, HQTS leverages QC for routing within a classical tabu search framework. The quantum component formulates the traveling salesman problem (TSP) for each route as a QUBO, solved using D-Wave's Advantage system. Experiments investigate the impact of quantum routing frequency and starting solution methods. While different starting solution methods, including quantum-based and classical heuristics methods, it shows minimal overall impact. HQTS achieved optimal or near-optimal solutions for several CVRP problems, outperforming other hybrid CVRP algorithms and significantly reducing the optimality gap compared to preliminary research. The experimental results demonstrate that more frequent quantum routing improves solution quality and runtime. The findings highlight the potential of integrating QC within meta-heuristic frameworks for complex optimization in vehicle routing problems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Emitters in Hexagonal Boron Nitride: Principles, Engineering and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state quantum emitters, molecular-sized complexes releasing a single photon at a time, have garnered much attention owing to their use as a key building block in various quantum technologies. Among these, quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have emerged as front runners with superior attributes compared to other competing platforms. These attributes are attainable thanks to the robust, two-dimensional lattice of the material formed by the extremely strong B-N bonds. This review discusses the fundamental properties of quantum emitters in hBN and highlights recent progress in the field. The focus is on the fabrication and engineering of these quantum emitters facilitated by state-of-the-art equipment. Strategies to integrate the quantum emitters with dielectric and plasmonic cavities to enhance their optical properties are summarized. The latest developments in new classes of spin-active defects, their predicted structural configurations, and the proposed suitable quantum applications are examined. Despite the current challenges, quantum emitters in hBN have steadily become a promising platform for applications in quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Bright single-photon source in a silicon chip by nanoscale positioning of a color center in a microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an all-silicon source of near-infrared linearly-polarized single photons, fabricated by nanoscale positioning of a color center in a silicon-on-insulator microcavity. The color center consists of a single W center, created at a well-defined position by Si$^{+}$ ion implantation through a 150 nm-diameter nanohole in a mask. A circular Bragg grating cavity resonant with the W's zero-phonon line at 1217 nm is fabricated at the same location as the nanohole. Under above-gap continuous-wave excitation, a very clean photon antibunching behavior ($g{^2} \leq 0.06$) is observed over the entire power range, which highlights the absence of parasitic emitters. Purcell-enhancement of W's zero-phonon emission provides both a record-high photoluminescence count rate among Si color centers (ca $1.2 \times 10^{6}$ counts/s) and apparent Debye-Waller factor around 99%. We also demonstrate the triggered emission of single photons with 93% purity under weak pulsed laser excitation. At high pulsed laser power, we reveal a detrimental effect of repumping processes, that could be mitigated using selective pumping schemes in the future. These results represent a major step towards on-demand sources of indistinguishable near-infrared single photons within silicon photonics chips.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of latent symmetries on the dynamics of photonic systems and their eigenmodes. Residing solely within the eigenspectral domain, latent symmetries are not visible in real space, yet promise intriguing new ways to engineer the functionality of photonic systems. We study the eigenmodes of a 9-site latent-symmetric photonic network and find that an anti-symmetric input state is fundamentally precluded from populating so-called singlet sites. Furthermore, arbitrary extensions of the system at these sites do not break its latent symmetry. Therefore anti-symmetric excitations cannot leave the initial system, which can be leveraged e.g. for the storage of information. This holds true for both single-photon states, or classical light, as well as both distinguishable and indistinguishable two-photon quantum states. Latent symmetries introduce a powerful new set of tools to the design of systems with desired functionality on any nanophotonic platform, paving the way for applications in photonic information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1812.08656v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The possibility of a quantum system to exhibit properties that are akin to both the classically held notions of being a particle and a wave, is one of the most intriguing aspects of the quantum description of nature. These aspects have been instrumental in understanding paradigmatic natural phenomena as well as to provide nonclassical applications. A conceptual foundation for the wave nature of a quantum state has recently been presented, through the notion of quantum coherence. We introduce here a parallel notion for the particle nature of a quantum state of an arbitrary physical system. We provide elements of a resource theory of particleness, and give a quantification of the same. Finally, we provide evidence for a complementarity between the particleness thus introduced, and the coherence of an arbitrary quantum state.</description>

Abstract: We address the discontinuities of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) that may arise when the parameter of interest takes values that change the rank of the quantum statistical model. We revisit the classical and the quantum Cram\'er-Rao theorems, show that they do not hold in these limiting cases, and discuss how this impacts on the relationship between the QFI and the Bures metric. In order to illustrate the metrological implications of our findings, we present two paradigmatic examples, where we discuss in detail the role of the discontinuities and show that the Cram\'er-Rao may be easily violated.</description>

      <title>Looped Pipelines Enabling Effective 3D Qubit Lattices in a Strictly 2D Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.13123v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many quantum computing platforms are based on a two-dimensional physical layout. Here we explore a concept called looped pipelines which permits one to obtain many of the advantages of a 3D lattice while operating a strictly 2D device. The concept leverages qubit shuttling, a well-established feature in platforms like semiconductor spin qubits and trapped-ion qubits. The looped pipeline architecture has similar hardware requirements to other shuttling approaches, but can process a stack of qubit arrays instead of just one. Even a stack of limited height is enabling for diverse schemes ranging from NISQ-era error mitigation through to fault-tolerant codes. For the former, protocols involving multiple states can be implemented with a space-time resource cost comparable to preparing one noisy copy. For the latter, one can realise a far broader variety of code structures; as an example we consider layered 2D codes within which transversal CNOTs are available. Under reasonable assumptions this approach can reduce the space-time cost of magic state distillation by two orders of magnitude. Numerical modelling using experimentally-motivated noise models verifies that the architecture provides this benefit without significant reduction to the code's threshold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a device-independent two-prover scheme in which a classical verifier can use a simple untrusted quantum measurement device (the client device) to securely delegate a quantum computation to an untrusted quantum server. To do this, we construct a parallel self-testing protocol to perform device-independent remote state preparation of $n$ qubits and compose this with the unconditionally secure universal verifiable blind quantum computation (VBQC) scheme of Fitzsimons and Kashefi [Phys. Rev. A 96, 012303 (2017)]. Our self-test achieves a multitude of desirable properties for the application we consider, giving rise to practical and fully device-independent VBQC. It certifies parallel measurements of all cardinal and intercardinal directions in the $XY$ plane as well as the computational basis, uses few input questions (of size logarithmic in $n$ for the client and a constant number communicated to the server), and requires only single-qubit measurements to be performed by the client device.</description>

      <title>Impact of Chiral-Transitions in Quantum Friction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the role of chiral-transitions in the quantum friction force that acts on a two-level atom that moves with relative velocity v parallel to a planar metallic surface. We find that the friction force has a component that is sensitive to the handedness of the atomic transition dipole moment. In the particular, we show that the friction force can be enhanced by an atomic transition with a dipole moment with a certain handedness, and almost suppressed by the dipole moment with the opposite handedness. Curiously, the handedness of the transition dipole moment that boosts the ground-state friction force is the opposite of what is classically expected from the spin-momentum locking.

      <title>Intrinsic Mixed-state Topological Order</title>

Abstract: Decoherence is a major obstacle to the preparation of topological order in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here, we show that decoherence can also give rise to new types of topological order. Specifically, we construct concrete examples by proliferating fermionic anyons in the toric code via local quantum channels. The resulting mixed states retain long-range entanglement, which manifests in the nonzero topological entanglement negativity, though the topological quantum memory is destroyed by decoherence. By comparison with the gapless spin liquid in pure states, we show that the identified states represent a novel intrinsic mixed-state topological order, which has no counterpart in pure states. Through the lens of quantum anomalies of 1-form symmetries, we then provide general constructions of intrinsic mixed-state topological order and reveal the existence of nonbosonic deconfined anyons as another key feature of these novel phases. The extended meaning and characterization of deconfined excitations and their statistics in mixed states are clarified. Moreover, when these deconfined anyons have nontrivial braiding statistics, we prove that the mixed states cannot be prepared via finite-depth local quantum channels from any bipartite separable states. We further demonstrate our construction using the decohered Kitaev honeycomb model and the decohered double-semion model. In the latter case, a surprising scenario arises where decoherence gives rise to additional types of deconfined anyons.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of Feynman's quantum computer</title>

Abstract: Feynman's circuit-to-Hamiltonian construction enables the mapping of a quantum circuit to a time-independent Hamiltonian. This model introduces a Hilbert space made from an ancillary clock register tracking the progress of the computation. In this paper, we explore the efficiency, or run-time, of a quantum computer that directly implements the clock system. This relates to the model's probability of computation completion which we investigate at an established optimal time for an arbitrary number of gates $k$. The relationship between the run-time of the model and the number of gates is obtained both numerically and analytically to be $O(k^{5/3})$. In principle, this is significantly more efficient than the well investigated Feynman-Kitaev model of adiabatic quantum computation with a run-time of $O(k^4)$. We address the challenge which stems from the small window that exists to capture the optimal stopping time, after which there are rapid oscillations of decreasing probability amplitude. We establish a relationship for the time difference between the first and second maximum which scales as O($k^{1/3}$).</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Electrical Networks and their Application to Exponential Speedups for Graph Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07372v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Apers and Piddock [TQC '23] strengthened the connection between quantum walks and electrical networks via Kirchhoff's Law and Ohm's Law. In this work, we develop a new multidimensional electrical network by defining Alternative Kirchhoff's Law and Alternative Ohm's Law based on the multidimensional quantum walk framework by Jeffery and Zur [STOC '23]. In analogy to the connection between the incidence matrix of a graph and Kirchhoff's Law and Ohm's Law in an electrical network, we rebuild the connection between the alternative incidence matrix and Alternative Kirchhoff's Law and Alternative Ohm's Law. This new framework enables generating an alternative electrical flow over the edges on graphs, which has the potential to be applied to a broader range of graph problems, benefiting both quantum and classical algorithm design.
  We first use this framework to generate quantum alternative electrical flow states and use it to find a marked vertex in one-dimensional random hierarchical graphs as defined by Balasubramanian, Li, and Harrow [arXiv '23]. In this work, they generalised the exponential quantum-classical separation of the welded tree graph by Childs, Cleve, Deotto, Farhi, Gutmann, and Spielman [STOC '03] to random hierarchical graphs. Our result partially recovers their results with an arguably simpler analysis.
  Furthermore, this framework also allows us to demonstrate an exponential quantum speedup for the pathfinding problem in a type of regular graph, which we name the welded tree circuit graph. The exponential quantum advantage is obtained by efficiently generating quantum alternative electrical flow states and then sampling from them to find an s-t path in the welded tree circuit graph. By comparison, Li [arXiv '23] constructed a non-regular graph based on welded trees and used the degree information to achieve a similar speedup.</description>

Abstract: We address the variational preparation of the Thermofield Double as the ground state of a suitably engineered Hamiltonian acting on the doubled Hilbert space. Through the use of the Entanglement Forging ansatz, we propose a solution that involves only circuits of width $N$. We illustrate the method with generic fermionic Hamiltonians. The free fermion case can be solved in closed form, and yields a warm start state for the variational circuits whenever interactions are present. As an important side product, this method returns the complete energy spectrum and eigenbasis of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07738v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Split Cayley hexagons of order two are distinguished finite geometries living in the three-qubit symplectic polar space in two different forms, called classical and skew. Although neither of the two yields observable-based contextual configurations of their own, {\it classically}-embedded copies are found to fully encode contextuality properties of the most prominent three-qubit contextual configurations in the following sense: for each set of unsatisfiable contexts of such a contextual configuration there exists some classically-embedded hexagon sharing with the configuration exactly this set of contexts and nothing else. We demonstrate this fascinating property first on the configuration comprising all 315 contexts of the space and then on doilies, both types of quadrics as well as on complements of skew-embedded hexagons. In connection with the last-mentioned case and elliptic quadrics we also conducted some experimental tests on a Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computer to substantiate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantum Simulation of Non-Markovian Open Quantum Dynamics: A Universal and Compact Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17255v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Markovianity, the intricate dependence of an open quantum system on its temporal evolution history, holds tremendous implications across various scientific disciplines. However, accurately characterizing the complex non-Markovian effects has posed a formidable challenge for numerical simulations. While quantum computing technologies show promise, a universal theory enabling practical quantum algorithm implementation has been elusive. We address this gap by introducing the dissipaton-embedded quantum master equation in second quantization (DQME-SQ). This exact and compact theory offers two key advantages: representability by quantum circuits and universal applicability to any Gaussian environment. We demonstrate these capabilities through digital quantum simulations of non-Markovian dissipative dynamics in both bosonic and fermionic environments. The DQME-SQ framework opens a new horizon for the efficient exploration of complex open quantum systems by leveraging the rapidly advancing quantum computing technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04000v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A widely used method for mitigating errors in noisy quantum computers is Richardson extrapolation, a technique in which the overall effect of noise on the estimation of quantum expectation values is captured by a single parameter that, after being scaled to larger values, is eventually extrapolated to the zero-noise limit. We generalize this approach by introducing \emph{layerwise Richardson extrapolation (LRE)}, an error mitigation protocol in which the noise of different individual layers (or larger chunks of the circuit) is amplified and the associated expectation values are linearly combined to estimate the zero-noise limit. The coefficients of the linear combination are analytically obtained from the theory of multivariate Lagrange interpolation. LRE leverages the flexible configurational space of layerwise unitary folding, allowing for a more nuanced mitigation of errors by treating the noise level of each layer of the quantum circuit as an independent variable. We provide numerical simulations demonstrating scenarios where LRE achieves superior performance compared to traditional (single-variable) Richardson extrapolation.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the Non-equilibrium spin Boson Model: A Benchmark of master equations and their validity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04488v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been tremendous focus on identifying whether effective descriptions of open quantum systems such as master equations, can accurately describe the dynamics of open quantum systems. One particular question is whether they provide the correct steady state in the long time limit. Transient regime is also of interest. Description of evolution by various master equations - some of them being not complete positive - is benchmarked against exact solutions (see e.g. Hartmann and Strunz, Phys. Rev. A 101, 012103). An important property of true evolution is its non-Markovian features, which are not captured by the simplest completely positive master equations.
  In this paper we consider a non-Markovian, yet completely positive evolution (known as refined weak coupling or cumulant equation) for the Spin-Boson model with an Overdamped Drude-Lorentz spectral density and arbitrary coupling. We bench-marked it against numerically exact solution, as well as against other master equations, for different coupling strengths and temperatures. We find the cumulant to be a better description in the weak coupling regime where it is supposed to be valid. For the examples considered it shows superiority at moderate and strong couplings in the low-temperature regime for all examples considered. In the high-temperature regime however its advantage vanishes. This indicates that the cumulant equation is a good candidate for simulations at weak to moderate coupling and low temperature. Our calculations are greatly facilitated due to our concise formulation of the cumulant equation by means of representation of the density matrix in the SU(N) basis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study thermalization in closed non-integrable quantum systems using the Krylov basis. We demonstrate that for thermalization to occur, the matrix representation of typical local operators in the Krylov basis should exhibit a specific tridiagonal form with all other elements in the matrix are exponentially small, reminiscent of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Within this framework, we propose that the nature of thermalization, whether weak or strong, can be examined by the infinite time average of the Krylov complexity. Moreover, we analyze the variance of Lanczos coefficients as another probe for the nature of thermalization. One observes that although the variance of Lanczos coefficients may capture certain features of thermalization, it is not as effective as the infinite time average of complexity.</description>

Abstract: A key objective in nuclear and high-energy physics is to describe nonequilibrium dynamics of matter, e.g., in the early universe and in particle colliders, starting from the Standard Model. Classical-computing methods, via the framework of lattice gauge theory, have experienced limited success in this mission. Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories holds promise for overcoming computational limitations. Because of local constraints (Gauss's laws), lattice gauge theories have an intricate Hilbert-space structure. This structure complicates the definition of thermodynamic properties of systems coupled to reservoirs during equilibrium and nonequilibrium processes. We show how to define thermodynamic quantities such as work and heat using strong-coupling thermodynamics, a framework that has recently burgeoned within the field of quantum thermodynamics. Our definitions suit instantaneous quenches, simple nonequilibrium processes undertaken in quantum simulators. To illustrate our framework, we compute the work and heat exchanged during a quench in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory coupled to matter in 1+1 dimensions. The thermodynamic quantities, as functions of the quench parameter, evidence a phase transition. For general thermal states, we derive a simple relation between a quantum many-body system's entanglement Hamiltonian, measurable with quantum-information-processing tools, and the Hamiltonian of mean force, used to define strong-coupling thermodynamic quantities.</description>

      <title>Designing open quantum systems with known steady states: Davies generators and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a systematic framework for constructing generic models of nonequilibrium quantum dynamics with a target stationary (mixed) state. Our framework identifies (almost) all combinations of Hamiltonian and dissipative dynamics that relax to a steady state of interest, generalizing the Davies' generator for dissipative relaxation at finite temperature to nonequilibrium dynamics targeting arbitrary stationary states. We focus on Gibbs states of stabilizer Hamiltonians, identifying local Lindbladians compatible therewith by constraining the rates of dissipative and unitary processes. Moreover, given terms in the Lindbladian not compatible with the target state, our formalism identifies the operations -- including syndrome measurements and local feedback -- one must apply to correct these errors. Our methods also reveal new models of quantum dynamics: for example, we provide a "measurement-induced phase transition" in which measurable two-point functions exhibit critical (power-law) scaling with distance at a critical ratio of the transverse field and rate of measurement and feedback. Time-reversal symmetry -- defined naturally within our formalism -- can be broken both in effectively classical and intrinsically quantum ways. Our framework provides a systematic starting point for exploring the landscape of dynamical universality classes in open quantum systems, as well as identifying new protocols for quantum error correction.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computation represents a promising frontier in the domain of high-performance computing, blending quantum information theory with practical applications to overcome the limitations of classical computation. This study investigates the challenges of manufacturing high-fidelity and scalable quantum processors. Quantum gate set tomography (QGST) is a critical method for characterizing quantum processors and understanding their operational capabilities and limitations. This paper introduces Ml4Qgst as a novel approach to QGST by integrating machine learning techniques, specifically utilizing a transformer neural network model. Adapting the transformer model for QGST addresses the computational complexity of modeling quantum systems. Advanced training strategies, including data grouping and curriculum learning, are employed to enhance model performance, demonstrating significant congruence with ground-truth values. We benchmark this training pipeline on the constructed learning model, to successfully perform QGST for 2 and 3 gates on single-qubit and two-qubit systems, with over-rotation error and depolarizing noise estimation with comparable accuracy to pyGSTi. This research marks a pioneering step in applying deep neural networks to the complex problem of quantum gate set tomography, showcasing the potential of machine learning to tackle nonlinear tomography challenges in quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: A classical particle in a confining potential gives rise to a Hamiltonian conservative dynamical system with an uncountably infinite continuous energy spectra, whereas the corresponding quantum particle exhibits countably infinite discrete energy levels. We consider a class of nonlinear self-sustained oscillators describing a classical active particle in a harmonic potential. These nonlinear oscillators emerge in the low-memory regime of both state-dependent time-delay systems as well as in non-Markovian stroboscopic models of walking droplets. Using averaging techniques, we prove the existence of a countably infinite number of asymptotically stable quantized orbits, i.e. megastability, for this class of self-excited systems. The set of periodic orbits consists of a sequence of nested limit-cycle attractors with quasilinear increasing amplitude and alternating stability, yielding smooth basins of attraction. By using the Lyapunov energy function, we estimate the energy spectra of this megastable set of orbits, and perform numerical simulations to confirm the mathematical analysis. Our formalism can be extended to self-excited particles in general confining potentials, resulting in different energy-frequency relations for these dynamical analogs of quantization.</description>

Abstract: Generalised contextuality is the notion of nonclassicality powering up a myriad of quantum tasks, among which is the celebrated case of a two-party information processing task where classical information is compressed in a quantum channel, the parity-oblivious multiplexing (POM) task. The success rate is the standard quantifier of resourcefulness for this task, while robustness-based quantifiers are as operationally motivated and have known general properties. In this work, we leverage analytical and numerical tools to estimate robustness of contextuality in POM scenarios under different types of noise. We conclude that for the 3-to-1 case robustness of contextuality to depolarisation, as well as a minimisation of robustness of contextuality to dephasing over all bases, are good quantifiers for the nonclassical advantage of this scenario. Moreover, we obtain a general relation between robustness of contextuality to depolarisation and the success rate in any $n$-to-1 POM scenario and show how it can be used to bound the number of bits encoded in this task.</description>

      <title>Quantum encryption design overcomes Shannon's theorem to achieve perfect secrecy with reusable keys</title>

Abstract: Shannon's perfect-secrecy theorem states that a perfect encryption system that yields zero information to the adversary must be a one-time pad (OTP) with the keys randomly generated and never reused. In this work we design the first encryption method (classical or quantum) that overcomes Shannon's theorem to achieve perfect secrecy with reusable keys. Because the mechanisms used are fundamentally quantum, Shannon's theorem remains true in the classical regime. Consequently, the quantum encryption design demonstrates decisive quantum advantage by achieving a goal impossible for classical systems. Finally, the design has major practical advantages by not requiring authentication and having silent tampering detection.</description>

      <title>Unconventional and robust light-matter interactions based on the non-Hermitian skin effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09826v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattice models featuring the non-Hermitian skin effect have attracted rapidly growing interest due to their nontrivial spectral topology and the exotic field dynamics they enable. Such non-Hermitian lattices provide a promising paradigm for engineering exotic light-matter interactions which benefit from the intrinsic chirality and unconventional (non-Bloch) band theory. Here we study a series of unconventional light-matter interactions between quantum emitters and the prototypical Hatano--Nelson model, and briefly discuss the case with an extended lattice model dubbed the bosonic Kitaev chain. We focus on the robustness of the dynamics against various imperfections and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. We consider both small emitters, which interact with the lattice at single sites, and giant emitters coupling at multiple sites. The latter exhibit an exclusive amplification mechanism, which we find enables decoherence-free dynamics even in the presence of extra dissipation in the system. The protection from dissipation arises from the cooperation of the non-Hermiticity and the self-interference effect, and is therefore lacking for small emitters. These results not only provide deeper insights into the interplay of non-Hermiticity and various interference effects, but also have potential applications in engineering exotic spin Hamiltonians and quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Hilbert space fragmentation at the origin of disorder-free localization in the lattice Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories, discretized cousins of continuum gauge theories arising in the Standard Model, have become important platforms for exploring non-equilibrium quantum phenomena. Recent works have reported the possibility of disorder-free localization in the lattice Schwinger model. Using degenerate perturbation theory and numerical simulations based on exact diagonalization and matrix product states, we perform a detailed characterization of thermalization breakdown in the Schwinger model, including its spectral properties, structure of eigenstates, and out-of-equilibrium quench dynamics. We scrutinize the strong-coupling limit of the model, in which an intriguing double-logarithmic-in-time growth of entanglement was previously proposed from the initial vacuum state. We identify the origin of this ultraslow growth of entanglement as due to approximate Hilbert space fragmentation and the emergence of a dynamical constraint on particle hopping, which gives rise to sharp jumps in the entanglement entropy dynamics within individual background charge sectors. Based on the statistics of jump times, we argue that entanglement growth, averaged over charge sectors, is more naturally explained as either single-logarithmic or a weak power law in time. Our results suggest the existence of a single ergodicity-breaking regime due to Hilbert space fragmentation, whose properties are reminiscent of conventional many-body localization within numerically accessible system sizes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we develop an open quantum system view of the parametric approximation, which allows us to obtain systematic perturbative corrections to it. We consider the Jaynes-Cummings model with dissipation, assuming that the field is in the regime close to the parametric approximation with depletion. We obtain non-unitary corrections to the parametric approximation and additional dynamical Lamb-shift contributions to it. For high detuning, these non-unitary corrections appear to be non-Markovian before depletion. And we show that even after depletion, initial non-Markovian behaviour contributes to the dynamics via laser-induced polishing of the density matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the propagation of experimentally relevant two-particle correlations for one-dimensional interacting bosons, and give evidence that many-body chaos induces the emergence of an effective diffusive regime for the fully coherent correlation dynamics, characterized by an interaction dependent diffusion coefficient, which we estimate. This result supports very recent experimental observations, and paves the way towards an efficient description of the dynamical behaviour of non-integrable complex many-body systems. Furthermore, we show that the dynamical features within experimentally accessible time scales of a conveniently defined two-particle correlation transport distance provide a direct and unambiguous characterization of many-body quantum chaos in perfect agreement with its spectral identification.</description>

      <title>Quadruply Bonded Mo$_2$ Molecules: An Emitter-Resonator Integrated Quantum System in Free Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent decades, significant progress has been made in construction and study of individual quantum systems consisting of the basic single matter and energy particles, i.e., atoms and photons, which show great potentials in quantum computation and communication. Here, we demonstrate that the quadruply-bonded Mo$_2$ unit of the complex can trap photons of visible light under ambient conditions, producing intense local electromagnetic (EM) field that features squeezed states, photon antibunching, and vacuum Rabi splitting. Our results show that both the electronic and vibrational states of the Mo$_2$ molecule are modified by coherent coupling with the scattered photons of the Mo$_2$ unit, as evidenced by the Rabi doublet4 and the Mollow triplet in the incoherent resonance fluorescence and the Raman spectra. The Mo$_2$ molecule, acting as an independent emitter-resonator integrated quantum system, allows optical experiments to be conducted in free space, enabling fundamental quantum phenomena to be observed through conventional spectroscopic instrumentation. This provides a new platform for study of field effects and quantum electrodynamics (QED) in the optical domain. The insights gained from this study advance our understanding in metal-metal bond chemistry, molecular physics and quantum optics, with applications in quantum information processing, optoelectronic devices and control of chemical reactivity.</description>

      <title>A Coherence-Protection Scheme for Quantum Sensors Based on Ultra-Shallow Single Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in the engineering of diamond surfaces make it possible to stabilize the charge state of 7-30 nanometers deep nitrogen-vacancy (NV) quantum sensors in diamond and to remove the charge noise at the surface principally. However, it is still a challenge to simultaneously increase the action volume of the quantum sensor by placing NV centers 0.5-2 nanometers deep and to maintain their favorable spin coherence properties which are limited by the magnetic noise from the fluctuating nuclear spins of the surface termination of diamond. Here we show by means of first principles simulations that leveraging the interplay of the surface-induced strain and small constant magnetic fields, the spin coherence times of the ultra-shallow 1-nanometer deep NV center can be significantly enhanced near the spin-phonon limited regime at room temperature in $^{12}$C enriched diamonds. We demonstrate that our protocol is beneficial to $\sim$10-nanometers deep NV centers in natural diamond too where the variable coherence properties of the center to the direction of the small constant magnetic fields establish vector magnetometry at the nanoscale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin states in semiconductors provide exceptionally stable and noise-resistant environments for qubits, positioning them as optimal candidates for reliable quantum computing technologies. The proposal to use nuclear and electronic spins of donor atoms in silicon, introduced by Kane in 1998, sparked a new research field focused on the precise positioning of individual impurity atoms for quantum devices, utilising scanning tunnelling microscopy and ion implantation. This roadmap article reviews the advancements in the 25 years since Kane's proposal, the current challenges, and the future directions in atomic-scale semiconductor device fabrication and measurement. It covers the quest to create a silicon-based quantum computer and expands to include diverse material systems and fabrication techniques, highlighting the potential for a broad range of semiconductor quantum technological applications. Key developments include phosphorus in silicon devices such as single-atom transistors, arrayed few-donor devices, one- and two-qubit gates, three-dimensional architectures, and the development of a toolbox for future quantum integrated circuits. The roadmap also explores new impurity species like arsenic and antimony for enhanced scalability and higher-dimensional spin systems, new chemistry for dopant precursors and lithographic resists, and the potential for germanium-based devices. Emerging methods, such as photon-based lithography and electron beam manipulation, are discussed for their disruptive potential. This roadmap charts the path toward scalable quantum computing and advanced semiconductor quantum technologies, emphasising the critical intersections of experiment, technological development, and theory.</description>

      <title>Entanglement transition in a cluster spin chain coupled with free spins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05937v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement of a ladder of spins formed by two sublattices, a ''cluster'' chain and the ''environment'', consisting of independent spins, both coupled by an exchange interaction and evolving under a unitary discrete time dynamics. The automaton is defined by the composition of the two body spin swap gate (between sublattices) and the three body cluster interaction. We observe that, depending on the set of coupling constants, the cluster subsystem evolves towards states corresponding to different entanglement phases. In the weak coupling regime the subsystem remains near the topological cluster state. Increasing the coupling strength leads to random states which transform from almost pure to fully mixed, according to the effective number of the environment active degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Invariant Theory and Magic State Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the performance of a linear self-orthogonal $GF(4)$ code for magic state distillation of Bravyi and Kitaev's $|T\rangle$-state is characterized by its simple weight enumerator. We compute weight enumerators of all such codes with fewer than 20 qubits and find none whose threshold exceeds that of the 5-qubit code. Using constraints on weight enumerators from invariant theory and linear programming, we establish bounds on the exponent characterizing noise suppression of a $|T\rangle$-state distillation protocol. We also obtain new non-negativity constraints on such weight enumerators by demanding consistency of the associated magic state distillation routine. These constraints yield new bounds on the distances of classical Hermitian self-dual and maximal self-orthogonal linear $GF(4)$ codes, notably proving the nonexistence of such codes with parameters $[12m, 6m, 4m+2]_{GF(4)}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precise control of nuclear spin states is crucial for a wide range of quantum technology applications. Here, we propose a fast and robust single qubit gate in $^{87}$Sr, utilizing the concept of optical nuclear electric resonance (ONER). ONER exploits the interaction between the quadrupole moment of a nucleus and the electric field gradient generated by its electronic environment, enabling spin level transitions via amplitude-modulated laser light. We investigate the hyperfine structure of the 5s$^2$ $^1S_{0}\rightarrow{}$ 5s5p $^3P_1$ optical transition in neutral $^{87}$Sr, and identify the magnetic field strengths and laser parameters necessary to drive spin transitions between the $m_I$ = -9/2 and $m_I$ = -5/2 hyperfine levels in the ground state. Our simulations show that ONER could enable faster spin operations compared to the state-of-the-art oscillations in this 'atomic qubit'. Moreover, we show that the threshold for fault-tolerant quantum computing can be surpassed even in the presence of typical noise sources. These results pave the way for significant advances in nuclear spin control, opening new possibilities for quantum memories and other quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the emergence of quantum computing, the subsequent quantum revolution will be that of interconnecting individual quantum computers at global level. In the same way that classical computers only realised their full potential with the emergence of the internet, a fully realised quantum internet is the next stage of evolution for quantum computation. This work examines in detail how the quantum internet would evolve in practice, focusing not only on the technology itself but also on the implications it will have economically and politically. We present both original ideas, as well as an extensive review of relevant and related background material. This work begins with a description of classical networks before introducing the key concepts behind quantum networks, such as quantum internet protocols, quantum cryptography, and cloud quantum computing. The work is divided into technical sections (requiring only a basic knowledge of the notation of quantum mechanics), for those interested in mathematical details, as well as non-technical sections for those seeking a more general understanding. We target this work very broadly at quantum and classical computer scientists, classical computer systems, software and network engineers, physicists, economists, artists, musicians, and those just generally curious about the future of quantum technologies and what they might bring to humanity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.14169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate reflected entropy in certain anisotropic boundary theories dual to nonrelativistic geometries using holography. It is proposed that this quantity is proportional to the minimal area of the entanglement wedge cross section. Using this prescription, we study in detail the effect of anisotropy on reflected entropy and other holographic entanglement measures. In particular, we study the discontinuous phase transition of this quantity for a symmetric configuration consisting of two disjoint strips. We find that in the specific regimes of the parameter space the critical separation is an increasing function of the anisotropy parameter and hence the correlation between the subregions becomes more pronounced. We carefully examine how these results are consistent with the behavior of other correlation measures including the mutual information. Finally, we show that the structure of the universal terms of entanglement entropy is corrected depending on the orientation of the entangling region with respect to the anisotropic direction.</description>

      <title>On Wigdersons' approach to the uncertainty principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the uncertainty principle from the point of view suggested by A. Wigderson and Y. Wigderson. This approach is based on a primary uncertainty principle from which one can derive several inequalities expressing the impossibility of a simultaneous sharp localization in time and frequency. Moreover, it requires no specific properties of the Fourier transform and can therefore be easily applied to all operators satisfying the primary uncertainty principle. A. Wigderson and Y. Wigderson also suggested many generalizations to higher dimensions and stated several conjectures which we address in the present paper. We argue that we have to consider a more general primary uncertainty principle to prove the results suggested by the authors. As a by-product we obtain some new inequalities akin to the Cowling-Price uncertainty principle, a generalization of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and derive the entropic uncertainty principle from the primary uncertainty principles.</description>

      <title>Phonon-limited valley life times in single-particle bilayer graphene quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The valley degree of freedom in 2D semiconductors, such as gapped bilayer graphene (BLG) and transition metal dichalcogenides, is a promising carrier of quantum information in the emerging field of valleytronics. While valley dynamics have been extensively studied for moderate band gap 2D~semiconductors using optical spectroscopy techniques, very little is known about valley lifetimes in narrow band gap BLG, which is difficult to study using optical techniques. Here, we report single-particle valley relaxation times ($T_1$) exceeding several microseconds in electrostatically defined BLG quantum dots (QDs) using a pulse-gating technique. The observed dependence of $T_1$ on perpendicular magnetic field can be understood qualitatively and quantitatively by a model in which $T_1$ is limited by electron-phonon coupling. We identify the coupling to acoustic phonons via the bond length change and via the deformation potential as the limiting mechanisms.</description>

      <title>New physics in spin entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14757v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a theory that preserves spin-summed scattering and decay rates at tree level while affecting particle spins. This is achieved by breaking the Lorentz group in a non-local way that tries avoiding stringent constraints, for example leaving unbroken the maximal sub-group SIM(2). As a phenomenological application, this new physics can alter the spins of top-antitop pairs (and consequently their entanglement) produced in $pp$ collisions without impacting their rates. Some observables affected by loops involving top quarks with modified entanglement receive corrections.</description>

      <title>Towards a classification of mixed-state topological orders in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02390v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classification and characterization of topological phases of matter is well understood for ground states of gapped Hamiltonians that are well isolated from the environment. However, decoherence due to interactions with the environment is inevitable -- thus motivating the investigation of topological orders in the context of mixed states. Here, we take a step toward classifying mixed-state topological orders in two spatial dimensions by considering their (emergent) generalized symmetries. We argue that their 1-form symmetries and the associated anyon theories lead to a partial classification under two-way connectivity by quasi-local quantum channels. This allows us to establish mixed-state topological orders that are intrinsically mixed, i.e., that have no ground state counterpart. We provide a wide range of examples based on topological subsystem codes, decohering $G$-graded string-net models, and "classically gauging" symmetry-enriched topological orders. One of our main examples is an Ising string-net model under the influence of dephasing noise. We study the resulting space of locally-indistinguishable states and compute the modular transformations within a particular coherent space. Based on our examples, we identify two possible effects of quasi-local quantum channels on anyon theories: (1) anyons can be incoherently proliferated -- thus reducing to a commutant of the proliferated anyons, or (2) the system can be "classically gauged", resulting in the symmetrization of anyons and an extension by transparent bosons. Given these two mechanisms, we conjecture that mixed-state topological orders are classified by premodular anyon theories, i.e., those for which the braiding relations may be degenerate.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Coupled Cluster Theory with Approximate Triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to explore the effects of high levels of electron correlation on the real-time coupled cluster formalism and algorithmic behavior, we introduce a time-dependent implementation of the CC3 singles, doubles and approximate triples method. We demonstrate the validity of our derivation and implementation using specific applications of frequency-dependent properties. Terms with triples are calculated and added to the existing CCSD equations, giving the method a nominal $\textit{O}(N^{7})$ scaling. We also use a graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerated implementation to reduce the computational cost, which we find can speed up the calculation by up to a factor of 17 for test cases of water clusters. In addition, we compare the impact of using single-precision arithmetic compared to conventional double-precision arithmetic. We find no significant difference in polarizabilities and optical-rotation tensor results, but a somewhat larger error for first hyperpolarizabilities. Compared to linear response (LR) CC3 results, the percentage errors of RT-CC3 polarizabilities and RT-CC3 first hyperpolarizabilities are under 0.1% and 1%, respectively, for a water-molecule test case in a double-zeta basis set. Furthermore, we compare the dynamic polarizabilities obtained using RT-CC3, RT-CCSD, and time-dependent nonorthogonal orbital-optimized coupled cluster doubles (TDNOCCD), in order to examine the performance of RT-CC3 and the orbital-optimization effect using a set of ten-electron systems.</description>

      <title>Large positive magnetoconductance in carbon nanoscrolls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate that carbon nanoscrolls -- spirally wrapped graphene layers with open endpoints -- can be characterized by a large positive magnetoconductance. We show that when a carbon nanoscroll is subject to an axial magnetic field of several Tesla, the ballistic conductance at low carrier densities of the nanoscroll has an increase of about 200%. Importantly, we find that this positive magnetoconductance is not only preserved in an imperfect nanoscroll (with disorder or mild inter-turn misalignment) but can even be enhanced in the presence of on-site disorder. We prove that the positive magnetoconductance comes about the emergence of magnetic field-induced zero energy modes, specific of rolled-up geometries. Our results establish curved graphene systems as a new material platform displaying sizable magnetoresistive phenomena.</description>

      <title>Achronal Localization, Representations of the Causal Logic for massive systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On plain physical grounds localization of relativistic quantum particles is extended to the achronal regions of Minkowski spacetime. Achronal localization fulfills automatically the requirements of causality. It constitutes the frame which complies most completely with the principle of causality for quantum mechanical systems. Achronal localization is equivalent to the localization in the regions of the causal logic. Representations of the causal logic are constructed for the systems with mass spectrum of positive Lebesgue measure and every definite spin. Apparently no representation of the causal logic for a real mass system has been achieved in the past.</description>

      <title>Efficient post-selection in light-cone correlations of monitored quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13096v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider how to target evolution conditioned on atypical measurement outcomes in monitored quantum circuits, i.e., the post-selection problem. We show that for a simple class of measurement schemes, post-selected light-cone dynamical correlation functions can be obtained efficiently from the averaged correlations of a different unitary circuit. This connects rare measurement outcomes in one circuit to typical outcomes in another one. We derive conditions for the existence of this rare-to-typical mapping in brickwork quantum circuits made of XYZ gates. We illustrate these general results with a model system that exhibits a dynamical crossover (a smoothed dynamical transition) in event statistics, and discuss extensions to more general dynamical correlations.</description>

      <title>Quantum-critical and dynamical properties of the XXZ bilayer with long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13145v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the XXZ square lattice bilayer model with antiferromagnetic non-frustrating long-range interactions that decay as a power law with the distance. Employing large-scale high-order series expansions with classical Monte Carlo integration (pCUT+MC) about the limit of isolated Heisenberg dimers in the rung-singlet phase, we investigate the one-triplon dispersion and the corresponding spectral weight along the parameter axes of the long-range decay exponent and the XXZ anisotropy. By tuning the latter, we observe two extended regions of 3d XY and Ising universality as well as 3d Heisenberg critical exponents at the isotropic point. Along the decay exponent axis, we demonstrate mean-field behavior for strong long-range couplings, the aforementioned three universality classes for sufficiently weak interactions, and continuously varying critical exponents in-between. Using extrapolations we are able to determine the one-triplon dispersion in a quantitative fashion up to the quantum-critical breakdown of the rung-singlet phase. This allows to extract the dynamical critical exponent $z$ as a function of the decay exponent, displaying a universal behavior. The detected $z&lt;1$ for small decay exponents is in agreement with the expected properties of the anomalous Goldstone modes in the ordered phases with broken continuous symmetry.</description>

      <title>Suppressing Gauge Drift in Quantum Simulations with Gauge Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simulation of quantum lattice gauge theories faces the major challenge of maintaining gauge invariance, as various errors in the simulation push the state of the system out of the physical subspace of the system's exponentially larger Hilbert space. This paper outlines a method, based off of previous work, that uses gauge transformations in two ways. Firstly, the method exploits the Zeno effect by conducting frequent projections to suppress gauge drift. These projections utilize local gauge transformations to destructively interfere unphysical amplitudes via coupling to an ancillary qubit while the physical amplitudes are left untouched, up to a less than unity normalization factor. Secondly, gauge transformations are conducted throughout the time evolution of the system to hamper the speed of gauge drift. This paper demonstrates this method on a pure 1D SU$(2)$ toy model.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Krylov Methods for Molecular Hamiltonians via Tensor Hypercontraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12708v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a matrix product operator (MPO) construction based on the tensor hypercontraction (THC) format for ab initio molecular Hamiltonians. Such an MPO construction dramatically lowers the memory requirement and cost scaling of Krylov subspace methods. These can find low-lying eigenstates while avoiding local minima and simulate quantum time evolution with high accuracy. In our approach, the molecular Hamiltonian is represented as a sum of products of four MPOs, each with a bond dimension of only $2$. Iteratively applying the MPOs to the current quantum state in matrix product state (MPS) form, summing and re-compressing the MPS leads to a scheme with the same asymptotic memory cost as the bare MPS and reduces the computational cost scaling compared to the Krylov method based on a conventional MPO construction. We provide a detailed theoretical derivation of these statements and conduct supporting numerical experiments to demonstrate the advantage. We also propose that our method is compatible with parallel computing, which is essential for calculating large-size systems.</description>

      <title>Euclidean and complex geometries from real-time computations of gravitational R\'enyi entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational R\'enyi computations have traditionally been described in the language of Euclidean path integrals. In the semiclassical limit, such calculations are governed by Euclidean (or, more generally, complex) saddle-point geometries. We emphasize here that, at least in simple contexts, the Euclidean approach suggests an alternative formulation in terms of the bulk quantum wavefunction. Since this alternate formulation can be directly applied to the real-time quantum theory, it is insensitive to subtleties involved in defining the Euclidean path integral. In particular, it can be consistent with many different choices of integration contour.
  Despite the fact that self-adjoint operators in the associated real-time quantum theory have real eigenvalues, we note that the bulk wavefunction encodes the Euclidean (or complex) R\'enyi geometries that would arise in any Euclidean path integral. As a result, for any given quantum state, the appropriate real-time path integral yields both R\'enyi entropies and associated complex saddle-point geometries that agree with Euclidean methods. After brief explanations of these general points, we use JT gravity to illustrate the associated real-time computations in detail.</description>

      <title>Non-isometry, State Dependence and Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish an equivalence between non-isometry of quantum codes and state-dependence of operator reconstruction, and discuss implications of this equivalence for holographic duality. Specifically, we define quantitative measures of non-isometry and state-dependence and describe bounds relating these quantities. In the context of holography we show that, assuming known gravitational path integral results for overlaps between semiclassical states, non-isometric bulk-to-boundary maps with a trivial kernel are approximately isometric and bulk reconstruction approximately state-independent. In contrast, non-isometric maps with a non-empty kernel always lead to state-dependent reconstruction. We also show that if a global bulk-to-boundary map is non-isometric, then there exists a region in the bulk which is causally disconnected from the boundary. Finally, we conjecture that, under certain physical assumptions for the definition of the Hilbert space of effective field theory in AdS space, the presence of a global horizon implies a non-isometric global bulk-to-boundary map.</description>

      <title>Quantum coherence and the invisible Universe: Subradiance as a dark matter mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of quantum entanglement and coherence in suppressing radiation and explore its implications for dark matter. Using Dicke's framework, we demonstrate that entangled states in a gas at thermal equilibrium can lead to subradiance, trapping energy in dark quantum states and reducing radiation intensity. Applying this to the 21 cm line in dark matter halos, we find that quantum coherence renders the gas effectively dark. Moreover, entanglement results in a vanishing collision cross-section, consistent with the collisionless nature of dark matter observed in systems like the bullet cluster. We also show that absorption of incident radiation can exceed levels predicted by Beer's law, which holds only in the absence of coherence. These findings suggest that quantum entanglement and coherence may explain the non-luminous behavior of matter in dark matter halos, offering a novel perspective on dark matter and advancing the understanding of astrophysical radiative processes.</description>

      <title>Soft symmetries of topological orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (2+1)D topological orders possess emergent symmetries given by a group $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$, which consists of the braided tensor autoequivalences of the modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ that describes the anyons. In this paper we discuss cases where $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$ has elements that neither permute anyons nor are associated to any symmetry fractionalization but are still non-trivial, which we refer to as soft symmetries. We point out that one can construct topological defects corresponding to such exotic symmetry actions by decorating with a certain class of gauged SPT states that cannot be distinguished by their torus partition function. This gives a physical interpretation to work by Davydov on soft braided tensor autoequivalences. This has a number of important implications for the classification of gapped boundaries, non-invertible spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the general classification of symmetry-enriched topological phases of matter. We also demonstrate analogous phenomena in higher dimensions, such as (3+1)D gauge theory with gauge group given by the quaternion group $Q_8$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how an isolated quantum system evolves toward a thermal state from an initial state far from equilibrium such as one prepared by a global quantum quench has attracted significant interest in recent years. This phenomenon can be elucidated through the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), which has had a profound impact across various fields, from high-energy physics to condensed matter physics. The purpose of this review article is to present the fundamental concepts of quantum equilibrium and the ETH to a broad audience within the physics community, particularly for those in high-energy physics who seek a comprehensive understanding of these important topics.</description>

      <title>A posteriori error estimates for the Lindblad master equation</title>

Abstract: We are interested in the simulation of open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. To simulate the solution of this equation, the standard approach involves two sequential approximations: first, we truncate the Hilbert space to derive a differential equation in a finite-dimensional subspace. Then, we use discrete time-step to obtain a numerical solution to the finite-dimensional evolution.
  In this paper, we establish bounds for these two approximations that can be explicitely computed to guarantee the accuracy of the numerical results. Through numerical examples, we demonstrate the efficiency of our method, empirically highlighting the tightness of the upper bound. While adaptive time-stepping is already a common practice in the time discretization of the Lindblad equation, we extend this approach by showing how to dynamically adjust the truncation of the Hilbert space. This enables fully adaptive simulations of the density matrix. For large-scale simulations, this approach significantly reduces computational time and relieves users of the challenge of selecting an appropriate truncation.</description>

      <title>Robust Hybrid Classical-Quantum Transfer Learning Model for Text Classification Using GPT-Neo 125M with LoRA &amp; SMOTE Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research introduces a hybrid classical-quantum framework for text classification, integrating GPT-Neo 125M with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) using quantum computing backends. While the GPT-Neo 125M baseline remains the best-performing model, the implementation of LoRA and SMOTE enhances the hybrid model, resulting in improved accuracy, faster convergence, and better generalization. Experiments on IBM's 127-qubit quantum backend and Pennylane's 32-qubit simulation demonstrate the viability of combining classical neural networks with quantum circuits. This framework underscores the potential of hybrid architectures for advancing natural language processing applications.</description>
