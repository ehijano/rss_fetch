      <title>Two waves of adaptation: speciation induced by dormancy in a model with changing environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a population model in which the season alternates between winter and summer, and individuals can acquire mutations either that are advantageous in the summer and disadvantageous in the winter, or vice versa. Also, we assume that individuals in the population can either be active or dormant, and that individuals can move between these two states. Dormant individuals do not reproduce but do not experience selective pressures. We show that, under certain conditions, over time we see two waves of adaptation. Some individuals repeatedly acquire mutations that are beneficial in the summer, while others repeatedly acquire mutations that are beneficial in the winter. Individuals can survive the season during which they are less fit by entering a dormant state. This result demonstrates that, for populations in fluctuating environments, dormancy has the potential to induce speciation.</description>

      <title>A reaction-diffusion model for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to investigate a reaction-diffusion model which describes in-host infection for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) allowing random motion (i.e. linear diffusion) and chemotaxis (i.e. non-linear diffusion) of macrophages and bacteria populations. In particular, chemotaxis-driven aggregation of macrophages plays a fundamental role in the development of the Mtb infection and the production of chemokine - located in the infection site - represents an attractant for the uninfected macrophages, therefore we consider chemotaxis between infected macrophages and uninfected macrophages. The linear stability of the endemic equilibria is investigated. In particular, by looking for conditions guaranteeing that an equilibrium, stable in the absence of diffusion, becomes unstable when diffusion is allowed, the formation of Turing patterns - that biologically represent the formation of granuloma initiated by the immune cells - is investigated. The weakly nonlinear analysis is performed to deeply explore the patterns amplitude. Furthermore, via numerical simulations, the formation of Turing patterns is analysed.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Dynamics of Lotka-Volterra Systems: Efficiency, Extinction Order, and Predictive Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For years, a main focus of ecological research has been to better understand the complex dynamical interactions between species which comprise food webs. Using the connectance properties of a widely explored synthetic food web called the cascade model, we explore the behavior of dynamics on Lotka-Volterra ecological systems. We show how trophic efficiency, a staple assumption in mathematical ecology, produces systems which are not persistent. With clustering analysis we show how straightforward inequalities of the summed values of the birth, death, self-regulation and interaction strengths provide insight into which food webs are more enduring or stable. Through these simplified summed values, we develop a random forest model and a neural network model, both of which are able to predict the number of extinctions that would occur without the need to simulate the dynamics. To conclude, we highlight the variable that plays the dominant role in determining the order in which species go extinct.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of mixed Gaussian phylogenetic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Continuous traits evolution of a group of taxa that are correlated through a phylogenetic tree is commonly modelled using parametric stochastic differential equations to represent deterministic change of trait through time, while incorporating noises that represent different unobservable evolutionary pressures. Often times, a heterogeneous Gaussian process that consists of multiple parametric sub-processes is often used when the observed data come from a very diverse set of taxa. In the maximum likelihood setting, challenges can be found when exploring the involved likelihood surface and when interpreting the uncertainty around the parameters.
  Results: We extend the methods to tackle inference problems for mixed Gaussian phylogenetic models (MGPMs) by implementing a Bayesian scheme that can take into account biologically relevant priors. The posterior inference method is based on the Population Monte Carlo (PMC) algorithm that are easily parallelized, and using an efficient algorithm to calculate the likelihood of phylogenetically correlated observations. A model evaluation method that is based on the proximity of the posterior predictive distribution to the observed data is also implemented. Simulation study is done to test the inference and evaluation capability of the method. Finally, we test our method on a real-world dataset.
  Conclusion: We implement the method in the R package bgphy, available at github.com/bayubeta/bgphy. Simulation study demonstrates that the method is able to infer parameters and evaluate models properly, while its implementation on the real-world dataset indicates that a carefully selected model of evolution based on naturally occurring classifications results in a better fit to the observed data.</description>

      <title>Reading Yule in light of the history and present of macroevolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Yule's 1925 paper introducing the branching model that bears his name was a landmark contribution to the biodiversity sciences. In his paper, Yule developed stochastic models to explain the observed distribution of species across genera and to test hypotheses about the relationship between clade age, diversity, and geographic range. Here we discuss the intellectual context in which Yule produced this work, highlight Yule's key mathematical and conceptual contributions using both his and more modern derivations, and critically examine some of the assumptions of his work through a modern lens. We then document the strange trajectory of his work through the history of macroevolutionary thought and discuss how the fundamental challenges he grappled with -- such as defining higher taxa, linking microevolutionary population dynamics to macroevolutionary rates, and accounting for inconsistent taxonomic practices -- remain with us a century later.</description>

      <title>Filtering coupled Wright-Fisher diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupled Wright-Fisher diffusions have been recently introduced to model the temporal evolution of finitely-many allele frequencies at several loci. These are vectors of multidimensional diffusions whose dynamics are weakly coupled among loci through interaction coefficients, which make the reproductive rates for each allele depend on its frequencies at several loci. Here we consider the problem of filtering a coupled Wright-Fisher diffusion with parent-independent mutation, when this is seen as an unobserved signal in a hidden Markov model. We assume individuals are sampled multinomially at discrete times from the underlying population, whose type configuration at the loci is described by the diffusion states, and adapt recently introduced duality methods to derive the filtering and smoothing distributions. These respectively provide the conditional distribution of the diffusion states given past data, and that conditional on the entire dataset, and are key to be able to perform parameter inference on models of this type. We show that for this model these distributions are countable mixtures of tilted products of Dirichlet kernels, and describe their mixing weights and how these can be updated sequentially. The evaluation of the weights involves the transition probabilities of the dual process, which are not available in closed form. We lay out pseudo codes for the implementation of the algorithms, discuss how to handle the unavailable quantities, and briefly illustrate the procedure with synthetic data.</description>

      <title>The importance of sampling design for unbiased estimation of survival using joint live-recapture and live resight models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13414v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Survival is a key life history parameter that can inform management decisions and life history research. Because true survival is often confounded with permanent and temporary emigration from the study area, many studies must estimate apparent survival (i.e., probability of surviving and remaining inside the study area), which can be much lower than true survival for highly mobile species. One method for estimating true survival is the Barker joint live-recapture/live-resight (JLRLR) model, which combines capture data from a study area (hereafter the capture site) with resighting data from a broader geographic area. This model assumes that live resights occur throughout the entire area where animals can disperse to and this assumption is often not met in practice. Here we use simulation to evaluate survival bias from a JLRLR model under study design scenarios that differ in the site selection for resights: global, random, fixed including the capture site, and fixed excluding the capture site. Simulation results indicate that fixed designs that included the capture site showed negative survival bias, whereas fixed designs that excluded the capture site exhibited positive survival bias. The magnitude of the bias was dependent on movement and survival, where scenarios with high survival and frequent movement had minimal bias. In effort to help minimize bias, we developed a multistate version of the JLRLR and demonstrated reductions in survival bias compared to the single-state version for most designs. Our results suggest minimizing bias can be accomplished by: 1) using a random resight design when feasible and global sampling is not possible, 2) using the multistate JLRLR model when appropriate, 3) including the capture site in the resight sampling frame when possible, and 4) reporting survival as apparent survival if fixed sites are used for resight with the single state JLRLR model.</description>

      <title>Indirect reciprocity under opinion synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Indirect reciprocity is a key explanation for the exceptional magnitude of cooperation among humans. This literature suggests that a large proportion of human cooperation is driven by social norms and individuals' incentives to maintain a good reputation. This intuition has been formalized with two types of models. In public assessment models, all community members are assumed to agree on each others' reputations; in private assessment models, people may have disagreements. Both types of models aim to understand the interplay of social norms and cooperation. Yet their results can be vastly different. Public assessment models argue that cooperation can evolve easily, and that the most effective norms tend to be stern. Private assessment models often find cooperation to be unstable, and successful norms show some leniency. Here, we propose a model that can organize these differing results within a single framework. We show that the stability of cooperation depends on a single quantity: the extent to which individual opinions turn out to be correlated. This correlation is determined by a group's norms and the structure of social interactions. In particular, we prove that no cooperative norm is evolutionarily stable when individual opinions are statistically independent. These results have important implications for our understanding of cooperation, conformity, and polarization.</description>
