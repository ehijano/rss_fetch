      <title>The Convergence of AI and Synthetic Biology: The Looming Deluge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and synthetic biology is rapidly accelerating the pace of biological discovery and engineering. AI techniques, such as large language models and biological design tools, are enabling the automated design, build, test, and learning cycles for engineered biological systems. This convergence promises to democratize synthetic biology and unlock novel applications across domains from medicine to environmental sustainability. However, it also poses significant risks around reliability, dual use, and governance. The opacity of AI models, the deskilling of workforces, and the outdated nature of current regulatory frameworks present challenges in ensuring responsible development. Urgent attention is needed to update governance structures, integrate human oversight into increasingly automated workflows, and foster a culture of responsibility among the growing community of bioengineers. Only by proactively addressing these issues can we realize the transformative potential of AI-driven synthetic biology while mitigating its risks.</description>

      <title>Six decades of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model: A guide through its spatio-temporal dynamics and influence across disciplines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The FitzHugh-Nagumo equation, originally conceived in neuroscience during the 1960s, became a key model providing a simplified view of excitable neuron cell behavior. Its applicability, however, extends beyond neuroscience into fields like cardiac physiology, cell division, population dynamics, electronics, and other natural phenomena. In this review spanning six decades of research, we discuss the diverse spatio-temporal dynamical behaviors described by the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation. These include dynamics like bistability, oscillations, and excitability, but it also addresses more complex phenomena such as traveling waves and extended patterns in coupled systems. The review serves as a guide for modelers aiming to utilize the strengths of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model to capture generic dynamical behavior. It not only catalogs known dynamical states and bifurcations, but also extends previous studies by providing stability and bifurcation analyses for coupled spatial systems.</description>
