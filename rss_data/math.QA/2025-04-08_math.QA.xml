      <title>Higher Order Connections in Noncommutative Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that, in the setting of noncommutative differential geometry, a system of higher order connections is equivalent to a suitable generalization of the notion of phase space quantization (in the sense of Moyal star products on the symbol algebra). Moreover, we show that higher order connections are equivalent to (ordinary) connections on jet modules. This involves introducing the notion of natural linear differential operator, as well as an important family of examples of such operators, namely the Spencer operators, generalizing their corresponding classical analogues. Spencer operators form the building blocks of this theory by providing a method of converting between the different manifestations of higher order connections. A system of such higher order connections then gives a quantization, by which we mean a splitting of the quotient projection that defines symbols as classes of differential operators up to differential operators of lower order. This yields a notion of total symbol and of star product, the latter of which corresponds, when restricted to the classical setting, to phase space quantization in the context of quantum mechanics. In this interpretation, we allow the analogues of the position coordinates to form a possibly noncommutative algebra.</description>

      <title>On the Hopf envelope of finite-dimensional bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hopf envelope of a bialgebra is the free Hopf algebra generated by the given bialgebra. Its existence, as well as that of the cofree Hopf algebra, is a well-known fact in Hopf algebra theory, but their construction is not particularly handy or friendly. In this note, we offer a novel realisation of the Hopf envelope and of the cofree Hopf algebra of a finite-dimensional bialgebra as a particular quotient and sub-bialgebra, respectively, of the bialgebra itself. Our construction can also be extended to the infinite-dimensional case, provided that the bialgebra satisfies additional conditions, such as being left Artinian as an algebra or admitting a $n$-antipode, the latter being a notion hereby introduced.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Double of Hopf Algebras Realized via Partial Dualization and the Tensor Category of Its Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to study the (generalized) quantum double $K^{\ast\mathrm{cop}}\bowtie_\sigma H$ determined by a (skew) pairing between finite-dimensional Hopf algebras $K^{\ast\mathrm{cop}}$ and $H$, especially the tensor category $\mathsf{Rep}(K^{\ast\mathrm{cop}}\bowtie_\sigma H)$ of its finite-dimensional representations. Specifically, we show that $K^{\ast\mathrm{cop}}\bowtie_\sigma H$ is a left partially dualized (quasi-)Hopf algebra of $K^\mathrm{op}\otimes H$, and use this formulation to establish tensor equivalences from $\mathsf{Rep}(K^{\ast\mathrm{cop}}\bowtie_\sigma H)$ to the categories ${}^K_K\mathcal{M}^K_H$ and ${}^{K^\ast}_{K^\ast}\mathcal{M}^{H^\ast}_{K^\ast}$ of two-sided two-cosided relative Hopf modules, as well as the category ${}_H\mathfrak{YD}^K$ of relative Yetter-Drinfeld modules.</description>

      <title>On the structure of DHR bimodules of abstract spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abstract spin chains axiomatize the structure of local observables on the 1D lattice which are invariant under a global symmetry, and arise at the physical boundary of 2+1D topologically ordered spin systems. In this paper, we study tensor categorical properties of DHR bimodules over abstract spin chains. Assuming that the charge transporters generate the algebra of observables, we prove that the associated category has a structure of modular tensor category with respect to the natural braiding. Under an additional assumption of algebraic Haag duality, this category becomes the Drinfeld center of the half-line fusion category.</description>

      <title>von Neumann Subfactors and Non-invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the language of von Neumann subfactors to investigate non-invertible symmetries in two dimensions. A fusion categorical symmetry $\mathcal{C}$, its module category $\mathcal{M}$, and a gauging labeled by an algebra object $\mathcal{A}$ are encoded in the bipartite principal graph of a subfactor. The dual principal graph captures the quantum symmetry $\mathcal{C}'$ obtained by gauging $\mathcal{A}$ in $\mathcal{C}$, as well as a reverse gauging back to $\mathcal{C}$. From a given subfactor $N \subset M$, we derive a quiver diagram that encodes the representations of the associated non-invertible symmetry. We show how this framework provides necessary conditions for admissible gaugings, enabling the construction of generalized orbifold groupoids. To illustrate this strategy, we present three examples: Rep$(D_4)$ as a warm-up, the higher-multiplicity case Rep$(A_4)$ with its associated generalized orbifold groupoid and triality symmetry, and Rep$(A_5)$, where $A_5$ is the smallest non-solvable finite group. For applications to gapless systems, we embed these generalized gaugings as global manipulations on the conformal manifolds of $c=1$ CFTs and uncover new self-dualities in the exceptional $SU(2)_1/A_5$ theory. For $\mathcal{C}$-symmetric TQFTs, we use the subfactor-derived quiver diagrams to characterize gapped phases, describe their vacuum structure, and classify the recently proposed particle-soliton degeneracies.</description>

      <title>Anti-pre-Novikov algebras and anti-pre-Novikov bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Firstly, we introduce the notion of anti-pre-Novikov algebras as a new approach of splitting the Novikov algebras. The notions of anti-O-operators on Novikov algebras are developed to interpret anti-pre-Novikov algebras. Secondly, we introduce the notion of anti-pre-Novikov bialgebras as the bialgebra structures corresponding to a double constructions of symmetric quasi-Frobenius Novikov algebras, which are interpreted in terms of certain matched pairs of Novikov algebras as well as the compatible anti-pre-Novikov algebras. The study of coboundary cases leads to the introduction of the the anti-pre-Novikov Yang-Baxter equation (APN-YBE), whose skew-symmetric solutions give coboundary anti-pre-Novikov bialgebras. The notion of O-operators on anti-pre-Novikov algebras is studied to construct skew-symmetric solutions of the APN-YBE.</description>

      <title>Towards the quantum exceptional series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find a single two-parameter skein relation on trivalent graphs, the quantum exceptional relation, that specializes to a skein relation associated to each exceptional Lie algebra (in the adjoint representation). If a slight strengthening of Deligne's conjecture on the existence of a (classical) exceptional series is true, then this relation holds for a new two-variable quantum exceptional polynomial, at least as a power series near $q=1$. The single quantum exceptional relation can be viewed as a deformation of the Jacobi relation, and implies a deformation of the Vogel relation that motivated the conjecture on the classical exceptional series.
  We find a conjectural basis for the space of diagrams with $n$ loose ends modulo the quantum exceptional relation for $n \le 6$, with dimensions agreeing with the classical computations, and compute the matrix of inner products, and the quantum dimensions of idempotents. We use the skein relation to compute the conjectural quantum exceptional polynomial for many knots. In particular we determine (unconditionally) the values of the quantum polynomials for the exceptional Lie algebras on these knots. We can perform these computations for all links of Conway width less than $6$, which includes all prime knots with 12 or fewer crossings. Finally, we prove several specialization results relating our conjectural family to certain quantum group categories, and conjecture a number of exceptional analogues of level-rank duality.</description>
