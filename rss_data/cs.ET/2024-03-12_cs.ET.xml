      <title>Towards Multiphase Clocking in Single-Flux Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid single-flux quantum (RSFQ) is one of the most advanced superconductive electronics technologies. SFQ systems operate at tens of gigahertz with up to three orders of magnitude smaller power as compared to CMOS. In conventional SFQ systems, most gates require clock signal. Each gate should have the fanins with equal logic depth, necessitating insertion of path-balancing (PB) DFFs, incurring prohibitive area penalty. Multiphase clocking is the effective method for reducing the path-balancing overhead at the cost of reduced throughput. However, existing tools are not directly applicable for technology mapping of multiphase systems. To overcome this limitation, in this work, we propose a technology mapping tool for multiphase systems. Our contribution is threefold. First, we formulate a phase assignment as a Constraint Programming with Satisfiability (CP-SAT) problem, to determine the phase of each element within the network. Second, we formulate the path balancing problem as a CP-SAT to optimize the number of DFFs within an asynchronous datapath. Finally, we integrate these methods into a technology mapping flow to convert a logic network into a multiphase SFQ circuit. In our case studies, by using seven phases, the size of the circuit (expressed as the number of Josephson junctions) is reduced, on average, by 59.94 % as compared to the dual (fast-slow) clocking method, while outperforming the state-of-the-art single-phase SFQ mapping tools.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the Power of T1-cells in SFQ Arithmetic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid single-flux quantum (RSFQ), a leading cryogenic superconductive electronics (SCE) technology, offers extremely low power dissipation and high speed. However, implementing RSFQ systems at VLSI complexity faces challenges, such as substantial area overhead from gate-level pipelining and path balancing, exacerbated by RSFQ's limited layout density. T1 flip-flop (T1-FF) is an RSFQ logic cell operating as a pulse counter. Using T1-FF the full adder function can be realized with only 40% of the area required by the conventional realization. This cell however imposes complex constraints on input signal timing, complicating its use. Multiphase clocking has been recently proposed to alleviate gate-level pipelining overhead. The fanin signals can be efficiently controlled using multiphase clocking. We present the novel two-stage SFQ technology mapping methodology supporting the T1-FF. Compatible parts of the SFQ network are first replaced by the efficient T1-FFs. Multiphase retiming is next applied to assign clock phases to each logic gate and insert DFFs to satisfy the input timing. Using our flow, the area of the SFQ networks is reduced, on average, by 6% with up to 25% reduction in optimizing the 128-bit adder.</description>

      <title>Designing a K-state P-bit Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic bit (p-bit)-based compute engines utilize the unique capability of a p-bit to probabilistically switch between two states to solve computationally challenging problems. However, when solving problems that require more than two states (e.g., problems such as Max-3-Cut, verifying if a graph is K-partite (K&gt;2) etc.), additional pre-processing steps such as graph reduction are required to make the problem compatible with a two-state p-bit platform. Moreover, this not only increases the problem size by entailing the use of auxiliary variables but can also degrade the solution quality. In this work, we develop a unique framework for implementing a K-state (K&gt;2) p-bit engine. Furthermore, from an implementation standpoint, we show that such a K-state p-bit engine can be implemented using N traditional (2-state) p-bits, and one multi-state p-bit -- a novel concept proposed here. Augmenting traditional p-bit platforms, our approach enables us to solve an archetypal combinatoric problem class requiring multiple states, namely Max-K-Cut (K=3, 4 shown here), without using any additional auxiliary variables. Thus, our work fundamentally advances the functional capability of p-bit engines, enabling them to solve a broader class of computationally challenging problems more efficiently.</description>

      <title>The Ouroboros of Memristors: Neural Networks Facilitating Memristor Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memristive devices hold promise to improve the scale and efficiency of machine learning and neuromorphic hardware, thanks to their compact size, low power consumption, and the ability to perform matrix multiplications in constant time. However, on-chip training with memristor arrays still faces challenges, including device-to-device and cycle-to-cycle variations, switching non-linearity, and especially SET and RESET asymmetry. To combat device non-linearity and asymmetry, we propose to program memristors by harnessing neural networks that map desired conductance updates to the required pulse times. With our method, approximately 95% of devices can be programmed within a relative percentage difference of +-50% from the target conductance after just one attempt. Our approach substantially reduces memristor programming delays compared to traditional write-and-verify methods, presenting an advantageous solution for on-chip training scenarios. Furthermore, our proposed neural network can be accelerated by memristor arrays upon deployment, providing assistance while reducing hardware overhead compared with previous works.
  This work contributes significantly to the practical application of memristors, particularly in reducing delays in memristor programming. It also envisions the future development of memristor-based machine learning accelerators.</description>

      <title>Integration of Physics-Derived Memristor Models with Machine Learning Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation frameworks such MemTorch, DNN+NeuroSim, and aihwkit are commonly used to facilitate the end-to-end co-design of memristive machine learning (ML) accelerators. These simulators can take device nonidealities into account and are integrated with modern ML frameworks. However, memristors in these simulators are modeled with either lookup tables or simple analytic models with basic nonlinearities. These simple models are unable to capture certain performance-critical aspects of device nonidealities. For example, they ignore the physical cause of switching, which induces errors in switching timings and thus incorrect estimations of conductance states. This work aims at bringing physical dynamics into consideration to model nonidealities while being compatible with GPU accelerators. We focus on Valence Change Memory (VCM) cells, where the switching nonlinearity and SET/RESET asymmetry relate tightly with the thermal resistance, ion mobility, Schottky barrier height, parasitic resistance, and other effects. The resulting dynamics require solving an ODE that captures changes in oxygen vacancies. We modified a physics-derived SPICE-level VCM model, integrated it with the aihwkit simulator and tested the performance with the MNIST dataset. Results show that noise that disrupts the SET/RESET matching affects network performance the most. This work serves as a tool for evaluating how physical dynamics in memristive devices affect neural network accuracy and can be used to guide the development of future integrated devices.</description>

      <title>Q-CHOP: Quantum constrained Hamiltonian optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems that arise in science and industry typically have constraints. Yet the presence of constraints makes them challenging to tackle using both classical and quantum optimization algorithms. We propose a new quantum algorithm for constrained optimization, which we call quantum constrained Hamiltonian optimization (Q-CHOP). Our algorithm leverages the observation that for many problems, while the best solution is difficult to find, the worst feasible (constraint-satisfying) solution is known. The basic idea is to to enforce a Hamiltonian constraint at all times, thereby restricting evolution to the subspace of feasible states, and slowly "rotate" an objective Hamiltonian to trace an adiabatic path from the worst feasible state to the best feasible state. We additionally propose a version of Q-CHOP that can start in any feasible state. Finally, we benchmark Q-CHOP against the commonly-used adiabatic algorithm with constraints enforced using a penalty term and find that Q-CHOP performs consistently better on a wide range of problems, including textbook problems on graphs, knapsack, combinatorial auction, as well as a real-world financial use case, namely bond exchange-traded fund basket optimization.</description>

      <title>Enabling 5G QoS configuration capabilities for IoT applications on container orchestration platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Container orchestration platform is the foundation of modern cloud infrastructure. In recent years, container orchestration platform has been evolving to cross the boundary of device, edge, and cloud. More and more IoT applications such as robotics and XR have been deployed across the device-cloud continuum through the container orchestration platform, e.g., the Kubernetes (K8s) framework. Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of advanced communication technologies like 5G has endorsed the revolution in IoT applications as more network resource is available for critical IoT use cases. This paper aims to integrate network configuration capabilities provided by a 5G Network Exposure Function (NEF) into the K8s framework which is used to simplify application deployment in an orchestration in the device-cloud continuum. Specifically, a Linux fwmark-based network Quality of Service (QoS) configuration method is proposed to expose the QoS information from an overlay network that is used by the container orchestration platform to the underlay network. A Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin-based implementation is demonstrated to perform QoS configuration for the 5G network. The proposed solution is validated with an existing localization and mapping application to verify the feasibility. The proposed solution has the following benefits: (1) The solution is a Kubernetes-native approach which adopts the CNI plugin mechanism. (2) The solution can expose the QoS information from an overlay network to an underlay network in a non-intrusive manner. (3) No packet manipulation is required to greatly reduce the overhead for packet processing. (4) It extends the K8s bandwidth limit feature from on-node to the access network. (5) It is compatible with the 5G infrastructure without any alteration or adding extra complexity.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum-inspired Resnet and Densenet for Pattern Recognition with Completeness Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the contemporary digital technology approaching, deep neural networks are emerging as the foundational algorithm of the artificial intelligence boom. Whereas, the evolving social demands have been emphasizing the necessity of novel methodologies to substitute traditional neural networks. Concurrently, the advent of the post-Moore era has spurred the development of quantum-inspired neural networks with outstanding potentials at certain circumstances. Nonetheless, a definitive evaluating system with detailed metrics is tremendously vital and indispensable owing to the vague indicators in comparison between the novel and traditional deep learning models at present. Hence, to improve and evaluate the performances of the novel neural networks more comprehensively in complex and unpredictable environments, we propose two hybrid quantum-inspired neural networks which are rooted in residual and dense connections respectively for pattern recognitions with completeness representation theory for model assessment. Comparative analyses against pure classical models with detailed frameworks reveal that our hybrid models with lower parameter complexity not only match the generalization power of pure classical models, but also outperform them notably in resistance to parameter attacks with various asymmetric noises. Moreover, our hybrid models indicate unique superiority to prevent gradient explosion problems through theoretical argumentation. Eventually, We elaborate on the application scenarios where our hybrid models are applicable and efficient, which paves the way for their industrialization and commercialization.</description>

      <title>Measuring Robustness in Cyber-Physical Systems under Sensor Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper contributes a formal framework for quantitative analysis of bounded sensor attacks on cyber-physical systems, using the formalism of differential dynamic logic. Given a precondition and postcondition of a system, we formalize two quantitative safety notions, quantitative forward and backward safety, which respectively express (1) how strong the strongest postcondition of the system is with respect to the specified postcondition, and (2) how strong the specified precondition is with respect to the weakest precondition of the system needed to ensure the specified postcondition holds. We introduce two notions, forward and backward robustness, to characterize the robustness of a system against sensor attacks as the loss of safety. To reason about robustness, we introduce two simulation distances, forward and backward simulation distances, which are defined based on the behavioral distances between the original system and the system with compromised sensors. Forward and backward distances, respectively, characterize upper bounds of the degree of forward and backward safety loss caused by the sensor attacks. We verify the two simulation distances by expressing them as modalities, i.e., formulas of differential dynamic logic, and develop an ad-hoc proof system to reason with such formulas. We showcase our formal notions and reasoning techniques on two non-trivial case studies: an autonomous vehicle that needs to avoid collision and a water tank system.</description>

      <title>Interest-Aware Joint Caching, Computing, and Communication Optimization for Mobile VR Delivery in MEC Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the upcoming B5G/6G era, virtual reality (VR) over wireless has become a typical application, which is an inevitable trend in the development of video. However, in immersive and interactive VR experiences, VR services typically exhibit high delay, while simultaneously posing challenges for the energy consumption of local devices. To address these issues, this paper aims to improve the performance of the VR service in the edge-terminal cooperative system. Specifically, we formulate a problem of joint caching, computing, and communication VR service policy, by optimizing the weighted sum of overall VR delivery delay and energy consumption of local devices. For the purpose of designing the optimal VR service policy, the optimization problem is decoupled into three independent subproblems to be solved separately. To enhance the caching efficiency within the network, a bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (Bert)-based user interest analysis method is first proposed to characterize the content requesting behavior accurately. On the basis of this, a service cost minimum-maximization problem is formulated with consideration of performance fairness among users. Thereafter, the joint caching and computing scheme is derived for each user with given allocation of communication resources while a bisection-based communication scheme is acquired with the given information on joint caching and computing policy. With alternative optimization, an optimal policy for joint caching, computing and communication based on user interest can be finally obtained. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed user interest-aware caching scheme and the effective of the joint caching, computing and communication optimization policy with consideration of user fairness.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Multimodal Multi-Instance Learning for Aortic Stenosis Diagnosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated interpretation of ultrasound imaging of the heart (echocardiograms) could improve the detection and treatment of aortic stenosis (AS), a deadly heart disease. However, existing deep learning pipelines for assessing AS from echocardiograms have two key limitations. First, most methods rely on limited 2D cineloops, thereby ignoring widely available Doppler imaging that contains important complementary information about pressure gradients and blood flow abnormalities associated with AS. Second, obtaining labeled data is difficult. There are often far more unlabeled echocardiogram recordings available, but these remain underutilized by existing methods. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Semi-supervised Multimodal Multiple-Instance Learning (SMMIL), a new deep learning framework for automatic interpretation for structural heart diseases like AS. When deployed, SMMIL can combine information from two input modalities, spectral Dopplers and 2D cineloops, to produce a study-level AS diagnosis. During training, SMMIL can combine a smaller labeled set and an abundant unlabeled set of both modalities to improve its classifier. Experiments demonstrate that SMMIL outperforms recent alternatives at 3-level AS severity classification as well as several clinically relevant AS detection tasks.</description>

      <title>I/O Transit Caching for PMem-based Block Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Byte-addressable non-volatile memory (NVM) sitting on the memory bus is employed to make persistent memory (PMem) in general-purpose computing systems and embedded systems for data storage. Researchers develop software drivers such as the block translation table (BTT) to build block devices on PMem, so programmers can keep using mature and reliable conventional storage stack while expecting high performance by exploiting fast PMem. However, our quantitative study shows that BTT underutilizes PMem and yields inferior performance, due to the absence of the imperative in-device cache. We add a conventional I/O staging cache made of DRAM space to BTT. As DRAM and PMem have comparable access latency, I/O staging cache is likely to be fully filled over time. Continual cache evictions and fsyncs thus cause on-demand flushes with severe stalls, such that the I/O staging cache is concretely unappealing for PMem-based block devices. We accordingly propose an algorithm named Caiti with novel I/O transit caching. Caiti eagerly evicts buffered data to PMem through CPU's multi-cores. It also conditionally bypasses a full cache and directly writes data into PMem to further alleviate I/O stalls. Experiments confirm that Caiti significantly boosts the performance with BTT by up to 3.6x, without loss of block-level write atomicity.</description>

      <title>LLMs Still Can't Avoid Instanceof: An Investigation Into GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and Bard's Capacity to Handle Object-Oriented Programming Assignments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools to assist students while solving programming assignments. However, object-oriented programming (OOP), with its inherent complexity involving the identification of entities, relationships, and responsibilities, is not yet mastered by these tools. Contrary to introductory programming exercises, there exists a research gap with regard to the behavior of LLMs in OOP contexts. In this study, we experimented with three prominent LLMs - GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard - to solve real-world OOP exercises used in educational settings, subsequently validating their solutions using an Automatic Assessment Tool (AAT). The findings revealed that while the models frequently achieved mostly working solutions to the exercises, they often overlooked the best practices of OOP. GPT-4 stood out as the most proficient, followed by GPT-3.5, with Bard trailing last. We advocate for a renewed emphasis on code quality when employing these models and explore the potential of pairing LLMs with AATs in pedagogical settings. In conclusion, while GPT-4 showcases promise, the deployment of these models in OOP education still mandates supervision.</description>

      <title>Developing an AI-Based Psychometric System for Assessing Learning Difficulties and Adaptive System to Overcome: A Qualitative and Conceptual Framework</title>

Abstract: Learning difficulties pose significant challenges for students, impacting their academic performance and overall educational experience. These difficulties could sometimes put students into a downward spiral that lack of educational resources for personalized support consistently led to under-accommodation of students special needs, and the student lose opportunities in the longer term academic and work development. This research aims to propose a conceptual framework for an adaptive AI-based virtual tutor system that incorporates psychometric assessment to support students with learning difficulties. This process involves the careful selection and integration of validated current mature psychometric scales that assess key dimensions of learning, such as cognitive abilities, learning styles, and academic skills. By incorporating scales that specifically assess these difficulties, the psychometric test will provide a comprehensive understanding of each students unique learning profile and inform targeted interventions within the adaptive tutoring system. The paper also proposes using autoencoders to identify the latent patterns to generate the students profile vector for collection of psychometric data, defining state space and action space representing the students desired combination of images, sound and text engagements, employing extended Bayesian knowledge tracing and hierarchical model and Metropolis-Hastings to continuously estimate and monitor the students performance in various psychometric constructs. The proposed system will leverage the capabilities of LLMs, visual generation models, and psychometric assessments to provide personalized instruction and support tailored to each students unique learning characteristics and needs.</description>

      <title>Solving Distributed Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problems in the Wool Textile Industry with Quantum Annealing</title>

Abstract: Many modern manufacturing companies have evolved from a single production site to a multi-factory production environment that must handle both geographically dispersed production orders and their multi-site production steps. The availability of a range of machines in different locations capable of performing the same operation and shipping times between factories have transformed planning systems from the classic Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) to Distributed Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (DFJSP). As a result, the complexity of production planning has increased significantly. In our work, we use Quantum Annealing (QA) to solve the DFJSP. In addition to the assignment of production orders to production sites, the assignment of production steps to production sites also takes place. This requirement is based on a real use case of a wool textile manufacturer. To investigate the applicability of this method to large problem instances, problems ranging from 50 variables up to 250 variables, the largest problem that could be embedded into a D-Wave quantum annealer Quantum Processing Unit (QPU), are formulated and solved. Special attention is dedicated to the determination of the Lagrange parameters of the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model and the QPU configuration parameters, as these factors can significantly impact solution quality. The obtained solutions are compared to solutions obtained by Simulated Annealing (SA), both in terms of solution quality and calculation time. The results demonstrate that QA has the potential to solve large problem instances specific to the industry.</description>

      <title>Self-Assembly of Patterns in the abstract Tile Assembly Model</title>

Abstract: In the abstract Tile Assembly Model, self-assembling systems consisting of tiles of different colors can form structures on which colored patterns are ``painted.'' We explore the complexity, in terms of the numbers of unique tile types required, of assembling various patterns. We first demonstrate how to efficiently self-assemble a set of simple patterns, then show tight bounds on the tile type complexity of self-assembling 2-colored patterns on the surfaces of square assemblies. Finally, we demonstrate an exponential gap in tile type complexity of self-assembling an infinite series of patterns between systems restricted to one plane versus those allowed two planes.</description>

      <title>Nanophotonic Phased Array XY Hamiltonian Solver</title>

Abstract: Solving large-scale computationally hard optimization problems using existing computers has hit a bottleneck. A promising alternative approach uses physics-based phenomena to naturally solve optimization problems wherein the physical phenomena evolves to its minimum energy. In this regard, photonics devices have shown promise as alternative optimization architectures, benefiting from high-speed, high-bandwidth and parallelism in the optical domain. Among photonic devices, programmable spatial light modulators (SLMs) have shown promise in solving large scale Ising model problems to which many computationally hard problems can be mapped. Despite much progress, existing SLMs for solving the Ising model and similar problems suffer from slow update rates and physical bulkiness. Here, we show that using a compact silicon photonic integrated circuit optical phased array (PIC-OPA) we can simulate an XY Hamiltonian, a generalized form of Ising Hamiltonian, where spins can vary continuously. In this nanophotonic XY Hamiltonian solver, the spins are implemented using analog phase shifters in the optical phased array. The far field intensity pattern of the PIC-OPA represents an all-to-all coupled XY Hamiltonian energy and can be optimized with the tunable phase-shifters allowing us to solve an all-to-all coupled XY model. Our results show the utility of PIC-OPAs as compact, low power, and high-speed solvers for nondeterministic polynomial (NP)-hard problems. The scalability of the silicon PIC-OPA and its compatibility with monolithic integration with CMOS electronics further promises the realization of a powerful hybrid photonic/electronic non-Von Neumann compute engine.</description>

      <title>A Digital Twin Design Methodology for Control, Simulation, and Monitoring of Fluidic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a synthesis method for the design of digital twins applicable to various systems (pneumatic, hydraulic, electrical/electronic circuits). The methodology allows representing the operation of these systems through an active digital twin, thereby enabling a more suitable and easier computer-aided design, simulation, control, and monitoring. Furthermore, our methodology enables the detection of a system's actions on its own inputs (for example, in pneumatics: backflow of gases trapped in part of a fluidic system onto its own inputs). During the simulation or monitoring phase, the approach also facilitates real-time diagnosis of the controlled system. The outputs, on the controlled physical system or its digital twin, do not depend only on the current inputs but also on the history of the inputs and the history of internal states and variables. In other words, the underlying sequential logic has a memory while an only combinational logic approach does not. These capabilities can contribute to the digital transformation of the factory of the future.</description>
