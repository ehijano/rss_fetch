      <title>Packet Level Resilience for the User Plane in 5G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demands of ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) in 5G networks necessitate enhanced resilience mechanisms to address user plane failures caused by outages, hardware defects, or software bugs. An important aspect for achieving ultra-reliable communication is the redundant transmission of packets, as also highlighted in 3GPP Release 18. This paper explores leveraging the Packet Replication, Elimination, and Ordering Function (PREOF) to achieve 1+1 path protection within 5G environments. By extending existing 5G components with mechanisms for path redundancy and offloading the reordering mechanism to external servers, the proposed approach ensures ultra-low latency and minimal packet loss in case of a failure. A conceptual integration of redundant paths and programmable elements is presented, with considerations for deployment in existing 5G infrastructures and the trade-offs of latency versus enhanced traffic engineering. Future work aims to evaluate practical implementations using P4-based hardware and offloading technologies like DPDK and eBPF.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Video Streaming with AI-Based Optimization for Dynamic Network Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increase in video streaming has presented a challenge of handling stream request effectively, especially over networks that are variable. This paper describes a new adaptive video streaming architecture capable of changing the video quality and buffer size depending on the data and latency of streamed video. For video streaming VLC media player was used where network performance data were obtained through Python scripts with very accurate data rate and latency measurement. The collected data is analyzed using Gemini AI, containing characteristics of the machine learning algorithm that recognizes the best resolution of videos and the buffer sizes. Through the features of real-time monitoring and artificial intelligence decision making, the proposed framework improves the user experience by reducing the occurrence of buffering events while at the same time increasing the video quality. Our findings therefore confirm that the proposed solution based on artificial intelligence increases video quality and flexibility. This study advances knowledge of adaptive streaming and offers an argument about how intelligent datadriven approaches and AI may be useful tools for enhancing the delivery of video in practical environments.</description>

      <title>Impact of Reactive Jamming Attacks on LoRaWAN: a Theoretical and Experimental Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of reactive jamming on LoRaWAN networks, focusing on minimizing jammer exposure time while effectively disrupting communication. We analyze the protection mechanisms implemented in LoRa and explore how different jamming configurations influence frame success rates. A key contribution of this work is the proposal of a Software Defined Radio (SDR)-based jamming approach that generates a controlled number of random symbols, independent of the standard LoRa frame structure. This approach enables precise control over jammer exposure time and provides flexibility in studying the effect of jamming symbols on network performance. Theoretical analysis is validated through experimental results, where a jammer implemented on GNU Radio is used to assess the impact of jamming under various configurations. Our findings demonstrate that LoRa-based networks can be disrupted with a minimal number of symbols, emphasizing the need for future research on covert communication techniques to counter such jamming attacks.</description>

      <title>RayLoc: Wireless Indoor Localization via Fully Differentiable Ray-tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless indoor localization has been a pivotal area of research over the last two decades, becoming a cornerstone for numerous sensing applications. However, conventional wireless localization methods rely on channel state information to perform blind modelling and estimation of a limited set of localization parameters. This oversimplification neglects many sensing scene details, resulting in suboptimal localization accuracy. To address this limitation, this paper presents a novel approach to wireless indoor localization by reformulating it as an inverse problem of wireless ray-tracing, inferring scene parameters that generates the measured CSI. At the core of our solution is a fully differentiable ray-tracing simulator that enables backpropagation to comprehensive parameters of the sensing scene, allowing for precise localization. To establish a robust localization context, RayLoc constructs a high-fidelity sensing scene by refining coarse-grained background model. Furthermore, RayLoc overcomes the challenges of sparse gradient and local minima by convolving the signal generation process with a Gaussian kernel. Extensive experiments showcase that RayLoc outperforms traditional localization baselines and is able to generalize to different sensing environments.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Key Distribution using Decoy Pulses to Combat Photon-Number Splitting by Eavesdropper: An Event-by-Event Impairment Enumeration Approach for Performance Evaluation and Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum-key distribution (QKD) schemes employing quantum communication links are typically based on the transmission of weak optical pulses over optical fibers to setup a secret key between the transmitting and receiving nodes. Alice transmits optically a random bit stream to the receiver (Bob) through the photon polarizations or the quadrature components of the lightwaves associated with the photons, with a secret key remaining implicitly embedded therein. However, during the above transmission, some eavesdropper (Eve) might attempt to tap the passing-by photons from the optical fiber links to extract the key. In one of the popular QKD schemes, along with signal pulses, some additional decoy pulses are transmitted by Alice, while Eve might use photon-number splitting (PNS) for eavesdropping. In a typical PNS scheme, (i) the optical pulses with single photon are blocked by Eve, (ii) from the optical pulses with two photons, one photon is retained by Eve to carry out eavesdropping operation and the other is retransmitted to Bob, and (iii) all other pulses with more than two photons are retransmitted by Eve to Bob without retaining any photon from them. Extensive theoretical research has been carried out on such QKD schemes, by employing information-theoretic approach along with computer simulations and experimental studies. We present a novel event-by-event impairment enumeration approach to evaluate the overall performance of one such QKD scheme analytically with due consideration to the physical layer of the quantum communication links. The proposed approach monitors the impairments of the propagating optical pulses event-by-event at all possible locations along the optical fiber link using statistical approach, and provides estimates of the realizable key generation rate, while assuring an adequate yield ratio between signal and decoy pulses for the detection of possible eavesdropping.</description>

Abstract: With the standardization and commercialization completed at an unforeseen pace for 5th generation (5G) wireless networks, researchers, engineers and executives from the academia and industry have turned their attention to new candidate technologies that can support next generation wireless networks enabling more advanced capabilities in emerging scenarios. Explicitly, the 6th generation (6G) terrestrial wireless network aims to providing seamless connectivity not only to users but also to machine type devices for the next decade and beyond. This paper describes the progresses moving towards 6G, which is officially termed as ''international mobile telecommunications (IMT) for 2030 and beyond'' in the International Telecommunication Union Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R). Specifically, the usage scenarios, their representative capabilities, the supporting technologies and spectrum are discussed, and research opportunities and challenges are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Real-Time Video QoE via Bandwidth Sharing under Markovian setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10681v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimizing Quality of Experience (QoE) of clients streaming real-time video, served by networks managed by different operators that can share bandwidth with each other. The abundance of real-time video traffic is evident in the popularity of applications like video conferencing and video streaming of live events, which have increased significantly since the recent pandemic. We model the problem as a joint optimization of resource allocation for the clients and bandwidth sharing across the operators, with special attention to how the resource allocation impacts clients' perceived video quality. We propose an online policy as a solution, which involves dynamically sharing a portion of one operator's bandwidth with another operator. We provide strong theoretical optimality guarantees for the policy. We also use extensive simulations to demonstrate the policy's substantial performance improvements (of up to ninety percent), and identify insights into key system parameters (e.g., imbalance in arrival rates or channel conditions of the operators) that dictate the improvements.</description>

      <title>REPS: Recycled Entropy Packet Spraying for Adaptive Load Balancing and Failure Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-generation datacenters require highly efficient network load balancing to manage the growing scale of artificial intelligence (AI) training and general datacenter traffic. Existing solutions designed for Ethernet, such as Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) and oblivious packet spraying (OPS), struggle to maintain high network utilizations as datacenter topologies (and network failures as a consequence) continue to grow. To address these limitations, we propose REPS, a lightweight decentralized per-packet adaptive load balancing algorithm designed to optimize network utilization while ensuring rapid recovery from link failures. REPS adapts to network conditions by caching good-performing paths. In case of a network failure, REPS re-routes traffic away from it in less than 100 microseconds. REPS is designed to be deployed with next-generation out-of-order transports, such as Ultra Ethernet, and introduces less than 25 bytes of per-connection state. We extensively evaluate REPS in large-scale simulations and FPGA-based NICs.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Impact of Inter-cluster Communications in Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09278v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed applications based on micro-services in edge computing are becoming increasingly popular due to the rapid evolution of mobile networks. While Kubernetes is the default framework when it comes to orchestrating and managing micro-service-based applications in mobile networks, the requirement to run applications between multiple sites at cloud and edge poses new challenges. Since Kubernetes does not natively provide tools to abstract inter-cluster communications at the application level, inter-cluster communication in edge computing is becoming increasingly critical to the application performance. In this paper, we evaluate for the first time the impact of inter-cluster communication on edge computing performance by using three prominent, open source inter-cluster communication projects and tools, i.e., Submariner, ClusterLink and Skupper. We develop a fully open-source testbed that integrates these tools in a modular fashion, and experimentally benchmark sample applications, including the ML class of applications, on their performance running in the multi-cluster edge computing system under varying networking conditions. We experimentally analyze two classes of envisioned mobile applications, i.e., a) industrial automation, b) vehicle decision drive assist. Our results show that ClusterLink performs best out of the three tools in scenarios with increased payloads, regardless of the underlying networking conditions or transmission direction between clusters. It is closely followed by Skupper, unless request and reply both transport significant amounts of data. Finally, when requesting smaller amounts of data from a service, Submariner slightly outperforms Skupper and ClusterLink regardless of the inter-node networking conditions.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Spectrum Sharing Algorithms for Networks with Heterogeneous Wireless Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As highlighted in the National Spectrum Strategy, Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) is key for enabling 6G networks to meet the increasing demand for spectrum from various, heterogeneous emerging applications. In this paper, we consider heterogeneous wireless networks with multiple 6G base stations (BS) and a limited number of frequency bands available for transmission. Each BS is associated with a geographical location, a coverage area, and a bandwidth requirement. We assume that clients/UEs are within the corresponding BS's coverage area. To avoid interference, we impose that BSs with overlapping coverage areas must use different frequency bands. We address the challenging problem of efficiently allocating contiguous frequency bands to BSs while avoiding interference. Specifically, we define performance metrics that capture the feasibility of the frequency allocation task, the number of BSs that can be allocated within the limited frequency bands, and the amount of resources utilized by the network. Then, we consider five different DSA algorithms that prioritize BSs based on different features -- one of these algorithms is known in the graph theory literature as Welsh-Powell graph colouring algorithm -- and compare their performance using extensive simulations. Our results show that DSA algorithms that attempt to maximize the chances of obtaining a feasible frequency allocation -- which have been widely studied in the literature -- tend to under-perform in all other metrics.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficiency and Spectral-Efficiency Trade-off in Distributed Massive-MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01271v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the inherent trade-off between energy efficiency (EE) and spectral efficiency (SE) in distributed massive-MIMO (D-mMIMO) systems. Optimizing the EE and SE together is crucial as increasing spectral efficiency often leads to higher energy consumption. Joint power allocation and AP-UE association are pivotal in this trade-off analysis because they directly influence both EE and SE. We address the gap in existing literature where the EE-SE trade-off has been analyzed but not optimized in the context of D-mMIMO systems. The focus of this study is to maximize the EE with constraints on uplink sum SE through judicious power allocation and AP-UE association, essential for enhancing network throughput. Numerical simulations are performed to validate the proposed model, exploring the impacts of AP-UE association and power allocation on the EE-SE trade-off in uplink D-mMIMO scenarios.</description>

      <title>An Attentive Graph Agent for Topology-Adaptive Cyber Defence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a promising technique to create intelligent and adaptive cyber defense systems. However, most existing autonomous defensive agents have overlooked the inherent graph structure of computer networks subject to cyber attacks, potentially missing critical information and constraining their adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we developed a custom version of the Cyber Operations Research Gym (CybORG) environment, encoding network state as a directed graph with realistic low-level features. We employ a Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture to process node, edge, and global features, and adapt its output to be compatible with policy gradient methods in RL. Our GAT-based approach offers key advantages over flattened alternatives: robust policies capable of handling dynamic network topology changes, generalisation to networks of varying sizes beyond the training distribution, and interpretable defensive actions grounded in tangible network properties. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our low-level directed graph observations by training GAT defensive policies that successfully adapt to changing network topologies. Evaluations across networks of different sizes, but consistent subnetwork structure, show our policies achieve comparable performance to policies trained specifically for each network configuration. Our study contributes to the development of robust cyber defence systems that can better adapt to real-world network security challenges.</description>
