      <title>Mamba Meets Financial Markets: A Graph-Mamba Approach for Stock Price Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stock markets play an important role in the global economy, where accurate stock price predictions can lead to significant financial returns. While existing transformer-based models have outperformed long short-term memory networks and convolutional neural networks in financial time series prediction, their high computational complexity and memory requirements limit their practicality for real-time trading and long-sequence data processing. To address these challenges, we propose SAMBA, an innovative framework for stock return prediction that builds on the Mamba architecture and integrates graph neural networks. SAMBA achieves near-linear computational complexity by utilizing a bidirectional Mamba block to capture long-term dependencies in historical price data and employing adaptive graph convolution to model dependencies between daily stock features. Our experimental results demonstrate that SAMBA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in prediction accuracy, maintaining low computational complexity. The code and datasets are available at github.com/Ali-Meh619/SAMBA.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Generative AI for Economic Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use generative AI to extract managerial expectations about their economic outlook from over 120,000 corporate conference call transcripts. The overall measure, AI Economy Score, robustly predicts future economic indicators such as GDP growth, production, and employment, both in the short term and to 10 quarters. This predictive power is incremental to that of existing measures, including survey forecasts. Moreover, industry and firm-level measures provide valuable information about sector-specific and individual firm activities. Our findings suggest that managerial expectations carry unique insights about economic activities, with implications for both macroeconomic and microeconomic decision-making.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of American option pricing in a two-asset jump-diffusion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses a significant gap in rigorous numerical treatments for pricing American options under correlated two-asset jump-diffusion models using the viscosity solution approach, with a particular focus on the Merton model. The pricing of these options is governed by complex two-dimensional (2-D) variational inequalities that incorporate cross-derivative terms and nonlocal integro-differential terms due to the presence of jumps. Existing numerical methods, primarily based on finite differences, often struggle with preserving monotonicity in the approximation of cross-derivatives-a key requirement for ensuring convergence to the viscosity solution. In addition, these methods face challenges in accurately discretizing 2-D jump integrals. We introduce a novel approach to effectively tackle the aforementioned variational inequalities, seamlessly managing cross-derivative terms and nonlocal integro-differential terms through an efficient and straightforward-to-implement monotone integration scheme. Within each timestep, our approach explicitly tackles the variational inequality constraint, resulting in a 2-D Partial Integro-Differential Equation (PIDE) to solve. Its solution is then expressed as a 2-D convolution integral involving the Green's function of the PIDE. We derive an infinite series representation of this Green's function, where each term is strictly positive and computable. This series facilitates the numerical approximation of the PIDE solution through a monotone integration method, such as the composite quadrature rule. The proposed method is demonstrated to be both $\ell_{\infty} $-stable and consistent in the viscosity sense, ensuring its convergence to the viscosity solution of the variational inequality. Extensive numerical results validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, highlighting its practical applicability and theoretical soundness.</description>

      <title>The Fourier Cosine Method for Discrete Probability Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous convergence proof demonstrating that the well-known semi-analytical Fourier cosine (COS) formula for the inverse Fourier transform of continuous probability distributions can be extended to discrete probability distributions, with the help of spectral filters. We establish general convergence rates for these filters and further show that several classical spectral filters achieve convergence rates one order faster than previously recognized in the literature on the Gibbs phenomenon. Our numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical convergence results. Additionally, we illustrate the computational speed and accuracy of the discrete COS method with applications in computational statistics and quantitative finance. The theoretical and numerical results highlight the method's potential for solving problems involving discrete distributions, particularly when the characteristic function is known, allowing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to be bypassed.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical pricing of options written on SOFR futures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a semi-analytical approach to pricing options on SOFR futures where the underlying SOFR follows a time-dependent CEV model. By definition, these options change their type at the beginning of the reference period: before this time, this is an American option written on a SOFR forward price as an underlying, and after this point, this is an arithmetic Asian option with an American style exercise written on the daily SOFR rates. We develop a new version of the GIT method and solve both problems semi-analytically, obtaining the option price, the exercise boundary, and the option Greeks. This work is intended to address the concern that the transfer from LIBOR to SOFR has resulted in a situation in which the options of the key money market (i.e., futures on the reference rate) are options without any pricing model available. Therefore, the trading in options on 3M SOFR futures currently ends before their reference quarter starts, to eliminate the final metamorphosis into exotic options.</description>

      <title>Numerical Claim Detection in Finance: A New Financial Dataset, Weak-Supervision Model, and Market Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the influence of claims in analyst reports and earnings calls on financial market returns, considering them as significant quarterly events for publicly traded companies. To facilitate a comprehensive analysis, we construct a new financial dataset for the claim detection task in the financial domain. We benchmark various language models on this dataset and propose a novel weak-supervision model that incorporates the knowledge of subject matter experts (SMEs) in the aggregation function, outperforming existing approaches. We also demonstrate the practical utility of our proposed model by constructing a novel measure of optimism. Here, we observe the dependence of earnings surprise and return on our optimism measure. Our dataset, models, and code are publicly (under CC BY 4.0 license) available on GitHub.</description>
