      <title>Nature of Science in the classroom: empirical insights into investigating physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we present and discuss a didactic activity that combines epistemic aspects of the nature of science (NOS) and a simple, relatively low-cost experiment on electromagnetic induction. The aim of the activity is for students to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between theory and experiment. The results of the application showed that the students not only improved their communication skills within the groups, but also exercised creativity when facing a real and unknown problem. In addition, interactions with the students revealed that they assimilated some of the consensual aspects of the nature of science, namely: there is no universal scientific method, scientists use imagination and belief in scientific practice, and theory is not a consequence of experimental observation and vice versa. In relation to pedagogical aspects, students have improved their communicative abilities within groups, exercised creativity in problem-solving, and assumed responsibility in the development of the activity. Although the activity was carried out with high school students, it also has potential to be applied in higher education. Finally, various possibilities for expansion and modifications to the activity are discussed, aiming to further enrich the learning experience.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Final Exams: An Assessment Strategy for Enhanced Collaborative Learning and Reduced Student Stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-stage exams, which pair a traditional individual exam with a subsequent collaborative, group exam, have been shown to enhance learning, retention, and student attitudes in midterm settings. This study investigates whether these benefits extend to final exam settings, compares the traditional final exam experience with a two-stage variation, and explores using an asynchronous group component to maintain the exam comprehensive nature. Within introductory courses at two different institutions, two formats for two-stage exams were implemented: one with a 2-hour individual exam followed by a 1-hour synchronous group exam and another with a 3-hour individual exam followed by an untimed, asynchronous group exam completed within 36 hours. Survey data comparing student experiences with two-stage midterm and final exams showed consistently positive responses at both institutions. When comparing two-stage final exams to traditional (individual-only) final exams, students reported increased learning and retention, decreased anxiety, and an overwhelming preference for the two-stage format. These findings suggest that extending the benefits of two-stage midterms to the final exam is possible without compromising the evaluative purpose of a final exam while also maintaining high student motivation and engagement.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the displacement current: Two key examples showing when and why it can be neglected</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores the role of the displacement current in systems beyond capacitors, focusing on coaxial cables and resistors with alternating currents. Although its contribution, compared to that of the conduction current, is negligible at low frequencies, the displacement current becomes essential for accurately describing electromagnetic fields in dynamic regimes. Introductory physics textbooks typically restrict the discussion of displacement currents to capacitor charging, which can limit the students' understanding of its broader relevance and the interdependence of Maxwell's equations. By analyzing two specific cases, we clarify the conditions under which the displacement current can be neglected, when simplified laws like Biot-Savart are valid, and where coupled electromagnetic equations are essential. This approach highlights the boundaries of common models and promotes a deeper understanding of dynamic field interactions.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Technology Job Market: Data Driven Analysis of 3641 Job Posts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19004v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Quantum Technology (QT) has created a growing demand for a specialized workforce, spanning across academia and industry. This study presents a quantitative analysis of the QT job market by systematically extracting and classifying thousands of job postings worldwide. The classification pipeline leverages large language models (LLMs) whilst incorporating a "human-in-the-loop" validation process to ensure reliability, achieving an F1-score of 89%: a high level of accuracy. The research identifies key trends in regional job distribution, degree and skill requirements, and the evolving demand for QT-related roles. Findings reveal a strong presence of the QT job market in the United States and Europe, with increasing corporate demand for engineers, software developers, and PhD-level researchers. Despite growing industry applications, the sector remains in its early stages, dominated by large technology firms and requiring significant investment in education and workforce development. The study highlights the need for targeted educational programs, interdisciplinary collaboration, and industry-academic partnerships to bridge the QT workforce gap.</description>
