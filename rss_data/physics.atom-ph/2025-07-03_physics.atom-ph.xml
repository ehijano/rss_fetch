      <title>Frequency reproducibility of solid-state Th-229 nuclear clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state $^{229}$Th nuclear clocks are set to provide new opportunities for precision metrology and fundamental physics. Taking advantage of a nuclear transition's inherent low sensitivity to its environment, orders of magnitude more emitters can be hosted in a solid-state crystal compared to current optical lattice atomic clocks. Furthermore, solid-state systems needing only simple thermal control are key to the development of field-deployable compact clocks. In this work, we explore and characterize the frequency reproducibility of the $^{229}$Th:CaF$_2$ nuclear clock transition, a key performance metric for all clocks. We measure the transition linewidth and center frequency as a function of the doping concentration, temperature, and time. We report the concentration-dependent inhomogeneous linewidth of the nuclear transition, limited by the intrinsic host crystal properties. We determine an optimal working temperature for the $^{229}$Th:CaF$_2$ nuclear clock at 195(5) K where the first-order thermal sensitivity vanishes. This would enable in-situ temperature co-sensing using different quadrupole-split lines, reducing the temperature-induced systematic shift below the 10$^{-18}$ fractional frequency uncertainty level. At 195 K, the reproducibility of the nuclear transition frequency is 280 Hz (fractionally $1.4\times10^{-13}$) for two differently doped $^{229}$Th:CaF$_2$ crystals over four months. These results form the foundation for understanding, controlling, and harnessing the coherent nuclear excitation of $^{229}$Th in solid-state hosts, and for their applications in constraining temporal variations of fundamental constants.</description>

      <title>Electron Excitation Probability in Dielectrics under Two-color Intense Laser Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-color laser fields offer significantly enhanced control over electron excitation dynamics under ultrashort intense laser pulses compared to monochromatic fields. However, their strong nonlinearity necessitates computationally expensive first-principles calculations to accurately predict ionization dynamics. To overcome this challenge, we derive an analytical expression for the ionization rate in dielectrics subjected to intense two-color laser fields, refining the theoretical framework introduced in JPSJ {\bf 88}, 024706 (2019). By benchmarking our formula against first-principles calculations based on time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) for $\alpha$-quartz, we demonstrate that our model captures the essential physics of ionization dynamics with remarkable qualitative accuracy, despite employing certain approximations. This analytical approach not only provides deeper physical insight but also offers a computationally efficient alternative for predicting strong-field interactions in dielectrics.</description>

      <title>Testing Determinism and the Role of Time in Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze experiments to test determinism and the role of time in atoms. As a first step, we consider experiments to test if stable isotopes change over time. The idea is to measure the hyperfine splitting for newly created stable isotopes and compare them to the same isotopes found in nature. The three cases analyzed are strontium-87 with an odd number of neutrons, lutetium-175 with an odd number of protons, and lutetium-176 with an odd number of protons and neutrons. These experiments would search for possible changes in the nuclear magnetic moment of isotopes since they were first created during nucleosynthesis. We propose that a time-dependent nuclear magnetic moment may enable deterministic tracking of the life cycle of an isotope, and prediction of age since creation and time until decay of radioisotopes. The case of thulium-170 is analyzed, it is particularly interesting as a radioisotope with an odd number of protons and neutrons. More generally, we argue that any atomic transition could change in time, either due to the atomic nucleus or to the electron charge distribution. The latter could be tested in a dual atomic clock in a ladder configuration to search for the aging of an electronic transition.</description>

      <title>Passive Quantum Interconnects: High-Fidelity Quantum Networking at Higher Rates and Less Overhead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity, high-rate quantum interconnect is a fundamental building block of scalable quantum technologies. The cavity-assisted photon scattering (CAPS) approach is an attractive alternative to commonly used active protocols based on photon emission and two-photon interference: it offers higher success probability and greater intrinsic robustness to imperfections, while remaining a passive operation that does not require complex atom excitation sequences or intermodule synchronization. Despite these advantages, CAPS has not been a primary choice for quantum interconnect protocols since the estimated fidelity and the rate of CAPS-based networking have been severely limited in existing protocols and analysis frameworks. In this work, we eliminate these limitations by protocol improvements aided by a thorough analysis of the atom-cavity dynamics, to demonstrate that existing or near-term optical cavity qualities are sufficient for achieving a fidelity of 0.999 with short optical pulses required for high-rate networking. We show that efficient time-multiplexed operation is possible with suppressed crosstalk, enabling high-rate entanglement generation. We also propose a hybrid network configuration leveraging both photon emission and CAPS gates, eliminating the need for external photon sources while maintaining performance and robustness. As a concrete example, with 200 ${}^{171}$Yb atoms coupled to a cavity with internal cooperativity 100, atom-atom entanglement generation rate of $4 \times 10^5~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ is estimated at a fidelity of 0.999, with further speedup beyond $10^6~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ anticipated by the use of multiple wavelength channels. Our results establish the CAPS-based network protocol as a leading candidate for scaling quantum information platforms.</description>

      <title>The robustness of composite pulses elucidated by classical mechanics: Stability around the globe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Composite Pulses (CPs) are widely used in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), optical spectroscopy, optimal control experiments and quantum computing to manipulate systems that are well-described by a two-level Hamiltonian. A careful design of these pulses can allow the refocusing of an ensemble at a desired state, even if the ensemble experiences imperfections in the magnitude of the external field or resonance offsets. Since the introduction of CPs, several theoretical justifications for their robustness have been suggested. In this work, we suggest another justification based on the classical mechanical concept of a stability matrix. The motion on the Bloch Sphere is mapped to a canonical system of coordinates and the focusing of an ensemble corresponds to caustics, or the vanishing of an appropriate stability matrix element in the canonical coordinates. Our approach highlights the directionality of the refocusing of the ensemble on the Bloch Sphere, revealing how different ensembles refocus along different directions. The approach also clarifies when CPs can induce a change in the width of the ensemble as opposed to simply a rotation of the axes. As a case study, we investigate the $90(x)180(y)90(x)$ CP introduced by Levitt, where the approach provides a new perspective into why this CP is effective.</description>

      <title>Effects of beyond-mean-field correlations on nuclear Schiff moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the nuclear Schiff moments of the diamagnetic atoms $^{129}$Xe, $^{199}$Hg, and $^{225}$Ra in multireference covariant density functional theory. Beyond-mean-field correlations, arising from symmetry restoration and shape mixing, are incorporated via the generator coordinate method with projection onto states with well-defined parity, particle number, and angular momentum. Our results reveal a correlation between the contributions of nuclear intermediate states to Schiff moments and the electric dipole transition strengths from these states to the ground state. The new beyond-mean-field effects can either enhance or suppress the Schiff moments. In $^{225}$Ra, they do the latter, reducing the enhancement from octupole deformation somewhat.</description>

      <title>Machine learning prediction of a chemical reaction over 8 decades of energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in machine learning has sparked increased interest in utilizing this technology to predict the outcomes of chemical reactions. The ultimate aim of such endeavors is to develop a universal model that can predict products for any chemical reaction given reactants and physical conditions. In pursuit of ever more universal chemical predictors, machine learning models for atom-diatom and diatom-diatom reactions have been developed, yet no such models exist for termolecular reactions. Accordingly, we introduce neural networks trained to predict opacity functions of atom recombination reactions. Our models predict the recombination of Sr$^+$ + Cs + Cs $\rightarrow$ SrCs$^+$ + Cs and Sr$^+$ + Cs + Cs $\rightarrow$ Cs$_2$ + Sr$^+$ over multiple orders of magnitude of energy, yielding overall results with a relative error $\lesssim 10\%$. Even far beyond the range of energies seen during training, our models predict the atom recombination reaction rate accurately. As a result, the machine is capable of learning the physics behind the atom recombination reaction dynamics.</description>

      <title>Role of plasma waves in rescattering processes in intense laser fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rescattering of the photoelectron at its parent ion underlie a number of phenomena in intense laser field interaction with matter, such as high harmonic generation, attosecond pulse production, non-sequential double ionization, and others. These processes are unavoidably accompanied by the medium photoionization. The interaction of the laser pulse with the photoionization-induced plasma excites wakefield waves, which are self-consistently coupled plasma density and Langmuir waves. We study theoretically the effect of the electric field of the plasma wave on the rescattering processes. We show that this field can compensate for the magnetic drift of the rescattering electron, which otherwise dramatically suppresses the rescattering efficiency in intense low-frequency laser fields. Moreover, the presence of the plasma wave field leads to new lines in the spectrum emitted due to the XUV free-induction decay (XFID). Observation of these lines can allow, in particular, the detection of forbidden transition frequencies, thus providing new perspectives for XFID spectroscopy.</description>

Abstract: The FAMU experiment at RAL has been designed to study the hyperfine splitting (HFS) of muonic hydrogen and thus measure the Zemach radius of the proton, with a precision better than 1 %. The HFS transition is excited by a tunable MIR laser at ~ 6790 nm and is recognized by delayed ($\mu$O) X-ray emission around 130-170 keV. The fast X-ray detection system is based on 34 scintillating LaBr3:Ce crystals and one HPGe detector for inter-calibration.</description>

      <title>Role of mechanical effects on the excitation spectra of microwave-dressed Rydberg states in a cold atomic cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the excitation spectra of cold 87Rb atoms to the 55D_3/2 Rydberg state in the presence of microwave (MW) radiation as a function of MW frequency. The spectra reveal several features around the transition-frequencies between adjacent Rydberg states. We argue that some of these features are indicative of variations in the Rydberg excitation probability while others result from the removal of atoms from the cold cloud as a consequence of a MW induced strong dipole-dipole inter-atomic force. Our claim is supported by experimental observations and theoretical modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trapped matter-wave interferometry offers the promise of compact high-precision local force sensing. However, the trap itself can introduce new systematic errors which are absent in traditional free-fall interferometers. We describe and demonstrate a novel Floquet-engineered platform for compact, continuously trapped atom interferometry which is intrinsically robust against trap noise and beamsplitter pulse duration. A non-interacting degenerate quantum gas undergoes position-space Bloch oscillations through an amplitude-modulated optical lattice, whose resulting Floquet-Bloch band structure includes Landau-Zener beamsplitters and Bragg mirrors, forming the components of a Mach-Zehnder interferometric force sensor. We identify, realize, and experimentally characterize magic band structures, analogous to the magic wavelengths employed in optical lattice clocks, for which the interferometric phase is insensitive to lattice intensity noise. We leverage the intrinsic programmability of the Floquet synthesis approach to demonstrate a variety of interferometer structures, highlighting the potential of this technique for quantum force sensors which are tunable, compact, simple, and robust.</description>

      <title>Dynamically-decoupled hyper-Ramsey spectroscopy of optical clock transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyper-Ramsey protocols have been successfully implemented on ultra-narrow optical clock transitions to reduce systematic frequency-shifts induced by AC-Stark shift and amplitude pulse variation. However, the compensation remains imperfect against laser probe intensity fluctuation, decoherence and unsuited for external quasi-static or low frequency noise perturbations. Here, we address these limitations by employing dynamical-decoupling methods composed by multiple rotary Hahn-echo pulses toggling probe frequency detunings between opposite signs during interrogating laser pulses. Time-optimized Uhrig sequences of refocusing pulses produce highly contrasted and robust hyper-Ramsey interferences against low-frequency noise distortions caused by environmental factors and imperfections in the probe parameters. Dynamically-decoupled SU(2) hyper-clocks pave the way to universal noise-resilient quantum sensors, unveiling fault-tolerant quantum metrology to track fundamental symmetries and search for new physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Experimental signatures of Hilbert-space ergodicity: Universal bitstring distributions and applications in noise learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Systems reaching thermal equilibrium are ubiquitous. For classical systems, this phenomenon is typically understood statistically through ergodicity in phase space, but translating this to quantum systems is a long-standing problem of interest. Recently a strong notion of quantum ergodicity has been proposed, namely that isolated, global quantum states uniformly explore their available state space, dubbed Hilbert-space ergodicity. Here we observe signatures of this process with an experimental Rydberg quantum simulator and various numerical models, before generalizing to the case of a local quantum system interacting with its environment. For a closed system, where the environment is a complementary subsystem, we predict and observe a smooth quantum-to-classical transition in that observables progress from large, quantum fluctuations to small, Gaussian fluctuations as the bath size grows. This transition exhibits universal properties on a quantitative level amongst a wide range of systems, including those at finite temperature, those with itinerant particles, and random circuits. For an open system, where the environment is uncontrolled, we predict the statistics of observables under largely arbitrary noise channels including those with correlated errors, allowing us to discriminate between candidate error models both for continuous Hamiltonian time evolution and for digital random circuits. This allows for computationally efficient experimental noise learning, and more broadly is a new avenue for quantitatively classifying the behavior of noisy quantum systems. Ultimately our results clarify the role of ergodicity in quantum dynamics, with fundamental and practical consequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Arkani-Hamed-Dimopoulos-Dvali (ADD) model with n extra compactified dimensions, the gravitational potential scales as 1/r^{n+1} and becomes significantly stronger at short distances. We investigate the possibility of forming small-sized composite systems of Standard Model particles bound by this potential. Such bound states, composed of quarks, neutrinos, axions, or other particles, exhibit a small cross-section-to-mass ratio, making them viable candidates for dark matter.</description>

Abstract: Scalable atom-based quantum platforms for simulation, computing, and metrology require fast high-fidelity, low-loss imaging of individual atoms. Standard fluorescence detection methods rely on continuous cooling, limiting the detection range to one atom and imposing long imaging times that constrain the experimental cycle and mid-circuit conditional operations. Here, we demonstrate fast and low-loss single-atom imaging in optical tweezers without active cooling, enabled by the favorable properties of ytterbium. Collecting fluorescence over microsecond timescales, we reach single-atom discrimination fidelities above 99.9% and single-shot survival probabilities above 99.5%. Through interleaved recooling pulses, as short as a few hundred microseconds for atoms in magic traps, we perform tens of consecutive detections with constant atom-retention probability per image - an essential step toward fast atom re-use in tweezer-based processors and clocks. Our scheme does not induce parity projection in multiply-occupied traps, enabling number-resolved single-shot detection of several atoms per site. This allows us to study the near-deterministic preparation of single atoms in tweezers driven by blue-detuned light-assisted collisions. Moreover, the near-diffraction-limited spatial resolution of our low-loss imaging enables number-resolved microscopy in dense arrays, opening the way to direct site-occupancy readout in optical lattices for density fluctuation and correlation measurements in quantum simulators.</description>
