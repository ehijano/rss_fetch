      <title>Symmetry groups of origami structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Origami is the art of folding paper into various patterns without cutting or tearing the paper. By viewing the paper as the complex plane, we iteratively compute and record all intersection points to construct mathematical origami sets. Additionally, we include the various lines to create a repeating pattern that can be viewed as a wallpaper group if the angle set contains fewer than 3 angles. There are 17 wallpaper groups up to isomorphism, so we determine which such groups can be constructed in this way, depending on the rotational and reflectional symmetries present in the given pattern. If the angle set contains more than 4 angles, the resulting pattern will be dense and hence no longer a wallpaper group. In this case, the classification of the symmetry group is done algorithmically.</description>

      <title>Singular Ideals over arbitrary fields for the two- and three-headed snakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Steinberg algebra with coefficients in an arbitrary field K for the two- and three-headed snake groupoids, which are basic examples of non-Hausdorff groupoids. We are particularly interested in elements of this algebra that are no longer continuous, known as singular functions. We prove that the ideal of singular functions in the Steinberg algebra of the two-headed snake does not properly contain any non-zero ideal, regardless of the choice of the base field K. In the case of the three-headed snake, we prove that the ideal of singular functions of the Steinberg algebra properly contains non-zero ideals if, and only if, the base field K is a splitting field of x^2 + x + 1. In particular, there are always non-zero proper subset ideals when K has characteristic a prime not congruent to -1 mod 3.</description>

      <title>Generalized Inverses of Quaternion Matrices with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the theoretical and computational aspects of quaternion generalized inverses, focusing on outer inverses and {1,2}-inverses with prescribed range and/or null space constraints. In view of non-commutative nature of quaternions, a detailed characterization of the left and right range and null spaces of quaternion matrices is presented. Explicit representations for these inverses are derived, including full rank decomposition-based formulations. We design two efficient algorithms, one leveraging the Quaternion Toolbox for MATLAB (QTFM), and another employing a complex structure-preserving approach based on the complex representation of quaternion matrices. With suitable choices of subspace constraints , these outer inverses unify and generalize several classical inverses, including the Moore-Penrose inverse, the group inverse, and the Drazin inverse. The proposed methods are validated through numerical examples and applied to two real-world tasks: quaternion-based color image deblurring, which preserves inter-channel correlations, and robust filtering of chaotic 3D signals, demonstrating their effectiveness in high-dimensional setings.</description>

      <title>The nilpotent graph of a finite0-dimensional Lie algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $L$ be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field $F$. In This paper we introduce the \emph{nilpotent graph} $\Gamma_\mathfrak{N}(L)$ as the graph whose vertices are the elements of $L \setminus \nil(L)$, where \[\nil(L) = \{x \in L \mid \langle x, y \rangle \text{ is nilpotent for all } y \in L\},\] and where two vertices $x, y$ are adjacent if the Lie subalgebra they generate is nilpotent. We give some characterizations of $\nil(L)$ and its connection with the hypercenter $Z^*(L)$, for example, they are equal when $F$ has characteristic zero. We prove that the nilpotentizer behaves well under direct sums, allowing a decomposition of $\Gamma_\mathfrak{N}(L)$ between components. The paper also investigates the structural and combinatorial properties of $\Gamma_\mathfrak{N}(L)$, including the conditions under which the graph is connected. We characterize the existence of strongly self-centralizing subalgebras in relation to connectivity and vertex isolation. Explicit computations are carried out for the algebra $\mathfrak{t}(2,\mathbb{F}_q)$, where $\Gamma_\mathfrak{N}(L)$ decomposes into $q+1$ components, each of size $q(q-1)$, forming a $(q^2-q-1)$-regular graph. We conclude with algorithms for constructing $\Gamma_\mathfrak{N}(L)$ in SageMath, and pose open problems concerning bipartiteness, regularity, and structural implications in higher dimensions over finite fields.</description>

      <title>Free commutative skew braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main result of this paper is an explicit construction of the free commutative skew brace -- that is, a skew brace whose circle group is commutative -- on an arbitrary generating set $X$. We embed this object into a set of rational functions and show that a simple linear equation characterizes the image of this embedding. As a consequence, comparing elements in this skew brace is no more difficult than comparing elements in the free commutative group generated by $X$.</description>

      <title>Normal forms for ordinary differential operators, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, which is a follow-up of our first paper "Normal forms for ordinary differential operators, I", we extend the explicit parametrisation of torsion free rank one sheaves on projective irreducible curves with vanishing cohomology groups obtained earlier to analogous parametrisation of torsion free sheaves of arbitrary rank with vanishing cohomology groups on projective irreducible curves.
  As an illustration of our theorem we calculate one explicit example of such parametrisation, namely for rank two sheaves on a Weierstrass cubic curve.</description>

      <title>Rank-Preserving Index-Dependent Matrix Transformations: Applications to Clockwork and Deconstruction Theory Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a versatile framework of index-dependent element-wise matrix transformations, $b_{ij} = a_{ij} / g_f(i,j)$, with direct applications to hierarchy generating mass hierarchies in high-energy physics. This paper establishes the precise mathematical conditions on $g_f(i,j)$ that preserve the rank and nullity of the original matrix. Our study reveals that such transformations provide a powerful method for engineering specific properties of a matrix's null space; by appropriately selecting the function $g_f(i,j)$, one can generate null vectors (or eigenvectors) with diverse and controllable localization patterns. The broad applicability of this technique is discussed, with detailed examples drawn from high-energy physics. We demonstrate how our framework can be used to tailor 0-mode profiles and fermionic mass spectra in clockwork and dimensional deconstruction models, showing that the standard clockwork mechanism arises as a particular case $(g_f(i,j) = f^{(i-j)})$, thereby offering new tools for particle physics BSM model building. This work illustrates the potential of these transformations in model building across various fields where localized modes or specific spectral properties are crucial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the Grothendieck group of the Leavitt path algebra over the power graphs of all prime-power cyclic groups is studied by using a well-known computation from linear algebra. More precisely, the Smith normal form of the matrix derived from the adjacency matrix associated with the power graph of prime-power cyclic group is calculated.</description>

      <title>Picture groups and maximal green sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.14584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that picture groups are directly related to maximal green sequences for valued Dynkin quivers of finite type. Namely, there is a bijection between maximal green sequences and positive expressions (words in the generators without inverses) for the Coxeter element of the picture group. We actually prove the theorem for the more general set up of "vertically and horizontally ordered" sets of positive real Schur roots for any hereditary algebra (not necessarily of finite type).
  Furthermore, we show that every picture for such a set of positive roots is a linear combination of "atoms" and we give a precise description of atoms as special semi-invariant pictures.</description>
