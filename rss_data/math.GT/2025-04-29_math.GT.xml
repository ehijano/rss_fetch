      <title>The crossing and the arc from the topological viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combinatorial approach to knot theory treats knots as diagrams modulo Reidemeister moves. Many constructions of knot invariants (e.g., index polynomials, quandle colorings, etc.) use elements of diagrams such as arcs and crossings by assigning invariant labels to them. The universal invariant labels, which carry the most information, can be thought of as equivalence classes of arcs and crossings modulo the relation, which identifies corresponding elements of diagrams connected by a Reidemeister move. We can call these equivalence classes the arcs and crossings of the knot. In the paper, we give a topological description of sets of these classes as the isotopy classes of probes of diagram elements.
  In the second part of the paper, we discuss the homotopy classes of diagram elements. We demonstrate that the sets of these classes are fundamental for the algebraic objects that are responsible for coloring diagrams of tangles on a given surface. For arcs, these algebraic objects are quandles; for regions, they are partial ternary quasigroups; for semiarcs, they are biquandloids; and for crossings, they are crossoids. The definitions of the last three algebraic structures are given in the paper.
  Additionally, we introduce the multicrossing complex of a tangle and define the crossing homology class. In a sense, the multicrossing complex unifies tribracket, biquandle and crossoid homologies; and the tribracket, biquandle and crossoid cycle invariants are actually the result of pairing a tribracket (biquangle, crossoid) cocycle with the crossing homology class.</description>

      <title>Homological dimension of discrete subgroups in higher rank Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we improve on a recent result by the authors. We show that infinite volume torsion free discrete subgroups of higher rank Lie groups have homological dimension gap at least one-eighth of the real rank, provided the injectivity radius of the quotient manifold is uniformly bounded from zero.</description>

      <title>The Forbidden Quiver of a Link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The forbidden moves in virtual knot theory can be used to unknot any knot, virtual or classical; however, multi-component crossings in links can still survive. Using the forbidden moves, we obtain a quiver-valued invariant of classical and virtual links we call the forbidden quiver and use it to obtain two polynomial invariants of virtual and classical links, the forbidden polynomials. Since these invariants are not sensitive to single-component crossing change, they are also link homotopy invariants.</description>

      <title>Comparing $h$-genera, Bridge-1 genera and Heegaard genera of knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $h(K)$, $g_H(K)$, $g_1(K)$, $t(K)$ be the $h$-genus, Heegaard genus, bridge-1 genus, tunnel number of a knot $K$ in the $3$-sphere $S^3$, respectively. It is known that $g_H(K)-1=t(K)\leq g_1(K)\leq h(K)\leq g_H(K)$. A natural question arises: when do these invariants become equal?
  We provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for equality and use these to show that for each integer $n\geq 1$, the following three families of knots are infinite:
  \begin{eqnarray}
  A_{n}=\{K\mid t(K)=n&lt;g_1(K)\},
  B_{n}=\{K\mid g_1(K)=n&lt;h(K)\},
  C_{n}=\{K\mid h(K)=n&lt;g_H(K)\}.
  \end{eqnarray} This result resolves a conjecture in \cite{Mo2}, confirming that each of these families is infinite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a simply connected stable plane with connected lines is isomorphic to an open subplane of a classical projective plane (i.e., a plane over the real or complex numbers, the quaternions or the octonions) if it has that property locally. We also give several examples indicating that our hypotheses cannot be relaxed much further.</description>

      <title>On virtual chirality of 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if a prime 3-manifold M is not finitely covered by the 3-sphere or a product manifold, then M is virtually chiral, i.e. it has a finite cover that does not admit an orientation reversing self-homeomorphism. In general if a 3-manifold contains a virtually chiral prime summand, then it is virtually chiral.</description>

      <title>Degree-1 maps and rank inequalities in Heegaard Floer homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ghosh-Sivek-Zentner constructed degree-1 maps from certain rational homology solid tori to the twisted $I$-bundle over the Klein bottle. We show that these maps yield rank inequalities for Heegaard Floer homology. To do so, we use Hanselman-Rasmussen-Watson's immersed curve interpretation of bordered Floer homology, extending their proof of a similar rank inequality corresponding to degree-1 maps to the solid torus. Our result provides further evidence for Kronheimer-Mowka's conjectured relationship between Heegaard Floer homology and instanton Floer homology.</description>

      <title>Bending parameterization of one-sided degenerated Kleinian surface groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently proved that quasi-Fuchsian manifolds are uniquely determined by their bending laminations. This paper concerns a similar result for certain non-quasi-Fuchsian manifolds~: those obtained by degenerating one end but not the other, i.e. those appearing in boundaries of Bers slices. More precisely, we show that such hyperbolic manifolds are uniquely determined by the end structure of the degenerated end and the bending lamination of the other. The end structure consists of the parabolic locus, which is a multicurve, together with ending laminations or conformal structures on each components of its complement.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds on the number of envy-free divisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze lower bounds for the number of envy-free divisions, in the classical Woodall-Stormquist setting and in a non-classical case, when envy-freeness is combined with the equipartition of a measure.
  1. In the first scenario, there are $r$ hungry players, and the cake (that is, the segment $[0,1]$) is cut into $r$ pieces. Then there exist at least two different envy-free divisions. This bound is sharp: for each $r$, we present an example of preferences such that there are exactly two envy-free divisions.
  2. In the second (hybrid) scenario, there are $p$ not necessarily hungry players ($p$ is a prime) and a continuous measure $\mu$ on $[0,1]$. The cake is cut into $2p-1$ pieces, the pieces are allocated to $p$ boxes (with some restrictions) and the players choose the boxes. Then there exists at least $\binom{2p-1}{p-1} \cdot 2^{1-p}$ envy-free divisions such that the measure $\mu$ is equidistributed among the players.</description>

      <title>On Simply Connected Quandles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide an alternative characterization of finite simply connected quandles involving only cocycles with values in abelian groups of prime size. As a corollary of such a characterization and the classification of connected quandles of size $p^2$ and $p^3$ we obtain a classification of simply connected quandles of size $p^2$ (already obtained with a different method in \cite{VV}) and $p^3$ for $p&gt;3$ using a method that works for quandles of size $p^n$ for arbitrary $n$. We also classify the simply connected quandles within two subclasses of finite involutory quandles: nilpotent latin quandles and core quandles.</description>

      <title>Wahl singularities in degenerations of del Pezzo surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any fixed $1 \leq \ell \leq 9$, we characterize all Wahl singularities that appear in degenerations of del Pezzo surfaces of degree $\ell$. This extends the work of Manetti and Hacking-Prokhorov in degree $9$, where Wahl singularities are classified using the Markov equation. To achieve this, we introduce del Pezzo Wahl chains with markings. They define marked del Pezzo surfaces $W_{*m}$ that govern all such degenerations. We also prove that every marked del Pezzo surface degenerates into a canonically defined toric del Pezzo surface with only T-singularities. In addition, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between the $W_{*m}$ surfaces and certain fake weighted projective planes. As applications, we show that every Wahl singularity occurs for del Pezzo surfaces of degree $\leq 4$, but that there are infinitely many Wahl singularities that do not arise for degrees $\geq 5$. We also use Hacking's exceptional collections to provide geometric proofs of recent results by Polishchuk and Rains on exceptional vector bundles on del Pezzo surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the 1970s, Williams developed an algorithm that has been used to construct and study modular links in the Lorenz template. We introduce an improved algorithm, which we call the bunch algorithm, to provide more insights into the geometry of modular links and Lorenz links. Using the machinery developed for the bunch algorithm, we provide the first upper volume bound that is independent of word exponents and quadratic in the braid index of the Lorenz link component for all modular link complements. We find families of modular knot complements with upper volume bounds that are linear in the braid index. A classification of modular link complements based on the relative magnitudes of word exponents is also presented.</description>

      <title>Jordan and Cartan spectra in higher rank with applications to correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a given $d$-tuple $\rho=(\rho_1,\dots,\rho_d):\Gamma \to G$ of faithful Zariski dense convex cocompact representations of a finitely generated group $\Gamma$, we study the correlations of length spectra $\{\ell_{\rho_i(\gamma)}\}_{[\gamma]\in[\Gamma]}$ and correlations of displacement spectra $\{\mathsf{d}(\rho_i(\gamma)o,o)\}_{\gamma\in\Gamma}$. We prove that for any interior vector $\mathsf v=(v_1,\dots,v_d)$ in the spectrum cone, there exists $\delta_\rho(\mathsf v) &gt; 0$ such that for any $\epsilon_1, \dots, \epsilon_d&gt;0$, there exist $c_1,c_2&gt; 0$ such that\begin{align*}&amp;\#\{[\gamma]\in [\Gamma]: v_iT \le \ell_{\rho_i(\gamma)} \le v_i T+\epsilon_i, \;1 \le i \le d\} \sim c_1 \frac{e^{\delta_\rho (\mathsf v)T}}{ T^{{(d+1)}/{2}}};\\&amp;\#\{\gamma\in \Gamma: v_iT \le \mathsf{d}(\rho_i(\gamma)o,o) \le v_i T+\epsilon_i, \;1 \le i \le d\} \sim c_2 \frac{e^{\delta_\rho (\mathsf v)T}}{ T^{{(d-1)}/{2}}}.\end{align*} The special case where $\Gamma$ is a surface group, $G=PSL_2(\mathbb R)$, and $\mathsf v=(1,1)$ was obtained by Schwarz and Sharp in 1993. We deduce this result as a special case of our main theorem on the distribution of Jordan projections with holonomies and Cartan projections in tubes of an Anosov subgroup $\Gamma$ of a semisimple real algebraic group $G$. We also show that the growth indicator of $\Gamma$ remains the same when we use Jordan projections instead of Cartan projections and tubes instead of cones.</description>

      <title>The Iwasawa invariants of $\mathbb{Z}_p^{\,d}$-covers of links</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03258v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number and let $d\in \mathbb{Z}_{&gt;0}$. In this paper, following the analogy between knots and primes, we study the $p$-torsion growth in a compatible system of $(\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z})^d$-covers of 3-manifolds and establish several analogues of Cuoco--Monsky's multivariable versions of Iwasawa's class number formula. Our main goal is to establish the Cuoco--Monsky type formula for branched covers of links in rational homology 3-spheres. In addition, we prove the precise formula over integral homology 3-spheres prompted by Greenberg's conjecture. We also derive results on reduced Alexander polynomials and on the Betti number periodicity. Furthermore, we investigate the twisted Whitehead links in $S^3$ and point out that the Iwasawa $\mu$-invariant of a $\mathbb{Z}_p^{\,2}$-cover can be an arbitrary non-negative integer. We also calculate the Iwasawa $\mu$ and $\lambda$-invariants of the Alexander polynomials of all links in Rolfsen's table.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a finite, 2-dimensional cell complex. The curvature invariants $\rho_\pm(X)$ and $\sigma_\pm(X)$ were defined in [13], and a programme of conjectures was outlined. Here, we prove the foundational result that the quantities $\rho_\pm(X)$ and $\sigma_\pm(X)$ are the extrema of explicit rational linear-programming problems. As a result they are rational, realised, and can be computed algorithmically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use new homotopy-theoretic tools to prove the existence of smooth $U(1)$- and $Sp(1)$-actions on infinite families of exotic spheres. Such families of spheres are propagated by the complex and quaternionic analogues of the Mahowald invariant (also known as the root invariant). In particular, we prove that the complex (respectively, quaternionic) Mahowald invariant takes an element of the $k$-th stable stem $\pi_k^s$ represented by a homotopy sphere $\Sigma^k$ to an element of a higher stable stem $\pi_{k+\ell}^s$ represented by another homotopy sphere $\Sigma^{k+\ell}$ equipped with a smooth $U(1)$- (respectively, $Sp(1)$-) action with fixed points the original homotopy sphere $\Sigma^k\subset \Sigma^{k+\ell}$.</description>

We construct a lamination $\lambda_\rho$ whose leaves are exactly the minimal hypersurfaces which are calibrated by every calibration in $\rho$. The geometry of $\lambda_\rho$ is closely related to the the geometry of the unit ball of the stable norm on $H_{d - 1}(M, \mathbb R)$, and so we deduce several results constraining the geometry of the stable norm ball in terms of the topology of $M$. These results establish a close analogy between the stable norm on $H_{d - 1}(M, \mathbb R)$ and the earthquake norm on the tangent space to Teichm\"uller space.</description>
