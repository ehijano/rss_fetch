      <title>Unveiling sex dimorphism in the healthy cardiac anatomy: fundamental differences between male and female heart shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sex-based differences in cardiovascular disease are well documented, yet the precise nature and extent of these discrepancies in cardiac anatomy remain incompletely understood. Traditional scaling models often fail to capture the interplay of age, blood pressure, and body size, prompting a more nuanced investigation. Here, we employ statistical shape modeling in a healthy subset (n=456) of the UK Biobank to explore sex-specific variations in biventricular anatomy. We reconstruct 3D meshes and perform multivariate analyses of shape coefficients, controlling for age, blood pressure, and various body size metrics. Our findings reveal that sex alone explains at least 25 percent of morphological variability, with strong discrimination between men and women (AUC=0.96-0.71) persisting even after correction for confounders. Notably, the most discriminative modes highlight pronounced differences in cardiac chamber volumes, the anterior-posterior width of the right ventricle, and the relative positioning of the cardiac chambers. These results underscore that sex has a fundamental influence on cardiac morphology, which may have important clinical implications for differing cardiac structural assessments in men and women. Future work should investigate how these anatomical differences manifest in various cardiovascular conditions, ultimately paving the way for more precise risk stratification and personalized therapeutic strategies for both men and women.</description>

      <title>Automated Retinal Layer and Fluid Segmentation and Cross-sectional Analysis using Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography Images for Diabetic Retinopathy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an AI-driven pipeline for automated retinal segmentation and thickness analysis in diabetic retinopathy (DR) using SD-OCT imaging. A deep neural network was trained to segment ten retinal layers, intra-retinal fluid, and hyperreflective foci (HRF), with performance evaluated across multiple architectures. SwinUNETR achieved the highest segmentation accuracy, while VM-Unet excelled in specific layers. Analysis revealed distinct thickness variations between NPDR and PDR, with correlations between layer thickness and visual acuity. The proposed method enhances DR assessment by reducing manual annotation effort and providing clinically relevant thickness maps for disease monitoring and treatment planning.</description>

      <title>How human-derived brain organoids are built differently from brain organoids derived from genetically-close relatives: A multi-scale hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08622</link>

Abstract: How genes affect tissue scale organization remains a longstanding biological puzzle. As experimental efforts aim to quantify gene expression, chromatin organization, cellular structure, and tissue structure, computational modeling lags behind. To address this gap, we merge a cellular-based tissue model with a nuclear model that includes a deformable lamina shell and chromatin to test multiscale hypotheses linking chromatin and tissue scales. We propose a multiscale hypothesis focusing on brain organoids to explain structural differences between brain organoids built from induced-pluripotent human stem cells and induced-pluripotent gorilla and chimpanzee cells. Recent experiments discover that a cell fate transition from neuroepithelial to radial glial cells includes a new intermediate state delayed in human organoids, which narrows and lengthens cells on the apical side. Experiments show that the transcription factor ZEB2 plays a major role in the emergence of this intermediate state with ZEB2 mRNA levels peaking. We postulate that the enhancement of ZEB2 expression is potentially due to chromatin reorganization in response to mechanical deformations of the nucleus. A larger critical mechanical strain triggers reorganization in human-derived stem cells, causing delayed ZEB2 upregulation compared with genetically close relatives. We test this by exploring how slightly different initial configurations of chromatin reorganize under applied strain, with greater representing less genetically-close relatives. We find that larger configuration discrepancies produce increased differences in the magnitude of chromatin displacement that rise faster than linearly yet slower than exponentially. Changes in chromatin strain and contact maps can reveal species-specific differences, aiding our understanding of how one species differs in structure from another.</description>
