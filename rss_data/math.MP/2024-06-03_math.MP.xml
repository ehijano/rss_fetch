      <title>Lecture on the combinatorial algebraic method for computing algebraic integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider an algebraic equation $P(x,y)=0$ where $P\in \mathbb C[x,y] $ (or $\mathbb F[x,y]$ with $\mathbb F\subset \mathbb C$ a subfield) is a bivariate polynomial, it defines a plane algebraic curve. We provide an efficient method for computing integrals of the type $ \int_\gamma R(x,y)dx $ where $R(x,y)\in \mathbb C(x,y) $ is any rational fraction, and $y$ is solution of $P(x,y)=0$, and $\gamma$ any Jordan arc open or closed on the plane algebraic curve. The method uses only algebraic and combinatorial manipulations, it rests on the combinatorics of the Newton's polygon. We illustrate it with many practical examples.</description>

      <title>A mathematical justification for nonlinear constitutive relations between stress and linearized strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an asymptotic framework that rigorously generates nonlinear constitutive relations between stress and linearized strain for elastic bodies. Each of these relations arises as the leading order relationship satisfied by a one-parameter family of nonlinear constitutive relations between stress and nonlinear strain. The asymptotic parameter limits the overall range of strains that satisfy the corresponding constitutive relation in the one-parameter family while the stresses can remain large (relative to a fixed stress scale). This differs from classical linearized elasticity where a fixed constitutive relation is assumed, and the magnitude of the displacement gradient serves as the asymptotic parameter. Also unlike classical approaches, the constitutive relations in our framework are expressed as implicit relationships between stress and strain rather than requiring stress explicitly expressed as a function of strain, adding conceptual simplicity and versatility. We demonstrate that our framework rigorously justifies nonlinear constitutive relations between stress and linearized strain including those with density-dependent Young's moduli or derived from strain energies beyond quadratic forms.</description>

      <title>Principle of structural analogy of solutions and its application to nonlinear PDEs and delay PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the principle of structural analogy of solutions, approaches have been developed for constructing exact solutions of complex nonlinear PDEs, including PDEs with delay, based on the use of special solutions to auxiliary simpler related equations. It is shown that to obtain exact solutions of nonlinear non-autonomous PDEs, the coefficients of which depend on time, it is possible to use generalized and functional separable solutions of simpler autonomous PDEs, the coefficients of which do not depend on time. Specific examples of constructing exact solutions to nonlinear PDEs, the coefficients of which depend arbitrarily on time, are considered. It has been discovered that generalized and functional separable solutions of nonlinear PDEs with constant delay can be used to construct exact solutions of more complex nonlinear PDEs with variable delay of general form. A number of nonlinear reaction-diffusion type PDEs with variable delay are described, which allow exact solutions with generalized separation of variables.</description>

      <title>Statistical signatures of quantum contextuality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum contextuality describes situations where the statistics observed in different measurement contexts cannot be explained by a measurement independent reality of the system. The most simple case is observed in a three-dimensional Hilbert space, with five different measurement contexts related to each other by shared measurement outcomes. The quantum formalism defines the relations between these contexts in terms of well-defined relations between operators, and these relations can be used to reconstruct an unknown quantum state from a finite set of measurement results. Here, I introduce a reconstruction method based on the relations between the five measurement contexts that can violate the bounds of non-contextual statistics. A complete description of an arbitrary quantum state requires only five of the eight elements of a Kirkwood-Dirac quasi probability, but only an overcomplete set of eleven elements provides an unbiased description of all five contexts. A set of five fundamental relations between the eleven elements reveals a deterministic structure that links the five contexts. As illustrated by a number of examples, these relations provide a consistent description of contextual realities for the measurement outcomes of all five contexts.</description>

      <title>Upscaled equations for the Fokker-Planck diffusion through arrays of permeable and of impermeable inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Fokker-Planck diffusion equation with diffusion coefficient depending periodically on the space variable. Inside a periodic array of inclusions the diffusion coefficient is reduced by a factor called the diffusion magnitude. We find the upscaled equations obtained by taking both the degeneration and the homogenization limits in which the diffusion magnitude and the scale of the periodicity tends, respectively, to zero. Different behaviors, classified as pure diffusion, diffusion with mass deposition, and absence of diffusion, are found depending on the order in which the two limits are taken and on the ratio between the size of the inclusions and the scale of the periodicity.</description>

      <title>Modulation theory of soliton-mean flow in KdV equation with box type initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the KdV equation with box type initial data, the interaction between a trial soliton and large-scale dispersive mean flow is studied theoretically and numerically. The pure box initial value can cause rarefaction wave and dispersive shock wave, and can create an area of soliton train. The key to the interaction of soliton and mean flow is that the dynamic evolutions of the mean flow and the local soliton can be described by the same modulation system. The soliton modulation system is derived from the degenerations of the two-genus Whitham modulation system. Considering the influence of rarefaction wave, dispersive shock wave and soliton train on the trial soliton, in the framework of Whitham modulation theory, the equation describing the soliton trajectory and the changes in amplitude and phase shift are given explicitly. The predicted results are compared with the numerical simulations, which verifies the corrections of the theoretical analysis. The exotic interaction phenomena between soliton and mean flow found in this work have broad applications to shallow water soliton propagations and real soliton experiments in fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>On alternative formulations of the thermodynamics of scalar-tensor theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore alternative formulations of the analogy between viable Horndeski gravity and Eckart's first-order thermodynamics. We single out a class of identifications for the effective stress-energy tensor of the scalar field fluid that, upon performing the imperfect fluid decomposition, yields constitutive relations that can be mapped onto Eckart's theory. We then investigate how different couplings to Einstein's gravity, at the level of the field equations, can affect the thermodynamic formalism overall. Lastly, we specialise the discussion to the case of ``traditional'' scalar-tensor theories and identify a specific choice of the coupling function that leads to a significant simplification of the formalism.</description>

      <title>Finite-size spectrum of the staggered six-vertex model with antidiagonal boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The finite-size spectrum of the critical staggered six-vertex model with antidiagonal boundary conditions is studied. Similar to the case of periodic boundary conditions, we identify three different phases. In two of those, the underlying conformal field theory can be identified to be related to the twisted $U(1)$ Kac-Moody algebra. In contrast, the finite size scaling in the third regime, whose critical behaviour with the quasi-periodic BCs is described by the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})_k/U(1)$ black hole CFT possessing a non-compact degree of freedom, is more subtle. Here with antidiagonal BCs imposed, the corrections to the scaling of the ground state grow logarithmically with the system size, while the energy gaps appear to close logarithmically. Moreover, we obtain an explicit formula for the Q-operator which is useful for numerical implementation.</description>

      <title>Number of distinct and common sites visited by $N$ independent random walkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this Chapter, we consider a model of $N$ independent random walkers, each of duration $t$, and each starting from the origin, on a lattice in $d$ dimensions. We focus on two observables, namely $D_N(t)$ and $C_N(t)$ denoting respectively the number of distinct and common sites visited by the walkers. For large $t$, where the lattice random walkers converge to independent Brownian motions, we compute exactly the mean $\langle D_N(t) \rangle$ and $\langle C_N(t) \rangle$. Our main interest is on the $N$-dependence of these quantities. While for $\langle D_N(t) \rangle$ the $N$-dependence only appears in the prefactor of the power-law growth with time, a more interesting behavior emerges for $\langle C_N(t) \rangle$. For this latter case, we show that there is a ``phase transition'' in the $(N, d)$ plane where the two critical line $d=2$ and $d=d_c(N) = 2N/(N-1)$ separate three phases of the growth of $\langle C_N(t)\rangle$. The results are extended to the mean number of sites visited exactly by $K$ of the $N$ walkers. Furthermore in $d=1$, the full distribution of $D_N(t)$ and $C_N(t)$ are computed, exploiting a mapping to the extreme value statistics. Extensions to two other models, namely $N$ independent Brownian bridges and $N$ independent resetting Brownian motions/bridges are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.21017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply reinforcement learning (RL) to generate fine regular star triangulations of reflexive polytopes, that give rise to smooth Calabi-Yau (CY) hypersurfaces. We demonstrate that, by simple modifications to the data encoding and reward function, one can search for CYs that satisfy a set of desirable string compactification conditions. For instance, we show that our RL algorithm can generate triangulations together with holomorphic vector bundles that satisfy anomaly cancellation and poly-stability conditions in heterotic compactification. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm can be used to search for reflexive subpolytopes together with compatible triangulations that define fibration structures of the CYs.</description>

Abstract: Generalized Large deviation principles was developed for Colombeau-Ito SDE with a random coefficients. We is significantly expand the classical theory of large deviations for randomly perturbed dynamical systems developed by Freidlin and Wentzell.Using SLDP approach, jumps phenomena, in financial markets, also is considered. Jumps phenomena, in financial markets is explained from the first principles, without any reference to Poisson jump process. In contrast with a phenomenological approach we explain such jumps phenomena from the first principles, without any reference to Poisson jump process.</description>

Abstract: We study the Hessian geometry associated with an ideal gas in a spherical centrifuge. According to Souriau, a spherically confined ideal gas admit states of thermal and rotational equilibrium. These states, called Gibbs states, form an exponential family with an action of the Euclidean rotation group. We investigate its Hessian (Fisher-Rao) geometry and show that in the high angular velocity limit, the geometry can be compared to the Hessian geometry of a spherical rigid body which we show to be isometric to a hyperbolic space.</description>

      <title>Uniform Spanning Tree in Topological Polygons, Partition Functions for SLE(8), and Correlations in $c=-2$ Logarithmic CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.04421v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find explicit SLE(8) partition functions for the scaling limits of Peano curves in the uniform spanning tree (UST) in topological polygons with general boundary conditions. They are given in terms of Coulomb gas integral formulas, which can also be expressed in terms of determinants involving a-periods of a hyperelliptic Riemann surface. We also identify the crossing probabilities for the UST Peano curves as ratios of these partition functions. The partition functions are interpreted as correlation functions in a logarithmic conformal field theory (log-CFT) of central charge $c= -2$. Indeed, it is clear from our results that this theory is not a minimal model and exhibits logarithmic phenomena -- the limit functions have logarithmic asymptotic behavior, that we calculate explicitly. General fusion rules for them could also be inferred from the explicit formulas. The discovered algebraic structure matches the known Virasoro staggered module classification, so in this sense, we give a direct probabilistic construction for correlation functions in a log-CFT of central charge $-2$ describing the UST model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.08800v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find the scaling limits of a general class of boundary-to-boundary connection probabilities and multiple interfaces in the critical planar FK-Ising model, thus verifying predictions from the physics literature. We also discuss conjectural formulas using Coulomb gas integrals for the corresponding quantities in general critical planar random-cluster models with cluster-weight $q \in [1,4)$. Thus far, proofs for convergence, including ours, rely on discrete complex analysis techniques and are beyond reach for other values of $q$ than the FK-Ising model ($q=2$). Given the convergence of interfaces, the conjectural formulas for other values of $q$ could be verified similarly with relatively minor technical work. The limit interfaces are variants of $\mathrm{SLE}_\kappa$ curves (with $\kappa = 16/3$ for $q=2$). Their partition functions, that give the connection probabilities, also satisfy properties predicted for correlation functions in conformal field theory (CFT), expected to describe scaling limits of critical random-cluster models. We verify these properties for all $q \in [1,4)$, thus providing further evidence of the expected CFT description of these models.</description>

      <title>Exact time-evolving scattering states in open quantum-dot systems with an interaction: Discovery of time-evolving resonant states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study exact time-evolving many-electron states of an open double quantum-dot system with an interdot Coulomb interaction. A systematic construction of the time-evolving states for arbitrary initial conditions is proposed. For any initial states of one- and two-electron plane waves on the electrical leads, we obtain exact solutions of the time-evolving scattering states, which converge to known stationary scattering eigenstates in the long-time limit. For any initial states of localized electrons on the quantum dots, we find exact time-evolving states of a new type, which we refer to as time-evolving resonant states. In contrast to stationary resonant states, whose wave functions spatially diverge and not normalizable, the time-evolving resonant states are normalizable since their wave functions are restricted to a finite space interval due to causality. The exact time-evolving resonant states enable us to calculate the time-dependence of the survival probability of electrons on the quantum dots for the system with the linearized dispersions. It decays exponentially in time on one side of an exponential point of resonance energies while, on the other side, it oscillates during the decay as a result of the interference of the two resonance energies.</description>

Abstract: Recently, we performed a two $\beta$-ensemble realization of the series of $\beta$-deformed WLZZ matrix models involving $\beta$-deformed Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber integrals. The realization was derived and studied by using Ward identities, which do not allow one to fix integration contours, these latter were chosen to be real axis for one $\beta$-ensemble and imaginary axis for the other one basing on some particular checks. Here, we evaluate the $\beta$-ensemble integrals directly using a conjecture by I.G. Macdonald, and explain that another choice of integration contours is also possible.</description>
