      <title>Evaluation of tetracycline photocatalytic degradation using NiFe2O4/CeO2/GO nanocomposite for environmental remediation: In silico molecular docking, Antibacterial performance, degradation pathways, and DFT calculations</title>

Abstract: Graphene-based nanostructures with distinct structural and physicochemical characteristics may be able to photodegrade antibiotics effectively. Herein, this study reports the successful synthesis of NiFe2O4/CeO2/GO nanocomposite (NC) by anchoring NiFe2O4/CeO2 to the surface of GO (Graphene oxide). All state-of-the-art characterization techniques investigated the nanostructure, crystallinity, phonon modes, chemical composition analysis, elemental composition, surface area, magnetic properties, and optical band gap. Hydrothermal approach assisted NiFe2O4/CeO2/GO catalyst showed better charge carrier separation and prompted the tetracycline (TC-HCl) photocatalytic degradation under visible light. Following 90 minutes of exposure to visible light, NiFe2O4/CeO2/GO nanocomposite demonstrated superior photocatalytic activity, with a TC-HCl degradation rate of 95%. Reasonable mechanisms of tetracycline degradation were proposed where the OH and O played a leading role based on identified intermediates. Moreover, tetracycline photodegradation intermediates and the optimal pathway were identified using LC-MS spectrometry. This study also performed Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations for the prepared materials to validate the experimental data. In vitro, antibacterial studies were consistent with the molecular docking investigations of the NiFe2O4/CeO2/GO nanocomposite against DNA gyrase and FabI from Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S.aureus). Lastly, the outcomes revealed a new potential for NiFe2O4/CeO2/GO nanocomposite for improved photocatalytic performance, making it a promising photocatalyst for wastewater treatment.</description>

      <title>Machine Learned Force Fields: Fundamentals, its reach, and challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly accurate force fields are a mandatory requirement to generate predictive simulations. In this regard, Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a revolutionary approach in computational chemistry and materials science, combining the accuracy of quantum mechanical methods with computational efficiency orders of magnitude superior to ab-initio methods. This chapter provides an introduction of the fundamentals of learning and how it is applied to construct MLFFs, detailing key methodologies such as neural network potentials and kernel-based models. Emphasis is placed on the construction of SchNet model, as one of the most elemental neural network-based force fields that are nowadays the basis of modern architectures. Additionally, the GDML framework is described in detail as an example of how the elegant formulation of kernel methods can be used to construct mathematically robust and physics-inspired MLFFs. The ongoing advancements in MLFF development continue to expand their applicability, enabling precise simulations of large and complex systems that were previously beyond reach. This chapter concludes by highlighting the transformative impact of MLFFs on scientific research, underscoring their role in driving future discoveries in the fields of chemistry, physics, and materials science.</description>

      <title>Tensor Learning and Compression of N-phonon Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonon interactions from lattice anharmonicity govern thermal properties and heat transport in materials. These interactions are described by $n$-th order interatomic force constants ($n$-IFCs), which can be viewed as high-dimensional tensors correlating the motion of $n$ atoms, or equivalently encoding $n$-phonon scattering processes in momentum space. Here, we introduce a tensor decomposition to efficiently compress $n$-IFCs for arbitrary order $n$. Using tensor learning, we find optimal low-rank approximations of $n$-IFCs by solving the resulting optimization problem.Our approach reveals the inherent low dimensionality of phonon-phonon interactions and allows compression of the 3 and 4-IFC tensors by factors of up to $10^3-10^4$ while retaining high accuracy in calculations of phonon scattering rates and thermal conductivity. Calculations of thermal conductivity using the compressed $n$-IFCs achieve a speed-up by nearly three orders of magnitude with &gt;98\% accuracy relative to the reference uncompressed solution. These calculations include both 3- and 4-phonon scattering and are shown for a diverse range of materials (Si, HgTe, MgO, and TiNiSn). In addition to accelerating state-of-the-art thermal transport calculations, the method shown here paves the way for modeling strongly anharmonic materials and higher-order phonon interactions.</description>

      <title>Analytical shear-band process zone model incorporating nonlinear viscous effects and initial defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental, theoretical, and numerical studies of adiabatic shear in ductile metals suggest initial defects such as pores or material imperfections increase shear-band susceptibility. Conversely, viscous effects manifesting macroscopically as strain-rate sensitivity inhibit localization. The analytical shear-band process zone model due to D.E. Grady, in turn based on a rigid-plastic solution for stress release by N.F. Mott, is advanced to account for these phenomena. The material contains an average defect measure (e.g., porosity) and a concentrated defect measure at a spatial location where shear banding is most likely to initiate after an instability threshold is attained. Shearing resistance and certain physical properties are reduced commensurately with local defect concentration. Non-Newtonian viscosity increases dissipative resistance. Viscous dissipation, if strong enough, is shown to prevent an infinitesimal-width shear band even in a non-conductor. Here, a pseudo-quadratic viscosity widens the band similarly to heat conduction, and akin to quadratic shock viscosity often used to resolve widths of planar shock waves. The model captures simulation data showing reduced localization strain and shear band width with increasing maximum initial pore size in additively manufactured titanium and HY-100 steel. Predictions for shear band width, local strain, and temperature are more accurate versus data on steel than prior analytical modeling. A quantitative framework is established by which processing defects can be related to shear-banding characteristics.</description>

      <title>Temperature-driven structural phase transitions in SmNiO3: insights from deep potential molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metal-insulator transition (MIT) in rare-earth nickelates exemplifies the intricate interplay between electronic correlations and lattice dynamics in quantum materials. This work focuses on SmNiO3 as a prototypical system, employing molecular dynamics simulations based on a "hidden" magnetic potential model. Our simulations reveal two key findings. First, the structural phase transition in SmNiO3 is intrinsically temperature-driven and occurs spontaneously via collective lattice distortions. Moreover, systematic high-pressure simulations demonstrate a distinct pressure dependence of the transition temperature, which decreases monotonically with increasing external hydrostatic pressure. These results provide atomistic insights into the cooperative mechanisms underlying the MIT and the interplay between structural distortions and electron correlation effects. The computational approach developed herein offers a generalizable framework for investigating complex phase transitions in correlated quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Highly Entangled Magnetodielectric and Magnetostriction effects, and Spin-Phonon coupling in the Antiferromagnetic Ni$_2$ScSbO$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic systems with noncentrosymmetric crystal structures are renowned for their complex magnetic ordering and diverse and fascinating physical properties. In this report, we provide a comprehensive study of the chiral magnetic system Ni$_2$ScSbO$_6$, which exhibits a robust incommensurate long-range antiferromagnetic spin ordering at a temperature of $T_N = 62$~K, as revealed by bulk magnetization, specific heat, and neutron diffraction studies. This magnetic ordering triggers a series of intriguing phenomena, including prominent magnetodielectric coupling manifested by a dielectric peak at $T_N$, significant spin-phonon coupling resulting in strong phonon renormalization characterized by anomalous softening of various Raman modes, and a remarkable volume magnetostriction effect probed by high-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction. These phenomena are intricately interlinked, positioning the present system as a rare and interesting material.</description>

      <title>Controllable and Continuous Quantum Phase Transitions in Intrinsic Magnetic Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic magnetic topological material MnBi2Te4 has demonstrated great potential to investigate the interplay between topology and magnetism, which opens up new avenues for manipulating non-trivial electronic states and designing quantum devices. However, challenges and controversies remain due to its inevitable n-type antisite defects, hindering the experimental realization of intrinsic magnetic topological phenomena and rendering the precise control of topological phase transitions (TPTs) unachievable. Here, we study a candidate material family, Mn(1-x)GexBi2Te4, in which the heavy n-type doping features are strongly suppressed when the Ge content reaches 0.46, and multiple topological phases are well maintained with the surface Dirac point located near the Fermi level. Based on angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, transport measurements, and first-principles calculations, we reveal two magnetism-induced TPTs: the first is antiferromagnetic-ordering-induced transition from strong topological insulator to a magnetic topological insulator as revealed by gap opening of topological surface states; the second is external-magnetic-field-dependent transition from magnetic topological insulator to a Weyl semimetal with the gap reclosed. Our work paves the way for the realization of intrinsic magnetic topological states in MnBi2Te4 family and provides an ideal platform for achieving controllable and continuous TPTs towards future spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Analysis of Graphite Electrode Aging Through X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aging limits commercial lithium-ion battery lifetime and must be understood at the level of active materials to improve both cell durability and performance. We show that in state-of-the-art technologies such as graphite/LiFePO4-Li(NiCoAl)O2 cells, degradation mostly arises at the negative electrode side due to both loss of active material and cyclable lithium. The characteristics of these phenomena are unraveled by applying a multi-technique workflow in which electrochemical, structural, and morphological analyses are combined. Series of post mortem, ex situ and operando experiments performed on aged materials dismounted from a large format cell at its end-of-life are benchmarked against pristine materials to highlight how in-plane and through-plane heterogeneities in graphite dynamics are profoundly modified in nature and exacerbated by aging. We discover inactive regions, where pure graphite or lithiated phases (LixC6) are invariant on cycling. They correspond to particles either disconnected (irreversibly lost) or kinetically-limited (reactivated at a very slow C-rate). As we map their distribution in 2D during battery cycling, we observe that LixC6-inactivity is heterogeneously distributed in the depth of the aged negative electrode and depends on both the x value and the C-rate. In particular, the negative electrode-separator interface is much more inactivated after long-term usage. Inactivity is correlated with an overall increased spatial heterogeneity of lithium concentration. This work suggests that the origin of aging lies in overworking graphite close to the separator.</description>

      <title>Improper Ferroelectricity at the Monolayer Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrathin ferroelectric films with out-of-plane polarization and high Curie temperatures are key to miniaturizing electronic devices. Most ferroelectrics employed in devices are proper ferroelectrics, where spontaneous polarization is the primary order parameter. Unfortunately, the Curie temperature of proper ferroelectrics is drastically reduced as the ferroelectric becomes thin; nearly all proper ferroelectrics need to be thicker than several unit cells. The absence of an ultrathin limit has been predicted, but not verified for improper ferroelectrics. These are ferroelectrics where the polarization emerges secondary to the primary order parameter, such as a structural distortion. Here we report improper ferroelectricity with an undiminished Curie temperature in a 0.75-unit-cell-thick hexagonal LuFeO3 (h-LuFeO3) film grown on a SrCo2Ru4O11 bottom electrode with an atomically engineered monolayer bridging layer. Our results demonstrate the absence of a critical thickness for improper ferroelectricity and provide a methodology for creating ultrathin improper ferroelectrics by stabilizing their primary order parameters.</description>

      <title>Single Atom Catalysts with Halogen Ligands: Elevating the HER Performance of Pd-anchored MoS2 monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted ever-growing interest due to their high atom-utilization efficiency and potential for cost-effective of hydrogen production. However, enhancing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance remains a key challenge in developing SACs for HER technology. Herein, we employed first-principles calculations in conjunction with the climbing-image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method to explore the effect of surface ligands (F, Cl, Br, I) on the HER performance and mechanism of single-atom (Pd or Cu)-anchored MoS2 monolayer. The results indicate that the relative Gibbs free energy for the adsorbed hydrogen atom in the I-Pd@MoS2 system is an exceptionally low value of -0.13 eV, which is not only comparable to that of Pt-based catalysts but also significantly more favorable than the calculated 0.84 eV for Pd@MoS2. However, the introduction of ligands to Cu@MoS2 deteriorates HER performance due to strong coupling between the absorbed H and ligands. It reveals that the ligand I restructures the local chemical microenvironment surrounding the SAC Pd, leading to impurity bands near the Fermi level that couple favorably with the s states of H atoms, yielding numerous highly active sites to enhance catalytic performance. Furthermore, the CI-NEB method elucidates that the enhanced HER mechanism for the I-Pd@MoS2 catalyst should belong to the coexistence of the Volmer-Tafel and Volmer-Heyrovsky reactions. This investigation provides a valuable framework for the experimental design and development of innovative single-atom catalysts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contribution of flexoelectric coupling to the long-range order parameter fluctuations in ferroics can be critically important to the ferron dispersion and related polar, pyroelectric and electrocaloric properties. Here we calculate analytically the dispersion relations of soft optic and acoustic "flexo-phonons" and "flexo-ferrons" by incorporating the flexoelectric coupling, damping, and higher elastic gradients in the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire free energy functional using the van der Waals uniaxial ferrielectric CuInP2S6 as an example. We analyze the changes in the flexo-phonon and flexo-ferron spectra arising from the appearance of spatially modulated phases induced by the flexoelectric coupling. We show that the free energy landscape of CuInP2S6 determines the specific features of its phonon spectra and ferron dispersion. We also discuss the contributions of optic and acoustic flexo-ferrons to the pyroelectric and electrocaloric responses of CuInP2S6 at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Charge-Density-Wave Oscillator Networks for Solving Combinatorial Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many combinatorial optimization problems fall into the non-polynomial time NP-hard complexity class, characterized by computational demands that increase exponentially with the size of the problem in the worst case. Solving large-scale combinatorial optimization problems efficiently requires novel hardware solutions beyond the conventional von Neumann architecture. We propose an approach for solving a type of NP-hard problem based on coupled oscillator networks implemented with charge-density-wave condensate devices. Our prototype hardware, based on the 1T polymorph of TaS2, reveals the switching between the charge-density-wave electron-phonon condensate phases, enabling room-temperature operation of the network. The oscillator operation relies on hysteresis in current-voltage characteristics and bistability triggered by applied electrical bias. This work presents a network of injection-locked, coupled oscillators whose phase dynamics follow the Kuramoto model and demonstrates that such coupled quantum oscillators naturally evolve to a ground state capable of solving combinatorial optimization problems. The coupled oscillators based on charge-density-wave condensate phases can efficiently solve NP-hard Max-Cut benchmark problems, offering advantages over other leading oscillator-based approaches. The nature of the transitions between the charge-density-wave phases, distinctively different from resistive switching, creates the potential for low-power operation and compatibility with conventional Si technology.</description>

Abstract: The study of topological band theory in classical structures has led to the development of novel topological metamaterials with intriguing properties. While single-gap topologies are well understood, recent novel multi-gap phases have garnished increasing interest. These novel phases are characterized by invariants, such as the Euler and second Stiefel-Whitney classes, which involve Bloch eigen-subspaces of multiple bands and can change by braiding in momentum space non-Abelian charged band degeneracies belonging to adjacent energy gaps. Here, we theoretically predict and experimentally demonstrate that two of such topological phases can coexist within a single system using vectorial elastic waves. The inherent coupling between different polarization modes enables non-Abelian braiding of nodal points of multiple energy band gaps and results in coexisting Euler and Stiefel-Whitney topological insulator phases. We furthermore unveil the central role played by the topologically stable Goldstone modes' degeneracy. Our findings represent the first realization of hybrid phases in vectorial fields exhibiting topologically nontrivial Goldstone modes, paving the way for bifunctional applications that leverage the coexistence of topological edge and corner states.</description>

      <title>Surface Orientation-dependent Corrosion Behavior of NiCr Alloys in Molten FLiNaK Salt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The corrosion behavior of NiCr alloys in molten FLiNaK salt is governed by complex Cr-F chemical interactions, necessitating a fundamental understanding for enhancing alloy performance in harsh environments. However, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the dynamic atomic-scale processes driving the progression of molten salt corrosion. This study employs reactive force field-based molecular dynamics simulations to unravel the influence of crystallographic orientation, temperature, and external electric fields on corrosion kinetics. The (100), (110), and (111) orientations of Ni$\mathrm{_{0.75}}$Cr$\mathrm{_{0.25}}$ alloys are evaluated at temperatures from 600 to 800{\deg}C, with and without electric fields. Results reveal that Cr dissolution and near-surface diffusion drive pitting-like surface morphology evolution. The (110) surface shows the highest corrosion susceptibility, while the (100) and (111) surfaces exhibit greater resistance, with (111) being the most stable. The corrosion activation energy, derived from the Arrhenius relation, ranges from 0.27 eV to 0.41 eV, aligning well with limited experimental data yet significantly lower than bulk diffusion barriers. This finding indicates that corrosion progression is primarily a kinetically controlled near-surface process, rather than being limited by bulk diffusion as suggested in previous understanding. Additionally, electric fields perpendicular to the interface are found to asymmetrically modulate corrosion dynamics, where a positive field (+0.10 V/{\AA}) promotes Cr dissolution. In comparison, a negative field (-0.10 V/{\AA}) largely suppresses corrosion, which can be effectively used to mitigate corrosion. These findings, along with atomistic details into the corrosion mechanisms, offer strategic perspectives for designing corrosion-resistant materials in advanced high-temperature molten salt applications.</description>

      <title>LLM-Feynman: Leveraging Large Language Models for Universal Scientific Formula and Theory Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distilling the underlying principles from data has long propelled scientific breakthroughs. However, conventional data-driven machine learning -- lacking deep, contextual domain knowledge -- tend to yield opaque or over-complex models that are challenging to interpret and generalize. Here, we present LLM-Feynman, a framework that leverages the embedded expertise of large language models (LLMs) with systematic optimization to distill concise, interpretable formula from data and domain knowledge. Our framework seamlessly integrates automated feature engineering, LLM-based symbolic regression augmented by self-evaluation and iterative refinement, and formula interpretation via Monte Carlo tree search. Ablation studies show that incorporating domain knowledge and self-evaluation yields more accurate formula at equivalent formula complexity than conventional symbolic regression. Validation on datasets from Feynman physics lectures confirms that LLM-Feynman can rediscover over 90% real physical formulas. Moreover, when applied to four key materials science tasks -- from classifying the synthesizability of 2D and perovskite structures to predicting ionic conductivity in lithium solid-state electrolytes and GW bandgaps in 2D materials -- LLM-Feynman consistently yields interpretable formula with accuracy exceeding 90% and R2 values above 0.8. By transcending mere data fitting through the integration of deep domain knowledge, LLM-Feynman establishes a new paradigm for the automated discovery of generalizable scientific formula and theory across disciplines.</description>

Abstract: The technological world is in search of environmentally friendly methods of generating energy for the use of the ever growing needs of power for sustainable development of visually all facet of life. Solar energy form an environmentally friendly solution for the reduction of global warming. For usage in photovoltaic applications, this work explores the production and characterisation of nanostructured cobalt sulphide (CoS) doped with dysprosium (Dy), a rare earth element. In order to increase CoS's efficiency in solar energy conversion, rare earth doping is used to improve its optical, electrical, and structural characteristics. To maximize performance, precise Dy doping doses were used in the electrochemical synthesis of the nanomaterials. UV-visible spectroscopy were among the characterization methods used to examine the optical and structural characteristics of the doped CoS nanomaterials. Significant alterations in the bandgap and optical absorption behavior are shown by the results, indicating that Dy-Doped CoS nanostructures hold great promise for enhanced photovoltaic performance. This study opens the door for the use of Dy-doped CoS in renewable energy technologies by demonstrating their viability as prospective materials for next-generation solar cells.</description>

      <title>Comparative high-pressure structural and electrical transport properties study of thermoelectric (Bi1-xSbx)2Te3 compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectric (Bi1-x Sbx)2Te3 (BST-x) compounds with x=0.2, 0.7 and 0.9 have been studied using synchrotron angle-dispersive powder x-ray diffraction in a diamond anvil cell up to 25 GPa (at room temperature). The results clearly indicate that all compounds of this study follow a similar structural evolution with the one of pure Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3 under pressure. From the comparison between the critical pressures of the corresponding phase transitions, a clear trend of increasing critical pressure for the transition to the disordered solid-solution BCC phase was observed with the increase of Sb concentration. In the case of the BST-0.7, an extended stability of the solid-solution BCC phase up to, at least, 180 GPa was observed. Finally, electrical transport properties measurements under pressure for BST-0.7, document a reversible pressure-induced metallization above 12 GPa.</description>

      <title>Antiferroelectric switching inside ferroelastic domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelastic materials (materials with switchable spontaneous strain) often are centrosymmetric, but their domain walls are always polar, as their internal strain gradients cause polarization via flexoelectricity. This polarization is generally not switchable by an external electric field, because reversing the domain wall polarity would require reversing the strain gradient, which in turn would require switching the spontaneous strain of the adjacent domains, destroying the domain wall in the process. However, domain wall polarization can also arise from biquadratic coupling between polar and non-polar order parameters (e.g. octahedral tilts in perovskites). Such coupling is independent of the sign of the polarization and thus allows switching between +P and -P. In this work, we seek to answer the question of whether the polarization of domain walls in ferroelastic perovskites is switchable, as per the symmetric biquadratic term, or non-switchable due to the unipolar flexoelectric bias. Using perovskite calcium titanate (CaTiO3) as a paradigm, molecular dynamics calculations indicate that high electric fields broaden the ferroelastic domain walls, thereby reducing flexoelectricity (as the domain wall strain gradient is inversely proportional to the wall width), eventually enabling switching. The polarization switching, however, is not ferroelectric-like with a simple hysteresis loop, but antiferroelectric-like with a double hysteresis loop. Ferroelastic domain walls thus behave as functional antiferroelectric elements, and also as nucleation points for a bulk phase transition to a polar state.</description>

      <title>Energy-efficient antiferromagnetic skyrmion creation and its dynamics in structure-dependent magneto-elastic coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing skyrmion nucleation methods lead to increased Joule heating, limiting the applicability to metallic Antiferromagnetic (AFM) systems. In this study, we propose a novel, energy-efficient mechanical method for nucleating AFM skyrmions using Surface Acoustic Waves (SAWs). SAWs, which propagate along material surfaces with minimal attenuation, generate dynamic strain that induces a spatially varying torque on magnetic spins, offering a viable alternative to traditional current-based methods. Using the Thiele approach we investigate skyrmion dynamics in special AFMs, NiO-like or CoO-like, incorporating a magnetoelastic term that accounts for the unique spin arrangements, where spins align oppositely within parallel planes. Our findings reveal that the deformation induced by SAWs, influenced by the magnetostriction of materials like NiO and CoO, can modify the spin configuration, consequently, alters the skyrmion dynamics. This study not only demonstrates the potential of SAWs for efficient skyrmion nucleation in AFMs but also introduces new theoretical insights into specific magnetoelastic-induced skyrmion dynamics in AFM systems.</description>

      <title>Handedness selection and hysteresis of chiral orders in crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A phase transition can drive the spontaneous emergence of chiral orders in crystals below a critical temperature. However, selecting either a right- or a left-handed phase with the aid of electromagnetic fields is challenging, particularly when intrinsic polar and axial moments are lacking. In this work we show that \textit{purely} chiral phases with opposite handedness, when both deriving from one degenerate instability, are linked by accessible transition states. While these states compete with the chirality under an electromagnetic field, a circularly polarized source can select the handedness of the system. This selection is mediated by a chiral monopole and may further result in a hysteresis process of the gyrotropic properties, namely the optical activity, below the critical temperature. We suggest several materials, among which K$_3$NiO$_2$, as candidates for possible experimental observation.</description>

      <title>Occurrence of chemically tuned spin-texture controlled large intrinsic anomalous Hall effect in epitaxial $Mn_{3+x}Pt_{1-x}$ thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving atomically flat and stoichiometric films of chiral antiferromagnets (AFM) with two-dimensional kagome spin lattice structures are crucial for integrating these materials in both established and emerging antiferromagnetic spintronic devices. We report a systematic study of growth and anomalous Hall effect in (111)-oriented non-collinear AFM $Mn_{3+x}Pt_{1-x}$ films with varying compositions, for x = 0.09, 0.17, 0.28. Under optimized growth conditions, we obtain stoichiometric and atomically flat epitaxial $Mn_{3}Pt$(111) films on Si(100) substrate, as evidenced by X-ray reflectivity and scanning probe microscopy. The magnetization measurement showed that epitaxial strain can induce a magnetic phase transition from an incommensurate spin state ($T_2$) at x = 0.09 to a triangular all-in/all-out AFM spin order ($T_1$) at x = 0.17, 0.28. The change in magnetic ground state is evident in the transport characteristics, as the ($T_1$) state shows a robust intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) persisting till room temperature, in contrast to the ($T_2$) state where AHE is negligible. Our studies reveal a hole-dominated conductance with room temperature anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) ranging from 5 to 16 $\Omega^{-1}cm^{-1}$ for x = 0.17 and 0.28 respectively. A scaling law is established, indicating that Hall resistivity is primarily governed by the intrinsic non-vanishing Berry curvature. The experimental observation corroborates the electronic structure calculations, which predicts the massless Dirac states near Fermi level in the bulk band structure, attributed to the presence of nonsymorphic glide symmetry. Additionally, we showed that chemical tuning via Mn doping can stabilize the required T$_1$ non-collinear AFM structure which enhance the topology driven intrinsic AHE.</description>

      <title>Conditional Generative Modeling for Amorphous Multi-Element Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amorphous multi-element materials offer unprecedented tunability in composition and properties, yet their rational design remains challenging due to the lack of predictive structure-property relationships and the vast configurational space. Traditional modeling struggles to capture the intricate short-range order that dictates their stability and functionality. We here introduce ApolloX, a pioneering predictive framework for amorphous multi-element materials, establishing a new paradigm by integrating physics-informed generative modeling with particle swarm optimization, using chemical short-range order as an explicit constraint. By systematically navigating the disordered energy landscape, ApolloX enables the targeted design of thermodynamically stable amorphous configurations. It accurately predicts atomic-scale arrangements, including composition-driven metal clustering and amorphization trends, which are well-validated by experiments, while also guiding synthesis by leveraging sluggish diffusion to control elemental distribution and disorder. The resulting structural evolution, governed by composition, directly impacts catalytic performance, leading to improved activity and stability with increasing amorphization. This predictive-experimental synergy transforms the discovery of amorphous materials, unlocking new frontiers in catalysis, energy storage, and functional disordered systems.</description>

Abstract: Accurate computational predictions of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their properties is crucial for discovering optimal compositions and applying them in relevant technological areas. This work benchmarks density functional theory (DFT) approaches, including semi-local, meta-GGA, and hybrid functionals with various dispersion corrections, on MOF-5 and three of its computationally predicted derivatives, analyzing structural, electronic, and vibrational properties. Our results underline the importance of explicitly treating van der Waals interactions for an accurate description of structural and vibrational properties, and indicate the meta-GGA functional R2SCAN as the best balance between accuracy and efficiency for characterizing the electronic structure of these systems, in view of future high-throughput screening studies on MOFs.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric Domains and Evolution Dynamics in Twisted CuInP2S6 Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar domains and their manipulation-particularly the creation and dynamic control-have garnered significant attention, owing to their rich physics and promising applications in digital memory devices. In this work, using density functional theory (DFT) and deep learning molecular dynamics (DLMD) simulations, we demonstrate that polar domains can be created and manipulated in twisted bilayers of ferroelectric CuInP2S6, as a result of interfacial ferroelectric (antiferroelectric) coupling in AA (AB) stacked region. Unlike the topological polar vortex and skyrmions observed in superlattices of (PbTiO3)n/(SrTiO3)n and sliding bilayers of BN and MoS2, the underlying mechanism of polar domain formation in this system arises from stacking-dependent energy barriers for ferroelectric switching and variations in switching speeds under thermal perturbations. Notably, the thermal stability and polarization lifetimes are highly sensitive to twist angles and temperature, and can be further manipulated by external electric fields and strain. Through multi-scale simulations, our study provides a novel approach to exploring how twist angles influence domain evolution and underscores the potential for controlling local polarization in ferroelectric materials via rotational manipulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in experimental techniques and computational methods have significantly expanded the family of alkali antimonides, a class of semiconducting materials used as photocathodes in particle accelerators, unveiling new crystal structures and stoichiometries with improved stability and quantum efficiency. This work investigates the electronic and optical properties of eight Na- and K-based alkali antimonide binary crystals with 3:1 and 1:1 alkali-to-antimony ratios, which were predicted to be stable in a recent high-throughput screening study. Employing density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory, we find that all systems exhibit direct band gaps, except for monoclinic Na$_8$Sb$_8$, which has a nearly degenerate indirect gap. Optical spectra are characterized by near-infrared absorption onsets and intense visible excitations. Our analysis highlights the significant role of electron-hole correlations, particularly in K-based compounds, leading to exciton binding energies above 100~meV and sharper absorption peaks. An in-depth analysis of the electronic contributions to the excited states provides additional insight into the role of excitonic effects. By shedding light on the fundamental properties of alkali antimonide binary crystals, our results are relevant for the design and optimization of next-generation electron sources for particle accelerators.</description>

      <title>Sum frequency generation from real-time simulations in two-dimensional crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sum frequency generation (SFG) and difference frequency generation (DFG) are second order nonlinear processes where two lasers with frequencies $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ combine to produce a response at frequency $\omega = \omega_1 \pm \omega_2$ . Compared with other nonlinear responses such as second-harmonic generation, SFG and DFG allow for tunability over a larger range. Moreover, the optical response can be enhanced by selecting the two laser frequencies in order to match specific electron-hole transitions. Here, we propose a first-principles framework based on the real-time solution of an effective Schr\"odinger equation to calculate the SFG and DFG in various systems, such as bulk materials, 2D materials, and molecules. Within this framework, one can select from various levels of theory for the effective one-particle Hamiltonian to account for local-field effects and electron-hole interactions. To assess the approach, we calculate the SFG and DFG of two-dimensional crystals, h-BN and MoS$_2$ monolayers, both within the independent-particle picture and including many-body effects. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach can also extract higher-order response functions, such as field-induced second-harmonic generation. We provide an example using bilayer h-BN.</description>

      <title>Layered Topological Antiferromagnetic Metal at Room Temperature -- YbMn$_2$Ge$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metallic antiferromagnets are essential for efficient spintronic applications due to their fast switching and high mobility, yet room-temperature metallic antiferromagnets are rare. Here, we investigate YbMn$_2$Ge$_2$, a room temperature antiferromagnet, and establish it as an exfoliable layered metal with altermagnetic surface states. Using multi-orbital Hubbard model calculations, we reveal that its robust metallic AFM ordering is stabilized by electronic correlations and a partially nested Fermi surface. Furthermore, we show that YbMn$_2$Ge$_2$ hosts symmetry-protected topological Dirac crossings, connecting unique even-order spin-polarized surface states with parabolic and inverted Mexican-hat-like dispersion. Our findings position YbMn$_2$Ge$_2$ as a promising platform for exploring the interplay of correlation, topology, and surface altermagnetism of layered antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Phase field study of the effective fracture energy increase during dynamic crack propagation in disordered heterogeneous materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propagation of a 3D crack in an heterogeneous material is studied using a phase field model. It is shown that in the case of randomly distributed inclusions of soft material in a matrix, the nature of the distribution has little effect on the effective elastic properties. On the opposite it affects significantly crack propagation. The less uniform distribution leads to higher thresholds for crack propagation.</description>

      <title>First-principles investigation of Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$ and Cs-doped Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$: unveiling their potential for hydrogen storage through mechanical and optoelectronic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study uses the density functional theory (DFT) approach with GGA-PBE to assess the effect of substituting alkali metals in Rb$_{2}$CaH and Cs-doped Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$ on their hydrogen storage potential. To address the challenges associated with predicting accurate electronic properties in materials containing heavier elements such as cesium, spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects have been incorporated into our calculations. The mechanical robustness of both Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$ and Cs-doped Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$, as demonstrated by their mechanical properties, highlights these materials as promising candidates due to their stability in hydrogen storage applications. Anisotropic factors show that all materials exhibit anisotropy, suggesting a directional dependency in their properties. The Pugh ratio indicates that Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$ and Cs-doped Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$ are brittle materials. Based on the calculated band gap, the electronic band structure analysis, conducted using both HSE06 and GGA-PBE, shows that Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$ and Cs-doped Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$ are wide-bandgap materials. Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$ and Cs-doped Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$ exhibit the highest optical conductivity, absorption coefficient, and energy loss function among optoelectronic materials, emphasizing their superior absorption and electron transfer capabilities. The hydrogen storage capacity has been evaluated for practical applications; Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$ and Cs-doped Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$ show the highest gravimetric and volumetric capacities.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen Bond Strength Dictates the Rate-Limiting Steps of Diffusion in Proton-Conducting Perovskites:A Critical Length Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (PC-SOFCs) are pivotal for their high proton conductivity and superior performance. The proton conduction mechanism is commonly described by the Grotthuss mechanism, involving proton rotation and transfer. While proton transfer is often considered the rate-limiting step, the underlying reasons remain unclear. Through density functional theory calculations on undoped, A-site doped, and B-site doped BaHfO$_3$ systems, we demonstrate that the rate-limiting nature of proton transfer stems from the formation of weaker hydrogen bonds. In systems with strong hydrogen bonds, proton rotation becomes non-negligible. We identify a critical hydrogen bond length that distinguishes strong from weak bonds, with shorter lengths correlating with distorted perovskite structures and configurations deviating from cubic. This insight into the necessity of rotation is crucial for screening and optimizing materials with superior proton conduction properties.</description>

      <title>Metastable Monolayer Formation through a Connector Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intentional growth of metastable surface structures of organic molecules adsorbed on inorganic substrates is a challenging task. It is usually unclear which kinetic mechanism leads to the metastable surface polymorph after a deposition experiment. In this work we investigate a growth procedure that allows to intentionally grow a defined metastable surface structure starting from thermodynamic equilibrium. This procedure is applicable to organic-inorganic interface systems that exhibit a thermodynamically stable connector structure that can be exploited to grow the metastable target structure. With specific temperature and pressure changes in the system a significant yield of the target polymorph can be achieved. We demonstrate this procedure on a simplified microscopic interface system of rectangular molecules adsorbing on a square lattice substrate with kinetic Monte Carlo growth simulations.</description>

      <title>Origin of second harmonic generation in non-centrosymmetric crystal structures containing lone-pairs electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Material systems with lone-pair electrons have long been a treasure trove in the search for large second harmonic generation effects. Revealing the origin of second harmonic generation in nonlinear optical materials can provide theoretical guidance for the design of new materials. In this work, the origin of second harmonic generation in non-centrosymmetric materials containing lone pair electrons is revealed by analyzing the orbital interactions on the sublattice. Stereochemically inactive Pb 6s orbitals with high symmetry in CsPbCO3F contribute less to the second harmonic generation. In contrast, the contribution of stereochemically active Pb 6s orbital in PbB5O7F3 and PbB2O3F2 is more obvious. Significantly, the orbitals of the interaction between lead and oxygen make a very significant contribution because these orbitals are located at the band edge and in non-centrosymmetric sublattices.</description>

      <title>Radiation damage and phase stability of Al$_x$CrCuFeNi$_y$ alloys using a machine-learned interatomic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a machine-learned interatomic potential for AlCrCuFeNi high-entropy alloys (HEA) using a diverse set of structures from density functional theory calculated including magnetic effects. The potential is based on the computationally efficient tabulated version of the Gaussian approximation potential method (tabGAP) and is a general-purpose model for molecular dynamics simulation of the HEA system, with additional emphasis on radiation damage effects. We use the potential to study key properties of AlCrCuFeNi HEAs at different compositions, focusing on the FCC/BCC phase stability. Monte Carlo swapping simulations are performed to understand the stability and segregation of the HEA and reveal clear FeCr and Cu segregation. Close to equiatomic composition, a transition from FCC to BCC is detected, following the valence electron concentration stability rule. Furthermore, we perform overlapping cascade simulations to investigate radiation damage production and tolerance. Different alloy compositions show significant differences in defect concentrations, and all alloy compositions show enrichment of some elements in or around defects. We find that, generally, a lower Al content corresponds to lower defect concentrations during irradiation. Furthermore, clear short-range ordering is observed as a consequence of continued irradiation.</description>

      <title>Materials Map Integrating Experimental and Computational Data through Graph-Based Machine Learning for Enhanced Materials Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07378v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials informatics (MI), which emerges from the integration of materials science and data science, is expected to greatly streamline the material discovery and development. The data used for MI are obtained from both computational and experimental studies, while their integration remains challenging. In our previous study, we reported the integration of these datasets by applying a machine learning model that captures trends hidden in the experimental datasets to compositional data stored in the computational database. In this study, we use the obtained data to construct materials maps, which visualize the relation in the structural features of materials, aiming to support study by the experimental researchers. The map is constructed using the MatDeepLearn (MDL) framework, which implements the graph-based representation of material structures, deep learning, and dimensional reduction for the map construction. We evaluate the obtained materials maps through statistical analysis and found that the MDL using message passing neural network (MPNN) enables efficient extraction of features that reflect the structural complexity of materials. Moreover, we found that this advantage does not necessarily translate into improved accuracy in predicting material properties. We attribute this unexpected outcome to the high learning performance inherent in MPNN, which can contribute to the structuring of data points within the materials map.</description>

      <title>Coherent Phonon Pairs and Rotational Symmetry Breaking of Charge Density Wave Order in the Kagome Metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we perform ultrafast time-resolved reflectivity measurements to study the symmetry breaking in the charge-density wave (CDW) phase of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. By extracting the coherent phonon spectrum in the CDW phase of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, we discover close phonon pairs near 1.3 THz and 3.1 THz, as well as a new mode at 1.84 THz. The 1.3 THz phonon pair and the 1.84 THz mode are observed up to the CDW transition temperature. Combining density-functional theory calculations, we point out these phonon pairs arise from the coexistence of Star-of-David and inverse Star-of-David distortions combined with six-fold rotational symmetry breaking. An anisotropy in the magnitude of transient reflectivity change is also revealed at the onset of CDW order. Our results thus indicate broken six-fold rotational symmetry in the charge-density wave state of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, along with the absence of nematic fluctuation above T$_{\text{CDW}}$. Meanwhile, the measured coherent phonon spectrum in the CDW phase of CsV$_3$Sb$_{5-\text{x}}$Sn$_\text{x}$ with x = 0.03-0.04 matches with staggered inverse Star-of-David with interlayer $\pi$ phase shift. This CDW structure contrasts with undoped CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and explains the evolution from phonon pair to a single mode at 1.3 THz by x = 0.03-0.04 Sn-doping.</description>

      <title>Advancing our Understanding of Optoionic Effects for the Design of Solar Batteries: A Theoretical Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optoionics, a promising new field that aims at controlling ion dynamics using light, links photovoltaic power generation with electrochemical charge storage. This has the potential to drive and accelerate the energy revolution by utilizing materials that integrate the functionality of batteriesand photovoltaic cells. Finding, optimizing, and customizing these materials is a complex task, though. Computational modeling can play a crucial role in guiding and speeding up these processes, particularly when the atomic mechanisms are not well understood. This does however require expertise in various areas, including advanced electronic-structure theory, machine learning, and multi-scale approaches.
  In this perspective, we shed light on the intricacies of modeling optoionic effects for solar battery materials. We first discuss the underlying physical and chemical mechanisms, as well as the computational tools that are available to date for describing these processes. Furthermore, we discuss the limits of these approaches and identify key challenges that need to be tackled to advance this field.</description>

      <title>Composition effect in the thermo-mechanical behavior of glasses, and its modelization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employed molecular dynamics simulations to explore comparatively the thermo-mechanical behavior of two glass materials-an oxide silica glass (SiO2) and a binary Cu-Zr-based metallic alloy (Cu50Zr50)-during shear deformation cycles. By calculating the energy balance and tracking the temperature evolution of both glasses under deformation cycles, we are able to propose, for each of them, a constitutive law which accurately reproduces the self-heating process due to plastic deformation. These relatively simple constitutive laws involve strain rate sensitivity and a non-linear temperature dependence of the thermal dilatancy coefficients, as well as strain gradient plasticity. To identify the right parameters, both glasses are equilibrated at very low temperature (10 K) and two independent deformation rates were applied to each sample. Thermal attenuation is greatly amplified in silica compared to the metallic glass. Moreover, using precise atomic description of the instantaneous deformation, combined with exact coarse-graining procedure, we show that selfheating is mainly supported, in silica, by inhomogeneous strain gradient plasticity with nanometric characteristic lengthscales.</description>

      <title>Oriented 2D Ruddlesden-Popper Metal Halides by Pulsed Laser Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) Metal Halides present unique and tunable properties, offering a plethora of applications in optoelectronics. However, the direct and oriented synthesis of these materials is challenging due to the low formation energies that result in fast, uncontrollable growth dynamics during solution-based processing. Here, we report the solvent-free growth of oriented and n = 1 2D $(\mbox{PEA})_2\mbox{PbI}_4$ RP films by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). In situ photoluminescence (PL) during PLD reveal that the n =1 RP phase of $(\mbox{PEA})_2\mbox{PbI}_4$ forms at the first stages of growth. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and grazing-incidence wide-angle scattering (GIWAXS) measurements confirm the formation of single oriented n = 1 phase of $(\mbox{PEA})_2\mbox{PbI}_4$ independent of the underlying substrate. Co-localized spatially resolved PL and AFM further validate the conformal growth of the n = 1 phase. While oriented growth is substrate-independent, the stability of the 2D films is influenced by the substrate. PLD-grown 2D RP films grown onto epitaxial $\mbox{MAPbI}_3$ films are stable over 80 days, showing no sign of cation exchange. This work highlights the potential of PLD for direct, room-temperature synthesis of 2D $(\mbox{PEA})_2\mbox{PbI}_4$ RP films on diverse substrates and demonstrates the feasibility of stable 2D/3D heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Implementation of full-potential screened spherical wave based muffin-tin orbital for all-electron density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Screened spherical wave (SSW) of the Hankel function features the complete, minimal and short-ranged basis set, presenting a compact representation for electronic systems. In this work, we report the implementation of full-potential (FP) SSW based tight-binding linearized Muffin-Tin orbital (TB-LMTO) for all-electron density functional theory (DFT), and provide extensive tests on the robustness of FP-TB-LMTO and its high accuracy for first-principles material simulation. Through the introduction of double augmentation, SSW based MTO is accurately represented on the double grids including the full-space uniform and dense radial grids. Based on the the double augmentation, the accurate computation of full charge density, full potential,complex integral in the interstitial region and the total energy are all effectively addressed to realize the FP-TB-LMTO for DFT self-consistent calculations. By calculating the total energy,band structure, phase ordering, and elastic constants for a wide variety of materials, including normal metals, compounds, and diamond silicon, we domenstrate the highly accurate numerical implemetation of FP-TB-LMTO for all-electron DFT in comparison with other well-established FP method. The implementation of FP-TB-LMTO based DFT offers an important tool for the accurate first-principles tight-binding electronic structure calculations, particular important for the large-scale or strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <title>DL_POLY 5: Calculation of system properties on the fly for very large systems via massive parallelism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling has become a third distinct line of scientific enquiry, alongside experiments and theory. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations serve to interpret, predict and guide experiments and to test and develop theories. A major limiting factor of MD simulations is system size and in particular the difficulty in handling, storing and processing trajectories of very large systems. This limitation has become significant as the need to simulate large system sizes of the order of billions of atoms and beyond has been steadily growing. Examples include interface phenomena, composite materials, biomaterials, melting, nucleation, atomic transport, adhesion, radiation damage and fracture. More generally, accessing new length and energy scales often brings qualitatively new science, but this has currently reached a bottleneck in MD simulations due to the traditional methods of storing and post-processing trajectory files. To address this challenge, we propose a new paradigm of running MD simulations: instead of storing and post-processing trajectory files, we calculate key system properties on-the-fly. Here, we discuss the implementation of this idea and on-the-fly calculation of key system properties in the general-purpose MD code, DL_POLY. We discuss code development, new capabilities and the calculation of these properties, including correlation functions, viscosity, thermal conductivity and elastic constants. We give examples of these on-the-fly calculations in very large systems. Our developments offer a new way to run MD simulations of large systems efficiently in the future.</description>

Abstract: An efficient mixed deterministic/sparse-stochastic plane-wave approach is developed for bandstructure calculations of large supercell periodic generalized-Kohn-Sham density functional theory, for any hybrid-exchange density functional. The method works for very large elementary cells and supercells, and we benchmark it on covalently bonded solids and molecular crystals with nonbonded interactions, for supercells of up to 33,000 atoms. Memory and CPU requirements scale with supercell size quasi-linearly.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Highly Anisotropic Type-II Ferromagnetic Weyl State Exhibiting a 3D Quantum Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological semimetals, particularly Weyl semimetals (WSMs), are crucial platforms for exploring emergent quantum phenomena due to their unique electronic structures and potential to transition into various topological phases. In this study, we report the discovery of a ferromagnetic (FM) type-II WSM in Mn(Bi1-xSbx)4Te7, which exhibits a remarkable three-dimensional (3D) quantum Hall effect (QHE). By precisely tuning the chemical potential through Sb doping, we obtained samples with the Fermi level near the charge neutrality point for x = ~ 0.27. This was confirmed by spectroscopy measurements (ARPES and STS), and these samples showed strong quantum oscillations along with a key transport signature of a Weyl state - chiral anomaly, and Fermi surface reconstruction driven by FM ordering. Our theoretical analysis indicates that this Weyl state evolves from a parent nodal ring state, where higher-order k-terms split the nodal line into type-II Weyl nodes. The Weyl state exhibits significant anisotropy, characterized by a pronounced reduction in Fermi velocity along the kz-axis, likely accounting for the observed 3D QHE. These results not only highlight the exceptional tunability of the Mn(Bi1-xSbx)4Te7 system, where precise control of the chemical potential and magnetic properties opens access to novel quantum phases, but also advance the understanding of FM WSMs.</description>

Abstract: The natural interactive materials under far-from-equilibrium conditions have significantly inspired advances in synthetic biomimetic materials. In artificial systems, gradient diffusion serves as the primary means of interaction between individuals, lacking directionality, sufficient interaction ranges and transmission rates. Here, we present a method for constructing highly directed, communicative structures via optical feedback in light responsive materials. We showcase a photomechanical operator system comprising a baffle and a soft actuator. Positive and negative operators are configured to induce light-triggered deformations, alternately interrupting the passage of two light beams in a closed feedback loop. The fundamental functionalities of this optically interconnected material loop include homeostasis-like self-oscillation and signal transmission from one material to another via light. Refinements in alignment facilitate remote sensing, fiber-optic/long-distance communication, and adaptation. These proof-of-concept demonstrations outline a versatile design framework for light-mediated communication among responsive materials, with broad applicability across diverse materials.</description>

      <title>A Materials Foundation Model via Hybrid Invariant-Equivariant Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials foundation models can predict energy, force, and stress of materials and enable a wide range of downstream discovery tasks. A key design choice involves the trade-off between invariant and equivariant architectures. Invariant models offer computational efficiency but may not perform well when predicting high-order outputs. In contrast, equivariant models can capture high-order symmetries, but are computationally expensive. In this work, we propose HIENet, a hybrid invariant-equivariant foundation model that integrates both invariant and equivariant message passing layers. HIENet is designed to achieve superior performance with considerable computational speedups over prior models. Experimental results on both common benchmarks and downstream materials discovery tasks demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of HIENet.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion Molecule Lattices Enabling Stable Transport and Flexible Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Skyrmions--topologically protected nanoscale spin textures with vortex-like configurations--hold transformative potential for ultra-dense data storage, spintronics and quantum computing. However, their practical utility is challenged by dynamic instability, complex interaction, and the lack of deterministic control. While recent efforts using classical wave systems have enabled skyrmion simulations via engineered excitations, these realizations rely on fragile interference patterns, precluding stable transport and flexible control. Here, we introduce a skyrmion molecule lattice, a novel architecture where pairs of spin skyrmions with opposite polarizability are symmetry-locked into stable molecule configurations. These molecules emerge as propagating eigenstates of the system, overcoming the static limitations of previous realizations. We further develop a boundary engineering technique, achieving precise control over skyrmion creation, deformation, annihilation, and polarizability inversion. As a proof of concept, we design a graphene-like acoustic surface wave metamaterial, where meta-atom pairs generate vortices with opposite orbital angular momenta, which couple to acoustic spin textures, forming skyrmion molecules. Experimental measurements confirm their stable transport and flexible control. Our work leverages the symmetry-locked molecule lattice to preserve the topological quasiparticle nature of skyrmions, offering a universal framework for their stabilization, transportation and manipulation. This bridges critical gaps in skyrmion physics, with potential impacts on wave-based sensing, information processing, and topological waveguiding.</description>

      <title>Topological superconductivity in two-dimensional $\pi$-junction Dirac semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Odd-parity pairings offer a natural pathway for realizing topological superconductivity. When two identical even-parity superconductors form a $\pi$-junction, the metallic material sandwiched between them experiences an effective odd-parity pairing, facilitating the emergence of topological superconductivity in the intermediate region. In this work, we consider the intermediate material to be a two-dimensional spin-orbit-coupled Dirac semimetal. When the two superconductors are conventional s-wave superconductors, we find that a helical topological superconductor can be realized. This phase is characterized by the presence of a pair of helical Majorana edge states. Interestingly, when the superconductors are $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductors, we observe not only the helical topological superconductor but also an unconventional topological superconductor. The latter is distinguished by the existence of two pairs of helical Majorana edge states, despite the fact that the global topological invariants for this system take on trivial values. By further applying an in-plane magnetic field, we demonstrate that second-order topological superconducting phases can be achieved. These phases host isolated Majorana corner modes as well as twofold Majorana corner modes. Our findings reveal that two-dimensional $\pi$-junction Dirac semimetals can support a rich variety of topological superconducting phases, offering a versatile platform for exploring exotic topological phenomena.</description>

      <title>Non-hermitian Green's function theory with $N$-body interactions: the coupled-cluster similarity transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the diagrammatic theory of the irreducible self-energy and Bethe-Salpeter kernel that naturally arises within the Green's function formalism for a general $N$-body non-hermitian interaction. In this work, we focus specifically on the coupled-cluster self-energy generated by the similarity transformation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian. We develop the biorthogonal quantum theory to construct dynamical correlation functions where the time-dependence of operators is governed by a non-hermitian Hamiltonian. We extend the Gell-Mann and Low theorem to include non-hermitian interactions and to generate perturbative expansions of many-body Green's functions. We introduce the single-particle coupled-cluster Green's function and derive the perturbative diagrammatic expansion for the non-hermitian coupled-cluster self-energy in terms of the `non-interacting' reference Green's function, $\tilde{\Sigma}[G_0]$. From the equation-of-motion of the single-particle coupled-cluster Green's function, we derive the self-consistent renormalized coupled-cluster self-energy, $\tilde{\Sigma}[\tilde{G}]$, and demonstrate its relationship to the perturbative expansion of the self-energy, $\tilde{\Sigma}[G_0]$. Subsequently, we show that the usual electronic self-energy can be recovered from the coupled-cluster self-energy by neglecting the effects of the similarity transformation. We show how the coupled-cluster ground state energy is related to the coupled-cluster self-energy and provide an overview of the relationship between approximations for the coupled-cluster self-energy, IP/EA-EOM-CCSD and the $G_0W_0$ approximation. As a result, we introduce the CC-$G_0W_0$ self-energy by leveraging the connections between Green's function and coupled-cluster theory. Finally, we derive the diagrammatic expansion of the coupled-cluster Bethe-Salpeter kernel.</description>

      <title>UniGenX: Unified Generation of Sequence and Structure with Autoregressive Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unified generation of sequence and structure for scientific data (e.g., materials, molecules, proteins) is a critical task. Existing approaches primarily rely on either autoregressive sequence models or diffusion models, each offering distinct advantages and facing notable limitations. Autoregressive models, such as GPT, Llama, and Phi-4, have demonstrated remarkable success in natural language generation and have been extended to multimodal tasks (e.g., image, video, and audio) using advanced encoders like VQ-VAE to represent complex modalities as discrete sequences. However, their direct application to scientific domains is challenging due to the high precision requirements and the diverse nature of scientific data. On the other hand, diffusion models excel at generating high-dimensional scientific data, such as protein, molecule, and material structures, with remarkable accuracy. Yet, their inability to effectively model sequences limits their potential as general-purpose multimodal foundation models. To address these challenges, we propose UniGenX, a unified framework that combines autoregressive next-token prediction with conditional diffusion models. This integration leverages the strengths of autoregressive models to ease the training of conditional diffusion models, while diffusion-based generative heads enhance the precision of autoregressive predictions. We validate the effectiveness of UniGenX on material and small molecule generation tasks, achieving a significant leap in state-of-the-art performance for material crystal structure prediction and establishing new state-of-the-art results for small molecule structure prediction, de novo design, and conditional generation. Notably, UniGenX demonstrates significant improvements, especially in handling long sequences for complex structures, showcasing its efficacy as a versatile tool for scientific data generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method that combines spin resonance spectroscopy with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), enabling localized in-situ detection of microwave (MW)-driven spin excitations. Our approach utilizes continuous wave MW excitation at GHz frequencies, while employing the free-space electron beam as a signal receiver to sense spin precession. Spin state polarization is achieved via the magnetic field of the TEM's polepiece, while a custom-designed microresonator integrated into a TEM sample holder drives spin transitions and modulates the electron beam. This modulation enables phase-locked detection with picosecond temporal resolution, allowing the isolation of spin precession contributions to the electron beam deflection with a sensitivity of $\sim 280$ prad. The presented technique lays foundations for the MW spectroscopic in-situ exploration of spin dynamics at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Multipolar Order and Multipole-Induced Superconductivity in PrTi$_{2}$Al$_{20}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multipolar moments entail a new route to tackle frontier problems in superconductivity (SC). A key progress in the search for multipolar SC is the discovery of Pr$Tr_2$Al$_{20}$ ($Tr =$ Ti, V), which possesses quadrupolar and octupolar but no magnetic dipolar moments. The Kondo entanglement of these multipolar moments with conduction electrons leads to exotic SC within the multipolar ordered phase, though the precise nature of the SC remains unexplored. We experimentally investigate the SC gap structure of SC in PrTi$_{2}$Al$_{20}$ and its La-doping evolution. Our results indicate deviations from a single $s$-wave gap, instead favoring nodal $d$-wave or multiple gaps. While the SC is robust against La dilution, the SC gap structure changes with minimal La doping, coinciding with a sharp change in the ferroquadrupolar (FQ) order. This suggests an intimate link between the quadrupolar order parameter and SC pairing, providing insight into the coexistence of SC with multipolar order.</description>

      <title>Out-of-plane displacement of quantum color centers in monolayer h-BN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Color centers exhibiting deep-level states within the wide bandgap h-BN monolayer possess substantial potential for quantum applications. Uncovering precise geometric characteristics at the atomic scale is crucial for understanding defect performance. In this study, first-principles calculations were performed on the most extensively investigated CBVN and NBVN color centers in h-BN, focusing on the out-of-plane displacement and their specific impacts on electronic, vibrational, and emission properties. We demonstrate the competition between the {\sigma}*-like antibonding state and the {\pi}-like bonding state, which determines the out-of-plane displacement. The overall effect of vibronic coupling on geometry is elucidated using a pseudo Jahn-Teller model. Local vibrational analysis reveals a series of distinct quasi-local phonon modes that could serve as fingerprints for experimental identification of specific point defects. The critical effects of out-of-plane displacement during the quantum emission process are carefully elucidated to answer the distinct observations in experiments, and these revelations are universal in quantum point defects in other layered materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the first time, a detailed analysis of the behaviour of the temperature dependences of the upper critical fields Hc2(T) has been carried out in the compounds (Dy1-xErx)Rh3.8Ru0.2B4 (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4). It is found that the Hc2(T) in (Dy0.8Er0.2)Rh3.8Ru0.2B4 has an inflection point at 3 kOe, which may be related to the low-temperature magnetic ordering, while a more exotic mechanism caused by the transition from ordinary singlet to triplet superconductivity is not excluded. For the first time, the experimental Hc2(T) dependences of (Dy1-xErx)Rh3.8Ru0.2B4 (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4) compounds have been fitted within the framework of Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg theory (WHH) with the Maki parameter alpha &gt; 0, indicating that spin-paramagnetic effects due to magnetic exchange interactions play an essential role in suppressing superconductivity in these compounds.</description>

Abstract: Introducing topologically protected skyrmions in graphene holds significant importance for developing high-speed, low-energy spintronic devices. Here, we present a centrosymmetric ferromagnetic graphene/trilayer Cr2Ge2Te6/graphene heterostructure, demonstrating the anomalous and topological Hall effect due to the magnetic proximity effect. Through gate voltage control, we effectively tune the emergence and size of skyrmions. Micromagnetic simulations reveal the formation of skyrmions and antiskyrmions, which respond differently to external magnetic fields, leading to oscillations in the topological Hall signal. Our findings provide a novel pathway for the formation and manipulation of skyrmions in centrosymmetric two-dimensional magnetic systems, offering significant insights for developing topological spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fermi arcs are one of the characteristic features of Weyl semimetals, appearing as surface states that connect Weyl points with opposite chiralities. It has also been suggested that Fermi arcs can emerge in the bulk due to the interplay between magnetic textures and Weyl physics. We focus on Ti$_2$MnAl which is an ideal magnetic Weyl semimetal with a compensated ferrimagnetic order. We systematically analyze domain wall-induced Fermi arcs in Ti$_2$MnAl using an effective tight-binding model. By varying the strength of spin-orbit coupling, we confirmed that these domain wall-induced Fermi arcs emerge as a result of shifts in the positions of the Weyl points. Furthermore, we found that these domain wall-induced Fermi arcs in Ti$_2$MnAl originate from the Chern number and represent a topologically robust state that is independent of the domain wall width.</description>

      <title>Origin of Cusp-Like Feature in Hall Resistivity of Uniaxial Ferromagnet in Non-Orthogonal Hall Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent magnetotransport studies on uniaxial ferromagnets have reported a cusp-like feature in Hall resistivity when the magnetic field is tilted away from the conventional orthogonal direction of the Hall measurement. This feature has often been attributed to the topological Hall effect arising from a non-coplanar spin structure. In this Letter, we have studied the uniaxial ferromagnet SmMn$_2$Ge$_2$ to demonstrate that this feature is rather a consequence of the non-orthogonal geometry of the Hall measurement and is expected to appear whenever the magnetic field is applied away from the easy axis of magnetization, non-orthogonal to the sample plane. The Hall resistivity, exhibiting this feature, scales with the orthogonal component of the magnetization, indicating that the observed feature is simply a manifestation of the anomalous Hall effect. We explain the origin of this feature based on the evolution of ferromagnetic domains under a non-orthogonal external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Crack propagation by activated avalanches during creep and fatigue from elastic interface theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth of cracks combines materials science, fracture mechanics, and statistical physics. The importance of fluctuations in the crack velocity is fundamental since it signals that the crack overcomes local barriers such as tough spots by avalanches. In ductile materials the omnipresent plasticity close to the crack tip influences the growth by history effects, which we here study in polymethylmetacrylate by various fatigue and creep protocols. We show how the crack tip local history may be encompassed in a time- and protocol dependent lengthscale, that allows to apply a statistical fracture description to the time-dependent crack growth rate, resolving the well-known paradox why fatigue cracks grow faster if the stress during a cycle is let to relax more from the peak value. The results open up novel directions for understanding fracture by statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Revealing Rotational Symmetry Breaking Charge-density Wave Order in Kagome Superconductor (Rb, K)V$_3$Sb$_5$ by Ultrafast Pump-probe Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered Kagome superconductor AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (where A refers to K, Rb, Cs) has stimulated widespread research interest due to its interplay of non-trivial topology and unconventional correlated physics including charge-density waves (CDW) and superconductivity. The essential prerequisite to understanding the microscopic mechanisms of this complex electronic landscape is to unveil the configuration and symmetry of the charge-density wave order. As to now, little consensus has been made on what symmetry is broken. Herein, we clarify the microscopic structure and symmetry breaking of the CDW phase in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ and KV$_3$Sb$_5$ by ultrafast time-resolved reflectivity. Our approach is based on extracting coherent phonon spectra induced by three-dimensional CDW and comparing them to calculated phonon frequencies via density-functional theory. The combination of these experimental results and calculations provides compelling evidence that the CDW structure of both compounds prevailing up to T$_{\text{CDW}}$ is the 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 2 staggered inverse Star-of-David pattern with interlayer $\pi$ phase shift, in which the six-fold rotational symmetry is broken. These observations thus corroborate six-fold rotational symmetry breaking throughout the CDW phase of RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ and KV$_3$Sb$_5$.</description>

      <title>Coupled electron-phonon hydrodynamics and viscous thermoelectric equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-diffusive, hydrodynamic-like transport of charge or heat has been observed in several materials, and recent, pioneering experiments have suggested the possible emergence of electron-phonon bifluids. Here we introduce the first-principles theory and computational framework to describe these phenomena, showing that the viscosity of electron-phonon bifluids is microscopically determined by composite ``relaxon'' electron-phonon excitations that also describe electron-phonon drag effects on thermoelectric transport coefficients. We show that these composite excitations emerge from the microscopic coupled electron-phonon Boltzmann transport equation, and demonstrate that the latter can be coarse-grained into a set of mesoscopic Viscous Thermoelectric Equations (VTE). The VTE unify the established hydrodynamic equation for electrons derived by Gurzhi [Sov. Phys. Usp. 11 1968], and the recently developed Viscous Heat Equations for phonons [PRX 10, 2020], while also extending them to cover the mixed electron-phonon bifluid regime. We employ this framework to elucidate from first principles the conditions under which electron and phonon fluids can coexist and mix, as well as to rationalize experimental signatures of electron-phonon drag in graphite.</description>

      <title>Computation of Burgers Vectors from Elastic Strain and Lattice Rotation Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.00717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A theoretical framework for computation of Burgers vectors from strain and lattice rotation data in materials with low dislocation density is presented, as well as implementation into a computer program to automate the process. The efficacy of the method is verified using simulated data of dislocations with known results. A three-dimensional dataset retrieved from Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) and a two-dimensional dataset from high-resolution transmission Kikuchi diffraction (HR-TKD) are used as inputs to demonstrate the reliable identification of dislocation positions and accurate determination of Burgers vectors from experimental data. For BCDI data, the results found using our approach show very close agreement to those expected from empirical methods. For the HR-TKD data, the predicted dislocation position and the computed Burgers vector showed fair agreement with the expected result, which is promising considering the substantial experimental uncertainties in this dataset. The method reported in this paper provides a general and robust framework for determining dislocation position and associated Burgers vector, and can be readily applied to data from different experimental techniques.</description>

      <title>Effect of cation-disorder on lithium transport in halide superionic conductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Li$_2$ZrCl$_6$ (LZC) is a promising solid-state electrolyte due to its affordability, moisture stability, and high ionic conductivity. We computationally investigate the role of cation disorder in LZC and its effect on Li-ion transport by integrating thermodynamic and kinetic modeling. The results demonstrate that fast Li-ion conductivity requires Li/vacancy disorder, which is dependent on the degree of Zr disorder. The high temperature required to form equilibrium Zr-disorder precludes any equilibrium synthesis processes for achieving fast Li-ion conductivity, rationalizing why only non-equilibrium synthesis methods, such as ball milling, lead to good conductivity. Our simulations show that Zr disorder lowers the Li/vacancy order-disorder transition temperature, which is necessary for creating high Li diffusivity at room temperature. These insights raise a challenge for the large-scale production of these materials and the potential for the long-term stability of their properties.</description>

      <title>Piezoresistivity as a Fingerprint of Ferroaxial Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in the understanding of the collective behavior of electrons and ions have revealed new types of ferroic orders beyond ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism, such as the ferroaxial state. The latter retains only rotational symmetry around a single axis and reflection symmetry with respect to a single mirror plane, both of which are set by an emergent electric toroidal dipole moment. Due to this unusual symmetry-breaking pattern, it has been challenging to directly measure the ferroaxial order parameter, despite the increasing attention this state has drawn. Here, we show that off-diagonal components of the piezoresistivity tensor (i.e., the linear change in resistivity under strain) transform the same way as the ferroaxial moments, providing a direct probe of such order parameters. We identify two new proper ferroaxial materials through a materials database search, and use first-principles calculations to evaluate the piezoconductivity of the double-perovskite CaSnF$_6$, revealing its connection to ferroaxial order and to octahedral rotation modes.</description>

      <title>Defects induce phase transition from dynamic to static rippling in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials display nanoscale dynamic ripples that significantly impact their properties. Defects within the crystal lattice are the elementary building blocks to tailor the material's morphology. While some studies have explored the link between defective structures and rippling dynamics in 2D materials, a comprehensive understanding of this relationship has yet to be achieved. Here, we address this using machine learning-driven molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, we find that above a critical concentration of defects, free-standing graphene sheets undergo a dynamic transition from freely propagating to static ripples. Our computational approach captures the dynamics with atomic resolution, and reveals that the transition is driven by elastic interactions between defects. The strength of these interactions is found to vary across defect types and we identify a unifying set of principles driving the dynamic-to-static transition in 2D materials. Our work not only rationalises puzzling experimental results for defective 2D materials, but also paves the way to design two-dimensional devices with tailored rippling dynamics. These insights could lay the foundations for a new class of disorder-based catalytic and interfacial materials.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we report a pronounced light upconversion in few-layer transition metal dichalcogenides. Our joint theory-experiment study attributes the upconversion photoluminescence to a resonant exciton-exciton annihilation involving a pair of dark excitons with opposite momenta, followed by the spontaneous emission of upconverted bright excitons, which can have a high upconversion efficiency. Additionally, the upconversion photoluminescence is generic in MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2, showing a high tuneability from green to ultraviolet light.</description>

      <title>Sulfur in diamond and its effect on the creation of nitrogen-vacancy defect from \textit{ab initio} simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16310v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center is one of the most significant and widely studied defects in diamond that plays a prominent role in quantum technologies. The precise engineering of the location and concentration of NV centers is of great importance in quantum technology applications. To this end, irradiation techniques such as nitrogen-molecule ion implantation are applied. Recent studies have reported enhanced NV center creation and activation efficiencies introduced by nitrogen molecule ion implantation in doped diamond layers, where the maximum creation efficiency at $\sim75$\% has been achieved in sulfur-doped layers. However, the microscopic mechanisms behind these observations and the limits of the efficiencies are far from understood. In this study, we employ hybrid density functional theory calculations to compute the formation energies, charge transition levels, and the magneto-optical properties of various sulfur defects in diamond where we also consider the interaction of sulfur and hydrogen in chemical vapor-deposited diamond layers. Our results imply that the competition between the donor substitutional sulfur and the hyper-deep acceptor sulfur-vacancy complex is an important limiting factor on the creation efficiency of the NV center in diamond. However, both species are able to trap interstitial hydrogen from diamond, which favorably mediates the creation of NV centers in chemical vapor-deposited diamond layers.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Discovery of Vanadium Oxide Compositions: A WGAN-VAE Framework for Materials Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of novel materials with tailored electronic properties is crucial for modern device technologies, but time-consuming empirical methods hamper progress. We present an inverse design framework combining an enhanced Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with a specialized Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to accelerate the discovery of stable vanadium oxide (V-O) compositions. Our approach features (1) a WGAN with integrated stability constraints and formation energy predictions, enabling direct generation of thermodynamically feasible structures, and (2) a refined VAE capturing atomic positions and lattice parameters while maintaining chemical validity. Applying this framework, we generated 451 unique V-O compositions, with 91 stable and 44 metastable under rigorous thermodynamic criteria. Notably, we uncovered several novel V2O3 configurations with formation energies below the Materials Project convex hull, revealing previously unknown stable phases. Detailed spin-polarized DFT+U calculations showed distinct electronic behaviors, including promising half-metallic characteristics. Our approach outperforms existing methods in both quality and stability, demonstrating about a 20 percent stability rate under strict criteria compared to earlier benchmarks. Additionally, phonon calculations performed on selected compositions confirm dynamic stability: minor imaginary modes at 0 K likely stem from finite-size effects or known phase transitions, suggesting that these materials remain stable or metastable in practical conditions. These findings establish our framework as a powerful tool for accelerated materials discovery and highlight promising V-O candidates for next-generation electronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in the investigations of the charge role in semiconductor surfaces is reviewed. This is based on ab intio investigations. That include elucidation of Coulomb interaction of the separated subsystems, such as slab copies or far distant adsorbate and the slab, the bonding in the bulk and on the surface, standard and resonant. The quantum nature of the bonding leads to emergence of the external surface dipole, which was well recognized prior to these investigations. The role of the external dipole layer in the thermalization of the adsorbate is proposed and formulated. The internal dipole charge well known to exist at the surface were supplemented by new finding including the simulation of these dipole fields within slab model, pinning the Fermi level at the surface and the role of bulk and surface charge. of the bonding states. This could also occur at the activated complex point where the energy of these states could be increased into the vicinity of Fermi level or even higher so that this affects the energy barrier for diffusion. Therefore the explicit incorporation of quantum effects in the charge role in the semiconductor surfaces changes their properties considerably as described in this review.</description>

Saturation was carried out under a pressure of 30 atm at various temperatures from 470 K to 720 K. At saturation temperatures above 520 K for hydrogen and 690 K for nitrogen, chemical interaction of impurity molecules and the fullerene matrix occurs, forming new chemical compounds. The results of a study of the photoluminescent properties of a new substances are presented for the first time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uranium mononitride (UN) is a promising advanced nuclear fuel due to its high thermal conductivity and high fissile density. Yet, many aspects of its mechanical behavior and microstructural features are currently unknown. In this paper, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to study UN's diffusional creep. Nanometer-sized polycrystals are used to simulate diffusional creep and to calculate an effective GB width. It is found that Nabarro-Herring creep is not dominant in the temperature range of 1700$-$2000 K and that the dominant diffusional creep mechanism is Coble creep with an activation energy of 2.28 $\pm$ 0.09 eV. A method is proposed to calculate the diffusional GB width and its temperature dependence in polycrystals. The effective GB width of UN is calculated as 2.69 $\pm$ 0.08 nm. This value fits very well with the prefactor of the phenomenological Coble creep formula. It is demonstrated that the most comprehensive thermal creep model for UN can be represented as the combination of our Coble creep model and the dislocation creep model proposed by Hayes et al.</description>

Abstract: Tungsten (W) exhibits desirable properties for extreme applications, such as the divertor in magnetic fusion reactors, but its practicality remains limited due to poor formability and insufficient irradiation resistance. In this work, we study the intrinsic ductility of body-centered cubic WTaCrV based high entropy alloys (HEAs), which are known to exhibit excellent irradiation resistance. The ductility evaluations are carried out using a criterion based on the competition between the critical stress intensity factors for emission (KIe) and cleavage (KIc) in the {110} slip planes and {110} crack planes, which are evaluated within the linear elastic fracture mechanics framework and computed using density functional theory calculations. The results suggest that increasing the alloying concentrations of V and reducing the concentrations of W can significantly improve the ductility in these HEAs. The elastic anisotropy for these HEAs is analyzed using the Zener anisotropy ratio and its correlation with the concentration of W in the alloys is studied. Results indicate that these alloys tend to be fairly isotropic independently from the concentration of W in them. The computed data for the elastic constants of these HEAs is also compared against the available experimental data. The results are in good agreement, hence validating the robustness and accuracy of the computational methods. Multiple phenomenological ductility metrics were also computed and analyzed against the analytical model. The results suggest that these models may have higher computational efficiency due to less number of parameters required for their computation. Some models, like the surrogate D parameter and the Pugh ratio, show a good correlation with the Rice model. The potential of these empirical models to serve as surrogate screening models for optimizing the compositional space is also discussed.</description>

      <title>opXRD: Open Experimental Powder X-ray Diffraction Database</title>

Abstract: Powder X-ray diffraction (pXRD) experiments are a cornerstone for materials structure characterization. Despite their widespread application, analyzing pXRD diffractograms still presents a significant challenge to automation and a bottleneck in high-throughput discovery in self-driving labs. Machine learning promises to resolve this bottleneck by enabling automated powder diffraction analysis. A notable difficulty in applying machine learning to this domain is the lack of sufficiently sized experimental datasets, which has constrained researchers to train primarily on simulated data. However, models trained on simulated pXRD patterns showed limited generalization to experimental patterns, particularly for low-quality experimental patterns with high noise levels and elevated backgrounds. With the Open Experimental Powder X-Ray Diffraction Database (opXRD), we provide an openly available and easily accessible dataset of labeled and unlabeled experimental powder diffractograms. Labeled opXRD data can be used to evaluate the performance of models on experimental data and unlabeled opXRD data can help improve the performance of models on experimental data, e.g. through transfer learning methods. We collected 92552 diffractograms, 2179 of them labeled, from a wide spectrum of materials classes. We hope this ongoing effort can guide machine learning research toward fully automated analysis of pXRD data and thus enable future self-driving materials labs.</description>

      <title>Orientation-dependent superconductivity and electronic structure of the rare-earth metal/KTaO3 interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of orientation-dependent superconductivity in KTaO3-based interfaces has attracted considerable interest, while the underlying origin remains an open question. Here we report a different approach to tune the interfacial electron gas and superconductivity by forming interfaces between rare-earth (RE) metals (RE being La, Ce, Eu) and KTaO3 substrates with different orientations. We found that the interfacial superconductivity is strongest for the Eu/KTaO3 interfaces, becomes weaker in La/KTaO3 and is absent in Ce/KTaO3. Using in-situ photoemission, we observed distinct valence bands associated with RE metals, as well as a pronounced orientation dependence in the interfacial electronic structure, which can be linked to the orientation-dependent superconductivity. The photoemission spectra show similar double-peak structures for the (111) and (110) oriented interfaces, with an energy separation close to the LO4 phonon of KTaO3. Detailed analyses suggest that this double-peak structure could be attributed to electron-phonon coupling, which might be important for the interfacial superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12052v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of obtaining new superconductor candidates from functionalized MXene compounds Zr$_2$NS$_2$, Zr$_2$NCl$_2$, and Sc$_2$NCl$_2$ based on $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations with density functional theory for superconductors (SCDFT). The predicted superconducting transition temperature $(T_c)$ at ambient pressure may reach up to 9.48 K (Zr$_2$NS$_2$), while further $T_c$ improvements may be achieved with applied strain. We note a correlation between the profiles of superconducting gap $(\Delta)$ and electron-phonon coupling $(\lambda)$ across the Fermi surface for all compounds, which may be influenced by their modified electronic bandstructure components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the magnetic equivariant K-theory groups as the K-theory groups associated to magnetic groups and their respective magnetic equivariant complex bundles. We restrict the magnetic group to its subgroup of elements that act complex linearly, and we show that this restriction induces a rational isomorphism with the conjugation invariant part of the complex equivariant K-theory of the restricted group. This isomorphism allows to calculate the torsion free part of the magnetic equivariant K-theory groups reducing it to known calculations in complex equivariant K-theory</description>

      <title>Superconductivity and magnetic ordering in chalcogen-intercalated graphene bilayers with charge compensation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02931v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a new class of two-dimensional crystals with the structure AC$_8$XC$_8$, consisting of two layers of graphene, a chalcogen (X = O, S, Se, Te) intercalation layer, and an alkaline earth (A = Be, Ca, Mg, Sr, Ba) adlayer. The electronic band structure for the 20 compounds was studied using density functional theory. The chalcogen $p$ orbitals interact with the carbon $\pi$ orbitals to form weakly dispersing bands that give rise to complex Fermi surfaces featuring electron and hole pockets whose densities exactly compensate each other, and van Hove singularities that are very close to, or coincident with, the Fermi level in the majority of compounds studied. The resulting electron-electron interaction effects are studied using both the temperature-flow renormalisation group approach and a spin fluctuation model, which show a dominant ferromagnetic instability coexisting with $p$- or $f$-wave spin triplet superconductivity over a range of temperatures.</description>

      <title>Lattice dynamics and spin-phonon coupling in the kagome spin ice HoAgGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy and first-principles phonon calculations to study the lattice dynamics and spin-phonon coupling in the kagome spin ice compound HoAgGe. Upon cooling, HoAgGe shows transitions from a nonmagnetic state at 300 K to a partially magnetic-ordered phase below T2 = 11.6 K, eventually reaching a fully-magnetic ordered phase below T1 = 7 K. We detect eight of ten Raman-active phonon modes at room temperature, with frequencies consistent with first-principles phonon calculations. We find that the low-energy phonon modes harden upon cooling, soften slightly below T2, and finally harden again below T1, suggesting finite spin-phonon coupling in HoAgGe. Furthermore, one high-energy mode at 185 cm-1 with E' symmetry exhibits a Fano lineshape due to electron-phonon coupling. Our Raman results establish finite spin-phonon coupling and electron-phonon coupling in the magnetic phase of HoAgGe, providing a foundation for future studies of the novel field-induced phases at low temperatures in HoAgGe.</description>

      <title>Quantum interference and occupation control in high harmonic generation from monolayer $WS_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional hexagonal materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit valley degrees of freedom, offering fascinating potential for valley-based quantum computing and optoelectronics. In nonlinear optics, the K and K' valleys provide excitation resonances that can be used for ultrafast control of excitons, Bloch oscillations, and Floquet physics. Under intense laser fields, however, the role of coherent carrier dynamics away from the K/K' valleys is largely unexplored. In this study, we observe quantum interferences in high harmonic generation from monolayer $WS_2$ as laser fields drive electrons from the valleys across the full Brillouin zone. In the perturbative regime, interband resonances at the valleys enhance high harmonic generation through multi-photon excitations. In the strong-field regime, the high harmonic spectrum is sensitively controlled by light-driven quantum interferences between the interband valley resonances and intraband currents originating from electrons occupying various points in the Brillouin zone, also away from K/K' valleys such as $\Gamma$ and M. Our experimental observations are in strong agreement with quantum simulations, validating their interpretation. This work proposes new routes for harnessing laser-driven quantum interference in two-dimensional hexagonal systems and all-optical techniques to occupy and read-out electronic structures in the full Brillouin zone via strong-field nonlinear optics, advancing quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models to Address Data Scarcity in Machine Learning: Applications in Graphene Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning in materials science faces challenges due to limited experimental data, as generating synthesis data is costly and time-consuming, especially with in-house experiments. Mining data from existing literature introduces issues like mixed data quality, inconsistent formats, and variations in reporting experimental parameters, complicating the creation of consistent features for the learning algorithm. Additionally, combining continuous and discrete features can hinder the learning process with limited data. Here, we propose strategies that utilize large language models (LLMs) to enhance machine learning performance on a limited, heterogeneous dataset of graphene chemical vapor deposition synthesis compiled from existing literature. These strategies include prompting modalities for imputing missing data points and leveraging large language model embeddings to encode the complex nomenclature of substrates reported in chemical vapor deposition experiments. The proposed strategies enhance graphene layer classification using a support vector machine (SVM) model, increasing binary classification accuracy from 39% to 65% and ternary accuracy from 52% to 72%. We compare the performance of the SVM and a GPT-4 model, both trained and fine-tuned on the same data. Our results demonstrate that the numerical classifier, when combined with LLM-driven data enhancements, outperforms the standalone LLM predictor, highlighting that in data-scarce scenarios, improving predictive learning with LLM strategies requires more than simple fine-tuning on datasets. Instead, it necessitates sophisticated approaches for data imputation and feature space homogenization to achieve optimal performance. The proposed strategies emphasize data enhancement techniques, offering a broadly applicable framework for improving machine learning performance on scarce, inhomogeneous datasets.</description>
