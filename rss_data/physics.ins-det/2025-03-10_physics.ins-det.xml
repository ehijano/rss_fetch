      <title>Development and Benchmarking of JANGOFETT: A Novel Geant4-Operated Fission Event Tracking Tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments measuring fission observables encounter false coincidences arising from timing overlap of separate fission product decays. Simulations of both fission observables and particles in detector systems exist, but have not yet been combined to produce accurate event-by-event outputs in a time-dependent manner. Geant4 is a powerful simulation tool for nuclear physics studies, but it does not handle multiple initial particles in a single simulation instance, nor does it feature high fidelity fission sampling. JANGOFETT: A Novel Geant4-Operated Fission Event Tracking Tool has been developed to address this challenge. The tool utilizes simulated fission data from an external program in conjunction with Geant4, which has been modified to produce a single timeline of events over an entire simulated experiment. The physical accuracy of the simulated overlapping energy depositions within detectors has been verified via simulation of fission products from the spontaneous fission of 252Cf.</description>

      <title>PoWER: a new concept for DUNE Phase 2 FD PDS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel concept for the future modules of the DUNE Phase 2 Far Detector Photodetection System, namely the Polymer Wavelength shifter and Enhanced Reflection - PoWER. In this concept, the field cage of the LArTPC is entirely covered with polymeric wavelength shifting foils (PolyEthylene Naphthalate - PEN) to convert the liquid argon scintillation light from VUV to visible, and an Enhanced Specular Reflector (ESR) is installed on the membrane aiming to increase the number of reflections and consequently the detection probability. In addition, we use Light Detection Units (LDUs), which are a combination of standard and VUV-sensitive SiPM that can be used as an active veto for events occurring outside the field cage. We present a preliminary study using a Monte Carlo simulation, including a Light Map for photons generated inside the field cage and a demonstration of the active veto.</description>

      <title>Medusa 84 SiH -- A novel high Selectivity Electron Beam Resist for Diamond Quantum Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the novel electron beam resist Medusa 84 SiH by Allresist GmbH (Germany) for nanostructuring of single crystal diamond and its effects on the spin properties of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in nanopillars as prototypes for photonic structures. We find contrast curves comparable to those of resists previously used for this task (Hydrogensilsequioxane FOx). We present a minimum selectivity for diamond etching of 6$\pm$1. Using an adhesion-promoting silicon interlayer enables fabrication yields of up to 98\%. We measure $T_2$ times of up to $\sim$25 $\mu$s before and after processing, demonstrating that the manufactured structures are usable for diamond-based quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Towards a Study of Low Energy Antiproton Annihilations on Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A study of antiproton annihilations at rest on thin solid targets is underway at the ASACUSA facility, which now features a dedicated beam line for slow extraction at 250 eV. The experiment will employ new technologies, such as the Timepix4 ASICs coupled to silicon sensors, to measure the total multiplicity, energy, and angular distribution of various prongs produced in thin solid targets. A detection system consisting of seven Timepix4, covering most of the solid angle, is being constructed. A 3D annihilation vertex reconstruction algorithm from particle tracks in the single-plane detectors has been developed using Monte Carlo simulations. The measurements will enable a study of pbar-nucleus interactions, their dependence on nucleus mass and branching ratios. The results will be used to assess and potentially improve various simulation models.</description>

      <title>Quality assurance tests and techniques to investigate and improve hermeticity of ATLAS Phase II Resistive Plate Chamber detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Phase II upgrade of the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer will involve the installation of approximately 1000 next-generation Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC) singlets. This upgrade aims to enhance detector coverage, increase hit efficiency, and improve timing precision, ultimately strengthening the precision and robustness of the muon trigger system. The upgrade is essential for maintaining the performance of the muon spectrometer in the high-luminosity environment of the HL-LHC, where increased radiation and event rates pose significant challenges. Currently, detector production is underway, with gas gaps being commercially produced in Italy. To ensure the integrity of these gas gaps, especially their mechanical properties and gas tightness, several investigative techniques have been proposed and implemented.
  This study discusses the results of Thermal Cycling tests performed on ATLAS RPC gas gaps. These tests were conducted between $-33^{\circ}$C and $+35^{\circ}$C in a climate room at University of Cambridge and $-20^{\circ}$C and $+30^{\circ}$C in laboratories at INFN Frascati, providing insights into the effects of mechanical stress due to thermal expansion on gas leaks. Additionally, it outlines various methods employed to assess and enhance the gas tightness of the detectors. The ultimate objective is to produce hermetic RPC detectors, minimising the emission of environmentally harmful gases and mitigating their impact on global warming.</description>

      <title>The MACIV multiscale seismic experiments in the French Massif Central (2023-2027): deployment, data quality and availability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of the MACIV project, a consortium of French laboratories has deployed a temporary seismic network of 100 broadband stations in the French Massif Central (FMC) for 3-4 years (2023-2027). The project aims at imaging the crust and upper mantle of the FMC to better assess the sources of volcanism, and the impacts of the Variscan inheritance or the Cenozoic rift system on volcanic systems. A large-scale array of 35 broadband stations covers the entire FMC and complements the permanent networks to reach a homogeneous coverage with ~35 km spacing. This network, with XP code, is the French contribution to AdriaArray. The XP array is complemented with 3 quasi-linear north-south, east-west and northwest-southeast profiles with inter-station spacing of 5-20 km, making up the XF network of 65 stations. The profiles cross volcanic areas and the main Variscan structures. We describe the experimental setup designed to optimize the performance/cost ratio and minimize the number of field visits, the deployment, the state-of-health monitoring, the data management and the data quality control strategies, outcomes of our 15-years' experience with major temporary seismic experiments in France and neighboring countries, including AlpArray. We also show some preliminary results including hypocenter locations and receiver function analysis. The 2 broadband arrays will be supplemented in 2025 by a month-long deployment of 3 large-N dense arrays of 625 3-C short-period nodes. These dense arrays will complete our multi-scale seismic experiment and illuminate active faults and possible plumbing systems of the youngest volcanoes.</description>

      <title>Testbeam result and digitization of a Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors for CEPC vertex detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC), as the next-generation electron-positron collider, is tasked with advancing not only Higgs physics but also the discovery of new physics. Achieving these goals requires high-precision measurements of particles. Taichu seires, Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (MAPS), a key component of the vertex detector for CEPC was designed to meet the CEPC's requirements. For the geometry of vertex detector is long barrel with no endcap, and current silicon lacks a complete digitization model, precise estimation of cluster size particularly causing by particle with large incident angle is needed. Testbeam results were conducted at the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF) to evaluate cluster size dependence on different incident angles and threshold settings. Experimental results confirmed that cluster size increases with incident angle. Simulations using the Allpix$^2$ framework replicated experimental trends at small angles but exhibited discrepancies at large angles, suggesting limitations in linear electric field assumptions and sensor thickness approximations. The results from both testbeam and simulations have provided insights into the performance of the TaichuPix chip at large incident angles, offering a crucial foundation for the establishment of a digital model and addressing the estimation of cluster size in the forward region of the long barrel. Furthermore, it offers valuable references for future iterations of TaichuPix, the development of digital models, and the simulation and estimation of the vertex detector's performance.</description>

      <title>Geant4 and FLUKA Simulations of a Cyclotron Based 30 MeV Proton-Beryllium Reaction: Benchmarking and Optimization of Neutron Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For studies where a reliable neutron source/beam is required and a nuclear reactor is not a viable option (considering their high neutron flux supply, which may not be suitable for research concerning low flux operations), alternative approaches may be sought. This paper presents a comprehensive simulation analysis of 30 MeV 9Be(p,n)9B reaction, which can be utilized as an isotropic neutron source. Due to different underlying physics and transport mechanisms, slight variations in findings between Geant4 and FLUKA may occur, and hence may require one to have a guide at hand to address the differences and interpret the data more accurately before conducting the actual experiment. Through these Monte Carlo simulation toolkits, this work estimates resulting neutron fluence and dose equivalent of prompt gamma decays, as well as how materials such as paraffin and borated polyethylene moderates its energy spectrum. Furthermore, this work also presents an exemplar modular irradiation station designed for target-moderator configurations, with the capability of generating thermal neutron fields .</description>

      <title>Quantitative Determination of Spatial Resolution and Linearity of Position-Sensitive LG-SiPMs at Sub-Millimeter Scale via Ricean Distribution Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Position-sensitive SiPMs are useful in all light detection applications requiring a small number of readout channels while preserving the information about the incoming light's interaction position. Focusing on a 2x2 array of LG-SiPMs covering an area of $\sim 15.5 \times 15.5~\rm{mm}$ with just 6 readout channels, we proposed a quantitative method to evaluate image reconstruction performance. The method is based on a statistical approach to assess the device's precision (spatial resolution) and accuracy (linearity) in reconstructing the light spot center of gravity. This evaluation is achieved through a Rice probability distribution function fitting. We obtained an average sensor spatial resolution's best value of $81 \pm 3~\rm{\mu m}$ (standard deviation), which is achieved by reconstructing each position with the amplitude of the channels' output signals. The corresponding accuracy is $231 \pm 4~\rm{\mu m}$.</description>

      <title>Step-by-step design guide of a cryogenic three-axis vector magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A tunable magnetic field at low temperatures is essential for numerous applications, including spintronics, magnetic resonance imaging, and condensed matter physics. While commercial superconducting vector magnets are available, they are complex, expensive, and often not adaptable to specific experimental needs. As a result, simple in-house designs are often being used in research environments. However, no comprehensive step-by-step guide for their construction currently exists. In this work, we provide a detailed manual for designing and building a cryogenically compatible three-axis vector magnet. The system is tested at the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator at temperatures ranging from 15 mK to 4 K, with no significant increase in base temperature. Safety measures are implemented to mitigate heating from quenching. The coils are successfully driven with DC currents as high as 3 A, generating magnetic fields of up to 2.5 T. Magnetic field measurements using Hall sensors demonstrate good agreement with the predictions of the designed performance.</description>

      <title>Study of environment friendly gas mixtures for the Resistive Plate Chambers of the ATLAS phase-2 upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard gas mixture for the Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC), composed of C2H2F4/i-C4H10/SF6, allows the detector operation in avalanche mode, as required by the high-luminosity collider experiments. The gas density, the low current and the comfortable avalanche-streamer separation guarantee high detection efficiency, rate capability and slow detector ageing. The mixture has a high Global Warming Potential (GWP ~1430), primarily due to the presence of C2H2F4. The C2H2F4 and SF6 are not recommended for industrial uses anymore, thus their availability will be increasingly difficult over time and the search for an alternative gas mixture is then of absolute priority. CERN is also driving efforts to reduce these gases, as they contribute significantly to the LHC greenhouse gas emissions. The thin 1 mm gas gap foreseen for the ATLAS upgrade of the latter requires a high-density in order to achieve high efficiency, due to the less active target available for the primary ionization. The mixture should also guarantee good timing performance and ensure the detector longevity. In this paper, the results obtained on a RPC operated with alternative gas mixtures are shown, following two different approaches. The first study consists of the replacement of the C2H2F4 with a mixture of C3H2F4/CO2 (GWP~200). The second approach consists in adding a modest fraction of CO2 in the standard gas, with the aim to reduce the C2H2F4 emissions. The paper provides a detailed study of efficiency, time resolution, and current under different irradiation backgrounds.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This proceeding provides an expanded overview of the Fast Interaction Trigger (FIT) system performance, focusing on new developments such as the prospective integration of the ALICE Low-Level Front-End Device (ALFRED) into the Detector Control System (DCS) and an upgraded Front-End Electronics (FEE) approach to enhance dynamic range and operational reliability. The first upgrade is dedicated to integrating FIT with ALICE central systems, while the second aims to improve signal processing from the scintillation arrays (FV0 and FDD). Additionally, we propose forward-detector applications in future ALICE upgrades (Run 5 and beyond).
  We also present the latest performance results, illustrated with relevant plots, including collision-time measurements for pp and Pb--Pb collision systems, collision centrality determination based on the amplitude signals from the FT0 detector, trigger performance metrics, and the improved DCS architecture.</description>

      <title>Triplet assembly and certification of the new generation of RPC for the ATLAS phase-2 upgrade at Max Planck Institute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new generation of Resistive Plate Chambers have been developed for the ATLAS phase-2 upgrade in sight of the High-Luminosity phase of the Large Hadron Collider. These RPCs consist of three independent 1 mm gas gaps(singlets) equipped with a newly low-threshold Front-End electronics, assembled in the same mechanical structure (triplet). During 2024 the production of the phase-2 RPCs started and the detectors will undergo (2024-2025) a certification test before the installation in the ATLAS cavern. The triplet assembly and the certification with cosmic rays of the BIS-type detectors is performed at the Max-Planck-Institute for Physics (MPI) in Munich. The architecture of the cosmic rays test stand has been built at MPI and has been studied in order to provide an efficient and robust structure to ensure an excellent quality control and study precisely the whole RPC performance needed to certify the detectors for the ATLAS experiment. In this presentation the assembly procedure, the architecture of the test stand and the certification protocols will be presented along with the validation tests to characterize the RPC performance.</description>

Abstract: Mode competition in nonequilibrium Rydberg gases enables the exploration of emergent many-body phases. This work leverages this emergent phase for electric field detection at room temperature. Sensitive frequency-resolved electric field measurements at very low-frequencies (VLF) are of central importance in a wide range of applications where deep-penetration is required in communications, navigation and imaging or surveying. The long wavelengths on order of 10-100 km (3-30 kHz) limit the efficiency, sensitivity, and bandwidth of compact classical detectors that are constrained by the Chu limit. Rydberg-atom electrometers are an attractive approach for microwave electric-field sensors but have reduced sensitivity at lower-frequencies. Very recent efforts to advance the standard Rydberg-atoms approach is based on DC electric-field (E-field) Stark shifting and have resulted in sensitivities between 67.9-2.2 uVcm-1Hz-1/2 (0.1-10 kHz) by fine optimization of the DC E-field. A major challenge in these approaches is the need for embedded electrodes or plates due to DC E-field Stark screening effect, which can perturb coupling of VLF signals when injected from external sources. In this article, it is demonstrated that state-of-art sensitivity (~1.6-2.3 uVcm-1Hz-1/2) can instead be achieved using limit-cycle oscillations in driven-dissipative Rydberg atoms by using a magnetic field (B-field) to develop mode-competition between nearby Rydberg states. The mode-competition between nearby Rydberg-states develop an effective transition centered at the oscillation frequency capable of supporting external VLF E-field coupling in the ~10-15kHz regime without the requirement for fine optimization of the B-field magnitude.</description>

Abstract: Soft X-ray experiments at synchrotron light sources are essential for a wide range of research fields. However, commercially available detectors for this energy range often cannot deliver the necessary combination of quantum efficiency, signal-to-noise ratio, dynamic range, speed, and radiation hardness within a single system. While hybrid detectors have addressed these challenges effectively in the hard X-ray regime, specifically with single photon counting pixel detectors extensively used in high-performance synchrotron applications, similar solutions are desired for energies below 2 keV.
  In this work, we introduce the first single-photon-counting hybrid pixel detector capable of detecting X-ray energies as low as 550 eV, utilizing the internal amplification of Low-Gain Avalanche Diode (LGAD) sensors. This detector is thoroughly characterized in terms of Signal-to-Noise Ratio and Detective Quantum Efficiency. We demonstrate its capabilities through ptychographic imaging at MAX IV 4th generation synchrotron light source at the Fe L$_3$-edge (707 eV), showcasing the enhanced detection performance of the system. This development sets a new benchmark for soft X-ray applications at synchrotrons, paving the way for significant advancements in imaging and analysis at lower photon energies.</description>

      <title>First search for dark photon dark matter with a MADMAX prototype</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02368</link>

Abstract: We report the first result from a dark photon dark matter search in the mass range from ${78.62}$ to $83.95~\mathrm{\mu eV}/c^2$ with a dielectric haloscope prototype for MADMAX (Magnetized Disc and Mirror Axion eXperiment). Putative dark photons would convert to observable photons within a stack consisting of three sapphire disks and a mirror. The emitted power of this system is received by an antenna and successively digitized using a low-noise receiver. No dark photon signal has been observed. Assuming unpolarized dark photon dark matter with a local density of $\rho_{\chi}=0.3~\mathrm{GeV/cm^3}$ we exclude a dark photon to photon mixing parameter $\chi &gt; 2.7 \times 10^{-12}$ over the full mass range and $\chi &gt; 1.1 \times 10^{-13}$ at a mass of $80.57~\mathrm{\mu eV}/c^2$ with a 95\% confidence level. This is the first physics result from a MADMAX prototype and exceeds previous constraints on $\chi$ in this mass range by up to almost three orders of magnitude.</description>
