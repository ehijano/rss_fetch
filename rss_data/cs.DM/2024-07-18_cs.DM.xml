      <title>Algorithmic methods of finite discrete structures. Automorphism of Nonseparable Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The monography examines the problem of constructing a group of automorphisms of a graph. A graph automorphism is a mapping of a set of vertices onto itself that preserves adjacency. The set of such automorphisms forms a vertex group of a graph or simply a graph group. The basis for constructing a group of graph automorphisms is the concept of orbit. The construction of an orbit is closely related to the quantitative assessment of a vertex or edge of a graph, called weight. To determine the weight of an element, graph invariants built on the spectrum of edge cuts and the spectrum of edge cycles are used. The weight of the graph elements allows identifying generating cycles and forming orbits. Examples are given of constructing a group of automorphisms for some types of graphs.</description>

      <title>Optimal Padded Decomposition For Bounded Treewidth Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A $(\beta,\delta,\Delta)$-padded decomposition of an edge-weighted graph $G = (V,E,w)$ is a stochastic decomposition into clusters of diameter at most $\Delta$ such that for every vertex $v\in V$, the probability that $\rm{ball}_G(v,\gamma\Delta)$ is entirely contained in the cluster containing $v$ is at least $e^{-\beta\gamma}$ for every $\gamma \in [0,\delta]$. Padded decompositions have been studied for decades and have found numerous applications, including metric embedding, multicommodity flow-cut gap, muticut, and zero extension problems, to name a few. In these applications, parameter $\beta$, called the padding parameter, is the most important parameter since it decides either the distortion or the approximation ratios. For general graphs with $n$ vertices, $\beta = \Theta(\log n)$. Klein, Plotkin, and Rao showed that $K_r$-minor-free graphs have padding parameter $\beta = O(r^3)$, which is a significant improvement over general graphs when $r$ is a constant. A long-standing conjecture is to construct a padded decomposition for $K_r$-minor-free graphs with padding parameter $\beta = O(\log r)$. Despite decades of research, the best-known result is $\beta = O(r)$, even for graphs with treewidth at most $r$. In this work, we make significant progress toward the aforementioned conjecture by showing that graphs with treewidth $\rm{tw}$ admit a padded decomposition with padding parameter $O(\log \rm{tw})$, which is tight. As corollaries, we obtain an exponential improvement in dependency on treewidth in a host of algorithmic applications: $O(\sqrt{ \log n \cdot \log(\rm{tw})})$ flow-cut gap, max flow-min multicut ratio of $O(\log(\rm{tw}))$, an $O(\log(\rm{tw}))$ approximation for the 0-extension problem, an $\ell^{O(\log n)}_\infty$ embedding with distortion $O(\log \rm{tw})$, and an $O(\log \rm{tw})$ bound for integrality gap for the uniform sparsest cut.</description>

      <title>A Unified Model of Congestion Games with Priorities: Two-Sided Markets with Ties, Finite and Non-Affine Delay Functions, and Pure Nash Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of equilibrium concepts in congestion games and two-sided markets with ties has been a primary topic in game theory, economics, and computer science. Ackermann, Goldberg, Mirrokni, R\"oglin, V\"ocking (2008) gave a common generalization of these two models, in which a player more prioritized by a resource produces an infinite delay on less prioritized players. While presenting several theorems on pure Nash equilibria in this model, Ackermann et al.\ posed an open problem of how to design a model in which more prioritized players produce a large but finite delay on less prioritized players. In this paper, we present a positive solution to this open problem by combining the model of Ackermann et al.\ with a generalized model of congestion games due to Bil\`o and Vinci (2023). In the model of Bil\`o and Vinci, the more prioritized players produce a finite delay on the less prioritized players, while the delay functions are of a specific kind of affine function, and all resources have the same priorities. By unifying these two models, we achieve a model in which the delay functions may be finite and non-affine, and the priorities of the resources may be distinct. We prove some positive results on the existence and computability of pure Nash equilibria in our model, which extend those for the previous models and support the validity of our model.</description>

      <title>Towards Lower Bounds on the Depth of ReLU Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.14835v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We contribute to a better understanding of the class of functions that can be represented by a neural network with ReLU activations and a given architecture. Using techniques from mixed-integer optimization, polyhedral theory, and tropical geometry, we provide a mathematical counterbalance to the universal approximation theorems which suggest that a single hidden layer is sufficient for learning any function. In particular, we investigate whether the class of exactly representable functions strictly increases by adding more layers (with no restrictions on size). As a by-product of our investigations, we settle an old conjecture about piecewise linear functions by Wang and Sun (2005) in the affirmative. We also present upper bounds on the sizes of neural networks required to represent functions with logarithmic depth.</description>

      <title>Concatenation trees: A framework for efficient universal cycle and de Bruijn sequence constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classic cycle-joining techniques have found widespread application in creating universal cycles for a diverse range of combinatorial objects, such as shorthand permutations, weak orders, orientable sequences, and various subsets of $k$-ary strings, including de Bruijn sequences. In the most favorable scenarios, these algorithms operate with a space complexity of $O(n)$ and require $O(n)$ time to generate each symbol in the sequences. In contrast, concatenation-based methods have been developed for a limited selection of universal cycles. In each of these instances, the universal cycles can be generated far more efficiently, with an amortized time complexity of $O(1)$ per symbol, while still using $O(n)$ space.
  This paper introduces $\mathit{concatenation~trees}$, which serve as the fundamental structures needed to bridge the gap between cycle-joining constructions based on the pure cycle register and corresponding concatenation-based approaches. They immediately demystify the relationship between the classic Lyndon word concatenation construction of de Bruijn sequences and a corresponding cycle-joining based construction. To underscore their significance, concatenation trees are applied to construct universal cycles for shorthand permutations and weak orders in $O(1)$-amortized time per symbol. Moreover, we provide insights as to how similar results can be obtained for other universal cycles including cut-down de Bruijn sequences and orientable sequences.</description>

      <title>Membership problems in nilpotent groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study both the Submonoid Membership problem and the Rational Subset Membership problem in finitely generated nilpotent groups. We give two reductions with important applications. First, Submonoid Membership in any nilpotent group can be reduced to Rational Subset Membership in smaller groups. As a corollary, we prove the existence of a group with decidable Submonoid Membership and undecidable Rational Subset Membership, confirming a conjecture of Lohrey and Steinberg. Second, the Rational Subset Membership problem in $H_3(\mathbb Z)$ can be reduced to the Knapsack problem in the same group, and is therefore decidable. Combining both results, we deduce that the filiform $3$-step nilpotent group has decidable Submonoid Membership.</description>
