      <title>Hollow polytopes with many vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, a hollow polytope has vertices in $S$ but contains no other point of $S$ in its interior. We prove upper and lower bounds on the maximum number of vertices of hollow polytopes whose facets are simplices or whose vertices are in general position. We also obtain relatively tight asymptotic bounds for polytopes which do not contain lattice segments of large length.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically CAT(0) metrics, Z-structures, and the Farrell-Jones Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that colorable hierarchically hyperbolic groups (HHGs) admit asymptotically CAT(0) metrics, that is, roughly, metrics where the CAT(0) inequality holds up to sublinear error in the size of the triangle.
  We use the asymptotically CAT(0) metrics to construct contractible simplicial complexes and compactifications that provide $\mathcal{Z}$-structures in the sense of Bestvina and Dranishnikov. It was previously unknown that mapping class groups are asymptotically CAT(0) and admit $\mathcal{Z}$-structures. As an application, we prove that many HHGs satisfy the Farrell--Jones Conjecture, including extra large-type Artin groups.
  To construct asymptotically CAT(0) metrics, we show that hulls of finitely many points in a colorable HHGs can be approximated by CAT(0) cube complexes in a way that adding a point to the finite set corresponds, up to finitely many hyperplanes deletions, to a convex embedding.</description>

      <title>Small genus, small index critical points of the systole function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper the index of a family of critical points of the systole function on Teichm\"uller space is calculated. The members of this family are interesting in that their existence implies the existence of strata in the Thurston spine for which the systoles do not determine a basis for the homology of the surface. Previously, index calculations of critical points with this pathological feature were impossible, because the only known examples were in surfaces with huge genus.
  A related concept is that of a ``minimal filling subset'' of the systoles at the critical point. Such minimal filling sets are studied, as they relate to the dimension of the Thurston spine near the critical point. We find an example of a minimal filling set of simple closed geodesics in genus 5 with cardinality 8, that are presumably realised as systoles. More generally, we determine the smallest and largest cardinality of a minimal filling set related to a tesselation of a hyperbolic surface by regular, right-angled $m$-gons for $m \in \{ 5, 6, 7 \}$. For this, we use integer linear programming together with a hand-tailored symmetry breaking technique.</description>
