      <title>Crystal Collimation Cleaning Measurements with 6.5 TeV protons in the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safe disposal of beam halo is a fundamental requirement of modern superconductive hadron colliders to reduce thermal load on magnets and background to experimental detectors. In the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) a multistage system fully compliant with the needs of the baseline operation was build. At a later stage, two short bent crystals were interleaved to the devices for betatron collimation to investigate efficiency enhancement of the halo disposal when inserting them as primary stages of the collimation hierarchy. Each crystal was mounted on a high--accuracy angular actuator, called goniometer, and installed in the clockwise Beam 1, one for the horizontal and one for the vertical plane. In this paper, measurements of the cleaning performance at collision energy with and without inserting crystals in the standard collimation schemes are discussed; the results are compared to theoretical expectations.</description>

      <title>Dechanneling Population at Extreme Crystal Bending with 6.5 TeV Proton Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beam measurements with bent crystals, installed in the Large Hadron Collider to assist multistage collimation system, provided information on hadron interactions with crystals in the multi-TeV energy range. In particular, the dechanneling population was observed through scans of deflected halo with collimators. Taking advantage of the fact that crystals with different values of curvature radii were present, the dependence of dechanneling on bending radius (R) was recorded. Dechanneling was found to be enhanced in crystals with smaller bending radius, because it is too close to the critical value R_c at the LHC energy of 6.5 TeV where channeling is lost. Data analysis and comparison to simulation results provided a better understanding of the phenomena and could be used to define specifications for more performing crystals in future upgrades of the crystal collimation system.</description>

      <title>ILC250 Cost Update -- 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00353v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The International Linear Collider was conceived as a global project for an energy-frontier electron-positron collider.It employs superconducting RF and nano-beam technologies with a center-of-mass energy of 500 GeV. Its cost was estimated in 2013, based on the Technical Design Report published in 2013.Japan's high-energy community proposed to host the ILC in Japan as a Higgs boson factory at 250 GeV in its first phase, and a revised cost estimate was conducted in 2017 to host it in Japan. However, due to global price increases and currency fluctuations that emerged afterward, the 2017 estimate is now outdated. A new cost evaluation has therefore been performed, according for global inflation tends, exchange rate shifts, and recent experiences in SRF based accelerators. This report describes the cost update performed in 2024. The cost update is included in the ILC Status Report in May 2025, contributing to the ongoing 2026 update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics.</description>

      <title>Observation and Interpretation of Field Emission Saturation Induced by an Ultra-fast Intense Terahertz Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Field emission under ultra-fast intense terahertz fields provides a promising approach for generating electron bunches with ultrashort pulse duration and high charge densities. It is generally believed that the field emission current described by traditional field emission theory increases dramatically with the applied electric field. However, we conducted extensive field emission experiments using quasi-single-cycle strong-field terahertz radiation at various energy levels and different temperatures and observed an intriguing phenomenon where the emitted charge reached saturation. A novel model is proposed to interpret this phenomenon, which considers the contribution of surface valence electrons and the dynamic replenishment of free electrons from the bulk to the surface. The experimentally observed convex relationship between the emitted charge and terahertz energy is consistent with the model prediction, unlike the concave relationship derived from the traditional field emission formula. In addition, another observed counter-intuitive phenomenon, the inverse correlation between the cathode temperature and saturated emission charge, is also well interpreted by the model. This work offers comprehensive insights into field emission dynamics under ultra-fast intense fields, paving the way for generating electron bunches with unprecedented temporal resolution.</description>
