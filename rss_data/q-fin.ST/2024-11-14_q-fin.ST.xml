      <title>New approaches of the DCC-GARCH residual: Application to foreign exchange rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two formulations are proposed to filter out correlations in the residuals of the multivariate GARCH model. The first approach is to estimate the correlation matrix as a parameter and transform any joint distribution to have an arbitrary correlation matrix. The second approach transforms time series data into an uncorrelated residual based on the eigenvalue decomposition of a correlation matrix. The empirical performance of these methods is examined through a prediction task for foreign exchange rates and compared with other methodologies in terms of the out-of-sample likelihood. By using these approaches, the DCC-GARCH residual can be almost independent.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Vector Auto Regression and Neural Network Model for Order Flow Imbalance Prediction in High Frequency Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high frequency trading, accurate prediction of Order Flow Imbalance (OFI) is crucial for understanding market dynamics and maintaining liquidity. This paper introduces a hybrid predictive model that combines Vector Auto Regression (VAR) with a simple feedforward neural network (FNN) to forecast OFI and assess trading intensity. The VAR component captures linear dependencies, while residuals are fed into the FNN to model non-linear patterns, enabling a comprehensive approach to OFI prediction. Additionally, the model calculates the intensity on the Buy or Sell side, providing insights into which side holds greater trading pressure. These insights facilitate the development of trading strategies by identifying periods of high buy or sell intensity. Using both synthetic and real trading data from Binance, we demonstrate that the hybrid model offers significant improvements in predictive accuracy and enhances strategic decision-making based on OFI dynamics. Furthermore, we compare the hybrid models performance with standalone FNN and VAR models, showing that the hybrid approach achieves superior forecasting accuracy across both synthetic and real datasets, making it the most effective model for OFI prediction in high frequency trading.</description>

      <title>FinRobot: AI Agent for Equity Research and Valuation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As financial markets grow increasingly complex, there is a rising need for automated tools that can effectively assist human analysts in equity research, particularly within sell-side research. While Generative AI (GenAI) has attracted significant attention in this field, existing AI solutions often fall short due to their narrow focus on technical factors and limited capacity for discretionary judgment. These limitations hinder their ability to adapt to new data in real-time and accurately assess risks, which diminishes their practical value for investors.
  This paper presents FinRobot, the first AI agent framework specifically designed for equity research. FinRobot employs a multi-agent Chain of Thought (CoT) system, integrating both quantitative and qualitative analyses to emulate the comprehensive reasoning of a human analyst. The system is structured around three specialized agents: the Data-CoT Agent, which aggregates diverse data sources for robust financial integration; the Concept-CoT Agent, which mimics an analysts reasoning to generate actionable insights; and the Thesis-CoT Agent, which synthesizes these insights into a coherent investment thesis and report. FinRobot provides thorough company analysis supported by precise numerical data, industry-appropriate valuation metrics, and realistic risk assessments. Its dynamically updatable data pipeline ensures that research remains timely and relevant, adapting seamlessly to new financial information. Unlike existing automated research tools, such as CapitalCube and Wright Reports, FinRobot delivers insights comparable to those produced by major brokerage firms and fundamental research vendors. We open-source FinRobot at \url{https://github. com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinRobot}.</description>
