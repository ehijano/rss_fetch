      <title>A Trifecta of Modelling Tools: Navigating COMPAS, Shark and Bayesian Inference for Binary Black Hole Model Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) have revealed surprising properties of binary black hole (BBH) populations, but there is still mystery surrounding how these compact objects evolve. We apply Bayesian inference and an efficient method to calculate the BBH merger rates in the Shark host galaxies, to determine the combination of COMPAS parameters that outputs a population most like the GW sources from the LVK transient catalogue. For our COMPAS models, we calculate the likelihood with and without the dependence on the predicted number of BBH merger events. We find strong correlations between hyper-parameters governing the specific angular momentum (AM) of mass lost during mass transfer, the mass-loss rates of Wolf--Rayet stars via winds and the chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) formation channel. We conclude that analysing the marginalised and unmarginalised likelihood is a good indicator of whether the population parameters distribution and number of observed events reflect the LVK data. In doing so, we see that the majority of the models preferred in terms of the population-level parameters of the BBHs greatly overpredict the number of events we should have observed to date. Looking at the smaller number of models which perform well with both likelihoods, we find that those with no CHE, AM loss occurring closer to the donor during the first mass-transfer event, and/or higher rates of mass-loss from Wolf--Rayet winds are generally preferred by current data. We find these conclusions to be robust to our choice of selection criteria.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Suppression of Cosmic Rays' Flux in $\boldsymbol{f(R)}$ and $\boldsymbol{f(Q)}$ Theories of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of magnetic diffusion on the spectrum of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) from a cosmological perspective. To this end, we consider two modified theories of gravity (MTGs), namely, the $f(R)$ gravity and a symmetric teleparallel gravity, also known as $f(Q)$ gravity. Utilizing these two MTGs, we calculate the suppression in the flux of UHECRs for a collection of sources. Non-evolution (NE) and cosmic star formation rate (SFR) scenarios have been considered in our calculation of the suppression factor. This study also includes a mixed composition scenario involving the nuclei upto iron (Fe). Furthermore, we provide a parameterization of the suppression factor for the proton and also for the mixed compositions within the $f(R)$ and $f(Q)$ theories, considering both NE and SFR scenarios. The influence of the turbulent magnetic field on the suppression factor is also incorporated in our work. Comparative analysis of all our results with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model reveals significant effects of MTGs on the suppression factor that the $f(R)$ power-law model predicts the lowest suppression factor, while the $f(Q)$ model predicts the highest, and interestingly the results from the standard model fall within the range predicted by these two cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Refining Galactic primordial black hole evaporation constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the role of primordial black holes (PBHs) as potential dark matter (DM) candidates, particularly focusing on light asteroid-mass PBHs. These PBHs are expected to emit particles through Hawking evaporation that can generate cosmic rays (CRs), eventually producing other secondary radiations through their propagation in the Milky Way, in addition to prompt emissions. Here, we perform a comprehensive analysis of CR signals resulting from PBH evaporation, incorporating the full CR transport to account for reacceleration and diffusion effects within the Milky Way. In particular, we revisit the $e^\pm$ flux produced by PBHs, using Voyager 1, and study for the first time the diffuse X-ray emission from the up-scattering of Galactic ambient photons due to PBH-produced $e^\pm$ via the inverse Compton effect using XMM-Newton data, as well as the morphological information of the diffuse 511 keV line measured by INTEGRAL/SPI. In doing so, we provide leading constraints on the fraction of DM that can be in form of PBHs in a conservative way, whilst also testing how different assumptions on spin and mass distributions affect our conclusions.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Inner 0.1 pc of a Supermassive Black Hole Environment with the Tidal Disruption Event and Extreme Coronal Line Emitter AT 2022upj</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme coronal line emitters (ECLEs) are objects showing transient high-ionization lines in the centers of galaxies. They have been attributed to echoes of high-energy flares of ionizing radiation, such as those produced by tidal disruption events (TDEs), but have only recently been observed within hundreds of days after an optical transient was detected. AT 2022upj is a nuclear UV-optical flare at z=0.054 with spectra showing [Fe X] {\lambda}6375 and [Fe XIV] {\lambda}5303 during the optical peak, the earliest presence of extreme coronal lines during an ongoing transient. AT 2022upj is also the second ever ECLE (and first with a concurrent flare) to show broad He II {\lambda}4686 emission, a key signature of optical/UV TDEs. We also detect X-ray emission during the optical transient phase, which may be related to the source of ionizing photons for the extreme coronal lines. Finally, we analyze the spectroscopic evolution of each emission line and find that [Fe X] and [Fe XIV] weaken within 400d of optical peak, while [Fe VII] {\lambda}5720, [Fe VII] {\lambda}6087, and [O III] {\lambda}{\lambda}4959,5007 emerge over the same period. The velocities of the iron lines indicate circumnuclear gas within 0.1pc of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH), while a dust echo inferred from NEOWISE data indicates that circumnuclear dust lies at a minimum of 0.4pc away, providing evidence of stratified material around a SMBH. AT 2022upj is the first confirmed ECLE-TDE with clear signatures of both classes. This event's spectroscopic evolution on a $\sim$year unveils the impact of highly energetic flares such as TDEs on the complex environments around SMBHs.</description>

      <title>Quiescent black hole X-ray binaries as multi-messenger sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) are of unknown origin, even though they have traditionally been connected to supernovae due to energetic arguments. In the last decades, Galactic black holes in X-ray binaries (BHXBs) have been proposed as candidate sources of CRs revising the CR paradigm. BHXBs launch two relativistic jets during outbursts, but recent observations suggest that such jets may be launched even during quiescence. A0620-00 is such a well-studied object that shows hints of jet emission. In this work, we study the simultaneous radio-to-X-ray spectrum detected from this source while in quiescence to better constrain the jet dynamics. Given that the majority of BHXBs spend their lifetime in quiescence (qBHXBs), we use the jet dynamics of A0620-00 to study a population of 100000 such sources distributed throughout the Galactic disc, and a further 10000 located in the Boxy Bulge around the Galactic centre. While the contribution to the CR spectrum is suppressed, we find that the cumulative intrinsic emission of qBHXBs from both the Boxy Bulge and the Galactic disc adds to the diffuse emission that various facilities detect from radio to TeV gamma rays. We examine the contribution of qBHXBs to the Galactic diffuse emission and investigate the possibility of SKA, INTEGRAL and CTAO to detect individual sources in the future. Finally, we compare the predicted neutrino flux to the recently presented Galactic diffuse neutrino emission by IceCube.</description>

      <title>An IXPE-Led X-ray Spectro-Polarimetric Campaign on the Soft State of Cygnus X-1: X-ray Polarimetric Evidence for Strong Gravitational Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first X-ray spectropolarimetric results for Cygnus X-1 in its soft state from a campaign of five IXPE observations conducted during 2023 May-June. Companion multiwavelength data during the campaign are likewise shown. The 2-8 keV X-rays exhibit a net polarization degree PD=1.99%+/-0.13% (68% confidence). The polarization signal is found to increase with energy across IXPE's 2-8 keV bandpass. The polarized X-rays exhibit an energy-independent polarization angle of PA=-25.7+/-1.8 deg. East of North (68% confidence). This is consistent with being aligned to Cyg X-1's AU-scale compact radio jet and its pc-scale radio lobes. In comparison to earlier hard-state observations, the soft state exhibits a factor of 2 lower polarization degree, but a similar trend with energy and a similar (also energy-independent) position angle. When scaling by the natural unit of the disk temperature, we find the appearance of a consistent trendline in the polarization degree between soft and hard states. Our favored polarimetric model indicates Cyg X-1's spin is likely high (a* above ~0.96). The substantial X-ray polarization in Cyg X-1's soft state is most readily explained as resulting from a large portion of X-rays emitted from the disk returning and reflecting off the disk surface, generating a high polarization degree and a polarization direction parallel to the black hole spin axis and radio jet. In IXPE's bandpass, the polarization signal is dominated by the returning reflection emission. This constitutes polarimetric evidence for strong gravitational lensing of X-rays close to the black hole.</description>

      <title>The XMM-Newton and NuSTAR view of IRASF11119+3257. I Detection of multiple UFO components and a very cold corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IRASF11119 is an ultra-luminous IR galaxy with post-merger morphology, hosting a type-1 QSO at z=0.189. Its 2013 Suzaku spectrum shows a prominent Ultra Fast Outflow (UFO) absorption feature (v_out~0.25c). In 2021, we obtained the first XMM-Newton long look of the target, coordinated with a simultaneous NuSTAR observation. The new high-quality data allow us to detect at P&gt;99.8% c.l. multiple absorption features associated with the known UFO. Furthermore, an emission plus absorption feature at 1.1-1.3 keV reveals the presence of a blueshifted P-Cygni profile in the soft band. We associate the hard band features with blends of FeXXV and FeXXVI He$\alpha$-Ly$\alpha$ and He$\beta$-Ly$\beta$ line pairs and infer a large column (N$_H$~$10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) of highly ionized (log$\xi$~5) gas outflowing at v_out=0.27c. The 1 keV feature can be associated with a blend of Fe and Ne transitions, produced by a lower column (N$_H$~$10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$) and ionization (log$\xi$~2.6) gas component outflowing at the same speed. Using a radiative-transfer disk wind model to fit the highly ionized UFO, we derive a large mass outflow rate, comparable with the mass accretion rate (M$_{out}$=4.25 M$_{Sun}$/yr, ~1.6 M$_{acc}$), and kinetic energy and momentum flux among the highest reported in the literature. We measure an extremely low high-energy cut-off (E$_c$~25 keV). Several other cases in the literature suggest that a steep X-ray continuum may be related to the formation of powerful winds. The lack of a significant momentum boost between the nuclear UFO and the different phases of the large-scale outflow, observed in IRASF11119 and in a growing number of sources with powerful UFOs, can be explained by (i) a momentum-driven expansion, (ii) an inefficient coupling of the UFO with the host ISM, or (iii) by repeated energy-driven expansion episodes with low duty-cycle, that average out on long time-scales.</description>

      <title>Conditions for Changing-Look AGNs from Accretion Disk-Induced Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of changing-look (CL) behavior in active galactic nuclei (AGN) is characterized by dramatic changes in luminosity and/or emission line profiles over relatively short periods, ranging from months to years. The origin of CL-AGNs remains a mystery, but one proposed explanation involves the response of the inner AGN disk to tidal disruption events (TDEs) around the supermassive black hole (SMBH). In this Letter, we calculate the predicted frequency of AGN TDEs as a function of SMBH mass and compare the results to the observed CL-AGN distribution. We find that if the fraction of CL-AGNs caused by AGN-TDEs is high, then: (1) most SMBHs in CL-AGN are near maximal spin, with the dimensionless spin parameter $a&gt;0.9$; (2) AGN inner disks have a high surface density ($\geq 10^{7}\, {\rm g\, cm^{-2}}$); (3) typical AGN lifetimes are $\sim 10$-$100$ Myr; and (4) a nuclear star cluster initial mass function (IMF) that scales as $\sim m_*^{-1.6}$ is preferred. Future observations of CL-AGN will help constrain the fraction of CL-AGNs caused by AGN-TDEs, SMBH spins, AGN lifetimes, and the nuclear star cluster IMF.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive comparison of spin-up and spin-down episodes of 4U 1538-522 observed with NuSTAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 4U 1538-522 is a persistent high mass X-ray binary which exhibits secular spin evolution. In 2019, it underwent a torque reversal from spinning up to spinning down. We performed an extensive study using four NuSATR observations to compare temporal and spectral properties during different states. We observed no abrupt change in luminosity associated with the torque reversal. In addition, the pulse profile, the spectral shape and the power spectrum remained unchanged before and after the torque reversal. The orbital and super-orbital modulation profiles also showed no significant changes. We discuss possible mechanisms for the torque reversal and conclude that it is unlikely to be caused by interactions between the accretion disk and the magnetosphere. Instead, the transition of accretion modes in spherical accretion may be a plausible explanation.</description>

      <title>Scintillation velocity and arc observations of FRB 20201124A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the scintillation velocity measurements of FRB~20201124A from the FAST observations, which reveal an annual variation. This annual variation is further supported by changes detected in the scintillation arc as observed from the secondary spectrum. We attribute the annual velocity variation to the presence of a moderately anisotropic scattering screen located at a distance of 0.4$\pm$0.1~kpc from Earth. Our results prove that the scintillation of this FRB is mainly caused by material close to Earth on a Galactic scale. However, scintillation observations of other FRBs may expose their surrounding environment or uncover possible orbital motion if scintillation is caused by materials in their host galaxy.</description>

      <title>Merger Precursor: Year-long Transients Preceding Mergers of Low-mass Stripped Stars with Compact Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary mass transfer can occur at high rates due to rapid expansion of the donor's envelope. In the case where mass transfer is unstable, the binary can rapidly shrink its orbit and lead to a merger. In this work we consider the appearance of the system preceding merger, specifically for the case of a low-mass ($\approx 2.5$-$3~M_\odot$) helium star with a neutron star (NS) companion. Modeling the mass transfer history as well as the wind launched by super-Eddington accretion onto the NS, we find that such systems can power slowly rising transients with timescales as long as years, and luminosities of $\sim 10^{40}$-$10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$ from optical to UV. The final explosion following the merger (or core-collapse of the helium star in some cases) leads to an interaction-powered transient with properties resembling Type Ibn supernovae (SNe), possibly with a bright early peak powered by shock cooling emission for merger-powered explosions. We apply our model to the Type Ibn SN 2023fyq, that displayed a long-term precursor activity from years before the terminal explosion.</description>

      <title>An atypical low-frequency QPO detected in the hard state of MAXI J1348-630 with $Insight$-HXMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the $Insight$-HXMT archival data, we have detected a new atypical low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (LFQPO) in the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1348$-$630. The new LFQPO is detected in all the three instruments of $Insight$-HXMT with a combined significance of 3--5 $\sigma$, covering a wide energy range of 1--100 keV. The fractional root-mean-square (RMS) seems decrease with energy. It exclusively appears in the hard state during both the main and mini outburst, spanning an X-ray intensity range by a factor of 10, and a very narrow hardness range. The frequency of this new type of LFQPO is moderately stable, in the range of 0.08--0.15 Hz. We discussed different models for the LFQPO, and found none is able to explain the observed properties of this new type of LFQPO.</description>

      <title>Transformer models for astrophysical time series and the GRB prompt-afterglow relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer models have recently become very successful in the natural language domain. Their value as sequence-to-sequence translators there, also makes them a highly interesting technique for learning relationships between astrophysical time series. Our aim is investigate how well such a transformer neural network can establish causal temporal relations between different channels of a single-source signal. We thus apply a transformer model to the two phases of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), reconstructing one phase from the other. GRBs are unique instances where a single process and event produces two distinct time variable phenomena: the prompt emission and the afterglow. We here investigate if a transformer model can predict the afterglow flux from the prompt emission. If successful, such a predictive scheme might then be distilled to the most important underlying physics drivers in the future. We combine the transformer model with a novel dense neural network setup to directly estimate the starting value of the prediction. We find that the transformer model can, in some instances, successfully predict different phases of canonical afterglows, including the plateau phase. Hence it is a useful and promising new astrophysical analysis technique. For the GRB test case, the method marginally exceeds the baseline model overall, but still achieves accurate recovery of the prompt-afterglow fluence-fluence correlation in reconstructed light curves. Despite this progress, we conclude that consistent improvement over the baseline model is not yet achieved for the GRB case. We discuss the future improvements in data and modeling that are required to identify new physical-relation parameters or new insights into the single process driving both GRB phases.</description>

      <title>The Galactic population of canonical pulsars II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsars are highly magnetized rotating neutron stars, emitting in a broad electromagnetic energy range. Reproducing the observed population of pulsars refines our understanding of their formation, evolution as well as radiation processes and geometry. In this paper, we improve our previous pulsar population synthesis by studying the impact of the Galactic gravitational potential and of the death line putting emphasis on the gamma-ray pulsar population. In order to elucidate the necessity of a death line, refined initial distributions for spin periods and radial positions at birth were implemented, elevating the sophistication of our previous simulations to the most recent state-of-the-art. Our pulsar population synthesis takes into account the secular evolution of a force-free magnetosphere and the magnetic field decay. The radio and gamma-ray emissions are modeled respectively by the polar cap geometry and the striped wind model. When simulating a cohort of ten million pulsars akin to previous endeavors, the integration of a death line proves essential for a better agreement with observational trends. Yet, discrepancies emerges when modeling a reduced ensemble of only one million pulsars, endowed with a higher birth rate. This divergence yields a remarkably refined $P-\dot{P}$ diagram, conspicuously with or without any delineating death line. Intriguingly, this observation suggests an overestimation of the ages of detected pulsars in existent data sets, thereby challenging the necessity of death lines in pulsar population synthesis. Validation through Kolmogorov-Smirnov testing underlines the statistical congruence between the spin period and spin period derivative distributions of both observations and simulations. Moreover simulations with a higher gamma-ray instrumental sensitivity show that the GeV excess in the Galactic centre could be of pulsar origin.</description>

      <title>Varying activity and the bursts properties of FRB 20240114A probed with GMRT down to 300 MHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Repeating fast radio bursts can exhibit a wide range of burst repetition rates, from none to hundreds of bursts per hour. Here, we report the detection and characteristics of 57 bursts from the recently discovered FRB 20240114A, observed with GMRT in the frequency ranges 300-500 MHz and 550-750 MHz. Majority of the bursts show narrow emission-bandwidth with $\Delta\nu/\nu \sim$ around 10 %. All of the bursts we detect are faint ($&lt;$10 Jy ms), and thus probe the lower end of the energy distribution. We determine the rate function for FRB 20240114A at 400 MHz, and downward drift rates at 400 and 650 MHz, and discuss our measurements in the context of the repeating FRB population. We observe sudden variations in the burst activity of FRB 20240114A over time. Our data as well as the other publicly available information on other observations of FRB 20240114A so far, there is an indication that FRB 20240114A potentially exhibit a chromaticity in its burst activity. While the burst properties of FRB 20240114A are similar to ther repeating FRBs, the frequency-dependent activity, if established, could provide crucial clues to the origin of repeating FRBs. We also place the most stringent 5$\sigma$ upper limits of 600 $\mu$Jy and 89 $\mu$Jy on any persistent radio source (PRS) associated with FRB 20240114A at 400 MHz and 650 MHz, respectively, and compare these with the luminosity of the known PRSs associated with FRB121102A and FRB190520B.</description>

      <title>A Tale of Two Black Holes: Multiband Gravitational-Wave Measurement of Recoil Kicks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-linear dynamics of General Relativity leave their imprint on remnants of black hole mergers in the form of a recoil ``kick''. The kick has profound astrophysical implications across the black hole mass range from stellar to super-massive. However, a robust measurement of the kick for generic binaries from gravitational-wave observations has proved so far to be extremely challenging. In this \emph{letter}, we demonstrate the prospects of measuring black hole kicks through a multiband gravitational-wave network consisting of space mission LISA, the current earth-based detector network and a third-generation detector. For two distinct cases of remnant black hole kick (68 km/s, 1006 km/s) emerging from near identical pre-merger configuration of GW190521 -- the first confirmed intermediate-mass black hole -- we find that the multiband network will recover with 90\% credible level the projection of the kick vector relative to the orbital plane within tens of km/s accuracy. Such precise measurement of the kick offer a new set of multi-messenger follow-ups and unprecedented tests of astrophysical formation channels.</description>

      <title>Spatial and Spectral Characterization of the Gravitational-wave Background with the PTA Optimal Statistic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have made tremendous progress and are now showing strong evidence for the gravitational-wave background (GWB). Further probing the origin and characteristics of the GWB will require more generalized analysis techniques. Bayesian methods are most often used but can be computationally expensive. On the other hand, frequentist methods, like the PTA Optimal Statistic (OS), are more computationally efficient and can produce results that are complementary to Bayesian methods, allowing for stronger statistical cases to be built from a confluence of different approaches. In this work we expand the capabilities of the OS through a technique we call the Per-Frequency Optimal Statistic (PFOS). The PFOS removes the underlying power-law assumption inherent in previous implementations of the OS, and allows one to estimate the GWB spectrum in a frequency-by-frequency manner. We have also adapted a recent generalization from the OS pipeline into the PFOS, making it capable of accurately characterizing the spectrum in the intermediate and strong GW signal regimes using only a small fraction of the necessary computational resources when compared with fully-correlated Bayesian methods, while also empowering many new types of analyses not possible before. We find that even in the strong GW signal regime, where the GWB dominates over noise in all frequencies, the injected value of the signal lies within the 50th-percentile of the PFOS uncertainty distribution in 41-45% of simulations, remaining 3$\sigma$-consistent with unbiased estimation.</description>

      <title>Be careful in multi-messenger inference of the Hubble constant: A path forward for robust inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-messenger observations of coalescing binary neutron stars (BNSs) are a direct probe of the expansion history of the universe and carry the potential to shed light on the disparity between low- and high-redshift measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$. To measure the value of $H_0$ with such observations requires pristine inference of the luminosity distance and the true source redshift with minimal impact from systematics. In this analysis, we carry out joint inference on mock gravitational wave (GW) signals and their electromagnetic (EM) afterglows from BNS coalescences and find that the inclination angle inferred from the afterglow light curve and apparent superluminal motion can be precise, but need not be accurate and is subject to systematic uncertainty that could be as large as $1.5\sigma$. This produces a disparity between the EM and GW inferred inclination angles, which if not carefully treated when combining observations can bias the inferred value of $H_0$. We also find that already small misalignments of $3^{\circ}-6^{\circ}$ between the inherent system inclinations for the GW and EM emission can bias the inference by $\mathcal{O}(1-2\sigma)$ if not taken into account. As multi-messenger BNS observations are rare, we must make the most out of a small number of events and harness the increased precision, while avoiding reduced accuracy. We demonstrate how to mitigate these potential sources of bias by jointly inferring the mismatch between the GW- and EM-based inclination angles and $H_0$.</description>

      <title>SDSS1335+0728: The awakening of a $\sim 10^6 M_{\odot}$ black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The galaxy SDSS1335+0728, which had exhibited no prior optical variations during the preceding two decades, began showing significant nuclear variability in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) alert stream from December 2019 (as ZTF19acnskyy). Its behaviour suggests that SDSS1335+0728 hosts a $\sim 10^6 M_{\odot}$ black hole (BH) that is currently in the process of `turning on'. We present a multi-wavelength photometric analysis and spectroscopic follow-up performed with the aim of better understanding the origin of the nuclear variations detected in SDSS1335+0728. We used archival photometry and spectroscopic data to study the state of SDSS1335+0728 prior to December 2019, and new observations from Swift, SOAR/Goodman, VLT/X-shooter, and Keck/LRIS taken after its turn-on to characterise its current state. We find that: (a) since 2021, the UV flux is four times brighter than the flux reported by GALEX in 2004; (b) since June 2022, the mid-infrared flux has risen more than two times, and the W1-W2 WISE colour has become redder; (c) since February 2024, the source has begun showing X-ray emission; (d) the narrow emission line ratios are now consistent with a more energetic ionising continuum; (e) broad emission lines are not detected; and (f) the [OIII] line increased its flux $\sim 3.6$ years after the first ZTF alert, which implies a relatively compact narrow-line-emitting region. We conclude that the variations observed in SDSS1335+0728 could be either explained by an AGN that is just turning on or by an exotic tidal disruption event (TDE). If the former is true, SDSS1335+0728 is one of the strongest cases of an AGN observed in the process of activating. If the latter, it would correspond to the longest and faintest TDE ever observed (or another class of still unknown nuclear transient). Future observations of SDSS1335+0728 are crucial to further understand its behaviour.</description>

      <title>Close Encounter of Three Black Holes III</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the three black hole scenario with numerical relativity techniques to study hierarchical configurations where the inner binary contains highly spinning black holes. We find that the merger time of the binary gets a delay (with a number of orbits to merger increase), depending strongly with the distance to the orbiting third hole $D$ as $\sim1/D^{1.6\pm0.1}$. Notably, a different dependence from what we had found in the nonspinning case, $\sim1/D^{2.5}$. We interpret this effect as mostly due to a spin-orbit coupling between the third hole and the closest member of the binary in the successive approaches. This lead us next to study scattering configurations of the third hole with the binary in order to evaluate the extent of this ``sudden'' interactions, finding also a correlation of the delay in merger times with the closest distance, even for the nonspinning cases. We then explore the mass ratio dependence of the triple system by modeling binaries orbiting a larger black hole bearing masses ratios 8:1:1 and 18:1:1 in co-orbiting or counter-orbiting configurations, finding merger times increasing with increasing mass ratios and for the counter-orbiting cases.</description>

      <title>Quasi-normal mode frequencies and gravitational perturbations of black holes with any subextremal spin in modified gravity through METRICS: the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational waves emitted in the ringdown phase of binary black-hole coalescence are a unique probe of strong gravity. Understanding how deviations from general relativity affect the ringdown phase of black holes, however, is extremely challenging, as it requires solving highly-coupled and sometimes higher-order partial differential equations. We here extend a novel approach, \textit{Metric pErTuRbations wIth speCtral methodS} (METRICS), to study the metric perturbations and the quasinormal mode frequencies of ringing black holes in modified gravity. We first derive the asymptotic behavior of metric perturbations at the event horizon and spatial infinity for rotating black holes beyond general relativity. We then extend the eigenvalue-perturbation theory approach of METRICS to allow us to compute the leading-order modified gravity corrections to the quasinormal-mode frequencies and metric perturbations. We apply METRICS to rotating black holes in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. Without decoupling or simplifying the linearized field equations in this theory, we compute the leading-order corrections to the quasinormal frequencies of the axial and polar perturbations of the $nlm = 022$, 021 and 033 modes of black holes of $a \leq 0.85$. The numerical accuracy of the METRICS frequencies is $\leq 10^{-5}$ for $a \leq 0.6$, $\lesssim 10^{-4}$ for $0.6 &lt; a \leq 0.7 $, and $\lesssim 10^{-2}$ for $0.7 &lt; a \leq 0.85 $ for all modes studied. We fit the frequencies as a polynomial in spin, whose coefficients (up to second order in spin) are consistent with those obtained in previous slow-rotating approximations. These results are the first accurate computations of the gravitational quasinormal-mode frequencies of rapidly rotating black holes (of $a \sim 0.85$) in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity.</description>

      <title>A monolithic first--order BSSNOK formulation of the Einstein--Euler equations and its solution with path-conservative finite difference CWENO schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new, monolithic first--order (both in time and space) BSSNOK formulation of the coupled Einstein--Euler equations. The entire system of hyperbolic PDEs is solved in a completely unified manner via one single numerical scheme applied to both the conservative sector of the matter part and to the first--order strictly non--conservative sector of the spacetime evolution. The coupling between matter and space-time is achieved via algebraic source terms. The numerical scheme used for the solution of the new monolithic first order formulation is a path-conservative central WENO (CWENO) finite difference scheme, with suitable insertions to account for the presence of the non--conservative terms. By solving several crucial tests of numerical general relativity, including a stable neutron star, Riemann problems in relativistic matter with shock waves and the stable long-time evolution of single and binary puncture black holes up and beyond the binary merger, we show that our new CWENO scheme, introduced two decades ago for the compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics, can be successfully applied also to numerical general relativity, solving all equations at the same time with one single numerical method. In the future the new monolithic approach proposed in this paper may become an attractive alternative to traditional methods that couple central finite difference schemes with Kreiss-Oliger dissipation for the space-time part with totally different TVD schemes for the matter evolution and which are currently the state of the art in the field.</description>

      <title>A two-minute burst of highly polarised radio emission originating from low Galactic latitude</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several sources of repeating coherent bursts of radio emission with periods of many minutes have now been reported in the literature. These ``ultra-long period'' (ULP) sources have no clear multi-wavelength counterparts and challenge canonical pulsar emission models, leading to debate regarding their nature. In this work we report the discovery of a bright, highly-polarised burst of radio emission at low Galactic latitude as part of a wide-field survey for transient and variable radio sources. ASKAP\,J175534.9$-$252749.1 does not appear to repeat, with only a single intense two-minute $\sim 200$\,mJy burst detected from 60~hours of observations. The burst morphology and polarisation properties are comparable to those of classical pulsars but the duration is more than one hundred times longer, analogous to ULPs. No comparable bursts are detected in the rest of our widefield survey to date. Combined with the existing ULP population, this suggests that these sources have a strong Galactic latitude dependence and hints at an unexplored population of transient and variable radio sources in the thin disk of the Milky Way. The resemblance of this burst with both ULPs and pulsars calls for a unified coherent emission model for objects with spin periods from milliseconds to tens of minutes. However, whether or not these are all neutron stars or have the same underlying power source remains open for debate.</description>

Abstract: We conduct an analysis of a $U(1)_{B-L}$ extended inert doublet model and obtained the parameter space allowing strong first order phase transitions. We show that a large part of the parameter space can cause double first-order phase transitions. Whereas both of these phase transitions can generate a detectable stochastic gravitational wave background, one of them can create primordial black holes with appreciable abundance. The primordial black holes generated at the high scale transition can account for the dark matter maintaining the correct relic abundance. We also show specific benchmark cases and their consequences from the aspect of primordial black holes and gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Constraining neutron star matter from $dM/dR$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the implications of information about local derivatives from the mass-radius diagram in neutron star matter. It is expected that the next generation of gravitational wave and electromagnetic detectors will allow the determination of the neutron star radius and mass with a small uncertainty. Observations of neutron stars clustered around a given neutron star mass allow the estimation of local derivatives in the $M(R)$ diagram, which can be used to constrain neutron star properties. From a model-independent description of the neutron star equation of state, it is shown that a $M(R)$ curve with a negative slope at 1.4$M_\odot$ predicts a $2M_\odot$ neutron star radius below 12 km. Furthermore, a maximum mass below 2.3$M_\odot$ is obtained if the $M(R)$ slope is negative in the whole range of masses above $1M_\odot$, and a maximum mass above 2.4$M_\odot$ requires the $M(R)$ slope to be positive in some range of masses. Constraints on the mass-radius curve of neutron stars will place strong constraints on microscopic models.</description>

      <title>Concurrent Accretion and Migration of Giant Planets in their Natal Disks with Consistent Accretion Torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Migration commonly occurs during the epoch of planet formation. For emerging gas giant planets, it proceeds concurrently with their growth through the accretion of gas from their natal protoplanetary disks. Similar migration process should also be applied to the stellar-mass black holes embedded in active galactic nucleus disks. In this work, we perform high resolution 3D and 2D numerical hydrodynamical simulations to study the migration dynamics for accreting embedded objects over the disk viscous timescales in a self-consistent manner. We find that an accreting planet embedded in a predominantly viscous disk has a tendency to migrate outward, in contrast to the inward orbital decay of non-accreting planets. 3D and 2D simulations find the consistent outward migration results for the accreting planets. Under this circumstance, the accreting planet's outward migration is mainly due to the asymmetric spiral arms feeding from the global disk into the Hill radius. This is analogous to the unsaturated corotation torque although the imbalance is due to material accretion within the libration timescale rather than diffusion onto the inner disk. In a disk with a relatively small viscosity, the accreting planets clear deep gaps near their orbits. The tendency of inward migration is recovered, albeit with suppressed rates. By performing a parameter survey with a range of disks' viscosity, we find that the transition from outward to inward migration occurs with the effective viscous efficiency factor $\alpha\sim 0.003$ for Jupiter-mass planets.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Thorne-\.{Z}ytkow Object Formation: Assembly via Common Envelope in Field Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thorne-\.{Z}ytkow objects (T\.{Z}Os), hypothetical merger products in which a neutron star is embedded in a stellar core, are traditionally considered steady-state configurations. Their assembly, especially through dynamical channels, is not well-understood. The predominant focus in the literature has been on the observational signatures related to the evolution and long-term fate of T\.{Z}Os, with their initial formation often treated as a given. However, the foundational calculations supporting the existence of T\.{Z}Os assume non-rotating spherically-symmetric initial conditions that we find to be inconsistent with a binary merger scenario. In this work, we explore the implications of post-merger dynamics in T\.{Z}O formation scenarios with field binary progenitors, specifically the role that angular momentum transport during the common envelope phase plays in constraining possible merger products, using the tools of stellar evolution and three-dimensional hydrodynamics. We also propose an alternative steady-state outcome for these mergers: the thin-envelope T\.{Z}O, an equilibrium solution consisting of a low-mass spherical envelope supported by the accretion disk luminosity of a central stellar-mass black hole. These configurations may be of interest to upcoming time-domain surveys as potential X-ray sources that may be preceded by a series of bright transient events.</description>

      <title>An isotropic full-sky sample of optically selected blazars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07508v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\it{Context.}$ Various high-energy phenomena in the Universe are associated with blazars, powerful active galaxies with jets pointing to the observer. Novel results relating blazars to high-energy neutrinos, cosmic rays, and even possible manifestations of new particle physics, are often based on statistical analyses of blazar samples, and uniform sky coverage is important for many of these studies.
  $\it{Aims.}$ Here, we construct a uniform full-sky catalog of blazars selected by their optical emission.
  $\it{Methods.}$ We define criteria of isotropy, making a special effort to cover the Galactic plane region, and compile an isotropic sample of blazars with GAIA optical magnitudes $G&lt;18^{\rm m}$, corrected for the Galactic absorption. The sources are taken from full-sky samples selected by parsec-scale radio emission or by high-energy gamma-ray flux, both being known to efficiently select blazar-like objects.
  $\it{Results.}$ We present a catalog of 651 optically bright blazars, uniformly distributed in the sky, together with their radio, optical, X-ray and gamma-ray fluxes, and an isotropic sample of 336 confirmed BL Lac type objects.
  $\it{Conclusions.}$ This catalog may be used in future statistical studies of energetic neutrinos, cosmic rays and gamma rays.</description>

      <title>Consistent eccentricities for gravitational wave astronomy: Resolving discrepancies between astrophysical simulations and waveform models</title>

Abstract: Detecting imprints of orbital eccentricity in GW signals promises to shed light on the formation mechanisms of binary black holes. To constrain formation mechanisms, distributions of eccentricity derived from numerical simulations of astrophysical formation channels are compared to the estimates of eccentricity inferred from GW signals. We report that the definition of eccentricity typically used in astrophysical simulations is inconsistent with the one used while modeling GW signals, with the differences mainly arising due to the choice of reference frequency used in both cases. We also posit a prescription for calculating eccentricity from astrophysical simulations by evolving ordinary differential equations obtained from post-Newtonian theory, and using the dominant ($\ell = m =2$) mode's frequency as the reference frequency; this ensures consistency in the definitions. On comparing the existing eccentricities of binaries present in the Cluster Monte Carlo catalog of globular cluster simulations with the eccentricities calculated using the prescription presented here, we find a significant discrepancy at $e \gtrsim 0.2$; this discrepancy becomes worse with increasing eccentricity. We note the implications this discrepancy has for existing studies, and recommend that care be taken when comparing data-driven constraints on eccentricity to expectations from astrophysical formation channels.</description>

      <title>Comparing jet-shaped point symmetry in cluster cooling flows and supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08544v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I point out similarities between point-symmetric X-ray morphologies in cooling flow groups and clusters of galaxies, which are observed to be shaped by jets, and point-symmetric morphologies of eight core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnants. I identify these similarities by qualitative eye inspection of multiwavelength images. I use these similarities to strengthen the jittering jet explosion mechanism (JJEM) of CCSNe, which predicts that the last pairs of jets to be launched by the newly born neutron star might shape some CCSN remnants to point-symmetric morphology. The point-symmetric morphologies in both types of objects are composed of two or more pairs of opposite bubbles (cavities), nozzles, some clumps, small protrusions (termed ears), and rims. The typically large volume of a CCSN remnant shaped by jets implies that the shaping jets carry an energy comparable to that of the ejecta, which in turn implies that jets exploded the remnant's massive star progenitor. The morphological similarities studied here add to the similarity of CCSN remnants, not only point-symmetric ones, to planetary nebulae shaped by jets. Together, these similarities solidify the JJEM as the main explosion mechanism of CCSNe. I consider the identification of point-symmetry in CCSNe, as expected by jet-shaping in the JJEM, to be the most severe challenge to the competing neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. I reiterate my earlier claim, but in a more vocal voice, that the main explosion mechanism of CCSNe is the JJEM.</description>

      <title>Constraining accretion-ejection parameters of a newly discovered Galactic transient Swift\,J151857.0-572147 using {\it IXPE} and {\it NuSTAR} observations</title>

Abstract: We study the spectro-polarimetric properties of a newly discovered black hole X-ray binary Swift\,J151857.0-572147 jointly using {\it IXPE} and {\it NuSTAR} observations during March 2024. The analysis of {\it IXPE} data reports mode-independent polarization degree (PD) $1.34\pm0.27$ and polarization angle (PA) $-13.69^\circ\pm5.85^\circ$, while the model-dependent analysis gives PD $1.18\pm0.23$ and PA $-14.01^\circ\pm5.80^\circ$. The joint spectral analysis of the broadband data and {\it NuSTAR} analysis in isolation constrain the mass of the central black hole between $\sim 9.2\pm1.6-10.5\pm1.8 M_\odot$ and a moderate spin parameter of $\sim0.6\pm0.2-0.7\pm0.2$ with disk inclination $\sim 38^\circ\pm9^\circ-47^\circ\pm15^\circ$. The power-law photon index and cutoff energy are $2.27\pm0.03-2.42\pm0.05$ and $\sim 40\pm7-62\pm8$ keV, suggesting a transition to the soft spectral state of the source during the observation period. Additionally, the best-fitted halo mass accretion is less compared to the disk mass accretion rate, and a relatively lower corona size of 6-9 r$_g$ indicates the same spectral state. The mass outflow rate was also low ($&lt;3$\% $\dot M_{\rm Edd}$) during these epochs. The hydrogen column density obtained from the fit is relatively high $\sim 4-5\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>Parametric decay instability of circularly polarized Alfv\'en wave in magnetically dominated plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate parametric decay instability (PDI) of circularly polarized Alfv\'en wave into daughter acoustic wave and backward Alfv\'en wave in magnetically-dominated plasma, in which the magnetization parameter $\sigma$ (energy density ratio of background magnetic field to matter) exceeds unity. We analyze relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), focusing on wave frequencies sufficiently lower than the plasma and cyclotron frequencies. We derive analytical formulae for the dispersion relation and growth rate of the instability as a function of the magnetization $\sigma$, wave amplitude $\eta$, and plasma temperature $\theta$. We find that PDI persists even in high magnetization $\sigma$, albeit with a decreased growth rate up to $\sigma\to\infty$. Our formulae are useful for estimating the decay of Alfv\'en wave into acoustic wave and heat in high magnetization $\sigma$ plasma, which is a ubiquitous phenomenon such as in pulsars, magnetars, and fast radio bursts.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Production Mechanism of High-Energy Neutrinos from NGC 1068</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of high-energy neutrino signals from the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 provides us with an opportunity to study nonthermal processes near the center of supermassive black holes. Using the IceCube and latest Fermi-LAT data, we present general multimessenger constraints on the energetics of cosmic rays and the size of neutrino emission regions. In the photohadronic scenario, the required cosmic-ray luminosity should be larger than about 1-10 percent of the Eddington luminosity, and the emission radius should be less than about 15 Schwarzschild radii in low-beta plasma and less than about 3 Schwarzschild radii in high-beta plasma. The leptonic scenario overshoots the NuSTAR or Fermi-LAT data for any emission radii we consider, and the required gamma-ray luminosity is much larger than the Eddington luminosity. The beta decay scenario also violates not only the energetics requirement but also gamma-ray constraints especially when the Bethe-Heitler and photomeson production processes are consistently considered. Our results rule out the leptonic and beta decay scenarios in a nearly model-independent manner, and support hadronic mechanisms in magnetically-powered coronae if NGC 1068 is a source of high-energy neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Spin, inclination, and magnetic field evolution of magnetar population in vacuum and plasma-filled magnetospheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetars are potential energy sources or central engines for numerous transient phenomena in the Universe. How newborn magnetars evolve in different environments remains an open question. Based on both observed and candidate magnetars, it is found that the periods of all magnetars or candidates appear as a bimodal distribution, and are defined as the ``long-P'' and ``short-P'' magnetar subclasses, respectively. We find that for the ``short-P'' subclass of magnetars, the $\dot{P}$ values also appear as a bimodal distribution, and therefore can be classified as ``high-$\dot{P}$ short-P'' and ``low-$\dot{P}$ short-P'' magnetar subclasses. In this paper, we use Monte Carlo simulations to generate synthetic magnetar populations and investigate the evolution of the ``high-$\dot{P}$ short-P'' and ``low-$\dot{P}$ short-P'' magnetar subclasses by considering both the magnetar spin and inclination, as well as the decay of their magnetic field within their evolution in both vacuum and plasma-filled magnetospheres. We find that the magnetar evolution is dependent on both spin and magnetic field, but seems to be insensitive to inclination evolution and magnetospheric environment for the ``high-$\dot{P}$ short-P'' sub-class. In comparison for the case of ``high-$\dot{P}$ short-P'', the magnetar evolution is dependent on spin, magnetic field, and inclination evolution, as well as the magnetospheric environment. The best evolution model should be the case of inclination evolution in vacuum with a small value of $\overline{\mathrm{FOM}}$. The differences in the best-fit parameters also suggest that the ``high-$\dot{P}$ short-P'' and ``low-$\dot{P}$ short-P'' magnetar subclasses may be tracking with different evolution channels.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Followup Could Have Enabled the Discovery of the GW190425 Kilonova</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of a kilonova associated with the GW170817 binary neutron star merger had far-reaching implications for our understanding of several open questions in physics and astrophysics. Unfortunately, since then, only one robust binary neutron star merger was detected through gravitational waves, GW190425, and no electromagnetic counterpart was identified for it. We analyze all reported electromagnetic followup observations of GW190425 and find that while the gravitational-wave localization uncertainty was large, most of the 90% probability region could have been covered within hours had the search been coordinated. Instead, more than 5 days after the merger, the uncoordinated search covered only 50% of the probability, with some areas observed over 100 times, and some never observed. We further show that, according to some models, it would have been possible to detect the GW190425 kilonova, despite the larger distance and higher component masses compared to GW170817. These results emphasize the importance of coordinating followup of gravitational-wave events, not only to avoid missing future kilonovae, but also to discover them early. Such coordination, which is especially important given the rarity of these events, can be achieved with the Treasure Map, a tool developed specifically for this purpose.</description>

      <title>Rapidly growing primordial black holes as seeds of the massive high-redshift JWST Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A group of massive galaxies at redshifts of $z\gtrsim 7$ have been recently detected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which were unexpected to form so early within the framework of standard Big Bang cosmology. In this work, we propose that this puzzle can be explained by the presence of some primordial black holes (PBHs) with a mass of $\sim 1000 M_\odot$. These PBHs, clothed in dark matter halo and undergoing super-Eddington accretion, serve as seeds for the early galaxy formation with masses of $\sim 10^{8}-10^{10}~M_\odot$ at high redshift, thus accounting for the JWST observations. Using a hierarchical Bayesian inference framework to constrain the PBH mass distribution models, we find that the Lognormal model with $M_{\rm c}\sim 750M_\odot$ is preferred over other hypotheses. These rapidly growing BHs are expected to emit strong radiation and may appear as high-redshift compact objects, similar to those recently discovered by JWST. Although we focuse on PBHs in this work, the bound on the initial mass of the seed black holes remains robust even if they were formed through astrophysical channels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Next Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) is a planned radio interferometer providing unprecedented sensitivity at wavelengths between 21 cm and 3 mm. Its 263 antenna element array will be spatially distributed across North America to enable both superb low surface brightness recovery and sub-milliarcsecond angular resolution imaging. The project was developed by the international astronomy community under the lead of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), and is anticipated to be built between 2027 and 2037. Two workshops have been held in 2022 and 2023 with the goal to discuss and consolidate the scientific interests in the ngVLA within the German astronomical community. This community paper constitutes a collection of 48 science ideas which the German community aims to pursue with the ngVLA in the 2030s. This is not a complete list and the ideas are not developed at the level of a "Science Book", such that the present document is mainly meant provide a basis for further discussion within the community. As such, additional contributions are welcome, and will be considered for inclusion in future revisions.</description>

      <title>Fireball anti-nucleosynthesis</title>

Abstract: The tentative identification of approximately ten relativistic anti-helium cosmic-ray events at AMS-02 would, if confirmed, challenge our understanding of the astrophysical synthesis of heavy anti-nuclei. We propose a novel scenario for the enhanced production of such anti-nuclei that is triggered by isolated, catastrophic injections of large quantities of energetic Standard Model (SM) anti-quarks in our galaxy by physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). We demonstrate that SM anti-nucleosynthetic processes that occur in the resulting rapidly expanding, thermalized fireballs of SM plasma can, for a reasonable range of parameters, produce the reported tentative $\sim 2:1$ ratio of anti-helium-3 to anti-helium-4 events at AMS-02, as well as their relativistic boosts. Moreover, we show that this can be achieved without violating anti-deuterium or anti-proton flux constraints for the appropriate anti-helium fluxes. A plausible BSM paradigm for the catastrophic injections is the collision of macroscopic composite dark-matter objects carrying large net anti-baryon number. Such a scenario would require these objects to be cosmologically stable, but to destabilize upon collision, promptly releasing a fraction of their mass energy into SM anti-particles within a tiny volume. We show that, in principle, the injection rate needed to attain the necessary anti-helium fluxes and the energetic conditions required to seed the fireballs appear possible to obtain in such a paradigm. We leave open the question of constructing a BSM particle physics model to realize this, but we suggest two concrete scenarios as promising targets for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Second gadolinium loading to Super-Kamiokande</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07796v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first loading of gadolinium (Gd) into Super-Kamiokande in 2020 was successful, and the neutron capture efficiency on Gd reached 50\%. To further increase the Gd neutron capture efficiency to 75\%, 26.1 tons of $\rm Gd_2(\rm SO_4)_3\cdot \rm 8H_2O$ was additionally loaded into Super-Kamiokande (SK) from May 31 to July 4, 2022. As the amount of loaded $\rm Gd_2(\rm SO_4)_3\cdot \rm 8H_2O$ was doubled compared to the first loading, the capacity of the powder dissolving system was doubled. We also developed new batches of gadolinium sulfate with even further reduced radioactive impurities. In addition, a more efficient screening method was devised and implemented to evaluate these new batches of $\rm Gd_2(\rm SO_4)_3\cdot \rm 8H_2O$. Following the second loading, the Gd concentration in SK was measured to be $333.5\pm2.5$ ppm via an Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS). From the mean neutron capture time constant of neutrons from an Am/Be calibration source, the Gd concentration was independently measured to be 332.7 $\pm$ 6.8(sys.) $\pm$ 1.1(stat.) ppm, consistent with the AAS result. Furthermore, during the loading the Gd concentration was monitored continually using the capture time constant of each spallation neutron produced by cosmic-ray muons,and the final neutron capture efficiency was shown to become 1.5 times higher than that of the first loaded phase, as expected.</description>

      <title>Assessing the impact of instrument noise and astrophysical fluctuations on measurements of the first black hole photon ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Currently envisioned extensions of the Event Horizon Telescope to space will soon target the black hole photon ring: a narrow ring-shaped imprint of a black hole's strong gravity produced in its images by highly bent photon trajectories. In principle, the shape of the photon ring encodes information about the geometry of the underlying black hole spacetime. In practice, however, whether or not this information can be extracted from the ring shape depends on several factors, ranging from the astrophysical details of the emitting source (such as the magnitude of its plasma fluctuations) to the specific configuration of the interferometric array (such as the separation between its telescopes, or the level of noise in its instruments). Here, we employ a phenomenological model to assess the impact of astrophysical fluctuations and instrument noise on the inferred shape of the photon ring. Our systematic study of several astrophysical profiles suggests that this shape can be measured even in the presence of instrument noise across a wide range of baselines. The measurement accuracy and precision appear relatively insensitive to the noise level, up to a sharp threshold beyond which any measurement becomes incredibly challenging (at least without recourse to more sophisticated data analysis methods). Encouragingly, we find that only a few snapshot images are generally needed to overcome the impact of astrophysical fluctuations and correctly infer the ring diameter. Inference becomes more challenging when analyzing the visibility amplitude in a baseline window that is not entirely dominated by a single photon ring. Nevertheless, in most cases, it is still possible to fit a ring shape with the correct fractional asymmetry. These results provide excellent prospects for future precision measurements of black hole spin and fundamental astrophysics via black hole imaging.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussianities in primordial black hole formation and induced gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The most promising mechanism of generating PBHs is by the enhancement of power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation, which is usually accompanied by the the enhancement of non-Gaussianity that crucially changes the abundance of PBHs. In this review I will discuss how non-Gaussianity is generated in single field inflation as well as in the curvaton scenario, and then discuss how to calculate PBH mass function and induced gravitational waves (GWs) with such non-Gaussianities. When the PBH abundance is fixed, non-Gaussianity only has mild impact on the spectral shape of the induced GWs, which gives relatively robust predictions in the mHz and nHz GW experiments.</description>

      <title>Horizon-penetrating form of parametrized metrics for static and stationary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06509v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Rezzolla-Zhidenko (RZ) and Konoplya-Rezzolla-Zhidenko (KRZ) frameworks provide an efficient approach to characterize agnostically spherically symmetric or stationary black-hole spacetimes in arbitrary metric theories. In their original construction, these metrics were defined only in the spacetime region outside of the event horizon, where they can reproduce any black-hole metric with percent precision and a few parameters only. At the same time, numerical simulations of accreting black holes often require metric functions that are regular across the horizon, so that the inner boundary of the computational domain can be placed in a region that is causally disconnected from the exterior. We present a novel formulation of the RZ/KRZ parametrized metrics in coordinate systems that are regular at the horizon and defined everywhere in the interior. We compare the horizon-penetrating form of the KRZ and RZ metrics with the corresponding forms of the Kerr metric in Kerr-Schild coordinates and of the Schwarzschild metric in Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates, remarking the similarities and differences. We expect the horizon-penetrating formulations of the RZ/KRZ metrics to represent new tools to study via simulations the physical processes that occur near the horizon of an arbitrary black hole.</description>

      <title>Natural-linewidth measurements of the 3C and 3D soft-x-ray transitions in Ni XIX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We used the monochromatic soft-x-ray beamline P04 at the synchrotron-radiation facility PETRA III to resonantly excite the strongest $2p-3d$ transitions in neon-like Ni XIX ions, $[2p^6]_{J=0} \rightarrow [(2p^5)_{1/2}\,3d_{3/2}]_{J=1}$ and $[2p^6]_{J=0} \rightarrow [(2p^5)_{3/2}\,3d_{5/2}]_{J=1}$, respectively dubbed 3C and 3D, achieving a resolving power of 15\,000 and signal-to-background ratio of 30. We obtain their natural linewidths, with an accuracy of better than 10\%, as well as the oscillator-strength ratio $f(3C)/f(3D)$ = 2.51(11) from analysis of the resonant fluorescence spectra. These results agree with those of previous experiments, earlier predictions, and our own advanced calculations.</description>

      <title>Jet formation in post-AGB binaries: Confronting cold magnetohydrodynamic disc wind wind models with observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aims: We consider cold self-similar magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disc wind solutions to describe jets that are launched from the circumcompanion accretion discs in post-AGB binaries. Resulting predictions are matched to observations for five different post-AGB binaries. This both tests the physical validity of the MHD disc wind paradigm and reveals the accretion disc properties. Results: Many of the time-series' properties are reproduced well by the models, though systematic mismatches, such as overestimated rotation, remain. Four targets imply accretion discs that reach close to the secondary's stellar surface, while one is fitted with an unrealistically large inner radius of about 20 stellar radii. Some fits imply inner disc temperatures over 10 000 K, seemingly discrepant with a previous observational estimate from H band interferometry. This estimate is, however, shown to be biased. Fitted mass-accretion rates range from about 10^-6 to 10^-3 solar masses per year. Relative to the jets launched from young stellar objects (YSOs), all targets prefer winds with higher ejection efficiencies, lower magnetizations and thicker discs. Conclusions: Our models show that current cold MHD disc wind solutions can explain many of the jet-related Balmer alpha features seen in post-AGB binaries, though systematic discrepancies remain. This includes, but is not limited to, overestimated rotation and underestimated post-AGB circumbinary disc lifetimes. The consideration of thicker discs and the inclusion of irradiation from the post-AGB primary, leading to warm magnetothermal wind launching, might alleviate these.</description>

      <title>ExaGRyPE: Numerical General Relativity Solvers Based upon the Hyperbolic PDEs Solver Engine ExaHyPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: ExaGRyPE describes a suite of solvers for numerical relativity, based upon ExaHyPE 2, the second generation of our Exascale Hyperbolic PDE Engine. The presented generation of ExaGRyPE solves the Einstein equations in the CCZ4 formulation under a 3+1 foliation and focuses on black hole spacetimes. It employs a block-structured Cartesian grid carrying a higher-order order Finite Difference scheme with adaptive mesh refinement, it facilitates massive parallelism combining message passing, domain decomposition and task parallelism, and it supports the injection of particles into the grid as data probes or tracers. We introduce the ExaGRyPE-specific building blocks within ExaHyPE 2, and discuss its software architecture and compute-n-feel:
  For this, we formalize the creation of any specific simulation with ExaGRyPE as a sequence of lowering operations, where abstract logical tasks are successively broken into finer tasks until we obtain an abstraction level that can be mapped onto a C++ executable. The overall program logic is fully specified via a domain-specific Python interface, we map this logic onto a more detailed set of numerical tasks, subsequently lower this representation onto technical tasks that the underlying ExaHyPE engine uses to parallelize the application, before eventually the technical tasks are mapped onto task graphs including the actual PDE term evaluations, initial conditions, boundary conditions, and so forth. We end up with a rigorous separation of concerns which shields ExaGRyPE users from technical details and hence simplifies the development of novel physical models. We present the simulations and data for the gauge wave, static single black holes and rotating binary black hole systems, demonstrating that the code base is mature and usable. However, we also uncover domain-specific numerical challenges that need further study by the community in future work.</description>
