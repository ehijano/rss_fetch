      <title>Non degeneracy of blow-up solutions of non-quantized singular Liouville-type equations and the convexity of the mean field entropy of the Onsager vortex model with sinks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the non-degeneracy of bubbling solutions for singular mean field equations when the blow-up points are either regular or non-quantized singular sources. This extends the results from Bartolucci-Jevnikar-Lee-Yang \cite{bart-5}, which focused on regular blow-up points. As a result, we establish the strict convexity of the entropy in the large energy limit for a specific class of two-dimensional domains in the Onsager mean field vortex model with sinks.</description>

      <title>Adhesion and volume filling in one-dimensional population dynamics under Dirichlet boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the one-dimensional population model of Anguige \&amp; Schmeiser [1] reflecting the cell-to-cell adhesion and volume filling and classify the resulting equation into the six types. Among these types, we fix one that yields a class of advection-diffusion equations of forward-backward-forward type and prove the existence of infinitely many global-in-time weak solutions to the initial-Dirichlet boundary value problem when the maximum value of an initial population density exceeds a certain threshold. Such solutions are extracted from the method of convex integration by M\"uller \&amp; \v Sver\'ak [12]; they exhibit fine-scale density mixtures over a finite time interval, then become smooth and identical, and decay exponentially and uniformly to zero as time approaches infinity.</description>

      <title>Local well-posedness for dispersive equations with bounded data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given sufficiently regular data \textit{without} decay assumptions at infinity, we prove local well-posedness for non-linear dispersive equations of the form
  \[
  \partial_t u + \mathsf A(\nabla) u + \mathcal Q(|u|^2) \cdot \nabla u= \mathcal N (u, \overline u),
  \]
  where $\mathsf A(\nabla)$ is a Fourier multiplier with purely imaginary symbol of order $\sigma + 1$ for $\sigma &gt; 0$, and polynomial-type non-linearities $\mathcal Q(|u|^2)$ and $\mathcal N(u, \overline u)$. Our approach revisits the classical energy method by applying it within a class of local Sobolev-type spaces $\ell^\infty_{\mathsf A(\xi)} H^s (\mathbb R^d)$ which are adapted to the dispersion relation in the sense that functions $u$ localised to dyadic frequency $|\xi| \approx N$ have size
  \[
  ||u||_{\ell^\infty_{\mathsf A(\xi)} H^s} \approx N^s \sup_{{\operatorname{diam}(Q) = N^\sigma}} ||u||_{L^2_x (Q)}.
  \]
  In analogy with the classical $H^s$-theory, we prove $\ell^\infty_{\mathsf A(\xi)} H^s$-local well-posedness for $s &gt; \tfrac{d}2 + 1$ for the derivative non-linear equation, and $s &gt; \tfrac{d}2$ without the derivative non-linearity. As an application, we show that if in addition the initial data is spatially almost periodic, then the solution is also spatially almost periodic.</description>

      <title>Local existence for systems of conservation laws with partial diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to the study of the local existence theory of the Cauchy problem for symmetric hyperbolic partially diffusive systems (also known as hyperbolic-parabolic system) in dimension $d\ge 1$. The system under consideration is a coupling between a symmetric hyperbolic system and a parabolic system. We address the question of well-posedness for large data having critical Besov regularity. This improves the analysis of Serre \cite{Serr10} and Kawashima \cite{Kawashima83}. Our results allow for initial data whose components have different regularities and we enlarge the class of the components experiencing the diffusion to $H^s$, with $s&gt;d/2$ (instead of $s&gt;d/2+1$ in Serre's work and $s&gt;d/2+2$ in Kawashima's one). Our results rely on G\r{a}rding's inequality, composition estimates and product laws. As an example, we consider the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations.</description>

      <title>On positive solutions of critical semilinear equations involving the Logarithmic Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we classify the solutions of the critical semilinear problem involving the logarithmic Laplacian $$(E)\qquad \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad \mathcal{L}_\Delta u= k u\log u,\qquad u\geq0 \quad \ {\rm in}\ \ \mathbb{R}^n, \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad$$ where $k\in(0,+\infty)$, $\mathcal{L}_\Delta$ is the logarithmic Laplacian in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with $n\in\mathbb{N}$, and $s\log s=0$ if $s=0$. When $k=\frac4n$, problem $(E)$ only has the solutions with the form $$u_{\tilde x,t}(x)=\beta_n \Big(\frac{t}{t^2+|x-\tilde x|^2)}\Big)^{\frac{n}{2}}\quad \text{ for any $t&gt;0$, $\tilde x\in\mathbb{R}^n$},$$ where $n\in\mathbb{N}$, $\beta_n=2^{\frac n2} e^{\frac n2\psi(\frac n2) }&gt;0$. When $k\in(0,+\infty)\setminus\{\frac 4n\}$, problem $(E)$ has no any positive solution.</description>

      <title>Symmetry of bounded solutions to quasilinear elliptic equations in a half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $u$ be a bounded positive solution to the problem $-\Delta_p u = f(u)$ in $\mathbb{R}^N_+$ with zero Dirichlet boundary condition, where $p&gt;1$ and $f$ is a locally Lipschitz continuous function. Among other things, we show that if $f(\sup_{\mathbb{R}^N_+} u)=0$ and $f$ satisfies some other mild conditions, then $u$ depends only on $x_N$ and monotone increasing in the $x_N$-direction. Our result partially extends a classical result of Berestycki, Caffarelli and Nirenberg in 1993 to the $p$-Laplacian.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Dirichlet problem of the two dimensional Lagrangian mean curvature equation in a bounded domain. Infinitely many $C^{1, \alpha} (\alpha\in (0,\frac{1}{5}))$ very weak solutions are built through Nash-Kuiper construction. Moreover, we note there are infinitely many $C^{1, \alpha}$ very weak solutions that can not be improved to be $C^{2, \alpha}$.</description>

      <title>Holder regularity for nonlocal in time subdiffusion equations with general kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the regularity of weak solutions to nonlocal in time subdiffusion equations for a wide class of weakly singular kernels appearing in the generalised fractional derivative operator. We prove a weak Harnack inequality for nonnegative weak supersolutions and Holder continuity of weak solutions to such problems. Our results substantially extend the results from our previous work [12] by leaving the framework of distributed order fractional time derivatives and considering a general PC kernel and by also allowing for an inhomogeneity in the PDE from a Lebesgue space of mixed type.</description>

      <title>Direct Sampling for recovering a clamped cavity from biharmonic far field data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the inverse shape problem of recovering an unknown clamped cavity embedded in a thin infinite plate. The model problem is assumed to be governed by the two-dimensional biharmonic wave equation in the frequency domain. Based on the far-field data, a resolution analysis is conducted for cavity recovery via the direct sampling method. The Funk--Hecke integral identity is employed to analyze the performance of two imaging functions. Our analysis demonstrates that the same imaging functions commonly used for acoustic inverse shape problems are applicable to the biharmonic wave context. This work presents the first extension of direct sampling methods to biharmonic waves using far-field data. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of these imaging functions in recovering a clamped cavity.</description>

      <title>Variational Dual Solutions for Incompressible Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a construction proposed in \cite{acharyaQAM} that builds on the notion of weak solutions for incompressible fluids to provide a scheme that generates variationally a certain type of dual solutions. If these dual solutions are regular enough one can use them to recover standard solutions. The scheme provides a generalisation of a construction of Y. Brenier for the Euler equations. We rigorously analyze the scheme, extending the work of Y.Brenier for Euler, and also provide an extension of it to the case of the Navier-Stokes equations. Furthermore we obtain the inviscid limit of Navier-Stokes to Euler as a $\Gamma$-limit.</description>

      <title>The spatially inhomogeneous Vlasov-Nordstr\"{o}m-Fokker-Planck system in the intrinsic weak diffusion regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatially homogeneous Vlasov-Nordstr\"{o}m-Fokker-Planck system is known to exhibit nontrivial large time behavior, naturally leading to weak diffusion of the Fokker-Planck operator. This weak diffusion, combined with the singularity of relativistic velocity, present a significant challenge in analysis for the spatially inhomogeneous counterpart.
  In this paper, we demonstrate that the Cauchy problem for the spatially inhomogeneous Vlasov-Nordstr\"{o}m-Fokker-Planck system, without friction, maintains dynamically stable relative to the corresponding spatially homogeneous system. Our results are twofold: (1) we establish the existence of a unique global classical solution and characterize the asymptotic behavior of the spatially inhomogeneous system using a refined weighted energy method; (2) we directly verify the dynamic stability of the spatially inhomogeneous system in the framework of self-similar solutions.</description>

      <title>On the Sobolev stability threshold for 3D Navier-Stokes equations with rotation near the Couette flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotation is one of the most important features of fluid flow in the atmosphere and oceans, which appears in almost all meteorological and geophysical models. When the speed of rotation is sufficiently large, the global existence of strong solution to the 3D Navier-Stokes equations with rotation has been obtained by the dispersion effect coming from Coriolis force (i.e., rotation). In this paper, we study the dynamic stability of the periodic, plane Couette flow in the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with rotation at high Reynolds number $\mathbf{Re}$. Our goal is to find the index of the stability threshold on $\mathbf{Re}$: the maximum range of perturbations in which the solution to the equations remains stable. We first study the linear stability effects of linearized perturbed system. Compared with the results of Bedrossian, Germain and Masmoudi [Ann. of Math. 185(2): 541--608 (2017)], mixing effects (which corresponds to enhanced dissipation and inviscid damping) arise from the Couette flow, Coriolis force acts as a restoring force which induces the dispersion mechanism of inertial waves and cancels the lift-up effect occurred in the zero frequency velocity. This dispersion mechanism bring good algebraic decay properties, which is different from the 3D classical Navier-Stokes equations. Therefore, we prove that the initial data satisfies $\left\|u_{\mathrm{in}}\right\|_{H^{\sigma}}&lt;\delta \mathbf{Re}^{-1}$ for any $\sigma&gt;\frac{9}{2}$ and some $\delta=\delta(\sigma)&gt;0$ depending only on $\sigma$, the resulting solution to the 3D Navier-Stokes equations with rotation is global in time and does not transition away from the Couette flow. In the sense, Coriolis force is a factor that contributes to the stability of the fluid, which improves the stability threshold from $\frac{3}{2}$ to $1$.</description>

      <title>Boundedness and finite-time blow-up in a repulsion-consumption system with flux limitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the following repulsion-consumption system with flux limitation \begin{align}\tag{$\star$}
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
  u_t=\Delta u+\nabla \cdot(uf(|\nabla v|^2) \nabla v), &amp; x \in \Omega, t&gt;0,
  \tau v_t=\Delta v-u v, &amp; x \in \Omega, t&gt;0, \end{array}
  \right. \end{align} under no-flux/Dirichlet boundary conditions, where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is a bounded domain and $f(\xi)$ generalizes the prototype given by $f(\xi)=(1+\xi)^{-\alpha}$ ($\xi \geqslant 0$). We are mainly concerned with the global existence and finite time blow-up of system ($\star$). The main results assert that, for $\alpha &gt; \frac{n-2}{2n}$, then when $\tau=1$ and under radial settings, or when $\tau=0$ without radial assumptions, for arbitrary initial data, the problem ($\star$) possesses global bounded classical solutions; for $\alpha&lt;0$, $\tau=0$, $n=2$ and under radial settings, for any initial data, whenever the boundary signal level large enough, the solutions of the corresponding problem blow up in finite time.
  Our results can be compared respectively with the blow-up phenomenon obtained by Ahn \&amp; Winkler (2023) for the system with nonlinear diffusion and linear chemotactic sensitivity, and by Wang \&amp; Winkler (2023) for the system with nonlinear diffusion and singular sensitivity .</description>

      <title>Concentration behavior of normalized ground states for mass critical Kirchhoff equations in bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In present paper, we study the limit behavior of normalized ground states for the following mass critical Kirchhoff equation $$ \left\{\begin{array}{ll} -(a+b\int_{\Omega}|\nabla u|^2\mathrm{d}x)\Delta u+V(x)u=\mu u+\beta^*|u|^{\frac{8}{3}}u &amp;\mbox{in}\ {\Omega}, \\[0.1cm]
  u=0&amp;\mbox{on}\ {\partial\Omega}, \\[0.1cm] \int_{\Omega}|u|^2\mathrm{d}x=1, \\[0.1cm] \end{array} \right. $$ where $a\geq0$, $b&gt;0$, the function $V(x)$ is a trapping potential in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^3$, $\beta^*:=\frac{b}{2}|Q|_2^{\frac{8}{3}}$ and $Q$ is the unique positive radially symmetric solution of equation $-2\Delta u+\frac{1}{3}u-|u|^{\frac{8}{3}}u=0.$ We consider the existence of constraint minimizers for the associated energy functional involving the parameter $a$. The minimizer corresponds to the normalized ground state of above problem, and it exists if and only if $a&gt;0$. Moreover, when $V(x)$ attains its flattest global minimum at an inner point or only at the boundary of $\Omega$, we analyze the fine limit profiles of the minimizers as $a\searrow 0$, including mass concentration at an inner point or near the boundary of $\Omega$. In particular, we further establish the local uniqueness of the minimizer if it is concentrated at a unique inner point.</description>

      <title>Some applications of the Nehari manifold method to functionals in $C^1(X \setminus \{0\})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a real Banach space $X$, we show that the Nehari manifold method can be applied to functionals which are $C^1$ in $X \setminus \{0\}$. In particular we deal with functionals that can be unbounded near $0$, and prove the existence of a ground state and infinitely many critical points for such functionals. These results are then applied to three classes of problems: the {\it prescribed energy problem} for a family of functionals depending on a parameter, problems involving the {\it affine} $p$-Laplacian operator, and degenerate Kirchhoff type problems.</description>

Abstract: We study the sharp $\mathrm{L}^\infty$ estimates for fully non-linear elliptic equations on compact complex manifolds. For the case of K\"ahler manifolds, we prove that the oscillation of any admissible solution to a degenerate fully non-linear elliptic equation satisfying several structural conditions can be controlled by the $\mathrm{L}^1(\log\mathrm{L})^n(\log\log\mathrm{L})^r(r&gt;n)$ norm of the right-hand function (in a regularized form). This result improves that of Guo-Phong-Tong. In addition to their method of comparison with auxiliary complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations, our proof relies on an inequality of H\"older-Young type and an iteration lemma of De Giorgi type. For the case of Hermitian manifolds with non-degenerate background metrics, we prove a similar $\mathrm{L}^\infty$ estimate which improves that of Guo-Phong. An explicit example is constucted to show that the $\mathrm{L}^\infty$ estimates given here may fail when $r\leqslant n-1$. The construction relies on a gluing lemma of smooth, radial, strictly plurisubharmonic functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate new properties of the fractional Dirichlet Laplacian on smooth bounded domains and establish fractional product estimates and nonlinear Poincar\'e inequalities. We also use these tools to study the long-time dynamics of the surface quasi-geostrophic equation forced by some given time-independent body forces in the presence of physical boundaries and prove the existence of a finite-dimensional global attractor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove Weyl laws for Schr\"odinger operators with critically singular potentials on compact manifolds with boundary. We also improve the Weyl remainder estimates under the condition that the set of all periodic geodesic billiards has measure 0. These extend the classical results by Seeley, Ivrii and Melrose. The proof uses the Gaussian heat kernel bounds for short times and a perturbation argument involving the wave equation.</description>

      <title>Construction of multi-soliton solutions for the energy critical wave equation in dimension 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the energy-critical wave equation in three dimensions, focusing on its ground state soliton, denoted by $W$. Using the Poincar\'e symmetry inherent in the equation, boosting $W$ along any timelike geodesic yields another solution. The slow decay behavior of $W$, $W\sim r^{-1}$, indicates a strong interaction among potential multi-soliton solutions.
  In this paper, for arbitrary $N\geq0$, we provide an algorithmic procedure to construct approximate solutions to the energy critical wave equation that: (1) converge to a superposition of solitons, (2) have no outgoing radiation, (3) their error to solve the equation decays like $(t-r)^{-N}$. Then, we show that this approximate solution can be corrected to a real solution.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of global solutions for a class of nonlinear wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper we consider global solutions of a class of non-linear wave equations of the form \begin{equation*}
  \Box u= N(x,t,u)u, \end{equation*} where the nonlinearity~$ N(x,t,u)u$ is assumed to satisfy appropriate boundedness assumptions.
  Under these appropriate assumptions we prove that the free channel wave operator exists. Moreover, if the interaction term~$N(x,t,u)u$ is localised, then we prove that the global solution of the full nonlinear equation can be decomposed into a `free' part and a `localised' part.
  The present work can be seen as an extension of the scattering results of~\cite{SW20221} for the Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the time-periodic Jordan-Moore-Gibson-Thompson equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by applications of nonlinear ultrasonics under continuous wave excitation, we study the Jordan-Moore-Gibson-Thompson (JMGT) equation -- a third order in time quasilinear PDE -- under time periodicity conditions. Here the coefficient of the third order time derivative is the so-called relaxation time and a thorough understanding of the limiting behaviour for vanishing relaxation time is essential to link these JMGT equations to classical second order models in nonlinear acoustics,
  As compared to the meanwhile well understood initial value problem for JMGT, the periodic setting poses substantial challenges due to a loss of temporal regularity, while the analysis still requires an $L^\infty$ control of solutions in space and time in order to maintain stability or equivalently, to avoid degeneracy of the second time derivative coefficient.
  We provide a full well-posedness analysis with and without gradient nonlinearity, as relevant for modelling non-cumulative nonlinear effects, under practically relevant mixed boundary conditions. The source-to-state map is thus well-defined and we additionally show it to be Lipschitz continuously differentiable, a result that is useful for inverse problems applications such as acoustic nonlinearity tomography. The energy bounds derived for the well-posedness analysis of periodic JMGT equations also allow to fully justify the singular limit for vanishing relaxation time.</description>

      <title>Singularity formed by the collision of two collapsing solitons in interaction for the 2D Keller-Segel system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that the two-dimensional Keller-Segel system admits finite time blowup solutions, which is the case if the initial density has a total mass greater than $8\pi$ and a finite second moment. Several constructive examples of such solutions have been obtained, where for all of them a perturbed stationary state undergoes scale instability and collapses at a point, resulting in a $8\pi$-mass concentration. It was conjectured that singular solutions concentrating simultaneously more than one solitons could exist. We construct rigorously such a new blowup mechanism, where two stationary states are simultaneously collapsing and colliding, resulting in a $16\pi$-mass concentration at a single blowup point, and with a new blowup rate which corresponds to the formal prediction by Seki, Sugiyama and Vel\'azquez. We develop for the first time a robust framework to construct rigorously such blowup solutions involving simultaneously the non-radial collision and concentration of several solitons, which we expect to find applications to other evolution problems.</description>

Firstly, we discuss the properties of solutions in the elliptic space. Then, we establish crucial principles, including the asymptotic narrow region principle.Finally, we employ the method of moving planes to demonstrate the asymptotic symmetry of the solutions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss pointwise decay estimate for the solution to the mass-critical generalized Korteweg-de Vries (gKdV) equation with initial data $u_0\in H^{1/2}(\mathbb{R})$. It is showed that nonlinear solution enjoys the same decay rate as linear one. Moreover, we also quantify the decay for solutions to the generalized Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation which is a natural multi-dimensional extension of the gKdV equation. We obtain some decay estimates for nonlinear solutions to generalized Zakharov-Kuznetsov equations with small initial data in $H^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$.</description>

      <title>Gradient estimates for the conductivity problem with imperfect bonding interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the field concentration phenomenon between two closely spaced perfect conductors with imperfect bonding interfaces of low conductivity type. The boundary condition on these interfaces is given by a Robin-type boundary condition. A previous conjecture suggested that the gradient of solutions remains bounded regardless of $\varepsilon$, the distance between two inclusions. In this article, we establish gradient estimates, indicating that the conjecture is true only when the bonding parameter $\gamma$ is sufficiently small, and the gradient could blow up when $\gamma$ is large and the boundary data is not aligned with shortest line connecting the two inclusions. Moreover, we derive the optimal blow-up rates under certain symmetry assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05669v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we complete the program initiated by the first and second authors and rigorously derive a Boltzmann-type equation that incorporates higher order collisions among gas particles. More precisely, starting from a finite $N$-particle system where the particles can perform symmetric hard sphere type interactions up to arbitrarily high order $M$, we derive a kinetic equation which consists of a linear combination of higher order collisional terms. We identify the new scaling regime that facilitates such collisions and systematically generalize geometric techniques allowing us to analyze the correlation of potentially distinct order recollisions as time evolves.</description>

      <title>Strange Attractors in Fractional Differential Equations: A Topological Approach to Chaos and Stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the dynamics of fractional differential equations (FDEs) through a rigorous topological analysis of strange attractors. By investigating systems with Caputo derivatives of order \( \alpha \in (0, 1) \), we identify conditions under which chaotic behavior emerges, characterized by positive topological entropy and the presence of homoclinic and heteroclinic structures. We introduce novel methods for computing the fractional Conley index and Lyapunov exponents, which allow us to distinguish between chaotic and non-chaotic attractors. Our results also provide new insights into the fractal and spectral properties of strange attractors in fractional systems, establishing a comprehensive framework for understanding chaos and stability in this context.</description>

      <title>Failure of famous functional inequalities on Finsler manifolds: the influence of $S$-curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The validity of functional inequalities on Finsler metric measure manifolds is based on three non-Riemannian quantities, namely, the reversibility, flag curvature and $S$-curvature induced by the measure. Under mild assumptions on the reversibility and flag curvature, it turned out that famous functional inequalities -- as Hardy inequality, Heisenberg--Pauli--Weyl uncertainty principle and Caffarelli--Kohn--Nirenberg inequality -- usually hold on forward complete Finsler manifolds with non-positive $S$-curvature, cf. Huang, Krist\'aly and Zhao [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 2020]. In this paper however we prove that -- under similar assumptions on the reversibility and flag curvature as before -- the aforementioned functional inequalities fail whenever the $S$-curvature is positive. Accordingly, our results clearly reveal the deep dependence of functional inequalities on the $S$-curvature. As a consequence of these results, we establish surprising analytic aspects of Finsler manifolds: if the flag curvature is non-positive, the Ricci curvature is bounded from below and the $S$-curvature is positive, then the reversibility turns out to be infinite. Examples are presented on general Funk metric spaces, where the $S$-curvature plays again a decisive role.</description>

Moreover we show that the result remains true for the entire range of $|a_0|/m_0$ for which stability can be established.</description>

Abstract: We study the convergence of a generic tamed Euler-Maruyama (EM) scheme for the kinetic type stochastic differential equations (SDEs) (also known as second order SDEs) with singular coefficients in both weak and strong probabilistic senses. We show that when the drift exhibits a relatively low regularity compared to the state of the art, the singular system is well-defined both in the weak and strong probabilistic senses. Meanwhile, the corresponding tamed EM scheme is shown to converge at the rate of 1/2 in both the weak and the strong senses.</description>

      <title>Optimal regularity for Lagrangian mean curvature type equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2009.04613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify regularity for Lagrangian mean curvature type equations, which include the potential equation for prescribed Lagrangian mean curvature and those for Lagrangian mean curvature flow self-shrinkers and expanders, translating solitons, and rotating solitons. Convex solutions of the second boundary value problem for certain such equations were constructed by Brendle-Warren 2010, Huang 2015, and Wang-Huang-Bao 2023. We first show that convex viscosity solutions are regular provided the Lagrangian angle or phase is $C^2$ and convex in the gradient variable. We next show that for merely H\"older continuous phases, convex solutions are regular if they are $C^{1,\beta}$ for sufficiently large $\beta$. Singular solutions are given to show that each condition is optimal and that the H\"older exponent is sharp. Along the way, we generalize the constant rank theorem of Bian and Guan to include arbitrary dependence on the Legendre transform.</description>

      <title>Generalized convergence of solutions for nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi equations with state-constraint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17058v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a continuous Hamiltonian $H : (x, p, u) \in T^*\mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, we consider the asymptotic behavior of associated Hamilton--Jacobi equations with state-constraint $H(x, Du, \lambda u) \leq C_\lambda$ in $\Omega_\lambda\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ and $H(x, Du, \lambda u) \geq C_\lambda$ on $\overline{\Omega}_\lambda\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ a $\lambda\rightarrow 0^+$. When $H$ satisfies certain convex, coercive, and monotone conditions, the domain $\Omega_\lambda:=(1+r(\lambda))\Omega$ keeps bounded, star-shaped for all $\lambda&gt;0$ with $\lim_{\lambda\rightarrow 0^+}r(\lambda)=0$, and $\lim_{\lambda\rightarrow 0^+}C_\lambda=c(H)$ equals the ergodic constant of $H(\cdot,\cdot,0)$, we prove the convergence of solutions $u_\lambda$ to a specific solution of the critical equation $H(x, Du, 0)\leq c(H) $ in $\Omega$ and $H(x, Du, 0)\geq c(H) $ on $\overline{\Omega}$. We also discuss the generalization of such a convergence for equations with more general $C_\lambda$ and $\Omega_\lambda$.</description>

      <title>The fine structure of the singular set of area-minimizing integral currents II: rectifiability of flat singular points with singularity degree larger than $1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11555v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an area-minimizing integral current $T$ of codimension higher than $1$ in a smooth Riemannian manifold $\Sigma$. In a previous paper we have subdivided the set of interior singular points with at least one flat tangent cone according to a real parameter, which we refer to as ``singularity degree''. This parameter determines the infinitesimal order of contact at the point in question between the ``singular part'' of $T$ and its ``best regular approximation''. In this paper we show that the set of points for which the singularity degree is strictly larger than $1$, is $(m-2)$-rectifiable. In a subsequent work we prove that the remaining flat singular points form an $(m-2)$-null set, thus concluding that the singular set of $T$ is $m-2$-rectifiable.</description>

      <title>Partial Regularity and Blowup for an Averaged Three-Dimensional Navier-Stokes Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15986v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove two results that together strongly suggest that obtaining a positive answer to the Navier-Stokes global regularity question requires more than a refinement of partial regularity theory. First we prove that there exists a class of bilinear operators $\mathfrak{B}$, which contains the Euler bilinear operator $\mathcal{E}(u,v):=\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{P}(u\cdot\nabla v + v\cdot\nabla u)$, such that for any $B\in \mathfrak{B}$, $n\geq3$, $\alpha \in ((n+1)/4, (n+2)/4)$, and smooth solution $u$ of the pseudodifferential equation $\partial_t u +(-\Delta)^\alpha u +B(u,u)=0$ on $\mathbb{R}^n\times [0,T)$, we have that $u$ is also smooth at time $T$ away from a closed set of Hausdorff dimension at most $n+2-4\alpha$. Next we prove that, for the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^3$, there exists an operator $C(u,v)\in \mathfrak{B}$ that is an averaged version of $\mathcal{E}$, that formally allows the dissipation of energy by the "cancellation identity" $\langle C(u,u), u\rangle =0$, and whose corresponding pseudodifferential equation $\partial_t u +(-\Delta)^\alpha u +C(u,u)=0$ admits a solution that blows up in finite time for all $\alpha \in (0,5/4)$.</description>

      <title>A symmetry breaking phenomenon for anisotropic harmonic maps from a 2D annulus into $\mathbb S^1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a two dimensional annulus $A_\rho=\{x\in \mathbb R^2: \rho&lt;|x|&lt;1\}$, $\rho\in (0,1)$, we characterize $0$-homogeneous minimizers, in $H^1(A_\rho;\mathbb S^1)$ with respect to their own boundary conditions, of the anisotropic energy \begin{equation*}
  E_\delta(u)=\int_{A_\rho} |\nabla u|^2 +\delta \left( (\nabla\cdot u)^2-(\nabla\times u)^2\right) \, dx,\quad \delta\in (-1,1). \end{equation*} Even for a small anisotropy $0&lt;|\delta|\ll 1$, we exhibit qualitative properties very different from the isotropic case $\delta=0$. In particular, $0$-homogeneous critical points of degree $d\notin \lbrace 0,1,2\rbrace$ are always local minimizers, but in thick annuli ($\rho\ll 1$) they are not minimizers: the $0$-homogeneous symmetry is broken. One corollary is that entire solutions to the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau system have a far-field behavior very different from the isotropic case studied by Brezis, Merle and Rivi\`ere. The tools we use include: ODE and variational arguments; asymptotic expansions, interpolation inequalities and explicit computations involving near-optimizers of these inequalities for proving that $0$-homogeneous critical points are not minimizers in thick annuli.</description>

      <title>On the motion of the closed free surface in three-dimensional incompressible ideal MHD with surface tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the local regularity theory for the three-dimensional free boundary incompressible ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations with surface tension and study the relationship between the geometry of the free boundary and the regularity loss of smooth solutions. Our main result is a regularity criterion which states that a smooth solution will preserve its initial regularity (controlled by the initial Sobolev norm) and remain smooth under specific conditions, including low regularity of the free boundary (curvature and normal velocity), fluid velocity and magnetic fields, and the free boundary not self-intersecting. Driven by the curvature and pressure estimates, this result holds in a general bounded domain with a closed surface, without assuming the free boundaries being graphs. Particularly, the lower-order regularity estimates in the main result extend the previous works for the periodic domain $\mathbb{T}^2\times (0,1)$ by Luo and Zhang (SIAM J Math Anal 53 (2) 2595-2630, 2021). This extension is nontrivial since we remove the regularity assumption for the initial boundary velocity as the estimate is independent of this quantity. It also reveals the central role of the mean curvature since the local coordinates fail to preserve the curvature and the curvature of the initial boundary of $\mathbb{T}^2\times (0,1)$ degenerates to zero. Moreover, this approach avoids the thorny problem of the spatial regularity of the flow map in Lagrangian coordinates. To our best knowledge, this is the first result involving the blow-up of free boundary incompressible MHD equations with surface tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12044v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a system of equations which can be seen as an evolving surface version of the diffuse interface "Model H" of Hohenberg and Halperin (1977). We then consider the well-posedness for the corresponding (tangential) system when one prescribes the evolution of the surface. Well-posedness is proved for smooth potentials in the Cahn-Hilliard equation with polynomial growth, and also for a thermodynamically relevant singular potential.</description>

      <title>Lane formation and aggregation spots in a model of ants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate an interacting particle model to simulate a foraging colony of ants, where each ant is represented as an active Brownian particle. The interactions among ants are mediated through chemotaxis, aligning their orientations with the upward gradient of the pheromone field. Unlike conventional models, our study introduces a parameter that enables the reproduction of two distinctive behaviors: the well-known Keller--Segel aggregation into spots and the formation of traveling clusters, without relying on external constraints such as food sources or nests. We consider the associated mean-field limit partial differential equation (PDE) of this system and establish the analytical and numerical foundations for understanding these particle behaviors. Remarkably, the mean-field PDE not only supports aggregation spots and lane formation but also unveils a bistable region where these two behaviors compete. The patterns associated with these phenomena are elucidated by the shape of the growing eigenfunctions derived from linear stability analysis. This study not only contributes to our understanding of complex ant colony dynamics but also introduces a novel parameter-dependent perspective on pattern formation in collective systems.</description>

Abstract: This work focuses on the rate of convergence for singular perturbation problems for first-order Hamilton-Jacobi equations. As an application we derive the rate of convergence for singularly perturbed two-players zero-sum deterministic differential games (i.e., leading to Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equations) and, subsequently, in case of singularly perturbed mean field games of acceleration. Namely, we show that in both the models the rate of convergence is $\varepsilon$.</description>

      <title>Constructing heat kernels on infinite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be an infinite, edge- and vertex-weighted graph with certain reasonable restrictions. We construct the heat kernel of the associated Laplacian using an adaptation of the parametrix approach due to Minakshisundaram-Pleijel in the setting of Riemannian geometry. This is partly motivated by the wish to relate the heat kernels of a graph and a subgraph, or of a domain and a discretization of it. As an application, assuming that the graph is locally finite, we express the heat kernel $H_G(x,y;t)$ as a Taylor series with the lead term being $a(x,y)t^r$, where $r$ is the combinatorial distance between $x$ and $y$ and $a(x,y)$ depends (explicitly) upon edge and vertex weights. In the case $G$ is the regular $(q+1)$-tree with $q\geq 1$, our construction reproves different explicit formulas due to Chung-Yau and to Chinta-Jorgenson-Karlsson. Assuming uniform boundedness of the combinatorial vertex degree, we show that a dilated Gaussian depending on any distance metric on $G$, which is uniformly bounded from below can be taken as a parametrix in our construction. Our work extends in part the recent articles [LNY21, CJKS23] in that the graphs are infinite and weighted.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Sigma:=[0,\infty)\times S^2$, $\mathscr F:=L_2(\Sigma)$. The {\it forward} acoustic scattering problem under consideration is to find $u=u^f(x,t)$ satisfying \begin{align} \label{Eq 01} &amp;u_{tt}-\Delta u+qu=0, &amp;&amp; (x,t) \in {\mathbb R}^3 \times (-\infty,\infty); \\ \label{Eq 02} &amp;u \mid_{|x|&lt;-t} =0 , &amp;&amp; t&lt;0;\\ \label{Eq 03} &amp;\lim_{s \to -\infty} s\,u((-s+\tau)\,\omega,s)=f(\tau,\omega), &amp;&amp; (\tau,\omega) \in \Sigma; \end{align} for a real valued compactly supported potential $q\in L_\infty(\Bbb R^3)$ and a control $f \in\mathscr F$. The response operator $R: \mathscr F\to\mathscr F$, \begin{align*} &amp; (Rf)(\tau ,\omega )\,:= \lim_{s \to +\infty} s\, u^f((s+\tau )\,\omega ,s), \quad (\tau ,\omega ) \in \Sigma \end{align*} depends on $q$ {\it locally}: if $\xi&gt;0$ and $f\in\mathscr F^\xi:=\{f\in\mathscr F\,|\,\,\,f\!\mid_{[0,\xi)}=0\}$ holds, then the values $(Rf)\!\mid_{\tau\geqslant\xi}$ are determined by $q\!\mid_{|x|\geqslant\xi}$ (do not depend on $q\!\mid_{|x|&lt;\xi}$).
  The {\it inverse problem} is: for an arbitrarily fixed $\xi&gt;0$, to determine $q\mid_{|x|\geqslant\xi}$ from $X^\xi R\upharpoonright\mathscr F^\xi$, where $X^\xi$ is the projection in $\mathscr F$ onto $\mathscr F^\xi$. It is solved by a relevant version of the boundary control method. The key point of the approach are recent results on the controllability of the system (\ref{Eq 01})--(\ref{Eq 03}).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01174v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel first-order derivative for functions on a lattice graph, which extends the discrete Laplacian and generalizes the theory of discrete PDEs on the lattices. First, we establish the well-posedness of generalized quasilinear Schr\"odinger equations and give a new proof of the global well-posedness of semilinear Schr\"odinger equations. Then we provide explicit expressions of higher order derivatives of the solution map and prove the analytic dependence between solution and initial data. At the end, we show the existence of wave operator and prove the asymptotic completeness in low dimensions.</description>

      <title>Quantitative stratification and sharp regularity estimates for supercritical semilinear elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the interior regularity theory for stationary solutions of the supercritical nonlinear elliptic equation $$ -\Delta u=|u|^{p-1}u\quad\text{in }\Omega,\quad p&gt;\frac{n+2}{n-2}, $$ where $ \Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n $ is a bounded domain with $ n\geq 3 $. Our primary focus is on the structure of stratification for the singular sets. We define the $ k $-th stratification $ S^k(u) $ of $ u $ based on the tangent functions and measures. We show that the Hausdorff dimension of $ S^k(u) $ is at most $ k $ and $ S^k(u) $ is $ k $-rectifiable, and establish estimates for volumes associated with points that have lower bounds on the regular scales. These estimates enable us to derive sharp interior estimates for the solutions. Specifically, if $ \alpha_p=\frac{2(p+1)}{p-1} $ is not an integer, then for any $ j\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0} $, we have $$ D^ju\in L_{\operatorname{loc}}^{q_j,\infty}(\Omega), $$ which implies that for any $ \Omega'\subset\subset\Omega $, $$ \sup\{\lambda&gt;0:\lambda^{q_j}\mathcal{L}^n(\{x\in\Omega':|D^ju(x)|&gt;\lambda\})\}&lt;+\infty, $$ where $ \mathcal{L}^n(\cdot) $ is the $ n $-dimensional Lebesgue measure, and $$ q_j=\frac{(p-1)(\lfloor\alpha_p\rfloor+1)}{2+j(p-1)}, $$ with $ \lfloor\alpha_p\rfloor $ being the integer part of $ \alpha_p $. The proofs of these results rely on Reifenberg-type theorems developed by A. Naber and D. Valtorta to study the stratification of harmonic maps.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness for a higher order water wave model on modulation spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considered in this work is the initial value problem (IVP) associated to a higher order water wave model
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases} \eta_t+\eta_x-\gamma_1 \eta_{xxt}+\gamma_2\eta_{xxx}+\delta_1 \eta_{xxxxt}+\delta_2\eta_{xxxxx}+\frac{3}{2}\eta \eta_x+\gamma (\eta^2)_{xxx}-\frac{7}{48}(\eta_x^2)_x-\frac{1}{8}(\eta^3)_x=0,\\ \eta(x,0) = \eta_0(x). \end{cases} \end{equation*} The main interest is in addressing the well-posedness issues of the IVP when the given initial data are considered in the modulation space $M_s^{2,p}(\mathbb{R})$ or the $L^p$-based Sobolev spaces $H^{s,p}(\mathbb{R})$, $1\leq p&lt;\infty$. We derive some multilinear estimates in these spaces and prove that the above IVP is locally well-posed for data in $M_s^{2,p}(\mathbb{R})$ whenever $s&gt;1$ and $p\geq 1$, and in $H^{s,p}(\mathbb{R})$ whenever $p\in [1,\infty)$ and $s\geq \max\left\{ \frac1{p}+\frac12, 1 \right\}$. We also use a combination of high-low frequency technique and an {\em a priori estimate}, and prove that the local solution with data in the modulation spaces $M_s^{2,p}(\mathbb{R})$ can be extended globally to the time interval $[0, T]$ for any given $T\gg1$ if $1\leq \frac32-\frac1p &lt;s&lt;2$ or if $(s,p)\in [2, \infty]\times [2, \infty]$.</description>

      <title>Microscopic, mesoscopic, and macroscopic descriptions of the Euler alignment system with adaptive communication strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a continuation of our previous joint work on the $\mathrm{s}$-model in arXiv:2310.00269. The $\mathrm{s}$-model, introduced by the first author in arXiv:2211.00117, is an alignment model with the property that the strength of the alignment force, $\mathrm{s}$, is transported along an averaged velocity field. The transport of the strength is designed so that it admits an $e$-quantity, $e = \partial_x u + \mathrm{s}$, which controls regularity in 1D similarly to the classical Cucker-Smale case. The utility of the $\mathrm{s}$-model is that it has the versatility to behave qualitatively like the Motsch-Tadmor model, for which global regularity theory is not known.
  This paper aims to put the $\mathrm{s}$-model on firmer physical grounds by formulating and justifying the microscopic and mesoscopic descriptions from which it arises. A distinctive feature of the microscopic system is that it is a discrete-continuous system: the position and velocity of the particles are discrete objects, while the strength is an active continuum scalar function. We establish a rigorous passage from the microscopic to the mesoscopic description via the Mean Field Limit and from the mesoscopic to the macroscopic description in the monokinetic and Maxwellian limiting regimes. We present a survey of such results for the Cucker-Smale model and explain how to extend these arguments to the $\mathrm{s}$-model, where the strength of the alignment force is transported. We also address the long-time behavior of the kinetic Fokker-Planck-Alignment equation by establishing the relaxation to the Maxwellian in 1D when the velocity averaging is the Favre averaging. As a supplement to the numerical results already presented in our previous work, we provide additional numerical evidence, via a particle simulation, that the $\mathrm{s}$-model behaves qualitatively like the Motsch-Tadmor model.</description>

      <title>Differential algebra of polytopes and inversion formulas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the differential algebra of polytopes to explain the known remarkable relation of the combinatorics of the associahedra and permutohedra with the compositional and multiplicative inversion of formal power series. This approach allows to single out the associahedra and permutohedra among all graph-associahedra and emphasizes the significance of the differential equations for special sequences of simple polytopes derived earlier by one of the authors. We discuss also the link with the geometry of Deligne-Mumford moduli spaces $\bar M_{0,n}$ and the interpretation of the combinatorics of cyclohedra in relation with the classical Fa\`a di Bruno's formula.</description>

      <title>Hairer-Quastel universality for KPZ -- polynomial smoothing mechanisms, general nonlinearities and Poisson noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of weakly asymmetric continuous microscopic growth models with polynomial smoothing mechanisms, general nonlinearities and a Poisson type noise. We show that they converge to the KPZ equation after proper rescaling and re-centering, where the coupling constant depends nontrivially on all details of the smoothing and growth mechanisms in the microscopic model. This confirms some of the predictions in [HQ18], and provides a first example of Hairer-Quastel type with both a generic nonlinearity (non-polynomial) and a non-Gaussian noise.
  The proof builds on the general discretisation framework of regularity structures ([EH19]), and employs the idea of using the spectral gap inequality to control stochastic objects as developed and systematised in [LOTT21,HS24], together with a new observation on the specific structure of the (discrete) Malliavin derivatives in our situation. This structure enables us to reduce the control of mixed $L^p$ spacetime norms (of arbitrarily large $p$) by certain $L^2$-norms in spacetime.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic-preserving hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method for the Westervelt quasilinear wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the asymptotic-preserving properties of a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method for the Westervelt model of ultrasound waves. More precisely, we show that the proposed method is robust with respect to small values of the sound diffusivity damping parameter $\delta$ by deriving low- and high-order energy stability estimates, and \emph{a priori} error bounds that are independent of $\delta$. Such bounds are then used to show that, when $\delta \rightarrow 0^+$, the method remains stable and the discrete acoustic velocity potential $\psi_h^{(\delta)}$ converges to $\psi_h^{(0)}$, where the latter is the singular vanishing dissipation limit. Moreover, we prove optimal convergence rates for the approximation of the acoustic particle velocity variable $\boldsymbol{v} = \nabla \psi$. The established theoretical results are illustrated with some numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Sobolev regularity theory for stochastic reaction-diffusion-advection equations with spatially homogeneous colored noises and variable-order nonlocal operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article investigates the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions to nonlinear stochastic reaction-diffusion-advection equations (SRDAEs) with spatially homogeneous colored noises and variable-order nonlocal operators in mixed norm $L_q(L_p)$-spaces. We introduce a new condition (strongly reinforced Dalang's condition) on colored noise, which facilitates a deeper understanding of the complicated relation between nonlinearities and stochastic forces. Additionally, we establish the space-time H\"older type regularity of solutions.</description>

      <title>An existence and uniqueness theory to stochastic partial differential equations involving pseudo-differential operators driven by space-time white noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04529v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to develop a new weak formulation that ensures well-posedness for a broad range of stochastic partial differential equations with pseudo-differential operators whose symbols depend only on time and spatial frequencies. The main focus of this paper is to relax the conditions on the symbols of pseudo-differential operators and data while still ensuring that the stochastic partial differential equations remain well-posed in a weak sense. Specifically, we allow symbols to be random and remove all regularity and ellipticity conditions on them. As a result, our main operators include many interesting rough operators that cannot generate any regularity gain or integrability improvement from the equations. In addition, our data do not need to be regular or possess finite stochastic moments.</description>

      <title>An integrable pseudospherical equation with pseudo-peakon solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an integrable equation whose solutions define a triad of one-forms describing a surface with Gaussian curvature -1. We identify a local group of diffeomorphisms that preserve these solutions and establish conserved quantities. From the symmetries, we obtain invariant solutions that provide explicit metrics for the surfaces. These solutions are unbounded and often appear in mirrored pairs. We introduce the ``collage'' method, which uses conserved quantities to remove unbounded parts and smoothly join the solutions, leading to weak solutions consistent with the conserved quantities. As a result we get pseudo-peakons, which are smoother than Camassa-Holm peakons. Additionally, we apply a Miura-type transformation to relate our equation to the Degasperis-Procesi equation, allowing us to recover peakon and shock-peakon solutions for it from the solutions of the other equation.</description>
