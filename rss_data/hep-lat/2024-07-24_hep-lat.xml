      <title>Non-local Nucleon Matrix Elements in the Rest Frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting parton structure from lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations requires studying the coordinate scale $z_3$ dependence of the matrix elements of bilocal operators. The most significant contribution comes from the $z_3$ dependence induced by ultraviolet (UV) renormalization of the Wilson line. We demonstrate that the next-to-leading order perturbative calculations of the renormalization factor can describe, to a few percent accuracy, the lattice QCD rest frame matrix elements with separations up to distances of 0.6~fm on multiple lattice spacings. The residual discrepancies can be modeled by a leading effect from the structure of the nucleon.</description>

      <title>The $\omega$-meson from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many excited states in the hadron spectrum have large branching ratios to the three-hadron final states. Understanding such particles from first principles QCD requires input from lattice QCD with one-, two-, and three-meson interpolators as well as a reliable three-body formalism relating finite-volume spectra at unphysical pion masses to the scattering amplitudes at the physical point. In this work, we provide the first-ever calculation of the resonance parameters of the $\omega$-meson from lattice QCD to the physical point, including an update of the formalism through matching to effective field theories. The main result of this pioneering study, the pole position of the $\omega$-meson at $\sqrt{s_\omega}= (778.0(11.2)-i\,3.0(5) )\,\mathrm{MeV}$, agrees reasonably well with experiment providing a pathway to study heavier three-hadron resonances. In addition we provide an estimate of the $\omega-\rho$ mass difference as $29(15)\,\mathrm{MeV}$.</description>

      <title>Ising BCFT from Fuzzy Hemisphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the recently introduced fuzzy sphere technique for the 3d Ising CFT to the case of boundary CFT (BCFT) using the fuzzy hemisphere. This allows to study conformal boundary conditions, and we investigate the three boundary universality classes of the 3d Ising CFT. These include the ordinary, extraordinary, and special boundary conditions. We identify the qualitative signatures of boundary conformal invariance, and in the cases of ordinary and extraordinary boundary conditions, obtain numerical estimates for the spectrum of low-lying boundary primaries. For the special boundary conditions, we are only able to see their qualitative features, while reliable estimates of the scaling dimensions of boundary primaries are left for the future work.</description>

      <title>Stochastic weight matrix dynamics during learning and Dyson Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the update of weight matrices in learning algorithms can be described in the framework of Dyson Brownian motion, thereby inheriting many features of random matrix theory. We relate the level of stochasticity to the ratio of the learning rate and the mini-batch size, providing more robust evidence to a previously conjectured scaling relationship. We discuss universal and non-universal features in the resulting Coulomb gas distribution and identify the Wigner surmise and Wigner semicircle explicitly in a teacher-student model and in the (near-)solvable case of the Gaussian restricted Boltzmann machine.</description>

      <title>ftint: Calculating gradient-flow integrals with pySecDec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The program ftint is introduced which numerically evaluates dimensionally regulated integrals as they occur in the perturbative approach to the gradient-flow formalism in quantum field theory. It relies on sector decomposition in order to determine the coefficients of the individual orders in $\epsilon=(4-D)/2$, where $D$ is the space-time dimension. For that purpose, it implements an interface to the public library pySecDec. The current version works for massive and massless integrals up to three-loop level with vanishing external momenta, but the underlying method is extendable to more general cases.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap for Finite N Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16925v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive framework for analyzing finite $N$ lattice Yang-Mills theory and finite $N$ matrix models. Utilizing this framework, we examine the bootstrap approach to SU(2) Lattice Yang-Mills Theory in 2,3 and 4 dimensions. The SU(2) Makeenko-Migdal loop equations on the lattice are linear and closed exclusively on single-trace Wilson loops. This inherent linearity significantly enhances the efficiency of the bootstrap approach due to the convex nature of the problem, permitting the inclusion of Wilson loops up to length 24. The exact upper and lower margins for the free energy per plaquette, derived from our bootstrap method, demonstrate good agreement with Monte Carlo data, achieving precision within $0.1\%$ for the physically relevant range of couplings in both three and four dimensions. Additionally, our bootstrap data provides estimates of the string tension, in qualitative agreement with existing Monte Carlo computations.</description>
