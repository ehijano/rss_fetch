      <title>The remarkable microquasar S26: a super-Eddington PeVatron?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. S26 is an extragalactic microquasar with the most powerful jets ever discovered. They have a kinetic luminosity of $L_{\rm j}\sim5\times 10^{40}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$. This implies that the accretion power to the black hole should be super-Eddington, of the order of $L_{\rm acc}\sim L_{\rm j}$. However, the observed X-ray flux of this system indicates an apparent very sub-Eddington accretion luminosity of $L_{\rm X}\approx 10^{37}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$.
  Aims. We aim to characterize the nature of S26, explain the system emission, and study the feasibility of super-Eddington microquasars as potential PeVatron sources.
  Methods. We first analyze X-ray observations of S26 obtained with XMM-Newton and model the super-Eddington disk and its wind. We then develop a jet model and study the particle acceleration and radiative processes that occur in shocks generated near the base of the jet and in its terminal region.
  Results. We find that the discrepancy between the jet and the apparent disk luminosities in S26 is caused by the complete absorption of the disk radiation by the wind ejected from the super-Eddington disk. The nonthermal X-rays are produced near the base of the jet, and the thermal X-rays are emitted in the terminal regions. The radio emission observed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array can be explained as synchrotron radiation produced at the reverse shock in the lobes. We also find that S26 can accelerate protons to PeV energies in both the inner jet and the lobes. The ultra-high energy protons accelerated in the lobes are injected into the ISM with a total power of $\sim 10^{36}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$.
  Conclusions. We conclude that S26 is a super-Eddington microquasar with a dense disk-driven wind that obscures the X-ray emission from the inner disk, and that the supercritical nature of the system allows the acceleration of cosmic rays to PeV energies.</description>

      <title>The Unknowns of the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background Hinder New Physics Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinos traveling over cosmic distances are ideal probes of new physics. We leverage on the approaching detection of the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) to explore whether, if the DSNB showed departures from theoretical predictions, we could attribute such modifications to new physics unequivocally. In order to do so, we focus on visible neutrino decay. Many of the signatures from neutrino decay are degenerate with astrophysical unknowns entering the DSNB modeling. Next generation neutrino observatories, such as Hyper-Kamiokande, JUNO, as well as DUNE, will set stringent limits on a neutrino lifetime over mass ratio $\tau/m \sim 10^{9}$-$10^{10}$ s eV$^{-1}$ at $90\%$ C.L., if astrophysical uncertainties and detector backgrounds were to be fully under control. However, if the lightest neutrino is almost massless and the neutrino mass ordering is normal, constraining visible decay will not be realistically possible in the coming few decades. We also assess the challenges of distinguishing among different new physics scenarios (such as visible decay, invisible decay, and quasi-Dirac neutrinos), all leading up to similar signatures in the DSNB. This work shows that the DSNB potential for probing new physics strongly depends on an improved understanding of the experimental backgrounds at next generation neutrino observatories as well as progress in the DSNB modeling.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous X-ray and optical polarization observations of the blazar Mrk 421</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present near-simultaneous X-ray and optical polarization measurements in the high synchrotron peaked (HSP) blazar Mrk 421. The X-ray polarimetric observations were carried out using {\it Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer} ({\it IXPE}) on 06 December 2023. During {\it IXPE} observations, we also carried out optical polarimetric observations using 104cm Sampurnanand telescope at Nainital and multi-band optical imaging observations using 2m Himalayan Chandra Telescope at Hanle. From model-independent analysis of {\it IXPE} data, we detected X-ray polarization with degree of polarization ($\Pi_X$) of 8.5$\pm$0.5\% and an electric vector position angle ($\Psi_X$) of 10.6$\pm$1.7 degrees in the 2$-$8 keV band. From optical polarimetry on 06 December 2023, in B, V, and R bands, we found values of $\Pi_B$ = 4.27$\pm$0.32\%, $\Pi_V$= 3.57$\pm$0.31\%, and $\Pi_R$= 3.13$\pm$0.25\%. The value of $\Pi_B$ is greater than that observed at longer optical wavelengths, with the degree of polarization suggesting an energy-dependent trend, gradually decreasing from higher to lower energies. This is consistent with that seen in other HSP blazars and favour a stratified emission region encompassing a shock front. The emission happening in the vicinity of the shock front will be more polarized due to the ordered magnetic field resulting from shock compression. The X-ray emission, involving high-energy electrons, originates closer to the shock front than the optical emission. The difference in the spatial extension could plausibly account for the observed variation in polarization between X-ray and optical wavelengths. This hypothesis is further supported by the broadband spectral energy distribution modeling of the X-ray and optical data.</description>

      <title>Multi-physics framework for fast modeling of gamma-ray burst afterglows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present PyBlastAfterglow, a modular C++ code with a Python interface to model light curves and sky maps of gamma-ray burst afterglows. The code is open-source, modular, and sufficiently fast to perform parameter grid studies. PyBlastAfterglow is designed to be easily extendable and used as a testing bed for new physics and methods related to gamma-ray burst afterglows. For the dynamical evolution of relativistic ejecta, a thin-shell approximation is adopted, where both forward and reverse shocks are included self-consistently, as well as lateral structure, lateral spreading, and radiation losses. Several models of the shock microphysics are implemented, including a fully numerical model of the downstream electron distribution evolution, synchrotron emission, self-absorption, and synchrotron self-Compton emission under the one-zone approximation. Thus, the code is designed to be able to model complex afterglows that include emission from reverse shock, very high energy emission, structured jets, and off-axis observations.</description>

      <title>The fast rise of the unusual Type IIL/IIb SN 2018ivc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the photometric and spectroscopic dataset of the Type II supernova (SN) 2018ivc in the nearby (10 Mpc) galaxy Messier 77. Thanks to the high cadence of the CHASE survey, we observed the SN rising very rapidly by nearly three magnitudes in five hours (or 18 mag d$^{-1}$). The $r$-band light curve presents four distinct phases: the maximum light is reached in just one day, then a first, rapid linear decline precedes a short-duration plateau. Finally, a long, slower linear decline lasted for one year. Following a radio rebrightening, we detected SN 2018ivc four years after the explosion. The early spectra show a blue, nearly featureless continuum, but the spectra evolve rapidly: after about 10 days a prominent H$\alpha$ line starts to emerge, with a peculiar profile, but the spectra are heavily contaminated by emission lines from the host galaxy. He I lines, namely $\lambda\lambda$5876,7065, are also strong. On top of the former, a strong absorption from the Na I doublet is visible, indicative of a non-negligible internal reddening. From its equivalent width, we derive a lower limit on the host reddening of $A_V\simeq1.5$ mag, while from the Balmer decrement and a match of the $B-V$ colour curve of SN 2018ivc to that of the comparison objects, a host reddening of $A_V\simeq3.0$ mag is obtained. The spectra are similar to those of SNe II, but with strong He lines. Given the peculiar light curve and spectral features, we suggest SN 2018ivc could be a transitional object between the Type IIL and Type IIb SNe classes. In addition, we found signs of interaction with circumstellar medium in the light curve, making SN 2018ivc also an interacting event. Finally, we modelled the early multi-band light curves and photospheric velocity of SN 2018ivc to estimate the explosion and CSM physical parameters.</description>

      <title>Further evidence of Quasiperiodic Eruptions in a tidal disruption event AT2019vcb by SRG/eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a short, large amplitude X-ray flare from AT2019vcb (aka Tormund), a tidal disruption event at $z=0.088$. The discovery is based on the data from the SRG/eROSITA X-ray telescope which happened to observe the source seven months after the onset of the optical TDE. eROSITA observation occurred 13 days after a soft flare was detected in the XMM-Newton data by Quintin et al. 2023. Both events bear similar characteristics in terms of timing and spectral properties. eROSITA spectrum is described as an accretion disk with a characteristic temperature of $\sim180$ eV and luminosity $\sim8\times10^{43}$ erg/s. The eROSITA flare lasted less than 12 hours and had an amplitude $\ge70$ with respect to the quiescent level, no flares were detected in later eROSITA observations (6-18 months later). The XMM-Newton and eROSITA flares provide strong evidence that the TDE AT2019vcb is a bona fide QPE source. Our work further strengthens the direct connection between TDEs and QPE following similar recent results in a TDE AT2019qiz by Nicholl et al. 2024.</description>

      <title>NICER observes the full Z-track in GX 13+1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the temporal analysis of the persistent neutron star low-mass X-ray binary (NS LMXB) GX 13+1 using NICER data. Classification of this source has been ambiguous so far. We investigate the evolution of the source in its hardness-intensity diagram (HID) and power density spectra (PDS) of the 0.5-10 keV NICER archival data. For the first time, we detect the source tracing out the entire Z-track, distinctly identifying the horizontal branch (HB), normal branch (NB) and flaring branch (FB). We also detect a peaked noise component in the PDS at $\sim$ 5.4 Hz, which appears to be present when the source is either in the NB or FB. We note a positive slope of the HB in the HID which could be due to either the high intrinsic absorption of the source or the stronger contribution of the soft spectral components in the soft energy domain.</description>

      <title>Preferential Occurrence of Fast Radio Bursts in Massive Star-Forming Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration events detected from beyond the Milky Way. FRB emission characteristics favor highly magnetized neutron stars, or magnetars, as the sources, as evidenced by FRB-like bursts from a galactic magnetar, and the star-forming nature of FRB host galaxies. However, the processes that produce FRB sources remain unknown. Although galactic magnetars are often linked to core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), it's uncertain what determines which supernovae result in magnetars. The galactic environments of FRB sources can be harnessed to probe their progenitors. Here, we present the stellar population properties of 30 FRB host galaxies discovered by the Deep Synoptic Array. Our analysis shows a significant deficit of low-mass FRB hosts compared to the occurrence of star-formation in the universe, implying that FRBs are a biased tracer of star-formation, preferentially selecting massive star-forming galaxies. This bias may be driven by galaxy metallicity, which is positively correlated with stellar mass. Metal-rich environments may favor the formation of magnetar progenitors through stellar mergers, as higher metallicity stars are less compact and more likely to fill their Roche lobes, leading to unstable mass transfer. Although massive stars do not have convective interiors to generate strong magnetic fields by dynamo, merger remnants are thought to have the requisite internal magnetic-field strengths to result in magnetars. The preferential occurrence of FRBs in massive star-forming galaxies suggests that CCSN of merger remnants preferentially forms magnetars.</description>

      <title>Novel understanding of Cosmological Phenomena using Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) offer unique probes of diverse cosmological phenomena due to their characteristic properties, including short duration timescale and high dispersion measure. This study investigates two distinct theoretical frameworks: the Gertsenshtein-Zel'dovich (GZ) mechanism for ultra-high-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) and fraction of dark matter in primordial mass black holes. We explore the hypothesis that ultra-high-frequency GWs could be responsible for FRB generation. Consequently, the detection of continuous GWs signal from the vicinity of an FRB by current or future detectors would disfavour merger-based FRB formation models and lend significant credence to the GZ theory, which postulates the existence of high-frequency GWs. Moreover, we examine the effects of modified gravity on the gravitational lensing of FRBs and thereby put constraints on the fraction of primordial mass black holes made up of dark matter. Our analysis suggests that modified gravity introduces a screening effect on lensing, analogous to the scattering effect by plasma on light rays. We further discuss the expected detection rates of FRBs as well as lensed FRBs with upcoming radio telescopes, primarily HIRAX.</description>

      <title>Varstrometry for Off-nucleus and Dual sub-Kpc AGN (VODKA): Long-slit optical spectroscopic follow-up with Gemini/GMOS and HST/STIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Gemini/GMOS and HST/STIS optical spectra for 27 dual quasar candidates selected based on their variability-induced astrometric noise or double detections in Gaia (the VODKA project). From this follow-up, we spectroscopically identify 10 star superpositions and 8 dual/lensed quasars. Among the remaining targets, 2 are likely dual/lensed quasars based on additional radio imaging, while the rest are quasars with unknown companions. Notably, WISE J1649+0812 is a newly confirmed dual quasar with a projected separation of 5 kpc at $z=1.39$ and a significant velocity offset of 183$\pm$76 km/s, highlighting the utility of narrow emission lines in identifying genuine dual quasars. Without prior photometric or spectroscopic selection, we find the star contamination rate to be 37-63%, while the dual/lensed quasar fraction is $\gtrsim$ 30% in the follow-up VODKA sample. However, when combined with existing unresolved spectra and spatially-resolved two-band color cuts, the dual/lensed quasar fraction can be increased to $\gtrsim$ 67%. High signal-to-noise ratio spectra ($\gtrsim$ 20 per spectral element) with adequate spectral resolution ($R \gtrsim$ 1000) are essential for identifying faint absorption lines in foreground stars and detecting dual quasars through velocity offsets.</description>

      <title>A novel emulator for fission event generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wide variety of emulators have been developed for nuclear physics, particularly for use in quantifying and propagating parametric uncertainties to observables. Most of these methods have been used to emulate structure observables, such as energies, masses, or separation energies, or reaction observables, such as cross sections. Rarely, if ever, have event generators for theory models been emulated. Here, we describe one such novel emulator for the fission fragment decay code, $\texttt{CGMF}$, which calculates the emission of prompt neutrons and $\gamma$ rays from fission fragments. The emulator described in this work uses a combination of a noisy emission model and mixture density network to model the neutron and $\gamma$-ray multiplicities and energies. In this manuscript, we display the power of this type of emulator for not only modeling average prompt fission observables but also correlations between fission fragment initial conditions and these observables, using both neutron-induced and spontaneous fission reactions.</description>

      <title>Radioactivity of Quark Nuggets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quark nuggets $^A_ZQ$, as Fermionic non-topological solitons, could have their mass per baryon smaller than ordinary nuclei and behave as exotic nuclei with different relations of atomic number and atomic mass number. Using both the degenerate Fermi gas model and the Friedberg-Lee shell model, we calculate the properties of quark nuggets made of up and down quarks. Similar to ordinary nuclei, quark nuggets could exhibit their own radioactivity, including gamma decay, beta decay, and (explosive) spontaneous fission, with the qualitative properties presented here. These quark nugget properties may provide guidance for searching for quark nuggets in situ from binary neutron star mergers.</description>

Abstract: It has been widely accepted that mass-accreting white dwarfs (WDs) are the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae or electron-capture supernovae. Previous work has shown that the accretion rate could affect the elemental abundance on the outer layers of CO WDs, and therefore affect the observational characteristics after they exploded as SNe Ia. However, it has not been well studied how elemental abundance changes on the outer layers of He-accreting ONe WDs as they approach the Chandrasekhar mass limit. In this paper, we investigated the evolution of He-accreting ONe WDs with MESA. We found that a CO-rich mantle will accumulate beneath the He layers resulting from the He burning, after which the ignition of the CO-rich mantle could transform carbon into silicon (Si). The amount of Si produced by carbon burning is strongly anti-correlated with the accretion rate. As the ONe WD nearly approaches the Chandrasekhar mass limit (Mch) through accretion, it is likely to undergo accretion-induced collapse (AIC), resulting in the formation of the neutron star (NS).</description>

      <title>Sgr A* Shadow Study with KTN Space Time and Investigation of NUT Charge Existence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, I investigate the existence of the NUT charge through the KTN spacetime using shadow observations of Sgr A*. I report that the range of my constraint for the NUT charge is between $-$0.5 and 0.5 for Schwarzschild-like and very slowly rotating KTN black holes. This range extends to 1.5 for spins up to $-$2 and $-$1.5 for spins up to 2 based on Keck observations for both 40$^\circ$ and 10$^\circ$ viewing angles. For VLTI observations, Schwarzschild-like and very slowly rotating KTN black holes are excluded for a 40$^\circ$ viewing angle, and the NUT charge is constrained to a very narrow range for a 10$^\circ$ viewing angle. I report that the possibility of having KTN naked singularities in Sgr A* is small, considering the uncertainties in the shadow size.</description>

      <title>How to describe the Sweet-Parker model in general relativity</title>

Abstract: It is a hot topic nowadays that magnetic reconnection, as a physical process to release magnetic energy effectively, occurs in numerous complicated astrophysical systems. Since the magnetic reconnection is thought to occur frequently in the accretion flow around compact objects which induce strong gravitational field, it is now regarded to be a practical mechanism to extract energy from rotation black holes, which motivates people to consider how to describe the process of magnetic reconnection in a generally relativistic way. In this work, I try to explore the description of Sweet-Parker model, one of the most famous theoretical models of magnetic reconnection, in general relativity. I begin with revisiting the Sweet-Parker model in special relativity and reorganize the calculations in seven steps, whose generally relativistic forms are discussed. I propose in this work, from the general discussions and consequences of specific examples, that no property in Sweet-Parker model would be modified by spacetime curvature, which is opposite to the conclusions in previous work. However, on the contrary, observation in different rest frames may bring modifications. If the magnetic reconnection occurs not in the rest frame of observer, the observer would find out that the detected relation between the reconnection rate and Lundquist number or that between outflow speed and Alfven velocity are not the same as the detected relations if the magnetic reconnection occurs just in the rest frame of observer.</description>

      <title>A gas rich cosmic web revealed by partitioning the missing baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximately half of the Universe's dark matter resides in collapsed halos; significantly less than half of the baryonic matter (protons and neutrons) remains confined to halos. A small fraction of baryons are in stars and the interstellar medium within galaxies. The lion's share are diffuse (less than $10^{-3}$ cm$^{-3}$) and ionized (neutral fraction less than $10^{-4}$), located in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and in the halos of galaxy clusters, groups, and galaxies. The quantity and spatial distribution of this diffuse ionized gas is notoriously difficult to measure, but has wide implications for galaxy formation, astrophysical feedback, and precision cosmology. Recently, the dispersion of extragalactic Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) has been used to measure the total content of cosmic baryons. However, past efforts had modest samples and methods that cannot discriminate between IGM and halo gas, which is critical for studying feedback and for observational cosmology. Here, we present a large cosmological sample of FRB sources localized to their host galaxies. We have robustly partitioned the missing baryons into the IGM, galaxy clusters, and galaxies, providing a late-Universe measurement of the total baryon density of $\Omega_b h_{70}$=0.049$\pm$0.003. Our results indicate efficient feedback processes that can expel gas from galaxy halos and into the intergalactic medium, agreeing with the enriched cosmic web scenario seen in cosmological simulations. The large diffuse baryon fraction that we have measured disfavours bottom-heavy stellar initial mass functions, which predict a large total stellar density, $\Omega_*$.</description>

      <title>Null geodesics around a black hole with weakly coupled global monopole charge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an asymptotically flat black hole spacetime with weakly nonminimally coupled monopole charge. We analytically and numerically investigate light ray propagation around such a black hole by employing the common Lagrangian formalism. Our analysis encompasses both radial and angular geodesics, for which we present analytical solutions in terms of incomplete Lauricella hypergeometric functions. Additionally, we explore the impact of the coupling constant on geodesic motion. Based on observations from the Event Horizon Telescope, we constrain the black hole parameters, resulting in a coupling constant range of $-0.5 M^2\lesssim \alpha\lesssim 0.5 M^2$. Throughout our analysis, we simulate all possible trajectories and, where necessary, perform numerical inversion of the included integrals.</description>

      <title>Minimally implicit methods for the numerical integration of the neutrino transport equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12089v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of many astrophysical systems is dominated by the interaction between matter and radiation such as photons or neutrinos. The dynamics can be described by the evolution equations of radiation hydrodynamics in which reactions between matter particles and radiation quanta couples the hydrodynamic equations to those of radiative transfer (see Munier &amp; Weaver (1986a) and Munier &amp; Weaver (1986b)). The numerical treatment has to account for their potential stiffness (e.g., in optically thick environments). In this article, we will present a new method to numerically integrate these equations in a stable way by using minimally implicit Runge-Kutta methods. With these methods, the inversion of the implicit operator can be done analytically, so the computational cost is equivalent to that of an explicit method. We strongly take into account the physical behavior of the evolved variables in the limit of the stiff regime in the derivation of the methods. We will show the results of applying these methods to the reactions between neutrinos and matter in some tests and also in realistic core-collapse supernovae simulations.</description>

      <title>The effect of stellar rotation on black hole mass and spin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10400v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational wave signature of a binary black hole (BBH) merger is dependent on its component mass and spin. If such black holes originate from rapidly rotating progenitors, the large angular momentum reserve in the star could drive a collapsar-like supernova explosion, hence substantially impacting these characteristics of the black holes in the binary. To examine the effect of stellar rotation on the resulting black hole mass and spin, we conduct a 1D general relativistic study of the end phase of the collapse. We find that the resulting black hole mass at times differs significantly from the previously assumed values. We quantify the dependence of the black hole spin magnitude on the hydrodynamics of the accretion flow, providing analytical relations for calculating the mass and spin based on the progenitor's pre-collapse properties. Depending on the nature of the accretion flow, our findings have implications for the black hole upper mass gap resulting from pair-instability supernovae, the maximum mass of a maximally rotating stellar black hole, and the maximum effective spin of a BBH formed in tidally locked helium star - black hole binary.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Limb Brightening in the Parsec-scale Jet of NGC 315 through Global Very Long Baseline Interferometry Observations and Its Implications for Jet Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first observation of the nearby giant radio galaxy NGC 315 using a global VLBI array consisting of 22 radio antennas located across five continents, including high-sensitivity stations, at 22 GHz. Utilizing the extensive $(u,v)$-coverage provided by the array, coupled with the application of a recently developed super-resolution imaging technique based on the regularized maximum likelihood method, we were able to transversely resolve the NGC 315 jet at parsec scales for the first time. Previously known for its central ridge-brightened morphology at similar scales in former VLBI studies, the jet now clearly exhibits a limb-brightened structure. This finding suggests an inherent limb-brightening that was not observable before due to limited angular resolution. Considering that the jet is viewed at an angle of $\sim50^\circ$, the observed limb-brightening is challenging to reconcile with the magnetohydrodynamic models and simulations, which predict that the Doppler-boosted jet edges should dominate over the non-boosted central layer. The conventional jet model that proposes a fast spine and a slow sheath with uniform transverse emissivity may pertain to our observations. However, in this model, the relativistic spine would need to travel at speeds of $\Gamma\gtrsim6.0-12.9$ along the de-projected jet distance of (2.3-10.8) $\times 10^3$ gravitational radii from the black hole. We propose an alternative scenario that suggests higher emissivity at the jet boundary layer, resulting from more efficient particle acceleration or mass loading onto the jet edges, and consider prospects for future observations with even higher angular resolution.</description>

      <title>Soft X-ray emission from the classical nova AT 2018bej</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical novae are known to demonstrate a supersoft X-ray source (SSS) state following outbursts, which is associated with residual thermonuclear burning on the white dwarf (WD) surface. During its all-sky survey (eRASS1), the eROSITA telescope onboard the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma observatory discovered a bright new SSS, whose position is consistent with the known classical nova AT 2018bej in the Large Magellanic Cloud. There were two eROSITA spectra obtained during eRASS1 and eRASS2 monitoring epochs and one XMM-Newton grating spectrum close to the eRASS1 epoch. We aim to describe the eROSITA and XMM-Newton spectra of AT 2018bej with our local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) atmosphere models. We focused on the evolution of the hot WD properties between the eRASS1 and eRASS2 epochs, especially on the change of the carbon abundance. A grid of LTE model atmosphere spectra were calculated for different values of the effective temperature (from $T_{\rm eff}= 525$ to $700\,\rm kK$), surface gravity (six values) and chemical composition with five different values of carbon and nitrogen abundances. Both eRASS1 and XMM $0.3-0.6$ keV spectral analyses yield a temperature of the WD of $T_{\rm eff}{\sim}\,600\, \rm kK$ and a WD radius of $8000-8700\,\rm km$. Simultaneous fitting of the eROSITA spectra for two epochs (eRASS1 and eRASS2) with a common WD mass parameter demonstrates a decrease in $T_{\rm eff}$ accompanied by an increase in the WD radius and a decrease in the carbon abundance. However, these changes are marginal and coincide within errors. The derived WD mass is estimated to be $1.05-1.15\, M_\odot$. We traced a minor evolution of the source on a half-year timescale accompanied by a decrease in carbon abundance and concluded that LTE model atmospheres can be used to analyse the available X-ray spectra of classical novae during their SSS stage.</description>

      <title>Optical and Radio Analysis of Systemically Classified Broad-lined Type Ic Supernovae from the Zwicky Transient Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a magnitude-limited sample of 36 Broad-lined Type Ic Supernovae (SNe Ic-BL) from the Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey (detected between March 2018 and August 2021), which is the largest systematic study of SNe Ic-BL done in literature thus far. We present the light curves (LCs) for each of the SNe, and analyze the shape of the LCs to derive empirical parameters, along with the explosion epochs for every event. The sample has an average absolute peak magnitude in the r band of $M_r^{max}$ = -18.51 $\pm$ 0.15 mag. Using spectra obtained around peak light, we compute expansion velocities from the Fe II 5169 Angstrom line for each event with high enough signal-to-noise ratio spectra, and find an average value of $v_{ph}$ = 16,100 $\pm$ 1,100 km $s^{-1}$. We also compute bolometric LCs, study the blackbody temperature and radii evolution over time, and derive the explosion properties of the SNe. The explosion properties of the sample have average values of $M_{Ni}$ = $0.37_{-0.06}^{+0.08}$ solar masses, $M_{ej}$ = $2.45_{-0.41}^{+0.47}$ solar masses, and $E_K$= $4.02_{-1.00}^{+1.37} \times 10^{51}$ erg. Thirteen events have radio observations from the Very Large Array, with 8 detections and 5 non-detections. We find that the populations that have radio detections and radio non-detections are indistinct from one another with respect to their optically-inferred explosion properties, and there are no statistically significant correlations present between the events' radio luminosities and optically-inferred explosion properties. This provides evidence that the explosion properties derived from optical data alone cannot give inferences about the radio properties of SNe Ic-BL, and likely their relativistic jet formation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Theoretical modeling of the exceptional GRB 221009A afterglow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extraordinary gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A provides a great opportunity to investigate the enigmatic origin and evolution of GRBs. However, the complexity of the observations associated with this GRB provides significant challenges to developing a theoretical modeling in a coherent framework. In this paper, we present a theoretical interpretation of the GRB 221009A afterglow within the relativistic fireball scenario, aiming to describe the broadband dataset with a consistent model evolution. We find that the adiabatic fireball evolution in the slow-cooling regime provides a viable scenario in good agreement with observations. Crucial to our analysis is the set of simultaneous GeV and TeV gamma-ray data obtained by AGILE and LHAASO during the early afterglow phases. Having successfully modeled as inverse Compton emission the high-energy spectral and lightcurve properties of the afterglow up to $10^4$ s, we extend our model to later times when also optical and X-ray data are available. This approach results in a coherent physical framework that successfully describes all observed properties of the afterglow up to very late times, approximately $10^6$ s. Our model requires time-variable microphysical parameters, with a moderately increasing efficiency $\varepsilon_e$ of a few percent for transferring the shock energy to radiating particles and a decreasing efficiency for magnetic field generation $\varepsilon_B$ in the range $10^{-5}$-$10^{-7}$. Fitting the detailed multifrequency spectral data across the afterglow provides a unique test of our model.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Multiband Photometry of the Early Optical Afterglow of GRB 240825A with Mephisto</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most luminous transients in the universe. The interaction of the relativistic jet with the circumburst medium produces an afterglow and generates multiwavelength emission. In this work, we present simultaneous multiband photometry of GRB~240825A with the Multi-channel Photometric Survey Telescope (Mephisto) and analyze its temporal and spectral properties. The measurement began 128 seconds after the GRB trigger and continued until the fourth day when the afterglow essentially diminished and the measured brightness was close to that of the host galaxy. Based on the multiband light curves in the $uvgriz$ bands, we find that the optical flux density satisfies $F_{\nu,{\rm obs}}\propto t^{-1.34}\nu^{-2.48}$ with a spectral index of $2.48$ much larger than those of most other GRBs. To reconcile the measured much softer spectral energy distribution (SED) with that predicted by the standard afterglow model, an extra host-galaxy extinction of $E_{B-V}\sim(0.37-0.57)$ mag is required. We interpreted this excess as arising from a dense circumburst medium. We further find that the SED of the optical afterglow hardened as the afterglow decayed and the color excess $E_{B-V}$ decreased $\sim0.21$ mag in the first 3000 seconds. Finally, we analyze the properties of the host galaxy of GRB~240825A based on data from the SDSS, PanSTARRS and HSC-SSP surveys. For a host redshift of $z=0.659$, the stellar mass and star formation rate of the host galaxy are estimated to be $\log(M_*/M_\odot)=10.0^{+0.3}_{-0.3}$ and $\log({\rm SFR}/M_{\odot}{\rm yr}^{-1})= 0.6^{+0.8}_{-3.3}$, respectively, pointing to a gas-rich, star-forming, medium-size galaxy.</description>

Abstract: Joint observations in electromagnetic and gravitational waves shed light on the physics of objects and surrounding environments with extreme gravity that are otherwise unreachable via siloed observations in each messenger. However, such detections remain challenging due to the rapid and faint nature of counterparts. Protocols for discovery and inference still rely on human experts manually inspecting survey alert streams and intuiting optimal usage of limited follow-up resources. Strategizing an optimal follow-up program requires adaptive sequential decision-making given evolving light curve data that (i) maximizes a global objective despite incomplete information and (ii) is robust to stochasticity introduced by detectors/observing conditions. Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches allow agents to implicitly learn the physics/detector dynamics and the behavior policy that maximize a designated objective through experience. To demonstrate the utility of such an approach for the kilonova follow-up problem, we train a toy RL agent for the goal of maximizing follow-up photometry for the true kilonova among several contaminant transient light curves. In a simulated environment where the agent learns online, it achieves 3x higher accuracy compared to a random strategy. However, it is surpassed by human agents by up to a factor of 2. This is likely because our hypothesis function (Q that is linear in state-action features) is an insufficient representation of the optimal behavior policy. More complex agents could perform at par or surpass human experts. Agents like these could pave the way for machine-directed software infrastructure to efficiently respond to next generation detectors, for conducting science inference and optimally planning expensive follow-up observations, scalably and with demonstrable performance guarantees.</description>

      <title>Exploring waveforms with non-GR deviations for extreme mass-ratio inspirals</title>

Abstract: The fundamental process of detecting and examining the polarization modes of gravitational waves plays a pivotal role in enhancing our grasp on the precise mechanisms behind their generation. A thorough investigation is essential for delving deeper into the essence of gravitational waves and rigorously evaluating and validating the range of modified gravity theories. In this line of interest, a general description of black holes in theories beyond general relativity can serve a meaningful purpose where distinct deviation parameters can be mapped to solutions representing distinct theories. Employing a refined version of the deformed Kerr geometry, which is free from pathological behaviours such as unphysical divergences in the metric, we explore an extreme mass-ratio inspiral system, wherein a stellar-mass object perturbs a supermassive black hole. We compute the effects of deformation parameters on the rate of change of orbital energy and angular momentum, orbital evolution and phase dynamics with leading order post-Newtonian corrections. With the waveform analysis, we assess the plausibility of detecting deviations from general relativity through observations facilitated by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), simultaneously constraining the extent of these deviations. Therefore, this analysis provides an understanding while highlighting the essential role of observations in advancing gravitational phenomena beyond general relativity.</description>

      <title>SMILE: Discriminating milli-lens systems in a pilot project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15229</link>

Abstract: Dark Matter (DM) remains poorly probed on critical, sub-galactic scales, where predictions from different models diverge in terms of abundance and density profiles of halos. Gravitational lens systems on milli-arcsecond scales (milli-lenses) are expected for a population of dense DM halos, or free-floating supermassive black holes (SMBHs), that might be comprised of primordial black holes (PBHs), in the mass range of $10^6$ to $10^9 M_\odot$. In this paper, we aim to look for milli-lens systems via a systematic search in a large sample of radio-loud AGN observed with very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI). We present the observational strategy to discriminate milli-lenses from contaminant objects mimicking a milli-lens morphology. In a pilot project, we have investigated VLBI images from 13,828 sources from the Astrogeo VLBI image database and reduced the number of candidates to 40 in a first step. We present here the images and analysis of sensitive follow-up observations with the EVN at 5 and 22 GHz, and streamline our analysis to reject milli-lens candidates. Using constraints such as the surface brightness ratio, conservation of spectral shape, stability of flux ratios over time, and changes in morphology, we can confidently discriminate between milli-lenses and their mimickers. Using the above constraints, we rule out 32 out of our initial 40 candidates as milli-lenses, demonstrating the power of our approach. Also, we find many new candidates for compact symmetric objects, that are thought to be short-lived, jetted radio sources. This serves as a pathfinder for the final sample used for the SMILE (Search for MIlli-LEnses) project, which will allow us to constrain DM models by comparing the results to theoretical predictions. This SMILE sample will consist of $\sim$5,000 sources based on the VLA CLASS survey, including many observations obtained for this project specifically.</description>
