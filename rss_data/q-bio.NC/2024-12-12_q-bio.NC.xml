      <title>Swin fMRI Transformer Predicts Early Neurodevelopmental Outcomes from Neonatal fMRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain development in the first few months of human life is a critical phase characterized by rapid structural growth and functional organization. Accurately predicting developmental outcomes during this time is crucial for identifying delays and enabling timely interventions. This study introduces the SwiFT (Swin 4D fMRI Transformer) model, designed to predict Bayley-III composite scores using neonatal fMRI data from the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP). To enhance predictive accuracy, we apply dimensionality reduction via group independent component analysis (ICA) and pretrain SwiFT on large adult fMRI datasets to address the challenges of limited neonatal data. Our analysis shows that SwiFT significantly outperforms baseline models in predicting cognitive, motor, and language outcomes, leveraging both single-label and multi-label prediction strategies. The model's attention-based architecture processes spatiotemporal data end-to-end, delivering superior predictive performance. Additionally, we use Integrated Gradients with Smoothgrad sQuare (IG-SQ) to interpret predictions, identifying neural spatial representations linked to early cognitive and behavioral development. These findings underscore the potential of Transformer models to advance neurodevelopmental research and clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Identifying Quantum Mechanical Statistics in Italian Corpora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical and empirical investigation of the statistical behaviour of the words in a text produced by human language. To this aim, we analyse the word distribution of various texts of Italian language selected from a specific literary corpus. We firstly generalise a theoretical framework elaborated by ourselves to identify 'quantum mechanical statistics' in large-size texts. Then, we show that, in all analysed texts, words distribute according to 'Bose--Einstein statistics' and show significant deviations from 'Maxwell--Boltzmann statistics'. Next, we introduce an effect of 'word randomization' which instead indicates that the difference between the two statistical models is not as pronounced as in the original cases. These results confirm the empirical patterns obtained in texts of English language and strongly indicate that identical words tend to 'clump together' as a consequence of their meaning, which can be explained as an effect of 'quantum entanglement' produced through a phenomenon of 'contextual updating'. More, word randomization can be seen as the linguistic-conceptual equivalent of an increase of temperature which destroys 'coherence' and makes classical statistics prevail over quantum statistics. Some insights into the origin of quantum statistics in physics are finally provided.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Approaches for Harmful Brain Activity Detection Using EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classification of harmful brain activities, such as seizures and periodic discharges, play a vital role in neurocritical care, enabling timely diagnosis and intervention. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive method for monitoring brain activity, but the manual interpretation of EEG signals are time-consuming and rely heavily on expert judgment. This study presents a comparative analysis of deep learning architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViTs), and EEGNet, applied to the classification of harmful brain activities using both raw EEG data and time-frequency representations generated through Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). We evaluate the performance of these models use multimodal data representations, including high-resolution spectrograms and waveform data, and introduce a multi-stage training strategy to improve model robustness. Our results show that training strategies, data preprocessing, and augmentation techniques are as critical to model success as architecture choice, with multi-stage TinyViT and EfficientNet demonstrating superior performance. The findings underscore the importance of robust training regimes in achieving accurate and efficient EEG classification, providing valuable insights for deploying AI models in clinical practice.</description>

      <title>On the linear scaling of entropy vs. energy in human brain activity, the Hagedorn temperature and the Zipf law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well established that the brain spontaneously traverses through a very large number of states. Nevertheless, despite its relevance to understanding brain function, a formal description of this phenomenon is still lacking. To this end, we introduce a machine learning based method allowing for the determination of the probabilities of all possible states at a given coarse-graining, from which all the thermodynamics can be derived. This is a challenge not unique to the brain, since similar problems are at the heart of the statistical mechanics of complex systems. This paper uncovers a linear scaling of the entropies and energies of the brain states, a behaviour first conjectured by Hagedorn to be typical at the limiting temperature in which ordinary matter disintegrates into quark matter. Equivalently, this establishes the existence of a Zipf law scaling underlying the appearance of a wide range of brain states. Based on our estimation of the density of states for large scale functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) human brain recordings, we observe that the brain operates asymptotically at the Hagedorn temperature. The presented approach is not only relevant to brain function but should be applicable for a wide variety of complex systems.</description>
