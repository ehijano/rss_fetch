      <title>Convergence and stationary distribution of Elo rating systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Elo rating system is a popular and widely adopted method for measuring the relative skills of players or teams in various sports and competitions. It assigns players numerical ratings and dynamically updates them based on game results and a model parameter. Assuming random games, this leads to a Markov chain for the evolution of the ratings of the $N$ players in the league. Despite its widespread use, little is known about the large-time behaviour of this process. Aiming to fill this gap, in this article we prove that the process has a unique equilibrium to which it converges in an almost-sure sense and in Wasserstein metrics. Moreover, we show important properties of the stationary distribution, such as finiteness of an exponential moment, full support, and quantitative convergence to the players' true skills as the update parameter decreases. We also provide Monte Carlo simulations that illustrate some of these properties and offer new insights.</description>

      <title>Component sizes of rank-2 multiplicative random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that in three different critical regimes, the masses of the connected components of rank-2 multiplicative random graph converge to lengths of excursions of a thinned L\'{e}vy process, perhaps with random coefficients. The three critical regimes are those identified by Bollob\'{a}s, Janson and Riordan (2007), the interacting regime identified by Konarovskyi and Limic (2021), and what we call the nearly bipartite regime which has recently gained interest for its connection to random intersection graphs. Our results are able to extend some of the results by Baslingker et al. (2023) on component sizes of the stochastic blockmodel with two types and those of Federico (2019) and Wang (2023) on the sizes of the connected components of random intersection graphs.</description>

      <title>Vector-valued concentration inequalities on the biased discrete cube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present vector-valued concentration inequalities for the biased measure on the discrete hypercube with an optimal dependence on the bias parameter and the Rademacher type of the target Banach space. These results allow us to obtain novel vector-valued concentration inequalities for the measure given by a product of Poisson distributions. Furthermore, we obtain lower bounds on the average distortion with respect to the biased measure of embeddings of the hypercube into Banach spaces of nontrivial type which imply average non-embeddability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a random graph model with preferential edge attachment and detachment through the embedding into a generalized Yule model. We show that the in-degree distribution of a vertex chosen uniformly at random follows a power law in the supercritical regime but has an exponential decay in the subcritical. We provide the corresponding asymptotics. In the critical regime we observe an intermediate decay. The regimes are clearly defined in terms of parameter ranges.</description>

      <title>Local properties for $1$-dimensional critical branching L\'{e}vy process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a one dimensional critical branching L\'{e}vy process $((Z_t)_{t\geq 0}, \mathbb {P}_x)$. Assume that the offspring distribution either has finite second moment or belongs to the domain of attraction to some $\alpha$-stable distribution with $\alpha\in (1, 2)$, and that the underlying L\'{e}vy process $(\xi_t)_{t\geq 0}$ is non-lattice and has finite $2+\delta^*$ moment for some $\delta^*&gt;0$. We first prove that $$t^{\frac{1}{\alpha-1}}\left(1- \mathbb{E}_{\sqrt{t}y}\left(\exp\left\{-\frac{1}{t^{\frac{1}{\alpha-1}-\frac{1}{2}}}\int h(x) Z_t(\mathrm{d}x) -\frac{1}{t^{\frac{1}{\alpha-1}}} \int g\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{t}}\right)Z_t(\mathrm{d}x)\right\}\right)\right)$$
  converges as $t\to\infty$ for any non-negative bounded Lipschtitz function $g$ and any non-negative directly Riemann integrable function $h$ of compact support.
  Then for any $y\in \R$ and bounded Borel set of positive Lebesgue measure with its boundary having zero Lebesgue measure, under a higher moment condition on $\xi$, we find the decay rate of the probability $\mathbb {P}_{\sqrt{t}y}(Z_t(A)&gt;0)$. As an application, we prove some convergence results for $Z_t$ under the conditional law $\mathbb {P}_{\sqrt{t}y}(\cdot| Z_t(A)&gt;0).$</description>

      <title>Ergodic and foliated kernel-differentiation method for linear responses of random systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the kernel-differentiation method (or likelihood-ratio method) for the linear response of random dynamical systems, after revisit its derivation in a microscopic view via transfer operators. First, for the linear response of physical measures, we extend the method to an ergodic version, which is sampled by one infinitely-long sample path; moreover, the magnitude of the integrand is bounded by a finite decorrelation step number. Second, when the noise and perturbation are along a given foliation, we show that the method is still valid for both finite and infinite time. We numerically demonstrate the ergodic version on a tent map, whose linear response of the physical measure does not exist; but we can add some noise and compute an approximate linear response. We also demonstrate on a chaotic neural network with 51 layers $\times$ 9 neurons, whose perturbation is along a given foliation; we show that adding foliated noise incurs a smaller error than noise in all directions. We give a rough error analysis of the method and show that it can be expensive for small-noise. We propose a potential future program unifying the three popular linear response methods.</description>

      <title>Local Optimality of Dictator Functions with Applications to Courtade--Kumar Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a convex function $\Phi:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$, the $\Phi$-stability of a Boolean function $f$ is $\mathbb{E}[\Phi(T_{\rho}f(\mathbf{X}))]$, where $\mathbf{X}$ is a random vector uniformly distributed on the discrete cube $\{\pm1\}^{n}$ and $T_{\rho}$ is the Bonami-Beckner operator. In this paper, we prove that dictator functions are locally optimal in maximizing the $\Phi$-stability of $f$ over all balanced Boolean functions. Combining this result with our previous bound in \cite{yu2023phi}, we provide a new bound for the Courtade--Kumar conjecture which is expressed in the form of finite-dimensional program. By evaluating this new bound, we numerically verify that the Courtade--Kumar conjecture is true for all $\rho\in[0,0.92]$. Our proofs are based on the majorization of noise operators and hypercontractivity inequalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a weakly coupled system of nonlocal operators which contain both diffusion part with uniformly elliptic diffusion matrices and bounded drift vectors and the jump part with relatively general jump kernels. We use the two-sided scale-invariant Green function estimation to prove the scale-invariant Harnack inequality for the weakly coupled nonlocal systems. In the case where the switching rate matrix is strictly irreducible, the scale-invariant full rank Harnack inequality is proved.Our approach is mainly probabilistic.</description>

      <title>Random vectors in the presence of a single big jump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multidimensional distributions with heavy tails attracted recently the attention of several papers on Applied Probability. However, the most of the works of the last decades are focused on multivariate regular variation, while the rest of the heavy-tailed distribution classes were not studied extensively. About the multivariate subexponentiality we can find several approximations, but none of them get established widely. Having in mind the single big jump and further the multivariate subexponentiality suggested by Samorodnitsky and Sun (2016), we introduce the multivariate long, dominatedly and constistently varying distribution classes. We examine the closure properties of these classes with respect to product convolution, to scale mixture and convolution of random vectors. Especially in the class of multivariate subexponential and dominatedly varying distributions we provide the asymptotic behavior of the random vector and its normalized Levy measure, through their linear combination, that leads to their characterization. Furthermore, we study the single big jump in finite and in random sums of random vectors, permitting some dependence structures, which contain the independence as special case. Finally, we present an application on the asymptotic evaluation of the present value of the total claims in a risk model, with common Poisson counting process, general financial factors and independent, identically distributed claims, with common multivariate subexponential distribution.</description>

      <title>Component Spectrum of Large Sparse Uniformly Random Magical Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we shall try to deduce asymptotic behaviour of component spectrum of random $n \times n$ magical squares with line sum $r \in \mathbb{N}$, which can also be identified as $r$-regular bipartite graphs on $2n$ vertices, chosen uniformly from the set of all possible such squares as the dimension $n$ grows large keeping $r$ fixed. We shall focus on limits (after appropriate centering and scaling) of various statistic depending upon the component structure, e.g., number of small components, size of the smallest and largest components, total number of components etc. We shall observe that for the case $r=2$, this analysis falls into the domain of Logarithmic combinatorial structures, although we shall present a new approach for this case relying only on the asymptotic results for random permutations which also helps us to demonstrate an importance sampling algorithm to estimate parameters defined in terms of uniform distribution on magical squares. The case $r \geq 3$ although does not fall in the domain of the Logarithmic combinatorial structures, we shall establish that its component structure is rather trivial, using techniques based on a power series approach.</description>

      <title>Intersections of Poisson k-flats in hyperbolic space: completing the picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years there has been a lot of interest in the study of isometry invariant Poisson processes of $k$-flats in $d$-dimensional hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^d$, for $0\le k\le d-1$. A phenomenon that has no counterpart in euclidean geometry arises in the investigation of the total $k$-dimensional volume $F_r$ of the process inside a spherical observation window $B_r$ of radius $r$ when one lets $r$ tend to infinity. While $F_r$ is asymptotically normally distributed for $2k\leq d+1$, it has been shown to obey a nonstandard central limit theorem for $2k&gt;d+1$.
  The intersection process of order $m$, for $d-m(d-k) \geq 0$, of the original process $\eta$ consists of all intersections of distinct flats $E_1,\ldots,E_m \in \eta$ with $\dim(E_1\cap\ldots\cap E_m) = d-m(d-k)$. For this intersection process, the total $d-m(d-k)$-dimensional volume $F^{(m)}_r$ of the process in $B_r$, again as $r \to \infty$, is of particular interest. For $2k \leq d+1$ it has been shown that $F^{(m)}_r$ is again asymptotically normally distributed. For $m \geq 2$, the limit is so far unknown, although it has been shown for certain $d$ and $k$ that it cannot be a normal distribution.
  We determine the limit distribution for all values of $d,k,m$. In addition, we establish explicit rates of convergence in the Kolmogorov distance and discuss properties of the limit distribution. Furthermore we show that the asymptotic covariance matrix of the vector $(F^{(1)}_r,\ldots,F^{(m)}_r)^\top$ has full rank when $2k &lt; d+1$ and rank one when $2k \geq d+1$.</description>

      <title>Strong solution and approximation of time-dependent radial Dunkl processes with multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the strong existence and uniqueness of solutions within a Weyl chamber for a class of time-dependent particle systems driven by multiplicative noise. This class includes well-known processes in physics and mathematical finance. We propose a method to prove the existence of negative moments for the solutions. This result allows us to analyze two numerical schemes for approximating the solutions. The first scheme is a $\theta$-Euler--Maruyama scheme, which ensures that the approximated solution remains within the Weyl chamber. The second scheme is a truncated $\theta$-Euler--Maruyama scheme, which produces values in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ instead of the Weyl chamber $\mathbb{W}$, offering improved computational efficiency.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sensitivity of the eigenvectors of random matrices, showing that even small perturbations make the eigenvectors almost orthogonal. More precisely, we consider two deformed Wigner matrices $W+D_1$, $W+D_2$ and show that their bulk eigenvectors become asymptotically orthogonal as soon as $\mathrm{Tr}(D_1-D_2)^2\gg 1$, or their respective energies are separated on a scale much bigger than the local eigenvalue spacing. Furthermore, we show that quadratic forms of eigenvectors of $W+D_1$, $W+D_2$ with any deterministic matrix $A\in\mathbf{C}^{N\times N}$ in a specific subspace of codimension one are of size $N^{-1/2}$. This proves a generalization of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis to eigenvectors belonging to two different spectral families.</description>

      <title>The macroscopic shape of Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns and free probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10754v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Gelfand-Tsetlin function is a real-valued function $\phi:C \to \mathbb{R}$ defined on a finite subset $C$ of the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$ with the property that $\phi(x) \leq \phi(y)$ for every edge $\langle x,y \rangle$ directed north or east between two elements of $C$. We study the statistical physics properties of random Gelfand-Tsetlin functions from the perspective of random surfaces, showing in particular that the surface tension of Gelfand-Tsetlin functions at gradient $u = (u_1,u_2) \in \mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}^2$ is given by \begin{align*} \sigma(u_1,u_2) = - \log (u_1 + u_2 ) - \log \sin (\pi u_1/(u_1+u_2)) -1 + \log \pi. \end{align*} A Gelfand-Tsetlin pattern is a Gelfand-Tsetlin function defined on the triangle $T_n = \{(x_1,x_2) \in \mathbb{Z}^2 : 1 \leq x_2 \leq x_1 \leq n \}$. We show that after rescaling, a sequence of random Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns with fixed diagonal heights approximating a probability measure $\mu$ satisfies a large deviation principle with speed $n^2$ and rate functional of the form \begin{align*} \mathcal{E}[\psi] := \int_{\blacktriangle} \sigma(\nabla \psi)\, \mathrm{d}s \,\mathrm{d}t - \chi[\mu] \end{align*} where $\chi[\mu]$ is Voiculescu's free entropy. We show that the Euler-Lagrange equations satisfied by the minimiser of the rate functional agree with those governing the free compression operation in free probability, thereby resolving a recent conjecture of Shlyakhtenko and Tao.</description>

      <title>On The MCMC Performance In Bernoulli Group Testing And The Random Max-Set Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The group testing problem is a canonical inference task where one seeks to identify $k$ infected individuals out of a population of $n$ people, based on the outcomes of $m$ group tests. Of particular interest is the case of Bernoulli group testing (BGT), where each individual participates in each test independently and with a fixed probability. BGT is known to be an ``information-theoretically'' optimal design, as there exists a decoder that can identify with high probability as $n$ grows the infected individuals using $m^*=\log_2 \binom{n}{k}$ BGT tests, which is the minimum required number of tests among \emph{all} group testing designs.
  An important open question in the field is if a polynomial-time decoder exists for BGT which succeeds also with $m^*$ samples. In a recent paper (Iliopoulos, Zadik COLT '21) some evidence was presented (but no proof) that a simple low-temperature MCMC method could succeed. The evidence was based on a first-moment (or ``annealed'') analysis of the landscape, as well as simulations that show the MCMC success for $n \approx 1000s$.
  In this work, we prove that, despite the intriguing success in simulations for small $n$, the class of MCMC methods proposed in previous work for BGT with $m^*$ samples takes super-polynomial-in-$n$ time to identify the infected individuals, when $k=n^{\alpha}$ for $\alpha \in (0,1)$ small enough. Towards obtaining our results, we establish the tight max-satisfiability thresholds of the random $k$-set cover problem, a result of potentially independent interest in the study of random constraint satisfaction problems.</description>

      <title>Colonization times in Moran process on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moran Birth-death process is a standard stochastic process that is used to model natural selection in spatially structured populations. A newly occurring mutation that invades a population of residents can either fixate on the whole population or it can go extinct due to random drift. The duration of the process depends not only on the total population size $n$, but also on the spatial structure of the population. In this work, we consider the Moran process with a single type of individuals who invade and colonize an otherwise empty environment. Mathematically, this corresponds to the setting where the residents have zero reproduction rate, thus they never reproduce. We present two main contributions. First, in contrast to the Moran process in which residents do reproduce, we show that the colonization time is always at most a polynomial function of the population size $n$. Namely, we show that colonization always takes at most $\frac12n^3-\frac12n^2$ expected steps, and for each $n$, we exactly identify the unique slowest spatial structure where it takes exactly that many steps. Moreover, we establish a stronger bound of roughly $n^{2.5}$ steps for spatial structures that contain only two-way connections and an even stronger bound of roughly $n^2$ steps for lattice-like spatial structures. Second, we discuss various complications that one faces when attempting to measure fixation times and colonization times in spatially structured populations, and we propose to measure the real duration of the process, rather than counting the steps of the classic Moran process.</description>

      <title>Joint identifiability of ancestral sequence, phylogeny and mutation rates under the TKF91 model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of identifying jointly the ancestral sequence, the phylogeny and the parameters in models of DNA sequence evolution with insertion and deletion (indel). Under the classical TKF91 model of sequence evolution, we obtained explicit formulas for the root sequence, the pairwise distances of leaf sequences, as well as the scaled rates of indel and substitution in terms of the distribution of the leaf sequences of an arbitrary phylogeny. These explicit formulas not only strengthen existing invertibility results and work for phylogeny that are not necessarily ultrametric, but also lead to new estimators with less assumption compared with the existing literature. Our simulation study demonstrates that these estimators are statistically consistent as the number of independent samples tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>A forward scheme with machine learning for forward-backward SDEs with jumps by decoupling jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) have been generalized by introducing jumps for better capturing random phenomena, while the resulting FBSDEs are far more intricate than the standard one from every perspective. In this work, we establish a forward scheme for potentially high-dimensional FBSDEs with jumps, taking a similar approach to [Bender and Denk, 117 (2007), Stoch. Process. Their Appl., pp.1793-1812], with the aid of machine learning techniques for implementation. The developed forward scheme is built upon a recursive representation that decouples random jumps at every step and converges exponentially fast to the original FBSDE with jumps, often requiring only a few iterations to achieve sufficient accuracy, along with the error bound vanishing for lower jump intensities. The established framework also holds novelty in its neural network-based implementation of a wide class of forward schemes for FBSDEs, notably whether with or without jumps. We provide an extensive collection of numerical results, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed recursion and its corresponding forward scheme in approximating high-dimensional FBSDEs with jumps (up to 100-dimension) without directly handling the random jumps.</description>

      <title>No arbitrage and the existence of ACLMMs in general diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a seminal paper, F. Delbaen and W. Schachermayer proved that the classical NA ("no arbitrage") condition implies the existence of an "absolutely continuous local martingale measure" (ACLMM). It is known that in general the existence of an ACLMM alone is not sufficient for NA. In this paper we investigate how close these notions are for single asset general diffusion market models. We show that NA is equivalent to the existence of an ACLMM plus a mild regularity condition on the scale function and the absence of reflecting boundaries. For infinite time horizon scenarios, the regularity assumption and the requirement on the boundaries can be dropped, showing equivalence between NA and the existence of an ACLMM. By means of counterexamples, we show that our characterization of NA for finite time horizons is sharp in the sense that neither the regularity condition on the scale function nor the absence of reflecting boundaries can be dropped.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of polynomials that we call fused Specht polynomials and use them to characterize irreducible representations of the fused Hecke algebra with parameter $q=-1$ in the space of polynomials. We apply the fused Specht polynomials to construct a basis for a space of holomorphic (chiral) conformal blocks with central charge $c=1$ which are degenerate at each point. In conformal field theory, this corresponds to all primary fields having conformal weight in the Kac table. The associated correlation functions are expected to give rise to conformally invariant boundary conditions for the Gaussian free field, which has also been verified in special cases.</description>

      <title>Planar UST Branches and $c=-2$ Degenerate Boundary Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a conformal field theory (CFT) description of the probabilistic model of boundary effects in the wired uniform spanning tree (UST) and its algebraic content, concerning the entire first row of the Kac table with central charge $c=-2$. Namely, we prove that all boundary-to-boundary connection probabilities for (potentially fused) branches in the wired UST converge in the scaling limit to explicit CFT quantities, expressed in terms of determinants, which can also be viewed as conformal blocks of degenerate primary fields in a boundary CFT with central charge $c=-2$.
  Moreover, we verify that the Belavin-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov (BPZ) PDEs (i.e., Virasoro degeneracies) of arbitrary orders hold, and we also reveal an underlying valenced Temperley-Lieb algebra action on the space of boundary correlation functions of primary fields in this model. To prove these results, we combine probabilistic techniques with representation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that all 'gradient span algorithms' have asymptotically deterministic behavior on scaled Gaussian random functions as the dimension tends to infinity. In particular, this result explains the counterintuitive phenomenon that different training runs of many large machine learning models result in approximately equal cost curves despite random initialization on a complicated non-convex landscape.
  The distributional assumption of (non-stationary) isotropic Gaussian random functions we use is sufficiently general to serve as realistic model for machine learning training but also encompass spin glasses and random quadratic functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a compounded random walk that is physically well defined on both finite and infinite domains, and samples space-dependent forces throughout jumps. The governing evolution equation for the walk limits to a space-fractional Fokker-Planck equation valid on bounded domains, and recovers the well known superdiffusive space-fractional diffusion equation on infinite domains. This compounded random walk, and its associated fractional Fokker-Planck equation, provides a major advance for modelling space-fractional diffusion through potential fields and on finite domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10115v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the one-dimensional stochastic heat equation with nonlinear Lipschitz coefficients and Dirichlet boundary conditions. We apply Malliavin calculus to this equation; we show that the solution $u \in L_{1,2}$ and provide a different proof for the existence of a density for $u$ that relies on a localization argument. This type of localization has been used before for other SPDE. However, our proof for the existence of a density for the solution to the stochastic heat equation follows a different strategy and is more involved due to new difficulties arising with the heat kernel. We also prove the existence of a density for the supremum of $u$ and that it belongs in $D_{1,2}$.</description>

Although we do not prove the presence of infinite cycles, our infinite volume model is naturally a distribution over configurations of finite loops and interlacements. We prove the limiting process to be solution of DLR equations. We will work within the framework of Dirichlet and periodic boundary conditions, for any inverse temperature $\beta$ &gt; 0, chemical potential $\mu$ $\in$ R and dimension d$\ge$1.</description>

      <title>Kinetic interacting particle system: parameter estimation from complete and partial discrete observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the estimation of drift and diffusion coefficients in a two dimensional system of N interacting particles modeled by a degenerate stochastic differential equation. We consider both complete and partial observation cases over a fixed time horizon [0, T] and propose novel contrast functions for parameter estimation. In the partial observation scenario, we tackle the challenge posed by unobserved velocities by introducing a surrogate process based on the increments of the observed positions. This requires a modified contrast function to account for the correlation between successive increments. Our analysis demonstrates that, despite the loss of Markovianity due to the velocity approximation in the partial observation case, the estimators converge to a Gaussian distribution (with a correction factor in the partial observation case). The proofs are based on Ito like bounds and an adaptation of the Euler scheme. Additionally, we provide insights into H\"ormander's condition, which helps establish hypoellipticity in our model within the framework of stochastic calculus of variations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning states that a hypothesis space is PAC learnable if and only if its VC dimension is finite. For the agnostic model of PAC learning, the literature so far presents proofs of this theorem that often tacitly impose several measurability assumptions on the involved sets and functions. We scrutinize these proofs from a measure-theoretic perspective in order to extract the assumptions needed for a rigorous argument. This leads to a sound statement as well as a detailed and self-contained proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning in the agnostic setting, showcasing the minimal measurability requirements needed. We then discuss applications in Model Theory, considering NIP and o-minimal structures. Our main theorem presents sufficient conditions for the PAC learnability of hypothesis spaces defined over o-minimal expansions of the reals.</description>

      <title>Convergence properties of Markov models for image generation with applications to spin-flip dynamics and to diffusion processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of Markov models for image generation, the main idea is to learn how non-trivial images are gradually destroyed by a trivial forward Markov dynamics over the large time window $[0,t]$ converging towards pure noise for $t \to + \infty$, and to implement the non-trivial backward time-dependent Markov dynamics over the same time window $[0,t]$ starting from pure noise at $t$ in order to generate new images at time $0$. The goal of the present paper is to analyze the convergence properties of this reconstructive backward dynamics as a function of the time $t$ using the spectral properties of the trivial continuous-time forward dynamics for the $N$ pixels $n=1,..,N$. The general framework is applied to two cases : (i) when each pixel $n$ has only two states $S_n=\pm 1$ with Markov jumps between them; (ii) when each pixel $n$ is characterized by a continuous variable $x_n$ that diffuses on an interval $]x_-,x_+[$ that can be either finite or infinite.</description>

      <title>Non-convergence to global minimizers in data driven supervised deep learning: Adam and stochastic gradient descent optimization provably fail to converge to global minimizers in the training of deep neural networks with ReLU activation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning methods - consisting of a class of deep neural networks (DNNs) trained by a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization method - are nowadays key tools to solve data driven supervised learning problems. Despite the great success of SGD methods in the training of DNNs, it remains a fundamental open problem of research to explain the success and the limitations of such methods in rigorous theoretical terms. In particular, even in the standard setup of data driven supervised learning problems, it remained an open research problem to prove (or disprove) that SGD methods converge in the training of DNNs with the popular rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function with high probability to global minimizers in the optimization landscape. In this work we answer this question negatively. Specifically, in this work we prove for a large class of SGD methods that the considered optimizer does with high probability not converge to global minimizers of the optimization problem. It turns out that the probability to not converge to a global minimizer converges at least exponentially quickly to one as the width of the first hidden layer of the ANN and the depth of the ANN, respectively, increase. The general non-convergence results of this work do not only apply to the plain vanilla standard SGD method but also to a large class of accelerated and adaptive SGD methods such as the momentum SGD, the Nesterov accelerated SGD, the Adagrad, the RMSProp, the Adam, the Adamax, the AMSGrad, and the Nadam optimizers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.04462v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper builds upon the research of Corwin and Knizel who proved the existence of stationary measures for the KPZ equation on an interval and characterized them through a Laplace transform formula. Bryc, Kuznetsov, Wang and Wesolowski found a probabilistic description of the stationary measures in terms of a Doob transform of some Markov kernels; essentially at the same time, another description connecting the stationary measures to the exponential functionals of the Brownian motion appeared in work of Barraquand and Le Doussal.
  Our first main result clarifies and proves the equivalence of the two probabilistic description of these stationary measures. We then use the Markovian description to give rigorous proofs of some of the results claimed in Barraquand and Le Doussal. We analyze how the stationary measures of the KPZ equation on finite interval behave at large scale. We investigate which of the limits of the steady states of the KPZ equation obtained recently by G. Barraquand and P. Le Doussal can be represented by Markov processes in spatial variable under an additional restriction on the range of parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.03243v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the bicausal optimal transport problem between the laws of scalar time-homogeneous stochastic differential equations, and we establish the optimality of the synchronous coupling between these laws. The proof of this result is based on time-discretisation and reveals a novel connection between the synchronous coupling and the celebrated discrete-time Knothe--Rosenblatt rearrangement. We also prove a result on equality of topologies restricted to a certain subset of laws of continuous-time processes. We complement our main results with examples showing how the optimal coupling may change in path-dependent and multidimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Concentration of Equilibria and Relative Instability in Disordered Non-Relaxational Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a system of random autonomous ODEs introduced by Cugliandolo et al. [22], which serves as a non-relaxational analog of the gradient flow for the spherical p-spin model. The asymptotics for the expected number of equilibria in this model was recently computed by Fyodorov [32] in the high-dimensional limit, followed a similar computation for the expected number of stable equilibria by Garcia [38]. We show that for $p &gt; 9$ the number of equilibria, as well as the number of stable equilibria, concentrate around their respective averages, generalizing recent results of Subag and Zeitouni [61, 64] in the relaxational case. In particular, we confirm that this model undergoes a transition from relative to absolute instability, in the sense of Ben Arous, Fyodorov, and Khoruzhenko [11].</description>

Abstract: Let $d \geq 2$, $\alpha \in (0,2)$, and $X$ be the rectilinear $\alpha$-stable process on $\mathbb{R}^d$. We first present a geometric characterization of an open subset $D\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ so that the part process $X^D$ of $X$ in $D$ is irreducible. We then study the properties of the transition density functions of $X^D$, including the strict positivity property as well as their sharp two-sided bounds in $C^{1,1}$ domains in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Our bounds are shown to be sharp for a class of $C^{1,1}$ domains.</description>

      <title>Decay of correlations in the monomer-dimer model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the monomer-dimer model, whose realisations are spanning sub-graphs of a given graph such that every vertex has degree zero or one. The measure depends on a parameter, the monomer activity, which rewards the total number of monomers. We consider general correlation functions including monomer-monomer correlations and dimer-dimer covariances. We show that these correlations decay exponentially fast with the distance if the monomer activity is strictly positive. Our result improves a previous upper bound from van den Berg and is of interest due to its relation to transverse spin-spin correlations in classical spin systems. Our proof is based on the cluster expansion technique.</description>

Abstract: Caputo, Ligget, and Richthammer proved Aldous' spectral gap conjecture, which asserts that the spectral gaps of a random walk and an interchange process on the common weighted graph are equal. In this paper, we will prove an analogue of Aldous' spectral gap conjecture for generalized exclusion processes, which explicitly describes the spectral gap of a generalized exclusion process by the spectral gap of a random walk.</description>

      <title>Markov chain entropy games and the geometry of their Nash equilibria</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the following two-person mixed strategy game of a probabilist against Nature with respect to the parameters $(f, \mathcal{B},\pi)$, where $f$ is a convex function satisfying certain regularity conditions, $\mathcal{B}$ is either the set $\{L_i\}_{i=1}^n$ or its convex hull with each $L_i$ being a Markov infinitesimal generator on a finite state space $\mathcal{X}$ and $\pi$ is a given positive discrete distribution on $\mathcal{X}$. The probabilist chooses a prior measure $\mu$ within the set of probability measures on $\mathcal{B}$ denoted by $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{B})$ and picks a $L \in \mathcal{B}$ at random according to $\mu$, whereas Nature follows a pure strategy to select $M \in \mathcal{L}(\pi)$, the set of $\pi$-reversible Markov generators on $\mathcal{X}$. Nature pays an amount $D_f(M||L)$, the $f$-divergence from $L$ to $M$, to the probabilist. We prove that a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium always exists, and establish a minimax result on the expected payoff of the game. This also contrasts with the pure strategy version of the game where we show a Nash equilibrium may not exist. To find approximately a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we propose and develop a simple projected subgradient algorithm that provably converges with a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{t})$, where $t$ is the number of iterations. In addition, we elucidate the relationships of Nash equilibrium with other seemingly disparate notions such as weighted information centroid, Chebyshev center and Bayes risk. This article generalizes the two-person game of a statistician against Nature developed in the literature, and highlights the powerful interplay and synergy between modern Markov chains theory and geometry, information theory, game theory, optimization and mathematical statistics.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Dean--Kawasaki equation does not admit nontrivial solutions in the space of tempered measures. More specifically, we consider martingale solutions taking values, and with initial conditions, in the subspace of measures admitting infinite mass and satisfying some integrability conditions. Following work by the first author, Lehmann and von Renesse [arXiv:1806.05018], we show that the equation only admits solutions if the initial measure is a discrete measure. Our result extends the previously mentioned works by allowing measures with infinite mass.</description>

      <title>Pinning, diffusive fluctuations, and Gaussian limits for half-space directed polymer models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11439v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Half-space directed polymers in random environments are models of interface growth in the presence of an attractive hard wall. They arise naturally in the study of wetting and entropic repulsion phenomena. In 1985, Kardar predicted a "depinning" phase transition as the attractive force of the wall is weakened. This phase transition has been rigorously established for integrable models of half-space last passage percolation, i.e. half-space directed polymers at zero temperature, in a line of study tracing back to work of Baik--Rains. On the other hand, for integrable positive temperature models, the first rigorous proof of this phase transition has only been obtained very recently through a series of works of Barraquand--Wang, Imamura--Mucciconi--Sasamoto [IMS], Barraquand--Corwin--Das, and Das--Zhu [DZ] on the half-space log-Gamma polymer. In this paper we study a broad class of half-space directed polymer models with minimal assumptions on the random environment. We prove that an attractive force on the wall strong enough to macroscopically increase the free energy induces phenomena characteristic of the subcritical "bound phase," namely the pinning of the polymer to the wall and the diffusive fluctuations and limiting Gaussianity of the free energy. Our arguments are geometric in nature and allow us to analyze the positive temperature and zero temperature models simultaneously. Moreover, given the macroscopic free energy increase proven in [IMS] for the half-space log-Gamma polymer, our arguments can be used to reprove the results of [IMS, DZ] on polymer geometry and free energy fluctuations in the bound phase.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the Adapted Smoothed Empirical Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The adapted Wasserstein distance controls the calibration errors of optimal values in various stochastic optimization problems, pricing and hedging problems, optimal stopping problems, etc. However, statistical aspects of the adapted Wasserstein distance are bottlenecked by the failure of empirical measures to converge under this distance. Kernel smoothing and adapted projection have been introduced to construct converging substitutes of empirical measures, known respectively as smoothed empirical measures and adapted empirical measures. However, both approaches have limitations. Specifically, smoothed empirical measures lack comprehensive convergence results, whereas adapted empirical measures in practical applications lead to fewer distinct samples compared to standard empirical measures.
  In this work, we address both of the aforementioned issues. First, we develop comprehensive convergence results of smoothed empirical measures. We then introduce a smoothed version for adapted empirical measures, which provide as many distinct samples as desired. We refer them as adapted smoothed empirical measures and establish their convergence in mean, deviation, and almost sure convergence. The convergence estimation incorporates two results: the empirical analysis of the smoothed adapted Wasserstein distance and its bandwidth effects. Both results are novel and their proof techniques could be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random diffusions are a popular tool in Monte-Carlo estimations, with well established algorithms such as Walk-on-Spheres (WoS) going back several decades. In this work, we introduce diffusion estimators for the problems of angular synchronization and smoothing on graphs, in the presence of a rotation associated to each edge. Unlike classical WoS algorithms that are point-wise estimators, our diffusion estimators allow for global estimations by propagating along the branches of random spanning subgraphs called multi-type spanning forests. Building upon efficient samplers based on variants of Wilson's algorithm, we show that our estimators outperform standard numerical-linear-algebra solvers in challenging instances, depending on the topology and density of the graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study how relaxing the classical hydrostatic balance hypothesis affects theoretical aspects of the LU primitive equations well-posedness. We focus on models that sit between incompressible 3D LU Navier-Stokes equations and standard LU primitive equations, aiming for numerical manageability while capturing non-hydrostatic phenomena. Our main result concerns the well-posedness of a specific stochastic interpretation of the LU primitive equations. This holds with rigid-lid type boundary conditions, and when the horizontal component of noise is independent of z. In fact these conditions can be related to the dynamical regime in which the primitive equations remain valid. Moreover, under these conditions, we show that the LU primitive equations solution tends toward the one of the deterministic primitive equations for a vanishing noise, thus providing a physical coherence to the LU stochastic model.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a stochastic nonlinear formulation of classical coastal waves models under location uncertainty (LU). In the formal setting investigated here, stochastic versions of the Serre-Green- Nagdi, Boussinesq and classical shallow water wave models are obtained through an asymptotic expansion, which is similar to the one operated in the deterministic setting. However, modified advection terms emerge, together with advection noise terms. These terms are well-known features arising from the LU formalism, based on momentum conservation principle.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the two main symmetries for the one-dimensional generalised KPZ equation (gKPZ): the chain rule and the It\^o Isometry. We consider the equation in the full-subcritical regimes and use multi-indices that avoid an over-parametrization of the renormalised equation to compute the dimension of the two spaces associated with these two symmetries. Our proof is quite elementary and shows that multi-indices provide in this case a simplification in comparison to the results obtained via decorated trees. It also completes the program on the study of the chain rule initiated in arxiv:1902.02884 and continued in arxiv:2403.17066.</description>

Our analysis is based on the geometry of the Hopf and anti-de Sitter fibrations, and on the relationship between winding and area forms.</description>

      <title>Sinai factors of nonsingular systems: Bernoulli shifts and Anosov flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.14497v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a totally dissipative system has all nonsingular systems as factors, but that this is no longer true when the factor maps are required to be finitary. In particular, if a nonsingular Bernoulli shift satisfies the Doeblin condition, and has a limiting marginal distribution p, then it cannot have, as a finitary factor, an independent and identically distributed (iid) system of entropy larger than H(p); on the other hand, we show that iid systems with entropy strictly lower than H(p) can be obtained as finitary factors of these Bernoulli shifts, extending Keane and Smorodinsky's finitary version of Sinai's factor theorem to the nonsingular setting. As a consequence of our results we also obtain that every transitive twice continuously differentiable Anosov diffeomorphism on a compact manifold, endowed with volume measure, has iid factors, and if the factor is required to be finitary, then the iid factor cannot have Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy greater than the measure-theoretic entropy of a Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen measure associated with the Anosov diffeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Testing Independence of Infinite Dimensional Random Elements: A Sup-norm Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00375v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the test for independence of two random elements $X$ and $Y$ lying in an infinite dimensional space ${\cal{H}}$ (specifically, a real separable Hilbert space equipped with the inner product $\langle ., .\rangle_{\cal{H}}$). In the course of this study, a measure of association is proposed based on the sup-norm difference between the joint probability density function of the bivariate random vector $(\langle l_{1}, X \rangle_{\cal{H}}, \langle l_{2}, Y \rangle_{\cal{H}})$ and the product of marginal probability density functions of the random variables $\langle l_{1}, X \rangle_{\cal{H}}$ and $\langle l_{2}, Y \rangle_{\cal{H}}$, where $l_{1}\in{\cal{H}}$ and $l_{2}\in{\cal{H}}$ are two arbitrary elements. It is established that the proposed measure of association equals zero if and only if the random elements are independent. In order to carry out the test whether $X$ and $Y$ are independent or not, the sample version of the proposed measure of association is considered as the test statistic after appropriate normalization, and the asymptotic distributions of the test statistic under the null and the local alternatives are derived. The performance of the new test is investigated for simulated data sets and the practicability of the test is shown for three real data sets related to climatology, biological science and chemical science.</description>

      <title>Matrix denoising: Bayes-optimal estimators via low-degree polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the additive version of the matrix denoising problem, where a random symmetric matrix $S$ of size $n$ has to be inferred from the observation of $Y=S+Z$, with $Z$ an independent random matrix modeling a noise. For prior distributions of $S$ and $Z$ that are invariant under conjugation by orthogonal matrices we determine, using results from first and second order free probability theory, the Bayes-optimal (in terms of the mean square error) polynomial estimators of degree at most $D$, asymptotically in $n$, and show that as $D$ increases they converge towards the estimator introduced by Bun, Allez, Bouchaud and Potters in [IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 62, 7475 (2016)]. We conjecture that this optimality holds beyond strictly orthogonally invariant priors, and provide partial evidences of this universality phenomenon when $S$ is an arbitrary Wishart matrix and $Z$ is drawn from the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble, a case motivated by the related extensive rank matrix factorization problem.</description>

      <title>Spectral convergence of random regular graphs: Chebyshev polynomials, non-backtracking walks, and unitary-color extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a short proof of the weak convergence to the Kesten-McKay distribution for the normalized spectral measures of random $N$-lifts. This result is derived by generalizing a formula of Friedman involving Chebyshev polynomials and non-backtracking walks. We also extend a criterion of Sodin on the convergence of graph spectral measures to regular graphs of growing degree. As a result, we show that for a sequence of random $(q_n+1)$-regular graphs $G_n$ with $n$ vertices, if $q_n = n^{o(1)}$ and $q_n$ tends to infinity, the normalized spectral measure converges almost surely in $p$-Wasserstein distance to the semicircle distribution for any $p \in [1, \infty)$. This strengthens a result of Dumitriu and Pal. Many of the results are extended to unitary-colored regular graphs.</description>

      <title>GROD: Enhancing Generalization of Transformer with Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12915v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer networks excel in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) tasks. However, they face challenges in generalizing to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) datasets, that is, data whose distribution differs from that seen during training. The OOD detection aims to distinguish data that deviates from the expected distribution, while maintaining optimal performance on in-distribution (ID) data. This paper introduces a novel approach based on OOD detection, termed the Generate Rounded OOD Data (GROD) algorithm, which significantly bolsters the generalization performance of transformer networks across various tasks. GROD is motivated by our new OOD detection Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Theory for transformer. The transformer has learnability in terms of OOD detection that is, when the data is sufficient the outlier can be well represented. By penalizing the misclassification of OOD data within the loss function and generating synthetic outliers, GROD guarantees learnability and refines the decision boundaries between inlier and outlier. This strategy demonstrates robust adaptability and general applicability across different data types. Evaluated across diverse OOD detection tasks in NLP and CV, GROD achieves SOTA regardless of data format. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GROD-OOD-Detection-with-transformers-B70F.</description>

      <title>Derivation of normal forms for dispersive PDEs via arborification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a systematic derivation of normal forms for dispersive equations using decorated trees introduced in arXiv:2005.01649. The key tool is the arborification map which is a morphism from the Butcher-Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra to the Shuffle Hopf algebra. It originates from Ecalle's approach to dynamical systems with singularities. This natural map has been used in many applications ranging from algebra, numerical analysis and rough paths. This connection shows that Hopf algebras also appear naturally in the context of dispersive equations and provide insights into some crucial decomposition.</description>

      <title>New matrix perturbation bounds via contour expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix perturbation bounds (such as Weyl and Davis-Kahan) are frequently used in many branches of mathematics. Most of the classical results in this area are optimal, in the worst case analysis. However, in modern applications, both the ground and the nose matrices frequently have extra structural properties. For instance, it is often assumed that the ground matrix is essentially low rank, and the nose matrix is random or pseudo-random. We aim to rebuild a part of perturbation theory, adapting to these modern assumptions. We will do this using a contour expansion argument, which enables us to exploit the skewness among the leading eigenvectors of the ground and the noise matrix (which is significant when the two are uncorrelated) to our advantage. In the current paper, we focus on the perturbation of eigenspaces. This helps us to introduce the arguments in the cleanest way, avoiding the more technical consideration of the general case. In applications, this case is also one of the most useful. More general results appear in a subsequent paper. Our method has led to several improvements, which have direct applications in central problems. Among others, we derive a sharp result for perturbation of a low rank matrix with random perturbation, answering an open question in this area. Next, we derive new results concerning the spike model, an important model in statistics, bridging two different directions of current research. Finally, we use our results on the perturbation of eigenspaces to derive new results concerning eigenvalues of deterministic and random matrices. In particular, we obtain new results concerning the outliers in the deformed Wigner model and the least singular value of random matrices with non-zero mean.</description>

      <title>Transition of $\alpha$-mixing in Random Iterations with Applications in Queuing Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear time series models with exogenous regressors are essential in econometrics, queuing theory, and machine learning, though their statistical analysis remains incomplete. Key results, such as the law of large numbers and the functional central limit theorem, are known for weakly dependent variables. We demonstrate the transfer of mixing properties from the exogenous regressor to the response via coupling arguments. Additionally, we study Markov chains in random environments with drift and minorization conditions, even under non-stationary environments with favorable mixing properties, and apply this framework to single-server queuing models.</description>
