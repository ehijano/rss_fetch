      <title>Some new Betti numbers of ideals generated by n+1 generic forms in n variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very little is known on the Hilbert series of graded algebras $\mathbb C[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/(g_1,\ldots,g_r)$, $r&gt;n$, $g_i$ generic form of degree $e_i$, in general. One instance when the series is known, is for $n+1$ forms in $n$ variables, \cite{St}. Of course even less is known about Betti numbers. There are some general results on the Betti table by Pardue and Richert in \cite{Pa-Ri,Pa-Ri1}, and by Diem in \cite{Di}. Then there are results on Betti numbers in the case $n+1$ relations in $n$ variables, described below, by Migliore and Mir\`o-Roig in \cite{Mi-Mi}, and more partial results in the general case by the same authors in \cite{Mi-Mi1}. In this paper we consider the same case as in \cite{Mi-Mi}, $n+1$ forms in $n$ variables. Our results can be described as follows. We can determine all graded Betti numbers of $\mathbb C[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/(g_1,\ldots,g_{n+1})$, $g_i$ generic, at least if $\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}\deg(g_i)-n$ is even, often in more cases. Thus, given {\em any} set $\{ e_1,\ldots,e_n\}$, $e_i\ge2$ for all $i$, such that $\deg(g_i)=e_i$, $i=1,\ldots,n$, we get many numbers $D_j$, so that we can determine all graded Betti numbers of $\mathbb C[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/(g_1,\ldots,g_{n+1})$, $\deg(g_i)=e_i$, $1\le i\le n$, $\deg(g_{n+1})=D_j$. The main ingredients of the proof is a theorem by Pardue and Richert, \cite{Pa-Ri,Pa-Ri1}, and later by Diem,\cite{Di}, and a new short proof of a theorem on Hilbert series of artinian complete intersections by Reid, Roberts, and Roitman, \cite{R-R-R}. We also give examples of algebras with many so called "ghost terms" in the minimal resolution.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity $=$ Volume formula and Newton non-degenerate ideals in regular local rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the notions of Newton non-degenerate (NND) ideals and Newton polyhedra for regular local rings. These concepts were first defined in the context of complex analysis. We show that the characterization of NND ideals via their integral closures known in the analytical setting extends to regular local rings. We use the limiting body $\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{I})$ associated to a graded family $\mathcal{I}$ of ideals to provide a new understanding of the celebrated "Multiplicity $=$ Volume" formula. Particularly, we prove that, for a Noetherian graded family $\mathcal{I}$ of $\mathfrak{m}$-primary ideals in a regular local ring $(R,\mathfrak{m})$ of dimension $d$, the equality $$e(\mathcal{I}) = d!\text{co-vol}_d(\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{I}))$$ holds if and only if $\mathcal{I}$ contains certain subfamily of NND ideals.</description>

      <title>Mutation and the Gabriel spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mutations occur in multiple algebraic contexts, often enjoying good combinatorial properties. In this paper we study mutations of pure-injective cosilting objects in compactly generated triangulated categories from a topological point of view. We consider the topologies studied by Gabriel, Burke and Prest on the set of indecomposable injective objects in a Grothendieck abelian category, transfer them to associated cosilting subcategories, and show that, in that context, right mutation induces a homeomorphism on two complementary subspaces. We then improve this result in the context of the derived category of a commutative noetherian ring, showing that right mutation is an open bijection. We end the paper with a detailed analysis of a range of cosilting subcategories over commutative noetherian rings for which the topology is completely known. As a byproduct of this analysis, we obtain that the category of modules over a commutative noetherian ring is the unique locally noetherian Grothendieck category in its derived-equivalence class.</description>

      <title>Uniform bounds in excellent $\mathbf{F}_p$-algebras and applications to semi-continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two important numerical invariants, Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity and $F$-signature, on the spectrum of a Noetherian $\mathbf{F}_p$-algebra $R$ that is not necessarily $F$-finite. When $R$ is excellent, we show that the limits defining the invariants are uniform. As a consequence, we show that the $F$-signature is lower semi-continuous, and the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity is upper semi-continuous provided $R$ is locally equidimensional. Uniform convergence is achieved via a uniform version of Cohen-Gabber theorem. We prove the results under weaker conditions than excellence.</description>

      <title>Simplicial complexes and matroids with vanishing $T^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate quotients by radical monomial ideals for which $T^2$, the second cotangent cohomology module, vanishes. The dimension of the graded components of $T^2$, and thus their vanishing, depends only on the combinatorics of the corresponding simplicial complex. We give both a complete characterization and a full list of one dimensional complexes with $T^2=0$. We characterize the graded components of $T^2$ when the simplicial complex is a uniform matroid. Finally, we show that $T^2$ vanishes for all matroids of corank at most two and conjecture that all connected matroids with vanishing $T^2$ are of corank at most two.</description>

      <title>If Terao's conjecture fails in $\mathbb{P}^{2}$, then it fails in $\mathbb{P}^{n &gt; 2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using an elementary technique, we construct a first example of Ziegler pairs of hyperplane arrangements in $\mathbb{P}^{3}$. Then, using this construction, we show how to obtain possible counterexamples to Terao's freeness conjecture in $\mathbb{P}^{n}$ with $n&gt;2$ using arrangements of lines in $\mathbb{P}^{2}$.</description>
