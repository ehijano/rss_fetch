      <title>Dynamics of Gender Bias within Computer Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new dataset (N = 7,456) analyzes women's research authorship in the Association for Computing Machinery's founding 13 Special Interest Groups or SIGs, a proxy for computer science. ACM SIGs expanded during 1970-2000; each experienced increasing women's authorship. But diversity abounds. Several SIGs had fewer than 10% women authors while SIGUCCS (university computing centers) exceeded 40%. Three SIGs experienced accelerating growth in women's authorship; most, including a composite ACM, had decelerating growth. This research may encourage reform efforts, often focusing on general education or workforce factors (across the entity of "computer science"), to examine under-studied dynamics within computer science that shaped changes in women's participation.</description>

      <title>Leveraging GPT for the Generation of Multi-Platform Social Media Datasets for Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media datasets are essential for research on disinformation, influence operations, social sensing, hate speech detection, cyberbullying, and other significant topics. However, access to these datasets is often restricted due to costs and platform regulations. As such, acquiring datasets that span multiple platforms which are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the digital ecosystem is particularly challenging. This paper explores the potential of large language models to create lexically and semantically relevant social media datasets across multiple platforms, aiming to match the quality of real datasets. We employ ChatGPT to generate synthetic data from two real datasets, each consisting of posts from three different social media platforms. We assess the lexical and semantic properties of the synthetic data and compare them with those of the real data. Our empirical findings suggest that using large language models to generate synthetic multi-platform social media data is promising. However, further enhancements are necessary to improve the fidelity of the outputs.</description>

      <title>Authenticity and exclusion: social media recommendation algorithms and the dynamics of belonging in professional networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homophily - the attraction of similarity - profoundly influences social interactions, affecting associations, information disclosure, and the dynamics of social exchanges. Organizational studies reveal that when professional and personal boundaries overlap, individuals from minority backgrounds often encounter a dilemma between authenticity and inclusion due to these homophily-driven dynamics: if they disclose their genuine interests, they risk exclusion from the broader conversation. Conversely, to gain inclusion, they might feel pressured to assimilate. How might the nature and design of social media platforms, where different conversational contexts frequently collapse, and the recommender algorithms that are at the heart of these platforms, which can prioritize content based on network structure and historical user engagement, impact these dynamics? In this paper, we employ agent-based simulations to investigate this question. Our findings indicate a decline in the visibility of professional content generated by minority groups, a trend that is exacerbated over time by recommendation algorithms. Within these minority communities, users who closely resemble the majority group tend to receive greater visibility. We examine the philosophical and design implications of our results, discussing their relevance to questions of informational justice, inclusion, and the epistemic benefits of diversity.</description>

      <title>Automatic Generation of Web Censorship Probe Lists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain probe lists--used to determine which URLs to probe for Web censorship--play a critical role in Internet censorship measurement studies. Indeed, the size and accuracy of the domain probe list limits the set of censored pages that can be detected; inaccurate lists can lead to an incomplete view of the censorship landscape or biased results. Previous efforts to generate domain probe lists have been mostly manual or crowdsourced. This approach is time-consuming, prone to errors, and does not scale well to the ever-changing censorship landscape.
  In this paper, we explore methods for automatically generating probe lists that are both comprehensive and up-to-date for Web censorship measurement. We start from an initial set of 139,957 unique URLs from various existing test lists consisting of pages from a variety of languages to generate new candidate pages. By analyzing content from these URLs (i.e., performing topic and keyword extraction), expanding these topics, and using them as a feed to search engines, our method produces 119,255 new URLs across 35,147 domains. We then test the new candidate pages by attempting to access each URL from servers in eleven different global locations over a span of four months to check for their connectivity and potential signs of censorship. Our measurements reveal that our method discovered over 1,400 domains--not present in the original dataset--we suspect to be blocked. In short, automatically updating probe lists is possible, and can help further automate censorship measurements at scale.</description>

      <title>Position: Measure Dataset Diversity, Don't Just Claim It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) datasets, often perceived as neutral, inherently encapsulate abstract and disputed social constructs. Dataset curators frequently employ value-laden terms such as diversity, bias, and quality to characterize datasets. Despite their prevalence, these terms lack clear definitions and validation. Our research explores the implications of this issue by analyzing "diversity" across 135 image and text datasets. Drawing from social sciences, we apply principles from measurement theory to identify considerations and offer recommendations for conceptualizing, operationalizing, and evaluating diversity in datasets. Our findings have broader implications for ML research, advocating for a more nuanced and precise approach to handling value-laden properties in dataset construction.</description>

      <title>Vox Populi, Vox AI? Using Language Models to Estimate German Public Opinion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent development of large language models (LLMs) has spurred discussions about whether LLM-generated "synthetic samples" could complement or replace traditional surveys, considering their training data potentially reflects attitudes and behaviors prevalent in the population. A number of mostly US-based studies have prompted LLMs to mimic survey respondents, with some of them finding that the responses closely match the survey data. However, several contextual factors related to the relationship between the respective target population and LLM training data might affect the generalizability of such findings. In this study, we investigate the extent to which LLMs can estimate public opinion in Germany, using the example of vote choice. We generate a synthetic sample of personas matching the individual characteristics of the 2017 German Longitudinal Election Study respondents. We ask the LLM GPT-3.5 to predict each respondent's vote choice and compare these predictions to the survey-based estimates on the aggregate and subgroup levels. We find that GPT-3.5 does not predict citizens' vote choice accurately, exhibiting a bias towards the Green and Left parties. While the LLM captures the tendencies of "typical" voter subgroups, such as partisans, it misses the multifaceted factors swaying individual voter choices. By examining the LLM-based prediction of voting behavior in a new context, our study contributes to the growing body of research about the conditions under which LLMs can be leveraged for studying public opinion. The findings point to disparities in opinion representation in LLMs and underscore the limitations in applying them for public opinion estimation.</description>

      <title>Operationalizing the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights: Recommendations for Practitioners, Researchers, and Policy Makers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools are increasingly employed in diverse real-world applications, there has been significant interest in regulating these tools. To this end, several regulatory frameworks have been introduced by different countries worldwide. For example, the European Union recently passed the AI Act, the White House issued an Executive Order on safe, secure, and trustworthy AI, and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy issued the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights (AI BoR). Many of these frameworks emphasize the need for auditing and improving the trustworthiness of AI tools, underscoring the importance of safety, privacy, explainability, fairness, and human fallback options. Although these regulatory frameworks highlight the necessity of enforcement, practitioners often lack detailed guidance on implementing them. Furthermore, the extensive research on operationalizing each of these aspects is frequently buried in technical papers that are difficult for practitioners to parse. In this write-up, we address this shortcoming by providing an accessible overview of existing literature related to operationalizing regulatory principles. We provide easy-to-understand summaries of state-of-the-art literature and highlight various gaps that exist between regulatory guidelines and existing AI research, including the trade-offs that emerge during operationalization. We hope that this work not only serves as a starting point for practitioners interested in learning more about operationalizing the regulatory guidelines outlined in the Blueprint for an AI BoR but also provides researchers with a list of critical open problems and gaps between regulations and state-of-the-art AI research. Finally, we note that this is a working paper and we invite feedback in line with the purpose of this document as described in the introduction.</description>

      <title>Inside the Black Box: Detecting and Mitigating Algorithmic Bias across Racialized Groups in College Student-Success Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Colleges and universities are increasingly turning to algorithms that predict college-student success to inform various decisions, including those related to admissions, budgeting, and student-success interventions. Because predictive algorithms rely on historical data, they capture societal injustices, including racism. In this study, we examine how the accuracy of college student success predictions differs between racialized groups, signaling algorithmic bias. We also evaluate the utility of leading bias-mitigating techniques in addressing this bias. Using nationally representative data from the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 and various machine learning modeling approaches, we demonstrate how models incorporating commonly used features to predict college-student success are less accurate when predicting success for racially minoritized students. Common approaches to mitigating algorithmic bias are generally ineffective at eliminating disparities in prediction outcomes and accuracy between racialized groups.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap! Bridging Explainable Artificial Intelligence and Human Understanding with Luhmann's Functional Theory of Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03460v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past decade explainable artificial intelligence has evolved from a predominantly technical discipline into a field that is deeply intertwined with social sciences. Insights such as human preference for contrastive -- more precisely, counterfactual -- explanations have played a major role in this transition, inspiring and guiding the research in computer science. Other observations, while equally important, have nevertheless received much less consideration. The desire of human explainees to communicate with artificial intelligence explainers through a dialogue-like interaction has been mostly neglected by the community. This poses many challenges for the effectiveness and widespread adoption of such technologies as delivering a single explanation optimised according to some predefined objectives may fail to engender understanding in its recipients and satisfy their unique needs given the diversity of human knowledge and intention. Using insights elaborated by Niklas Luhmann and, more recently, Elena Esposito we apply social systems theory to highlight challenges in explainable artificial intelligence and offer a path forward, striving to reinvigorate the technical research in the direction of interactive and iterative explainers. Specifically, this paper demonstrates the potential of systems theoretical approaches to communication in elucidating and addressing the problems and limitations of human-centred explainable artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Potential Societal Biases of ChatGPT in Higher Education: A Scoping Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14381v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose:Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) models, such as ChatGPT, may inherit or amplify societal biases due to their training on extensive datasets. With the increasing usage of GAI by students, faculty, and staff in higher education institutions (HEIs), it is urgent to examine the ethical issues and potential biases associated with these technologies. Design/Approach/Methods:This scoping review aims to elucidate how biases related to GAI in HEIs have been researched and discussed in recent academic publications. We categorized the potential societal biases that GAI might cause in the field of higher education. Our review includes articles written in English, Chinese, and Japanese across four main databases, focusing on GAI usage in higher education and bias. Findings:Our findings reveal that while there is meaningful scholarly discussion around bias and discrimination concerning LLMs in the AI field, most articles addressing higher education approach the issue superficially. Few articles identify specific types of bias under different circumstances, and there is a notable lack of empirical research. Most papers in our review focus primarily on educational and research fields related to medicine and engineering, with some addressing English education. However, there is almost no discussion regarding the humanities and social sciences. Additionally, a significant portion of the current discourse is in English and primarily addresses English-speaking contexts. Originality/Value:To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to summarize the potential societal biases in higher education. This review highlights the need for more in-depth studies and empirical work to understand the specific biases that GAI might introduce or amplify in educational settings, guiding the development of more ethical AI applications in higher education.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Cross-sectoral Intersecting Discrepancies within Multiple Groups Using Latent Class Analysis Towards Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing interest in fair AI development is evident. The ''Leave No One Behind'' initiative urges us to address multiple and intersecting forms of inequality in accessing services, resources, and opportunities, emphasising the significance of fairness in AI. This is particularly relevant as an increasing number of AI tools are applied to decision-making processes, such as resource allocation and service scheme development, across various sectors such as health, energy, and housing. Therefore, exploring joint inequalities in these sectors is significant and valuable for thoroughly understanding overall inequality and unfairness. This research introduces an innovative approach to quantify cross-sectoral intersecting discrepancies among user-defined groups using latent class analysis. These discrepancies can be used to approximate inequality and provide valuable insights to fairness issues. We validate our approach using both proprietary and public datasets, including EVENS and Census 2021 (England &amp; Wales) datasets, to examine cross-sectoral intersecting discrepancies among different ethnic groups. We also verify the reliability of the quantified discrepancy by conducting a correlation analysis with a government public metric. Our findings reveal significant discrepancies between minority ethnic groups, highlighting the need for targeted interventions in real-world AI applications. Additionally, we demonstrate how the proposed approach can be used to provide insights into the fairness of machine learning.</description>

Abstract: This report documents the process that led to the NSF Workshop on "Sustainable Computing for Sustainability" held in April 2024 at NSF in Alexandria, VA, and reports on its findings. The workshop's primary goals were to (i) advance the development of research initiatives along the themes of both sustainable computing and computing for sustainability, while also (ii) helping develop and sustain the interdisciplinary teams those initiatives would need. The workshop's findings are in the form of recommendations grouped in three categories: General recommendations that cut across both themes of sustainable computing and computing for sustainability, and recommendations that are specific to sustainable computing and computing for sustainability, respectively.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Probabilistic Graph Neural Networks for Road-Level Traffic Accident Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05072v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traffic accidents present substantial challenges to human safety and socio-economic development in urban areas. Developing a reliable and responsible traffic accident prediction model is crucial to addressing growing public safety concerns and enhancing the safety of urban mobility systems. Traditional methods face limitations at fine spatiotemporal scales due to the sporadic nature of highrisk accidents and the predominance of non-accident characteristics. Furthermore, while most current models show promising occurrence prediction, they overlook the uncertainties arising from the inherent nature of accidents, and then fail to adequately map the hierarchical ranking of accident risk values for more precise insights. To address these issues, we introduce the Spatiotemporal Zero-Inflated Tweedie Graph Neural Network STZITDGNN -- the first uncertainty-aware probabilistic graph deep learning model in roadlevel traffic accident prediction for multisteps. This model integrates the interpretability of the statistical Tweedie family model and the expressive power of graph neural networks. Its decoder innovatively employs a compound Tweedie model,a Poisson distribution to model the frequency of accident occurrences and a Gamma distribution to assess injury severity, supplemented by a zeroinflated component to effectively identify exessive nonincident instances. Empirical tests using realworld traffic data from London, UK, demonstrate that the STZITDGNN surpasses other baseline models across multiple benchmarks and metrics, including accident risk value prediction, uncertainty minimisation, non-accident road identification and accident occurrence accuracy. Our study demonstrates that STZTIDGNN can effectively inform targeted road monitoring, thereby improving urban road safety strategies.</description>

      <title>Inference-Time Rule Eraser: Fair Recognition via Distilling and Removing Biased Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04814v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models often make predictions based on biased features such as gender, race, and other social attributes, posing significant fairness risks, especially in societal applications, such as hiring, banking, and criminal justice. Traditional approaches to addressing this issue involve retraining or fine-tuning neural networks with fairness-aware optimization objectives. However, these methods can be impractical due to significant computational resources, complex industrial tests, and the associated CO2 footprint. Additionally, regular users often fail to fine-tune models because they lack access to model parameters In this paper, we introduce the Inference-Time Rule Eraser (Eraser), a novel method designed to address fairness concerns by removing biased decision-making rules from deployed models during inference without altering model weights. We begin by establishing a theoretical foundation for modifying model outputs to eliminate biased rules through Bayesian analysis. Next, we present a specific implementation of Eraser that involves two stages: (1) distilling the biased rules from the deployed model into an additional patch model, and (2) removing these biased rules from the output of the deployed model during inference. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing its superior performance in addressing fairness concerns in AI systems.</description>

      <title>High-Precision, Fair University Course Scheduling During a Pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scheduling university courses is extra challenging when classroom capacities are reduced because of social distancing requirements that are implemented in response to a pandemic such as COVID-19. In this work, we propose an expanded taxonomy of course delivery modes, present an integer program, and develop a course scheduling algorithm to enable all course sections -- even the largest -- to have a significant classroom learning component during a pandemic. Our approach is fair by ensuring that a certain fraction of the instruction in every course section occurs in the classroom. Unlike previous studies, we do not allow rotating attendance and instead require simultaneous attendance in which all students in a section meet in 1-5 rooms at the same time but less often than in a normal semester. These mass meetings, which create opportunities for in-person midterm exams and group activities, are scheduled at high precision across all days of the semester rather than a single, repeating week. A fast heuristic algorithm makes the schedule in an hour. Results: We consider the 1834 in-person course sections, 172 classrooms, and 96 days in the fall 2022 semester at [UniversityXYZ]. If average classroom capacity is reduced by 75% due to a pandemic, our approach still allows at least 25% of the instruction in every section, and more than 49% of all instruction across the entire campus, to be in the classroom. Our method also produces excellent results for regular classroom assignment. Managerial implications: An algorithm based on the principles of fairness and simultaneous attendance can significantly improve university course schedules during a pandemic and in normal times. High-precision schedules that prepare a campus for various pandemic possibilities can be created with minimal administrative effort and activated at a moment's notice before or during a semester if an outbreak occurs.</description>
