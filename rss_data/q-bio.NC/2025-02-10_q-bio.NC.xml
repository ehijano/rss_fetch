      <title>From Bedside to Desktop: A Data Protocol for Normative Intracranial EEG and Abnormality Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Normative mapping is a framework used to map population-level features of health-related variables. It is widely used in neuroscience research, but the literature lacks established protocols in modalities that do not support healthy control measurements, such as intracranial EEG (icEEG). An icEEG normative map would allow researchers to learn about population-level brain activity and enable comparison of individual data against these norms to identify abnormalities. Currently, no standardised guide exists for transforming clinical data into a normative, regional icEEG map. Papers often cite different software and numerous articles to summarise the lengthy method, making it laborious for other researchers to understand or apply the process. Our protocol seeks to remedy this gap by providing a dataflow guide and key decision points that summarise existing methods. This protocol is used heavily in published works from our own lab (twelve peer-reviewed journal publications). Briefly, we take as input, icEEG recordings and neuroimaging data from people with epilepsy who are undergoing evaluation for resective surgery. As final outputs, we obtain a normative icEEG map, comprising signal properties localised to brain regions. Optionally, we can also process new subjects through the same pipeline and obtain their z-scores (or centiles) in each brain region, for abnormality detection and localisation. To date, a single, cohesive, dataflow pipeline for generating normative icEEG maps, along with abnormality mapping, has not been created. We envisage that this dataflow guide will not only increase understanding and application of normative mapping methods, but will also improve the consistency and quality of studies in the field.</description>

      <title>Dark Brain Energy: Toward an Integrative Model of Spontaneous Slow Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural oscillations facilitate the functioning of the human brain in spatial and temporal dimensions at various frequencies. These oscillations feature a universal frequency architecture that is governed by brain anatomy, ensuring frequency specificity remains invariant across different measurement techniques. Initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methodology constrained functional MRI (fMRI) investigations to a singular frequency range, thereby neglecting the frequency characteristics inherent in blood oxygen level-dependent oscillations. With advancements in MRI technology, it has become feasible to decode intricate brain activities via multi-band frequency analysis (MBFA). During the past decade, the utilization of MBFA in fMRI studies has surged, unveiling frequency-dependent characteristics of spontaneous slow oscillations (SSOs) believed to base dark energy in the brain. There remains a dearth of conclusive insights and hypotheses pertaining to the properties and functionalities of SSOs in distinct bands. We surveyed the SSO MBFA studies during the past 15 years to delineate the attributes of SSOs and enlighten their correlated functions. We further proposed a model to elucidate the hierarchical organization of multi-band SSOs by integrating their function, aimed at bridging theoretical gaps and guiding future MBFA research endeavors.</description>

      <title>Shifting Attention to You: Personalized Brain-Inspired AI Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of human and artificial intelligence represents a scientific opportunity to advance our understanding of information processing, as each system offers unique computational insights that can enhance and inform the other. The synthesis of human cognitive principles with artificial intelligence has the potential to produce more interpretable and functionally aligned computational models, while simultaneously providing a formal framework for investigating the neural mechanisms underlying perception, learning, and decision-making through systematic model comparisons and representational analyses. In this study, we introduce personalized brain-inspired modeling that integrates human behavioral embeddings and neural data to align with cognitive processes. We took a stepwise approach, fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model with large-scale behavioral decisions, group-level neural data, and finally, participant-level neural data within a broader framework that we have named CLIP-Human-Based Analysis (CLIP-HBA). We found that fine-tuning on behavioral data enhances its ability to predict human similarity judgments while indirectly aligning it with dynamic representations captured via MEG. To further gain mechanistic insights into the temporal evolution of cognitive processes, we introduced a model specifically fine-tuned on millisecond-level MEG neural dynamics (CLIP-HBA-MEG). This model resulted in enhanced temporal alignment with human neural processing while still showing improvement on behavioral alignment. Finally, we trained individualized models on participant-specific neural data, effectively capturing individualized neural dynamics and highlighting the potential for personalized AI systems. These personalized systems have far-reaching implications for the fields of medicine, cognitive research, human-computer interfaces, and AI development.</description>

      <title>In Praise of Stubbornness: The Case for Cognitive-Dissonance-Aware Knowledge Updates in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite remarkable capabilities, large language models (LLMs) struggle to continually update their knowledge without catastrophic forgetting. In contrast, humans effortlessly integrate new information, detect conflicts with existing beliefs, and selectively update their mental models. This paper introduces a cognitive-inspired investigation paradigm to study continual knowledge updating in LLMs. We implement two key components inspired by human cognition: (1) Dissonance and Familiarity Awareness, analyzing model behavior to classify information as novel, familiar, or dissonant; and (2) Targeted Network Updates, which track neural activity to identify frequently used (stubborn) and rarely used (plastic) neurons. Through carefully designed experiments in controlled settings, we uncover a number of empirical findings demonstrating the potential of this approach. First, dissonance detection is feasible using simple activation and gradient features, suggesting potential for cognitive-inspired training. Second, we find that non-dissonant updates largely preserve prior knowledge regardless of targeting strategy, revealing inherent robustness in LLM knowledge integration. Most critically, we discover that dissonant updates prove catastrophically destructive to the model's knowledge base, indiscriminately affecting even information unrelated to the current updates. This suggests fundamental limitations in how neural networks handle contradictions and motivates the need for new approaches to knowledge updating that better mirror human cognitive mechanisms.</description>

      <title>A Foundational Brain Dynamics Model via Stochastic Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a foundational model for brain dynamics that utilizes stochastic optimal control (SOC) and amortized inference. Our method features a continuous-discrete state space model (SSM) that can robustly handle the intricate and noisy nature of fMRI signals. To address computational limitations, we implement an approximation strategy grounded in the SOC framework. Additionally, we present a simulation-free latent dynamics approach that employs locally linear approximations, facilitating efficient and scalable inference. For effective representation learning, we derive an Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) from the SOC formulation, which integrates smoothly with recent advancements in self-supervised learning (SSL), thereby promoting robust and transferable representations. Pre-trained on extensive datasets such as the UKB, our model attains state-of-the-art results across a variety of downstream tasks, including demographic prediction, trait analysis, disease diagnosis, and prognosis. Moreover, evaluating on external datasets such as HCP-A, ABIDE, and ADHD200 further validates its superior abilities and resilience across different demographic and clinical distributions. Our foundational model provides a scalable and efficient approach for deciphering brain dynamics, opening up numerous applications in neuroscience.</description>

      <title>How the Stroop Effect Arises from Optimal Response Times in Laterally Connected Self-Organizing Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Stroop effect refers to cognitive interference in a color-naming task: When the color and the word do not match, the response is slower and more likely to be incorrect. The Stroop task is used to assess cognitive flexibility, selective attention, and executive function. This paper implements the Stroop task with self-organizing maps (SOMs): Target color and the competing word are inputs for the semantic and lexical maps, associative connections bring color information to the lexical map, and lateral connections combine their effects over time. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 84.2%, with significantly fewer errors and faster responses in congruent compared to no-input and incongruent conditions. The model's effect is a side effect of optimizing response times, and can thus be seen as a cost associated with overall efficient performance. The model can further serve studying neurologically-inspired cognitive control and related phenomena.</description>

      <title>People use fast, goal-directed simulation to reason about novel games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: People can evaluate features of problems and their potential solutions well before we can effectively solve them. When considering a game we have never played, for instance, we might infer whether it is likely to be challenging, fair, or fun simply from hearing the game rules, prior to deciding whether to invest time in learning the game or trying to play it well. Many studies of game play have focused on optimality and expertise, characterizing how people and computational models play based on moderate to extensive search and after playing a game dozens (if not thousands or millions) of times. Here, we study how people reason about a range of simple but novel Connect-N style board games. We ask people to judge how fair and how fun the games are from very little experience: just thinking about the game for a minute or so, before they have ever actually played with anyone else, and we propose a resource-limited model that captures their judgments using only a small number of partial game simulations and almost no look-ahead search.</description>
