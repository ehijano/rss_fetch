      <title>Recent developments in exponential functionals of L\'evy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This survey aims to review two decades of progress on exponential functionals of (possibly killed) real-valued L\'evy processes. Since the publication of the seminal survey by Bertoin and Yor, substantial advances have been made in understanding the structure and properties of these random variables. At the same time, numerous applications of these quantities have emerged across various different contexts of modern applied probability. Motivated by all this, in this manuscript, we provide a detailed overview of these developments, beginning with a discussion of the class of special functions that have played a central role in recent progress, and then organising the main results on exponential functionals into thematic groups. Moreover, we complement several of these results and set them within a unified framework. Throughout, we strive to offer a coherent historical account of each contribution, highlighting both the probabilistic and analytical techniques that have driven the advances in the field.</description>

      <title>The Busemann Process and Steep Highways in Directed First Passage Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Busemann process in planar directed first passage percolation. We extend existing techniques to establish the existence of the process in our setting and determine its distribution in a number of integrable models. As examples of their utility, we show how these explicit distributions may be used to quantify the semi-infinite geodesics passing through thin rectangles, and the clustering phenomenon observed in competition interface angles. There is a natural connection with various particle systems, and in particular we obtain the multi-class invariant distributions for discrete-time TASEP with parallel updates.</description>

      <title>Particle system approximation of Nash equilibria in large games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a probabilistic framework to approximate Nash equilibria in symmetric $N$-player games in the large population regime, via the analysis of associated mean field games (MFGs). The approximation is achieved through the analysis of a McKean-Vlasov type Langevin dynamics and their associated particle systems, with convergence to the MFG solution established in the limit of vanishing temperature parameter. Relying on displacement monotonicity or Lasry-Lions monotonicity of the cost function, we prove contractility of the McKean-Vlasov process and uniform-in-time propagation of chaos for the particle system. Our results contribute to the general theory of interacting diffusions by showing that monotonicity can ensure convergence without requiring small interaction assumptions or functional inequalities.</description>

      <title>Markov chains, AR linear models, and regular variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate multivariate regular variation in the context of time-homogeneous Markov chains on general vector spaces and in random coefficient linear models. In the first part, we show that the regular variation of the stationary distribution can be derived from that of the innovations, provided that the chain satisfies a certain monotonicity condition with respect to a gauge function.
  In the second part, we study random linear models with random coefficients defined by an explicit iterative scheme. We prove that the precise structure of the underlying chain affects the form of the associated spectral measure.</description>

      <title>Local limits of determinantal processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $H_n$ be the row space of a signed adjacency matrix of a $C_4$-free bipartite bi-regular graph in which one part has degree $d(n)\to\infty$ and the other part has degree $k+1$ where $k\geq 1$ is a fixed integer. We show that the local limit as $n\to \infty$ of the determinantal process corresponding to the orthogonal projection on $H_n$ is a variant of a Poisson$(k)$ branching process conditioned to survive.
  This setup covers a wide class of determinantal processes such as uniform spanning trees, Kalai's determinantal hypertrees, hyperforests in regular cell complexes, discrete Grassmanians, incidence matroids and more, as long as their degree tends to $\infty$.</description>

      <title>Quasi-compactness for dominated kernels with application to quasi-stationary distribution theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a domination principle for positive operators, yielding a upper bound on the essential spectral radius and a practical quasi-com\-pact\-ness criterion on weighted supremum spaces. We then apply these results to absorbed Markov processes and show that quasi-compactness of the transition kernel ensures existence and convergence to quasi-statio\-nary distributions in broadly reducible settings, without regularity requirements. In continuous time, we show that measurability plus quasi-com\-pact\-ness at a single time propagates to all times, rules out periodic behavior, and yields convergence to quasi-stationary distributions. Two illustrative cases demonstrate the scope and simplicity of the criteria.</description>

      <title>Homogenisation of singular SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an approach to study homogenisation of a large class of singular SPDEs of the form $$ \partial_t u_\varepsilon - \nabla\cdot {A}(x/\varepsilon,t/\varepsilon^2) \nabla u_\varepsilon = F(x/\varepsilon , t/\varepsilon^2, u_\varepsilon , \nabla u_\varepsilon , \xi ) $$ which is based on the idea of importing (classical) homogenisation results into the framework of regularity structures and the insight that one can rewrite the SPDE under consideration in terms of a model, where the correctors (from homogenisation theory) are seen as further `abstract noises'.
  As applications, we establish periodic space-time homogenisation results for oscillatory generalisations of the 2d g-PAM and $\Phi^4_3$ equation proving that when the noise is regularised at scale $\delta\ll 1$ solutions to the equation with coefficient field ${A}(x/\varepsilon,t/\varepsilon^2)$, when appropriately renormalised, converge to solutions to the corresponding homogenised equation along any sequence $(\varepsilon,\delta)\to 0$. We make the observation that the unbounded divergences can be written as sums of two types of terms: `small scale' terms, the spatial dependence of which is an explicit local function of the coefficient field and `large scale' terms, which for logarithmic divergences are explicit involving the homogenised matrix and correctors. Furthermore, in order to recover the same solution to the corresponding homogenised equation along any joint limit $(\varepsilon, \delta)\to 0$ one has to subtract additional bounded renormalisation constants which appear due to oscillations at mesoscopic scales, as well as due to resonances between the coefficient field and the oscillations in the nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Knuth's big-chooser matchbox process: the case of many matchboxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Banach's matchbox problem considers the setting of two matchboxes that each initially contain the same number of matches. Boxes are chosen with equal probability and a match removed each time. The problem concerns the law of the number of matches remaining in one box once the other box empties. Knuth considered a generalization of this problem whereby `big-choosers' arrive with probability $p$ and remove a match from the box with the most number remaining, and `little-choosers' arrive with probability $1-p$ and remove a match from the box with the least number remaining.
  In this paper we consider Knuth's generalization for the case of $k$ matchboxes. We determine the generating function for the expected number of matches remaining in $k-1$ matchboxes once a box first empties, a quantity we refer to as the `residue'. Interestingly, this generating function is a quotient whose denominator contains a generating function for a special case of the Raney numbers. The form for this generating function allows us to give an expression for the expected residue in terms of a sum that involves diagonal state return probabilities, where a diagonal state is a configuration in which all matchboxes each contain the same number of matches. We use analytic techniques to determine the asymptotic behaviour of this expected value for all values of $p$, which involves the study of an asymmetric random walk.
  We also consider the expected value of the order of the first return to a diagonal state and determine its asymptotic behaviour. The coefficients of the diagonal state probability generating function are shown to be related to `manila folder configurations in a filing cabinet', and we make this connection precise. This allows us to use known results for the enumeration of such manila folder configurations to give a closed form expression for the diagonal state return probabilities.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Conditional Entropy for Diffusion Dynamics on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modeling of diffusion processes on graphs is the basis for many network science and machine learning approaches. Entropic measures of network-based diffusion have recently been employed to investigate the reversibility of these processes and the diversity of the modeled systems. While results about their steady state are well-known, very few exact results about their time evolution exist. Here, we introduce the conditional entropy of heat diffusion in graphs. We demonstrate that this entropic measure satisfies the first and second laws of thermodynamics, thereby providing a physical interpretation of diffusion dynamics on networks. We outline a mathematical framework that contextualizes diffusion and conditional entropy within the theories of continuous-time Markov chains and information theory. Furthermore, we obtain explicit results for its evolution on complete, path, and circulant graphs, as well as a mean-field approximation for Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs. We also obtain asymptotic results for general networks. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate several properties of conditional entropy for diffusion over random graphs, such as the Watts-Strogatz model.</description>

      <title>The maximal hard-core model as a recoverable system: Gibbs measures and phase coexistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recoverable systems provide coarse models of data storage on the two-dimensional square lattice, where each site reconstructs its value from neighboring sites according to a specified local rule. To study the typical behavior of recoverable patterns, this work introduces an interaction potential on the local recovery regions of the lattice, which defines a corresponding interaction model. We establish uniqueness of the Gibbs measure at high temperature and derive bounds on the entropy in the zero- and low-temperature regimes.
  For the recovery rule under consideration, exactly recoverable configurations coincide with maximal independent sets of the grid. Relying on methods developed for the standard hard-core model, we show phase coexistence at high activity in the maximal case. Unlike the standard hard-core model, however, the maximal version admits nontrivial ground states even at low activity, and we manage to classify them explicitly. We further verify the Peierls condition for the associated contour model. Combined with the Pirogov-Sinai theory, this shows that each ground state gives rise to an extremal Gibbs measure, proving phase coexistence at low activity.</description>

Abstract: We prove large deviation principles for the distribution of the empirical measure of the eigenvalues of Lax matrices following the Generalized Gibbs ensembles of the classical Toda chain introduced in [10]. We deduce the almost sure convergence of this empirical measure towards a limit which we describe in terms of the limiting empirical measure of beta-ensembles. Our results apply to general smooth potentials.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a broad class of McKean-Vlasov stochastic variational inequalities (MVSVIs), where both the drift coefficient $b$ and the diffusion coefficient $\sigma$ depend on time $t$, the state $X_t$ and its distribution $\mu_t$. We establish the strong well-posedness, when $b$ is superlinear growth and locally Lipschitz continuous, and $\sigma$ is locally H\"older continuous, both with respect to $X_t$ and $\mu_t$. Additionally, we present the first propagation of chaos result for MVSVIs.</description>

      <title>On the uniqueness of the infinite cluster and the cluster density in the Poisson driven random connection model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17762v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a random connection model (RCM) on a general space driven by a Poisson process whose intensity measure is scaled by a parameter $t\ge 0$. We say that the infinite clusters are deletion stable if the removal of a Poisson point cannot split a cluster in two or more infinite clusters. We prove that this stability together with a natural irreducibility assumption implies uniqueness of the infinite cluster. Conversely, if the infinite cluster is unique then this stability property holds. Several criteria for irreducibility will be established. We also study the analytic properties of expectations of functions of clusters as a function of $t$. In particular we show that the position dependent cluster density is differentiable. A significant part of this paper is devoted to the important case of a stationary marked RCM (in Euclidean space), containing the Boolean model with general compact grains and the so-called weighted RCM as special cases. In this case we establish differentiability and a convexity property of the cluster density $\kappa(t)$. These properties are crucial for our proof of deletion stability of the infinite clusters but are also of interest in their own right. It then follows that an irreducible stationary marked RCM can have at most one infinite cluster. This extends and unifies several results in the literature.</description>

      <title>On cutoff via rigidity for high dimensional curved diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider overdamped Langevin diffusions in Euclidean space, with curvature equal to the spectral gap. This includes the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process as well as non Gaussian and non product extensions with convex interaction, such as the Dyson process from random matrix theory. We show that a cutoff phenomenon or abrupt convergence to equilibrium occurs in high-dimension, at a critical time equal to the logarithm of the dimension divided by twice the spectral gap. This cutoff holds for Wasserstein distance, total variation, relative entropy, and Fisher information. A key observation is a relation to a spectral rigidity, linked to the presence of a Gaussian factor. A novelty is the extensive usage of functional inequalities, even for short-time regularization, and the reduction to Wasserstein. The proofs are short and conceptual. Since the product condition is satisfied, an Lp cutoff hold for all p. We moreover discuss a natural extension to Riemannian manifolds, a link with logarithmic gradient estimates in short-time for the heat kernel, and ask about stability by perturbation. Finally, beyond rigidity but still for diffusions, a discussion around the recent progresses on the product condition for nonnegatively curved diffusions leads us to introduce a new curvature product condition.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for One-Dimensional Homogenized Diffusion Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two limit theorems, a mean ergodic and a central limit theorem, for a specific class of one-dimensional diffusion processes that depend on a small-scale parameter $\varepsilon$ and converge weakly to a homogenized diffusion process in the limit $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$. In these results, we allow for the time horizon to blow up such that $T_\varepsilon \rightarrow \infty$ as $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$. The novelty of the results arises from the circumstance that many quantities are unbounded for $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$, so that formerly established theory is not directly applicable here and a careful investigation of all relevant $\varepsilon$-dependent terms is required. As a mathematical application, we then use these limit theorems to prove asymptotic properties of a minimum distance estimator for parameters in a homogenized diffusion equation.</description>

      <title>On the Dimension-Free Concentration of Simple Tensors via Matrix Deviation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09333v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a simpler proof of a sharp concentration inequality for subgaussian simple tensors obtained recently by Al-Ghattas, Chen and Sanz-Alonso. Our approach uses a matrix deviation inequality for $\ell^p$ norms and a basic chaining argument.</description>

      <title>Coupling Theory, Optimal Transport, and Strassen's Theorem Beyond Regular Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many results in probability (most famously, Strassen's theorem on stochastic domination), characterize some relationship between probability distributions in terms of the existence of a particular structured coupling between them. Optimal transport, and in particular Kantorovich duality, provides a framework for formally unifying these results, but the standard duality theory requires topological conditions that are not satisfied in some settings. In this work, we investigate the extent to which Kantorovich duality still provides meaningful connections between distributional relations and their coupling counterparts, in the topologically irregular setting. Towards this end, we show that Strassen's theorem ``nearly holds'' for topologically irregular orders but that the full theorem admits counterexamples. The core of the proof is a novel technical result in optimal transport, which shows that the Kantorovich dual problem is well-behaved for optimal transport problems whose cost functions can be written as a non-increasing limit of lower semi-continuous functions.</description>

      <title>Pathwise Patching: A Geometric Construction of Quasi-Sure Solutions to G-SDEs and the Fundamental Role of the Path Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06054v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a rigorous geometric framework for constructing quasi-sure solutions to stochastic differential equations under model uncertainty. Departing from classical measure-specific approaches, we introduce a pathwise patching methodology that explicitly builds universal solutions directly on the path space.
  Our construction leverages the fundamental property of pathwise uniqueness in stochastic differential equations. We prove that when an SDE admits a unique strong solution under each probability measure in a family $\mathscr{P}$, and under appropriate average measure conditions on the family of measures, our method yields a universally measurable process that serves as the unique quasi-sure solution to the corresponding G-SDE.
  The key insight of our approach is that pathwise uniqueness ensures the compatibility of solutions across different probability measures, allowing them to be seamlessly patched together into a single canonical object. This work establishes that probability measures serve as filters that select plausible paths from an underlying path space reality, rather than defining the solution itself.
  The resulting framework provides enhanced conceptual clarity and mathematical rigor, offering a unified perspective on G-expectation theory and paving the way for robust computational methods in quantitative finance and stochastic control under model uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Asynchronous Federated Learning: A Delicate Trade-Off Between Model-Parameter Staleness and Update Frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08206v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synchronous federated learning (FL) scales poorly with the number of clients due to the straggler effect. Algorithms like FedAsync and GeneralizedFedAsync address this limitation by enabling asynchronous communication between clients and the central server. In this work, we rely on stochastic modeling and analysis to better understand the impact of design choices in asynchronous FL algorithms, such as the concurrency level and routing probabilities, and we leverage this knowledge to optimize loss. Compared to most existing studies, we account for the joint impact of heterogeneous and variable service speeds and heterogeneous datasets at the clients. We characterize in particular a fundamental trade-off for optimizing asynchronous FL: minimizing gradient estimation errors by avoiding model parameter staleness, while also speeding up the system by increasing the throughput of model updates. Our two main contributions can be summarized as follows. First, we prove a discrete variant of Little's law to derive a closed-form expression for relative delay, a metric that quantifies staleness. This allows us to efficiently minimize the average loss per model update, which has been the gold standard in literature to date, using the upper-bound of Leconte et al. as a proxy. Second, we observe that naively optimizing this metric drastically slows down the system by overemphasizing staleness at the expense of throughput. This motivates us to introduce an alternative metric that also accounts for speed, for which we derive a tractable upper-bound that can be minimized numerically. Extensive numerical results show these optimizations enhance accuracy by 10% to 30%.</description>

      <title>Smoothed Distance Kernels for MMDs and Applications in Wasserstein Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Negative distance kernels $K(x,y) := - \|x-y\|$ were used in the definition of maximum mean discrepancies (MMDs) in statistics and lead to favorable numerical results in various applications. In particular, so-called slicing techniques for handling high-dimensional kernel summations profit from the simple parameter-free structure of the distance kernel. However, due to its non-smoothness in $x=y$, most of the classical theoretical results, e.g. on Wasserstein gradient flows of the corresponding MMD functional do not longer hold true. In this paper, we propose a new kernel which keeps the favorable properties of the negative distance kernel as being conditionally positive definite of order one with a nearly linear increase towards infinity and a simple slicing structure, but is Lipschitz differentiable now. Our construction is based on a simple 1D smoothing procedure of the absolute value function followed by a Riemann-Liouville fractional integral transform. Numerical results demonstrate that the new kernel performs similarly well as the negative distance kernel in gradient descent methods, but now with theoretical guarantees.</description>
