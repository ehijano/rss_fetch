      <title>What is the amount of baryonic dark matter in galaxies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we re-evaluate the estimates of dust mass in galaxies and demonstrate that current dust models are incomplete and based on a priori assumptions. These models suffer from a circularity problem and account for only a small portion of dust, specifically submicron-sized grains. They overlook larger dust particles and other macroscopic bodies, despite observational evidence supporting their existence. This evidence includes the observed (sub)millimeter excess in dust emission spectra and the power-law size distribution with an index {\gamma} ~ 3.5-4.0, which has been measured for large particles and compact bodies across diverse environments. Examples of these large particles include large dust grains and meteoroids detected by satellites, near-Earth objects colliding with Earth, fragments in the Main Asteroid Belt and the Kuiper Belt, interstellar 'Oumuamua-like objects, and exoplanets. As a result, dust-type baryonic dark matter may be more abundant throughout the galaxy by one order of magnitude or even more than previously assumed, with a significant portion of its mass concentrated in large compact bodies. Additionally, black holes may contribute significantly to the total mass of baryonic dark matter. Consequently, current galaxy models do not provide reliable estimates of baryonic mass in galaxies. Clearly, a substantially larger amount of baryonic dark matter in galaxies would have major implications for theories of galaxy dynamics and evolution.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray Ionization of Low-Excitation Lines in Active Galactic Nuclei and Starburst Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) can significantly impact dense molecular clouds in galaxies, heating the interstellar medium (ISM) and altering its chemistry, ionization, and thermal properties. Their influence is particularly relevant in environments with high CR rates, such as starburst galaxies with supernova remnants or jets and outflows in active galactic nuclei (AGN). CRs transfer energy to the ionized phase of the ISM far from the ionization source, preventing gas cooling and driving large-scale winds. In this work, we use CLOUDY to explore the effect of CRs on nebular gas, a relatively underexplored area, mainly focused on cold molecular gas. Our models cover a broad range of density ($1 - 10^4\,\rm{cm^{-3}}$), ionization parameter ($-3.5 \leq \log U \leq -1.5$), and CR ionization rate ($10^{-16}\, \rm{s^{-1}} - 10^{-12}\, \rm{s^{-1}}$). These are compared to MUSE observations of two AGN, Centaurus A and NGC 1068, and the starburst NGC 253. We find that CR rates $\gtrsim 10^{-13}\, \rm{s^{-1}}$, typical of AGN and strong starburst galaxies, can significantly alter the thermal structure of the ionized gas by forming a deep secondary low-ionization layer beyond the photoionization-dominated region. This enhances emission from low-ionization transitions, such as [\ion{N}{ii}], [\ion{S}{ii}], and [\ion{O}{i}], affecting line-ratio diagnostics, metallicity, and ionization estimates. Unlike pure photoionization models, AGN simulations with high CR ionization rates reproduce the Seyfert loci in BPT diagrams without requiring super-solar metallicities for the narrow-line region. Additionally, star formation simulations with high CR ionization rates can explain line ratios in the LINER domain. We propose new maximum starburst boundaries for BPT diagrams to distinguish regions dominated by AGN photoionization from those that could be explained by star formation plus high CR ionization rates.</description>

      <title>New tools for studying planarity in galaxy satellite systems: Milky Way satellite planes are consistent with {\Lambda}CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new concept -- termed "planarity" -- which aims to quantify planar structure in galaxy satellite systems without recourse to the number or thickness of planes. We use positions and velocities from the Gaia EDR3 to measure planarity in Milky Way (MW) satellites and the extent to which planes within the MW system are kinematically supported. We show that the position vectors of the MW satellites exhibit strong planarity but the velocity vectors do not, and that kinematic coherence cannot, therefore, be confirmed from current observational data. We then apply our methodology to NewHorizon, a high-resolution cosmological simulation, to compare satellite planarity in MW-like galaxies in a {\Lambda}CDM-based model to that in the MW satellite data. We demonstrate that kinematically supported planes are common in the simulation and that the observed planarity of MW satellites is not in tension with the standard {\Lambda}CDM paradigm.</description>

      <title>Exploring IMF Sampling Effects on Star Formation and Metallicity in Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the impact of various Initial Mass Function (IMF) sampling methods on the star formation and metal enrichment histories of Ultra-Faint Dwarf (UFD) galaxy analogs. These analogs are characterized by $M_{\rm vir}\sim10^8 M_\odot$ and $M_{\ast}\lesssim10^5 M_\odot$ at $z=0$, utilizing high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations with a gas particle mass resolution of $\sim63 M_\odot$. Specifically, we evaluate three IMF sampling techniques: the burst model, stochastic IMF sampling, and individual IMF sampling. Our results demonstrate that the choice of IMF sampling method critically affects stellar feedback dynamics, particularly supernova (SN) feedback, thus impacting the star formation and metallicity characteristics of UFD analogs. We find that simulations with stochastic IMF sampling yield UFD analogs with 40\% to 70\% higher stellar masses than those using the burst model, due to a less immediate suppression of star formation by SNe. The individual IMF method results in even greater stellar masses, 8\% to 58\% more than stochastic runs, as stars form individually and continuously. Star formation is most continuous with individual sampling, followed by stochastic, and least with the burst model, which shows the longest quenching periods. Furthermore, the individual sampling approach achieves higher metallicity stars, aligning well with observed values, unlike the lower metallicities (about 1 dex less) found in the burst and stochastic methods. This difference is attributed to the continuous star formation in individual sampling, where gas metallicity shaped by previous SN events is immediately reflected in stellar metallicity. These findings emphasize the essential role of choosing appropriate IMF sampling methods for accurately modeling the star formation and chemical evolution of UFD galaxies.</description>

      <title>The MAGPI Survey: radial trends in star formation across different cosmological simulations in comparison with observations at $z \sim$ 0.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the internal and external mechanisms that regulate and quench star formation (SF) in galaxies at $z \sim 0.3$ using MAGPI observations and the EAGLE, Magneticum, and IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations. Using SimSpin to generate mock observations of simulated galaxies, we match detection/resolution limits in star formation rates and stellar mass, along with MAGPI observational details including the average point spread function and pixel scale. While we find a good agreement in the slope of the global star-forming main sequence (SFMS) between MAGPI observations and all three simulations, the slope of the resolved SFMS does not agree within 1 $-$ 2$\sigma$. Furthermore, in radial SF trends, good agreement between observations and simulations exists only for galaxies far below the SFMS, where we capture evidence for inside-out quenching. The simulations overall agree with each other between $\sim1.5-4 \ R_{\rm e}$ but show varying central suppression within $R \sim 1.5 \ R_{\rm e}$ for galaxies on and below the SFMS, attributable to different AGN feedback prescriptions. All three simulations show similar dependencies of SF radial trends with environment. Central galaxies are subject to both internal and external mechanisms, showing increased SF suppression in the centre with increasing halo mass, indicating AGN feedback. Satellite galaxies display increasing suppression in the outskirts as halo mass increases, indicative of environmental processes. These results demonstrate the power of spatially resolved studies of galaxies; while global properties align, radial profiles reveal discrepancies between observations and simulations and their underlying physics.</description>

      <title>A Novel Test for MOND: Gravitational Lensing by Disc Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disc galaxies represent a promising laboratory for the study of gravitational physics, including alternatives to dark matter, owing to the possibility of coupling rotation curves' dynamical data with strong gravitational lensing observations. In particular, Euclid, DES and LSST are predicted to observe hundreds of thousands of gravitational lenses. Here, we investigate disc galaxy strong gravitational lensing in the MOND framework. We employ the concept of equivalent Newtonian systems within the quasi-linear MOND formulation to make use of the standard lensing formalism. We derive the phantom dark matter distribution predicted for realistic disc galaxy models and study the impact of morphological and mass parameters on the expected lensing. We find purely MONDian effects dominate the lensing and generate non-trivial correlations between the lens parameters and the lensing cross section. Moreover, we show that the standard realisation of MOND predicts a number count of disc galaxy lenses of one order of magnitude higher than the dark matter-driven predictions, making it distinguishable from the latter in upcoming surveys. Finally, we show that disc galaxy gravitational lensing can be used to strongly constrain the interpolating function of MOND.</description>

      <title>A New Rarity Assessment of the `Disk of Satellites': the Milky Way System Is the Exception Rather than the Rule in the $\Lambda$CDM Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The majority of satellite galaxies around the Milky Way (MW) show disk-like distributions (the disk of satellites; DoS), which is a small-scale problem of the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. The conventional definition of the MW-like DoS is a satellite system with a minor-to-major axis ratio ($c$/$a$) lower than the MW's $c$/$a$ value of 0.181. Here we question the validity of the $c$/$a$-based DoS rarity assessment and propose an alternative approach. How satellites are placed around a galaxy is dictated mainly by two factors: the distributions of satellites' orbital poles and distances from the host. Based on this premise, we construct the `satellite distribution generator' code and generate 10$^5$ `spatially and kinematically analogous systems (SKASs)' sharing these two factors. The SKAS can disclose the intrinsic, underlying $c$/$a$ probability distribution function (PDF), from which a present-day $c$/$a$ value is fortuitously determined. We find that the $c$/$a$ PDF of the MW DoS defined by 11 classical satellites is quite broad ($\sigma_{c/a}$$\sim$0.105), implying that a simple present-day $c$/$a$ value, combined with its highly time-variable nature, cannot fully represent the degree of flatness. Moreover, based on the intrinsic $c$/$a$ PDF, we re-evaluate the rarity of the MW DoS by comparing it with IllustrisTNG50-1 host-satellite systems and find that even with the new measure, the MW DoS remains rare (0.00$\sim$3.40%). We show that the reason behind the rareness is that both orbital poles and distances of the 11 MW satellites are far more plane-friendly than those of simulated host-satellite systems, challenging the current structure and galaxy formation model.</description>

      <title>Rediscovering the Milky Way with orbit superposition approach and APOGEE data III. Panoramic view of the bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The innermost parts of the Milky Way (MW) are very difficult to observe due to the high extinction along the line of sight, especially close to the disc mid-plane. However, this region contains the most massive complex stellar component of the MW, the bulge, primarily composed of disc stars whose structure is (re-)shaped by the evolution of the bar. In this work, we extend the application of the orbit superposition method to explore the present-day 3D structure, orbital composition, chemical abundance trends and kinematics of the MW bulge. Thanks to our approach, we are able to transfer astrometry from Gaia and stellar parameters from APOGEE DR 17 to map the inner MW without obscuration by the survey footprint and selection function. We demonstrate that the MW bulge is made of two main populations originating from a metal-poor, high-{\alpha} thick disc and a metal-rich, low-{\alpha} thin disc, with a mass ratio of 4:3, seen as two major components in the MDF. Finer MDF structures hint at multiple sub-populations associated with different orbital families of the bulge, which, however, have broad MDFs themselves. Decomposition using 2D GMMs in [Fe/H] -[Mg/Fe] identifies five components including a population with ex-situ origin. Two dominant ones correspond to the thin and thick discs and two in between trace the transition between them. We show that no universal metallicity gradient value can characterise the MW bulge. The radial gradients closely trace the X-shaped bulge density structure, while the vertical gradient variations follow the boxy component. While having, on average, subsolar metallicity, the MW bulge populations are more metal-rich compared to the surrounding disc, in agreement with extragalactic observations and state-of-the-art simulations reinforcing its secular origin.</description>

      <title>The Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS). Black hole mass estimation using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detailed feeding and feedback mechanisms of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are not yet well known. For low-luminosity and obscured AGN, as well as late-type galaxies, determining the central black hole (BH) masses is challenging. Our goal with the GATOS sample is to study circum-nuclear regions and better estimate BH masses with more precision than scaling relations offer. Using ALMA's high spatial resolution, we resolve CO(3-2) emissions within ~100 pc around the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in seven GATOS galaxies to estimate their BH masses when sufficient gas is present. We study seven bright ($L_{AGN}(14-150\mathrm{keV}) \geq 10^{42}\mathrm{erg/s}$), nearby (&lt;28 Mpc) galaxies from the GATOS core sample. For comparison, we searched the literature for previous BH mass estimates and made additional calculations using the \mbh~ - $\sigma$ relation and the fundamental plane of BH activity. We developed a supervised machine learning method to estimate BH masses from position-velocity diagrams or first-moment maps using ALMA CO(3-2) observations. Numerical simulations with a wide range of parameters created the training, validation, and test sets. Seven galaxies provided enough gas for BH mass estimations: NGC4388, NGC5506, NGC5643, NGC6300, NGC7314, NGC7465, and NGC~7582. Our BH masses, ranging from 6.39 to 7.18 log$(M_{BH}/M_\odot)$, align with previous estimates. Additionally, our machine learning method provides robust error estimations with confidence intervals and offers greater potential than scaling relations. This work is a first step toward an automated \mbh estimation method using machine learning.</description>

      <title>Predicting HCN, HCO$^+$, multi-transition CO, and dust emission of star-forming galaxies -- Extension to luminous infrared galaxies and the role of cosmic ray ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The specific star-formation rate of star-forming `main sequence' galaxies significantly decreased since z~1.5, due to the decreasing molecular gas fraction and star formation efficiency. However, the radio-infrared (IR) correlation has not changed significantly since z~1.5. The theory of turbulent clumpy starforming gas disks together with the scaling relations of the interstellar medium describes the large and small-scale properties of galactic gas disks. Here we extend our previous work on infrared, multi-transition molecular line, and radio continuum emission of local and high-z starforming and starburst galaxies to local and z~0.5 luminous infrared galaxies. The model reproduces the IR luminosities, CO, HCN, and HCO+ line luminosities, and the CO spectral line energy distributions of these galaxies. We derive CO(1-0) and HCN(1-0) conversion factors for all galaxy samples. The relation between the star formation rate per unit area and H2 surface density cannot be fit simply for all redshifts. There is a tight correlation between the star formation efficiency and the product of the gas turbulent velocity dispersion and the angular velocity of the galaxies. Galaxies of lower stellar masses can in principle compensate their gas consumption via star formation by radial viscous gas accretion. The limiting stellar mass increases with redshift. Whereas the radio continuum emission is directly proportional to the density of cosmic ray (CR) electrons, the molecular line emission depends on the CR ionization rate via the gas chemistry. The normalization of the CR ionization rate found for the different galaxy samples is about a factor of three to five higher than the normalization for the Solar neighborhood. This means that the mean yield of low energy CR particles for a given star formation rate per unit area is about three to ten times higher in external galaxies than observed by Voyager I.</description>

      <title>Learning the Evolution of Physical Structure of Galaxies via Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In astrophysics, understanding the evolution of galaxies in primarily through imaging data is fundamental to comprehending the formation of the Universe. This paper introduces a novel approach to conditioning Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) on redshifts for generating galaxy images. We explore whether this advanced generative model can accurately capture the physical characteristics of galaxies based solely on their images and redshift measurements. Our findings demonstrate that this model not only produces visually realistic galaxy images but also encodes the underlying changes in physical properties with redshift that are the result of galaxy evolution. This approach marks a significant advancement in using generative models to enhance our scientific insight into cosmic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Central kpc of Andromeda. I. Dynamical modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Andromeda galaxy (M31) is the most nearby giant spiral galaxy, an opportunity to study with high resolution dynamical phenomena occurring in nuclear disks and bulges, able to explain star formation quenching, and galaxy evolution through collisions and tides. Multi-wavelength data have revealed in the central kpc of M31 strong dynamical perturbations, with an off-centered tilted disk and ring, coinciding with a dearth of atomic and molecular gas. Our goal to understand the origin of these perturbations is to propose a dynamical model, reproducing the global features of the observations. We are reporting about integral field spectroscopy of the ionized gas with H$\alpha$ and [NII] obtained with SITELLE, the optical imaging Fourier transform spectrometer (IFTS) at the Canada France Hawaii telescope (CFHT). Using the fully sampled velocity field of ionized gas, together with the more patchy molecular gas velocity field, previously obtained with the CO lines at IRAM-30m telescope, and the dust photometry, we identify three dynamical components in the gas, the main disk, a tilted ring and a nuclear warped disk. A mass model of the central kpc is computed, essentially from the stellar nuclear disk and bulge, with small contributions of the main stellar and gaseous disk, and dark matter halo. The kinematics of the ionized and molecular gas is then computed in this potential, and the velocity field confronted to observations. The best fit helps to determine the physical parameters of the three identified gas components, size, morphology and geometrical orientation. The results are compatible with a recent head-on collision with a M-32 like galaxy, as previously proposed. The kinematical observations correspond to a dynamical re-orientation of the perturbed nuclear disk, through warps and tearing disk into ring, following the collision.</description>

      <title>Searching for compact hierarchical triple systems candidates in astrometric binaries and accelerated solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact hierarchical triple (CHT) systems, where a tertiary component orbits an inner binary, provide critical insights into stellar formation and evolution. Despite their importance, the detection of such systems, especially compact ones, remains challenging due to the complexity of their orbital dynamics and the limitations of traditional observational methods. This study aims to identify new CHT star systems among Gaia astrometric binaries and accelerated solutions by analysing the radial velocity (RV) amplitude of these systems, thereby improving our understanding of stellar hierarchies. We selected a sample of bright astrometric binaries and accelerated solutions from the Gaia DR3 Non-Single Stars catalogue. The RV peak-to-peak amplitude was used as an estimator, and we applied a new method to detect potential triple systems by comparing the RV-based semi-amplitude with the astrometric semi-amplitude. We used available binary and triple star catalogues to identify and validate candidates, with a subset confirmed through further examination of the RV and astrometric data. Our analysis resulted in the discovery of 956 CHT candidates among the orbital sources as well as another 3,115 probable close binary sources in stars with accelerated solutions. Exploring the inclination, orbital period, and eccentricity of the outer companion in these CHT systems provides strong evidence of mutual orbit alignment, as well as a preference towards moderate outer eccentricities. Our novel approach has proven effective in identifying potential triple systems thereby increasing their number in the catalogues. Our findings emphasise the importance of combined astrometric and RV data analysis in the study of multiple star systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a brief review on the formation and evolution of hydrogen deficient central stars of planetary nebulae. We include a detailed description of the main observable features of both the central stars and their surrounding nebulae and review their main classifications. We also provide a brief description of the possible progenitor systems of hydrogen deficient central stars, as well as, of transients closely connected to the formation of these stars. In particular we offer a detailed theoretical explanation of the main evolutionary scenarios, both single and binary, devised to explain these stars and nebulae. Particular emphasis is made in the description of the so-called born again scenario, their quantitative predictions and uncertainties. Finally we discuss the pros and cons of both binary and single evolution channels, draw some conclusions and discuss open questions in the field.</description>

      <title>Heating the dark matter halo with dark radiation from supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supernova explosions are among the most extreme events in the Universe, making them a promising environment in which to search for the effects of light, weakly coupled new particles. As significant sources of energy, they are known to have an important effect on the dynamics of ordinary matter in their host galaxies but their potential impact on the dark matter (DM) halo remains less explored. In this work, we investigate the possibility that some fraction of the supernova energy is released via the form of dark radiation into the DM halo. Based on evaluation of energetics, we find that even a small fraction of the total SN energy is sufficient to change the overall shape of the DM halo and transform a cuspy halo into a cored one. This may help to explain the cores that are observed in some dwarf galaxies. Alternatively, one can interpret the upper limit on the size of a possible DM core as an upper limit on the energy that can go into light particles beyond the SM. These arguments are largely independent of a concrete model for the new physics. Nevertheless, it is important to ensure that the conditions we need, i.e.~significant supernova emissivity of dark radiation and the opacity of DM halo to the dark radiation, can be met in actual models. To demonstrate this, we study four simple benchmark models: the dark photon, dark Higgs, and gauged $B-L$ and $L_\mu - L_\tau$ models -- all provide light weakly coupled particles serving as the dark radiation. Assuming a sizable coupling of the dark radiation to DM, we find that all of the benchmark models have a significant part of the parameter space that meets the conditions. Interestingly, the couplings allowed by observations of SN1987A can have a significant effect on the halo of dwarf spheroidal galaxies.</description>

      <title>Using different sources of ground truths and transfer learning to improve the generalization of photometric redshift estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore methods to improve galaxy redshift predictions by combining different ground truths. Traditional machine learning models rely on training sets with known spectroscopic redshifts, which are precise but only represent a limited sample of galaxies. To make redshift models more generalizable to the broader galaxy population, we investigate transfer learning and directly combining ground truth redshifts derived from photometry and spectroscopy. We use the COSMOS2020 survey to create a dataset, TransferZ, which includes photometric redshift estimates derived from up to 35 imaging filters using template fitting. This dataset spans a wider range of galaxy types and colors compared to spectroscopic samples, though its redshift estimates are less accurate. We first train a base neural network on TransferZ and then refine it using transfer learning on a dataset of galaxies with more precise spectroscopic redshifts (GalaxiesML). In addition, we train a neural network on a combined dataset of TransferZ and GalaxiesML. Both methods reduce bias by $\sim$ 5x, RMS error by $\sim$ 1.5x, and catastrophic outlier rates by 1.3x on GalaxiesML, compared to a baseline trained only on TransferZ. However, we also find a reduction in performance for RMS and bias when evaluated on TransferZ data. Overall, our results demonstrate these approaches can meet cosmological requirements.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Detailed Study of the M31 Classical Nova AT 2023tkw: Evidence for Internal Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of a slow classical nova in M31 exhibiting multiple peaks in its light curve. Spectroscopic and photometric observations were used to investigate the underlying physical processes. Shock-induced heating events resulting in the expansion and contraction of the photosphere are likely responsible for the observed multiple peaks. Deviation of the observed spectrum at the peak from the models also suggests the presence of shocks. The successive peaks occurring at increasing intervals could be due to the series of internal shocks generated near or within the photosphere. Spectral modeling suggests a low-mass white dwarf accreting slowly from a companion star. The ejecta mass, estimated from spectral analysis, is $\sim 10^{-4}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, which is typical for a slow nova. We estimate the binary, by comparing the archival HST data and eruption properties with stellar and novae models, to comprise a 0.65 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ primary white dwarf and a K III cool giant secondary star.</description>

      <title>Frequency redistribution and step-size distribution of light scattered by atomic vapor: applications to L\'evy flight random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The propagation of light that undergoes multiple-scattering by resonant atomic vapor can be described as a L\'evy flight. L\'evy flight is a random walk with heavy tailed step-size (r) distribution, decaying asymptotically as $P(r)\sim r^{-1-\alpha}$, with $\alpha&lt;2$. The large steps, typical of L\'evy flights, have its origins in frequency redistribution of the light scattered by the vapor. We calculate the frequency redistribution function and the step-size distribution for light diffusion in atomic vapor. From the step-size distribution we extract a L\'evy parameter $\alpha$ that depends on the step's size. We investigate how the frequency redistribution function and step-size distribution are influenced by the finite size of the vapor and the many-level structure typical for alkali vapors. Finite size of the vapor introduces cutoff on the light scattered spectrum and thus in the size of steps. Multi-level structure introduces oscillations in $P(r)$ slope. Both effects might have an impact on measurables related to the L\'evy flight random walk.</description>

      <title>Gravitational atoms beyond the test field limit: The case of Sgr A* and ultralight dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct gravitational atoms including self-gravity, obtaining solutions of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations for a scalar field surrounding a non-rotating black hole in a quasi-stationary approximation. We resolve the region near the horizon as well as the far field region. Our results are relevant in a wide range of masses, from ultralight to MeV scalar fields and for black holes ranging from primordial to supermassive. For instance, a system with a scalar field consistent with ultralight dark matter and a black hole mass comparable to that of Sagittarius A* can be modeled. A density spike near the event horizon, although present, is negligible, contrasting with the prediction in [P. Gondolo and Silk, Phys. Rev. Lett., 83:1719-1722, 1999] for cold dark matter.</description>

      <title>Variability of hot sub-luminous stars and binaries: Machine learning analysis of Gaia DR3 multi-epoch photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hot sub-luminous stars represent a population of stripped and evolved red giants located at the Extreme Horizontal Branch (EHB). Since they exhibit a wide range of variability due to pulsations or binary interactions, unveiling their intrinsic and extrinsic variability is crucial for understanding the physical processes responsible for their formation. In the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, they overlap with interacting binaries such as Cataclysmic Variables (CVs). By leveraging cutting-edge clustering algorithm tools, we investigate the variability of 1,576 hot subdwarf variable candidates using comprehensive data from Gaia DR3 multi-epoch photometry and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observations. We present a novel approach that utilises the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) dimensionality reduction algorithms to facilitate the identification and classification of different populations of variable hot subdwarfs and Cataclysmic Variables in a large dataset. In addition to the Gaia time-series statistics table, we adopt extra statistical features that enhance the performance of the algorithms. The clustering results lead to the identification of 85 new hot subdwarf variables based on Gaia and TESS lightcurves and 108 new variables based on Gaia lightcurves alone, including reflection-effect systems, HW Vir, ellipsoidal variables, and high-amplitude pulsating variables. A significant number of known Cataclysmic Variables (140) distinctively cluster in the 2-D feature space among an additional 152 objects that we consider new Cataclysmic Variable candidates. This study paves the way for more efficient and comprehensive analyses of stellar variability from both ground and space-based observations, as well as the application of machine learning classifications of variable candidates in large surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) exhibit morphological similarities with other low-luminosity galaxies indicating a possible evolutionary connection. We investigate for common dynamical characteristics of isolated, HI-rich UDGs with other low luminosity field galaxies, namely the low surface brightness galaxies (LSBs) and the dwarf irregulars (dIrrs). From the galaxy scaling relation studies, we note that UDGs and LSBs constitute statistically different populations. However, for UDGs and dIrrs, the null hypotheses of these statistical tests cannot be rejected : stellar mass versus atomic hydrogen mass; stellar mass versus dynamical mass; and dark matter core density versus core radius mass scaling. Interestingly, the dynamical models suggest that UDGs, LSBs and dIrrs constitute different galaxy populations as reflected by their radial-to-vertical velocity dispersion, and the rotational velocity-to-total stellar velocity dispersion. Finally, we observe that the total HI and stellar mass mostly regulate the variance in the structural and kinematical data both for the UDGs and dIrrs, while the ratio of radial-to-vertical velocity dispersion, and the total HI mass dominate the same in LSBs. UDGs and LSBs represent statistically different galaxy populations with respect to their mass and structural properties. But the fact that their structural parameters follow the same distributions is not ruled out. However, UDGs, dIrrs and LSBs constitute very different populations as far as their kinematical parameters are concerned. Finally, we note that the variation in the structural and kinematical data of both the UDGs and the dIrrs is mostly accounted for by their stellar mass and HI mass, whereas for the LSBs, the same is explained by the ratio of the radial-to-vertical stellar dispersion followed by the HI mass. Thus we conclude that the UDGs and dIrrs to share common dynamical lineage.</description>

      <title>Eccentric Mergers in AGN Discs: Influence of the Supermassive Black-Hole on Three-body Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are indications that stellar-origin black holes (BHs) are efficiently paired up in binary black holes (BBHs) in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) disc environments, which can undergo interactions with single BHs in the disc. Such binary-single interactions can potentially lead to an exceptionally high fraction of gravitational-wave mergers with measurable eccentricity in LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. We here take the next important step in this line of studies, by performing post-Newtonian N-body simulations between migrating BBHs and single BHs set in an AGN disc-like configuration with a consistent inclusion of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the equations of motion. With this setup, we study how the fraction of eccentric mergers varies in terms of the initial size of the BBH semi-major axis relative to the Hill sphere, as well as how it depends on the angle between the BBH and the incoming single BH. We find that the fraction of eccentric mergers is still relatively large, even when the interactions are notably influenced by the gravitational field of the nearby SMBH. However, the fraction as a function of the BBH semi-major axis does not follow a smooth functional shape, but instead shows strongly varying features that originate from the underlying phase-space structure. The phase-space further reveals that many of the eccentric mergers are formed through prompt scatterings. Finally, we present the first analytical solution to how the presence of an SMBH in terms of its Hill sphere affects the probability for forming eccentric BBH mergers through chaotic three-body interactions.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Morphologies Revealed with Subaru HSC and Super-Resolution Techniques II: Environmental Dependence of Galaxy Mergers at z~2-5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We super-resolve the seeing-limited Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) images for 32,187 galaxies at z~2-5 in three techniques, namely, the classical Richardson-Lucy (RL) point spread function (PSF) deconvolution, sparse modeling, and generative adversarial networks to investigate the environmental dependence of galaxy mergers. These three techniques generate overall similar high spatial resolution images but with some slight differences in galaxy structures, for example, more residual noises are seen in the classical RL PSF deconvolution. To alleviate disadvantages of each technique, we create combined images by averaging over the three types of super-resolution images, which result in galaxy sub-structures resembling those seen in the Hubble Space Telescope images. Using the combined super-resolution images, we measure the relative galaxy major merger fraction corrected for the chance projection effect, f_merg, for galaxies in the ~300 deg^2-area data of the HSC Strategic Survey Program and the CFHT Large Area U-band Survey. Our f_merg measurements at z~3 validate previous findings showing that f_merg is higher in regions with a higher galaxy overdensity delta at z~2-3. Thanks to the large galaxy sample, we identify a nearly linear increase in f_merg with increasing delta at z~4-5, providing the highest-z observational evidence that galaxy mergers are related to delta. In addition to our f_merg measurements, we find that the galaxy merger fractions in the literature also broadly align with the linear f_merg-delta relation across a wide redshift range of z~2-5. This alignment suggests that the linear f_merg-delta relation can serve as a valuable tool for quantitatively estimating the contributions of galaxy mergers to various environmental dependences. This super-resolution analysis can be readily applied to datasets from wide field-of-view space telescopes such as Euclid and Roman.</description>

      <title>JADES: Primaeval Lyman-$\mathrm{\alpha}$ emitting galaxies reveal early sites of reionisation out to redshift $z \sim 9$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05724v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\require{mediawiki-texvc}$Given the sensitivity of the resonant Lyman-$\mathrm{\alpha}$ (Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$) transition to absorption by neutral hydrogen, observations of Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$ emitting galaxies (LAEs) have been widely used to probe the ionising capabilities of reionisation-era galaxies and their impact on the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, prior to JWST our understanding of the contribution of fainter sources and of ionised `bubbles' at earlier stages of reionisation remained uncertain. Here, we present the characterisation of three exceptionally distant LAEs at $z&gt;8$, newly discovered by JWST/NIRSpec in the JADES survey. These three similarly bright ($M_\text{UV} \approx -20\,\mathrm{mag}$) LAEs exhibit small Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$ velocity offsets from the systemic redshift, $\Delta v_\mathrm{Ly\alpha} \lesssim 200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, yet span a range of Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$ equivalent widths ($15\,\AA$, $31\,\AA$, and $132\,\AA$). The former two show moderate Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$ escape fractions ($f_\mathrm{esc,Ly\alpha} \approx 10\%$), whereas Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$ escapes remarkably efficiently from the third ($f_\mathrm{esc,Ly\alpha} \approx 72\%$), which moreover is very compact (half-light radius of $90\pm10\,\mathrm{pc}$). We find these LAEs are low-mass galaxies dominated by very recent, vigorous bursts of star formation accompanied by strong nebular emission from metal-poor gas. We infer the two LAEs with modest $f_\mathrm{esc,Ly\alpha}$, one of which reveals evidence for ionisation by an active galactic nucleus, may have reasonably produced small ionised bubbles preventing complete IGM absorption of Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$. The third, however, requires a $\sim 3\,\text{physical Mpc}$ bubble, indicating faint galaxies have contributed significantly. The most distant LAEs thus continue to be powerful observational probes into the earlier stages of reionisation.</description>

      <title>The evolution of low-mass central galaxies in the vicinity of massive structures and its impact on the two-halo conformity</title>

Abstract: We investigated the population of low-mass central galaxies with Mstar = $10^{9.5}-10^{10}$ Msun/h, inhabiting regions near massive groups and clusters of galaxies using the TNG300 and MDPL2-SAG simulations. We set out to study their evolutionary histories, aiming to find hints about the large-scale conformity signal they produce. We also used a control sample of central galaxies with the same stellar mass range located far away from massive structures. For both samples, we find a subpopulation of galaxies accreted by another halo in the past, but now considered central galaxies; we refer to these objects as former satellites. The number of former satellites is higher for quenched central galaxies near massive systems, with fractions of 45% and 17% in TNG300 and MDPL2-SAG. Our results in TNG300 show that former satellites pollute the sample of central galaxies because they suffered environmental processes when they were satellites hosted typically by massive dark matter halos (M200 $\geq 10^{13}$ Msun/h) since z$\lesssim$0.5. After removing former satellites, the evolutionary trends for quenched central galaxies near massive structures are fairly similar to those of the quenched control galaxies, showing small differences at low redshift. For MDPL2-SAG instead, former satellites were hosted by less massive halos, with a mean halo mass around $10^{11.4}$ Msun/h, and the evolutionary trends remain equal before and after removing former satellite galaxies. We also measured the two-halo conformity, i.e, the correlation in the sSFR between low-mass central galaxies and their neighbors at Mpc scales, and how former satellites contribute to the signal at three different redshifts: z=0, 0.3, and 1. The time evolution of the conformity signal in the simulations presents apparent contradictory results: it decreases from z=0 to z=1 in MDPL2-SAG, while it increases in TNG300 (abridged).</description>

      <title>Exploring Simple-Population and Multiple-Population Globular Clusters in the Outer Galactic Halo using the Hubble Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pseudo two-color diagram, known as chromosome map (ChM), is a valuable tool for identifying globular clusters (GCs) that consist of single or multiple stellar populations (MPs). Recent surveys of Galactic GCs using the ChM have provided stringent observational constraints on the formation of GCs and their stellar populations. However, these surveys have primarily focused on GCs at moderate distances from the Galactic center and composed of MPs. In this paper, we present the first detailed study of the stellar composition of four GCs in the outer halo of the Milky Way: Arp 2, Ruprecht 106, Terzan 7, and Terzan 8. Our analysis is based on high-precision photometry obtained from images collected with the Hubble Space Telescope in the F275W, F336W, F438W, F606W, and F814W bands. We find that Ruprecht 106 and Terzan 7 are composed solely of a single stellar population, whereas Arp 2 and Terzan 8 host both first- and second-population stars. In these clusters, the second population comprises about half and one-third of the total number of GC stars, respectively. The results from this paper and the literature suggest that the threshold in the initial GC mass, if present, should be smaller than approximately 10^5 M$_{\odot}$. The first-population stars of Arp 2 and Terzan 8, along with the stars of the simple-population GCs Ruprecht 106 and Terzan 7, exhibit intrinsic F275W - F814W color spreads, likely indicative of [Fe/H] variations of approximately 0.05 -- 0.30 dex. This suggests that star-to-star metallicity variations are a common feature of star clusters, regardless of the presence of MPs.</description>

      <title>New constraints on the central mass contents of Omega Centauri from combined stellar kinematics and pulsar timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00939v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a combined analysis of stellar kinematics and line-of-sight accelerations of millisecond pulsars to investigate the mass contents of Omega Centauri. We consider multiple mass components: the visible photometric distribution, a central cluster of dark remnants, an intermediate-mass black hole, and a distribution of intermediate extension traced by the pulsars. By self-consistently incorporating multiple independent datasets, including the effects of different centers, we obtain significant constraints on these mass distributions. Our results strongly favor an extended central mass of ~ 2 - 3 x 10^5 Msun, emulating a cluster of heavy stellar remnants, over an IMBH, with a 3-sigma upper limit of 6 x 10^3 Msun on its mass. Pulsar timing observations provide significant constraints, favoring a central mass distribution that is ~ 20% more massive and extended. Notably, we observe a clear linear scaling between the pulsar distribution and stellar encounter rates, showing excellent agreement with the expectation from millisecond pulsar formation models and motivating a profile for their distribution, providing the first validation of its kind where positions are linked to their place of formation in globular clusters. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of this novel methodology in exploring the structure of star clusters, setting a promising precedent amid the advent of the rapidly growing number of observations and discoveries currently being experienced in this field.</description>

      <title>Velocity-resolved Reverberation Mapping of Changing-look Active Galactic Nucleus NGC 4151 during Outburst Stage. II. Four Season Observation Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of a four-year velocity-resolved reverberation mapping (RM) campaign of the changing-look active galactic nucleus (CL-AGN) NGC 4151 during its outburst phase. By measuring the time lags of the \ha, \hb, \hg, \hei, and \heii\ emission lines, we confirm a stratified broad-line region (BLR) structure that aligns with predictions from photoionization models. Intriguingly, we observed an ``anti-breathing" phenomenon, where the lags of broad emission lines decreased with increasing luminosity, contrary to the typical expectation. This anomaly may be attributed to the influence of the ultraviolet-optical lag or non-virialized motions in the BLR gas. Velocity-resolved RM and ionization mapping analyses revealed rapid and significant changes in the BLR geometry and kinematics on timescales within one year, which cannot be interpreted by any single mechanism, such as an inhomogeneous BLR, variations in radiation pressure, or changes in the illuminated ionizing field. Additionally, the \hb\ lags of NGC 4151 and other CL-AGNs agree with the radius-luminosity relationship established for AGNs with low accretion rates, implying that the CL phenomenon is more likely driven by intrinsic changes in the accretion rate rather than obscuration. These findings provide new insights into the complex internal processes of CL-AGNs and highlight the importance of long-term, multi-line RM for understanding BLR structures, geometry, and kinematics.</description>

      <title>Helical randomization of magnetized Galactic and galaxy clusters plasmas: from magnetorotational disc dynamo to the Faraday rotation and synchrotron emission skies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07399v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using results of numerical simulations and Galactic and galaxy clusters observations, it is shown that the transition from deterministic chaos to hard turbulence in the Galactic and galaxy clusters magnetized plasmas occurs via a randomization process. The notion of distributed chaos has been used to describe the randomization process. The randomization can be quantified with the main parameter of the distributed chaos, which in turn can be related to magnetic helicity or its dissipation rate. Spontaneous breaking of local reflectional symmetry (an intrinsic property of chaotic/turbulent motions) generates local helicity even when the global helicity is negligible. It is shown that the magnetic fields can impose their level of randomization on the electron density, Faraday rotation maps, and synchrotron emission. Results of the numerical simulations of the Galactic and galaxy clusters dynamos: the inner disk's ones (based on the magnetorotational instability) and global ones, are in good agreement with this approach, as well as with the results obtained using observations of the Faraday rotation and synchrotron emission skies.</description>

      <title>Growth of Light-Seed Black Holes in Gas-Rich Galaxies at High Redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope confirm the existence of massive black holes ($&gt;10^6$ $\rm{M_{\odot}}$) beyond the redshift of $z=10$. However, their formation mechanism(s) still remain an open question. Light seed black holes are one such formation pathway, forming as the end stage of metalfree (Population III) stars. Light seed black holes can grow into massive black holes as long as they accrete near the Eddington limit for substantial periods or undergo several bursts of super-Eddington accretion. In this work, our aim is to ascertain if light seeds can grow in gas rich galaxies - similar to those expected at high redshift (z $\gtrsim 10$). Using the Arepo code, we follow self-consistently the formation of Population III stars and black holes in galaxies with total masses in the range $10^8$ $\rm{M_{\odot}}$. We find that in the absence of feedback, black holes can grow to $10^5$ $\rm{M_{\odot}}$ in just $10^4$ years. These black holes do not decouple from the gas clumps in which they are born and are able to accrete at hyper-Eddington rates. In the presence of supernova feedback, the number of actively growing black holes diminishes by an order of magnitude. However, we still observe hyper-Eddington accretion in approximately 1 % of the black hole population despite supernova feedback. This (idealised) work lays the foundation for future works, where we will test our models in a cosmological framework. In this work, we neglect radiative feedback processes from stellar evolution and from accretion onto the growing black holes. This likely means that our results represent an upper limit to light seed growth. We will address these shortcomings in future work.</description>

      <title>Polarization of active galactic nuclei with significant VLBI-Gaia displacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous studies have reported significant displacements in the coordinates of active galactic nuclei between measurements using radio interferometry techniques and those obtained by the Gaia space observatory. There is a consensus that these discrepancies do indeed manifest astrometrically resolved sub-components of AGN rather than random measurement noise. Among other evidence, it has been reported that AGN with VLBI-to-Gaia displacements (VGD) pointing downstream their parsec-scale radio jets exhibit higher optical polarization compared to sources with the opposite VGD orientation. We aim to verify this previously reported connection between optical polarization and VGD-jet angle using a larger dataset of polarimetric measurements and updated Gaia DR3 positions. We also seek additional evidence supporting the disc-jet dichotomy as an explanation of such a connection by using mm-wave polarization and multi-band optical polarization measurements. We performed optical polarimetric observations of 157 AGN using three telescopes. We cross-match public astrometric data from VLBI and Gaia experiments, obtain corresponding positional displacements, and join this catalog with the polarimetric and jet directions data. AGN with downstream VGD are confirmed to have significantly higher optical fractional polarization than the upstream sample. At the same time, the mm-wavelength polarization of the two samples demonstrates very similar distributions. Our results support the hypothesis that the VLBI-to-Gaia displacements pointing down the radio jet are likely caused by a component in the jet emitting highly polarized synchrotron radiation and dominating in the overall optical emission. The upstream-oriented VGD are likely to be produced by the low-polarized emission of the central engine sub-components dominating in the optical.</description>

      <title>Stellar Halos of Bright Central Galaxies: A View from the FEGA Semi-Analytic Model of Galaxy Formation and VEGAS Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present theoretical predictions and extrapolations from observed data of the stellar halos surrounding central group/cluster galaxies and the transition radius between them and the intracluster or diffuse light. Leveraging the state-of-the-art semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, {\small FEGA} (\citealt{contini2024c}), applied to two dark matter-only cosmological simulations, we derive both the stellar halo mass and its radius. Using theoretical assumptions about the diffuse light distribution and halo concentration, we extrapolate the same information for observed data from the {\small VEGAS} survey (\citealt{capaccioli2015,iodice2021}). Our model, supported by observational data and independent simulation results, predicts an increasing transition radius with halo mass, a constant stellar halo-to-intracluster light ratio, and a stable stellar halo mass fraction with increasing halo mass. Specifically, we find that the transition radius between the stellar halo and the diffuse light ranges from 20 to 250 kpc, from Milky Way-like halos to large clusters, while the stellar halo mass comprises only a small fraction, between 7\% and 18\%, of the total stellar mass within the virial radius. These results support the idea that the stellar halo can be viewed as a transition region between the stars bound to the galaxy and those belonging to the intracluster light, consistent with recent observations and theoretical predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We estimate halo spins for HI-rich galaxies in the Arecibo Legacy Fast Alfa Survey using a semi-analytic approach, examining the relationship between halo spin and stellar surface density. Our findings reveal an inverse correlation in both low- and high-mass galaxy samples, with stellar surface density decreasing as halo spin increases. This trend highlights the pivotal role of halo spin in galaxy evolution and suggests a universal formation scenario: high-spin halos, accompanied by high-spin accreted gas, retain angular momentum, preventing gas from efficiently condensing in the galactic center and thus suppressing star formation. Consequently, weak feedback redistributes gas to the halo outskirts without significant expulsion. The shallower central gravitational potential in high-spin halos promotes outward stellar migration, leading to more extended stellar distributions and lower stellar surface densities.</description>

      <title>A catalog of ringed galaxies in the TNG50 simulation: Analysis of their properties and structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The catalog of ringed galaxies was compiled through visual classification of synthetic images from the TNG50 simulation. Galaxies were selected based on specific criteria: a redshift range of $0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.1$, stellar mass $M_\star &gt;10^9 M_\odot$, stellar half-mass radius $r_{50} &gt; 1$ kpc, and specific star formation rate (sSFR), $\rm{log(sSFR/yr}^{-1}) &gt; -13$. Our classification allowed for differentiation between inner rings, outer rings, combinations of rings, and partial rings (pseudo-rings), including barred and non-barred ringed galaxies.
  We constructed a control sample of non-ringed galaxies with similar redshift, stellar mass, and environmental density distributions. We identified 807 ringed galaxies. Approximately 59% possess an inner ring, 22% a partial ring, 12% an outer ring, and 7% have i+o rings. Our statistical analysis reveals that 64% (507 galaxies) exhibit bars. Ringed galaxies exhibit lower efficiency for star formation, reduced gas fractions, redder colors, and higher metallicities compared to non-ringed disk objects. They also show greater variability in metallicity for a given stellar mass.
  From the analysis of radial profiles, galaxies with outer rings exhibit a $r_{50}$ similar to or slightly larger than their control group, while those with inner or partial rings tend to have smaller sizes. A deeper exploration of radial density profiles revealed a pronounced central mass deficit preceding the ring structures, with inner and outer rings located at $r_{50}$ and $1.5 , r_{50}$, respectively. Galaxies with both i+o rings have inner rings that are more compact and massive. Additionally, galaxies with partial rings exhibit deeper mass profiles than their controls, particularly in central areas. These findings improve our understanding of galactic evolution and the complex interplay between mass distribution and morphology.</description>

      <title>The deuterium fractionation of NH$_3$ in massive star-forming regions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deuteration is sensitive to environmental conditions in star-forming regions. To investigate NH$_2$D chemistry, we compared the spatial distribution of ortho-NH$_2$D $1_{11}^s-1_{01}^a$, NH$_3$(1,1) and NH$_3$(2,2) in 12 late-stage massive star-forming regions. By averaging several pixels along the spatial slices of ortho-NH$_2$D $1_{11}^s-1_{01}^a$, we obtained the deuterium fractionation of NH$_3$. In seven targets, the deuterium fractionation of NH$_3$ shows a decreasing trend with increasing rotational temperature. This trend is less clear in the remaining five sources, likely due to limited spatial resolution. However, when considering all 12 sources together, the anticorrelation between NH$_3$ deuterium fractionation and rotational temperature becomes less significant, suggesting that other physical parameters may influence the fractionation. Additionally, we found that the region of highest deuterium fractionation of NH$_3$ is offset from the NH$_3$ peak in each source, likely because the temperature is higher near the NH$_3$ peaks and NH$_2$D may be depleted from the gas phase as the molecular cloud core evolves, as well as the increased release of CO from grains into the gas phase.</description>

      <title>Intergalactic medium rotation measure of primordial magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Faraday rotation effect, quantified by the Rotation Measure (RM), is a powerful probe of the large-scale magnetization of the Universe - tracing magnetic fields not only on galaxy and galaxy cluster scales but also in the intergalactic Medium (IGM; referred to as $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$). The redshift dependence of the latter has extensively been explored with observations. It has also been shown that this relation can help to distinguish between different large-scale magnetization scenarios. We study the evolution of this $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$ for different primordial magnetogenesis scenarios to search for the imprints of primordial magnetic fields (PMFs; magnetic fields originating in the early Universe) on the redshift-dependence of $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$. We use cosmological magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations for evolving PMFs during large-scale structure formation, coupled to the light cone analysis to produce a realistic statistical sample of mock $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$ images. We study the predicted behavior for the cosmic evolution of $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$ for different correlation lengths of PMFs, and provide fitting functions for their dependence on redshifts. We compare these mock RM trends with the recent analysis of the the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) RM Grid and find that large-scale-correlated PMFs should have (comoving) strengths $\lesssim 0.75$ nanoGauss, if originated during inflation with the scale invariant spectrum and (comoving) correlation length $\sim 19$ cMpc/h or $ \lesssim 30$ nanoGauss if they originated during phase-transition epochs with the comoving correlation length $\sim 1$ cMpc/h. Our findings agree with previous observations and confirm the results of semi-analytical studies, showing that upper limits on the PMF strength decrease as their coherence scales increase.</description>

Abstract: We consider constraints on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{\mathrm{M}}$ from: (i) the age of the Universe based on old stars and stellar populations in the Galactic disc and halo (Cimatti &amp; Moresco 2023); (ii) the turnover scale in the matter power spectrum, which tells us the cosmological horizon at the epoch of matter-radiation equality (Philcox et al. 2022); and (iii) the shape of the expansion history from supernovae (SNe) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) with no absolute calibration of either, a technique known as uncalibrated cosmic standards (UCS; Lin, Chen, &amp; Mack 2021). A narrow region is consistent with all three constraints just outside their $1\sigma$ uncertainties. Although this region is defined by techniques unrelated to the physics of recombination and the sound horizon then, the standard $Planck$ fit to the CMB anisotropies falls precisely in this region. This concordance argues against early-time explanations for the anomalously high local estimate of $H_0$ (the 'Hubble tension'), which can only be reconciled with the age constraint at an implausibly low $\Omega_{\mathrm{M}}$. We suggest instead that outflow from the local KBC supervoid (Keenan, Barger, &amp; Cowie 2013) inflates redshifts in the nearby universe and thus the apparent local $H_0$. Given the difficulties with solutions in the early universe, we argue that the most promising alternative to a local void is a modification to the expansion history at late times, perhaps due to a changing dark energy density.</description>
