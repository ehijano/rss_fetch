      <title>Disks, Surfaces, and Entanglement Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the probability that a loop is null-homotopic -- that is, bounded by the continuous image of a disk -- in plaquette percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^3.$ Locally, the event that there is a ``horizontal disk crossing'' of a rectangular prism is dual to the event that there is a vertical crossing in entanglement percolation (with wired boundary conditions). However, the analysis of analogous events on the full lattice is complicated by the long-range nature of entanglement percolation. We show that the probability that a rectangular loop is contractible exhibits a phase transition from area law to perimeter law dual to the entanglement percolation threshold, conditional on a conjecture concerning the continuity of entanglement percolation thresholds with respect to truncation. We also show the continuity of a truncated entanglement percolation threshold in slabs and apply that to identify a regime where large plaquette surfaces exist but typically have many handles.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems for Markov walks conditioned to stay positive in the $\alpha$-stable regime under a spectral gap assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X_n)_{n\ge 1}$ be a Markov chain on a measurable state space $X$, and let $S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n f(X_k)$ be the associated Markov walk. For $y&gt;0$, denote by $\tau_y$ the first time at which $y+S_n$ becomes non-positive. Assuming that the centred martingale approximation of $S_n$ lies in the domain of attraction of a strictly $\alpha$-stable law with $\alpha\in(1,2)$, and that the transition operator satisfies a spectral-gap condition, we determine the asymptotic behaviour of $P_x(\tau_y&gt;n)$.
  In particular, we show the existence of a strictly positive $Q^+$-harmonic function $V_\alpha(x,y)$ such that $$n^{1-\rho} L(n)\, P_x(\tau_y&gt;n) \longrightarrow V_\alpha(x,y),$$ where $L$ is slowly varying and $\rho$ is the positivity parameter of the limiting $\alpha$-stable process. We further establish the asymptotic growth of $V_\alpha(x,y)$ as $y\to\infty$ and prove a conditional limit theorem: conditionally on $\{\tau_y&gt;n\}$,
  $$\frac{S_n}{n^{1/\alpha} L(n)}$$ converges in distribution to the $\alpha$-stable meander.
  These results extend the Gaussian spectral-gap theory of Markov walks to the full stable regime and give the first appearance of stable meanders for Markov additive processes under such assumptions.</description>

      <title>Maximum Cluster Diameter in Non-Critical Bond Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study independent (Bernoulli) bond percolation in dimensions $d \ge 2$, focusing on the maximum diameter of finite clusters in the non-critical regime ($p\neq p_c$). We prove that the maximum diameter $R_n$ satisfies $R_n / \log n \to \varkappa(p)$ almost surely, where $\varkappa(p)$ is determined by the exponential decay rate $\xi(p)$ of $P_p(0 \leftrightarrow \partial B_n, |\mathcal C_0|&lt;\infty)$. Furthermore, we establish a large deviation principle for the event $\{R_n &gt; \rho\log n\}$ for $\rho &gt; \varkappa (p)$. Finally, we consider the asymptotics of the number of vertices in clusters with large diameters.</description>

      <title>Global universal approximation with Brownian signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish $L^p$-type universal approximation theorems for general and non-anticipative functionals on suitable rough path spaces, showing that linear functionals acting on signatures of time-extended rough paths are dense with respect to an $L^p$-distance. To that end, we derive global universal approximation theorems for weighted rough path spaces. We demonstrate that these $L^p$-type universal approximation theorems apply in particular to Brownian motion. As a consequence, linear functionals on the signature of the time-extended Brownian motion can approximate any $p$-integrable stochastic process adapted to the Brownian filtration, including solutions to stochastic differential equations.</description>

      <title>On the Dimension of Random Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dimension of random simplicial complexes (defined as the maximal dimension among all faces) is a natural extreme value associated with the complex, and is closely related to other functionals defined by a maximum, such as the clique number of geometric graphs or scan statistics. We extend existing results in the binomial point process case to the Poisson setting in sparse graphs, give new ones about expectations and large deviation principles in all regimes, as well as give a first precise distribution result in the dense case.</description>

      <title>A new bound for the critical point of the FK model for $q&lt;1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the random cluster model with parameter $q&lt;1$, for which the FKG inequalities are not valid. On the square lattice, stochastic comparison with Bernoulli percolation implies that the model is subcritical (respectively supercritical) when $p \leq q/(1+q)$ (resp. $p \geq 1/2$); in this paper, we extend these two regions, by improving the classical stochastic comparisons. Assuming the existence of the critical point, this reduces its possible range.
  The proof relies on a modification of the usual Glauber dynamics of the model, which enables stochastic bounds of FK measures between two inhomegenous percolations. We also prove uniqueness of the infinite-volume measure in our extended ranges. Most of our results are valid in any dimension $d \geq 2$ and beyond hypercubic lattices.</description>

      <title>Multi-Dimensional Martingales from Mutual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of Risk Neutral Pricing theory, we consider the classic problem of calibrating a martingale over $\mathbb{R}^n$ to a finite number of marginals thereof, or more practically, to prices of an arbitrary finite set of (joint) European contingent claims. For $n=1$, one can rely on the work of Dupire, while for $n\geq 2$ an analogous natural unique construction seems to be lacking. We provide such a unique candidate as the result of pure Martingale Entropic Optimal Transport. As a byproduct, the latter allows us to obtain a constructive proof of a classic result of Strassen. Finally, and in contrast to the proposed approach, we prove a result that demonstrates how a certain class of local correlation models fails in general to calibrate to basket option prices, particularly in the foreign exchange market.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein error bounds for aggregations of continuous-time Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the approximation of a (finite) continuous-time Markov chain by a Markov chain on a reduced state space, and we provide formal error bounds for the approximated transient distributions in the Wasserstein distance. These bounds extend previous work on error bounds in the total variation distance, and are the first step towards a generalization to continuous-time Markov processes with continuous state spaces. A Wasserstein matrix norm is used to bound the error caused by the lower-dimensional approximation of the dynamics. In order to control the propagation of the accumulated error, we rely on the concept of coarse Ricci curvature of a Markov chain. The practical applicability of the presented bounds depends strongly on the curvature of the chain. Examples for CTMCs taken from the literature (where we added a metric on the state space) show that a negative curvature results in exponentially exploding bounds. On the other hand, certain CTMCs which we call translation-invariant always have non-negative curvature. When measuring the error in the total variation distance (a special case of the Wasserstein distance with the discrete metric), the curvature is also always non-negative. If it is strictly positive, the bounds presented in this paper are an improvement over previous work.</description>

      <title>Computing Lower and Upper Hitting Probabilities for Imprecise Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the computation of lower and upper probabilities of hitting a target set of states for imprecise Markov chains. For these, transition uncertainty is modelled by a convex set of transition matrices. In the precise case, hitting probabilities are the minimal nonnegative solution of a linear system and admit a closed-form expression. We study the notion of reachability in the imprecise setting. The literature review highlights few different definitions of lower reachability; thus we explore the relations among them, presenting examples to clarify their logical implications. Using this revised definition of reachability for imprecise Markov chain, we partition the state space into classes of states whose hitting probabilities are trivially zero or one and those which require further computation. For these nontrivial states, we show that lower and upper hitting probabilities are the unique solutions of two nonlinear fixed-point equations. For the practical computation of lower and upper hitting probabilities, we propose iterative algorithms that alternate between solving a linear system and choosing an extreme point from the set of transition matrices. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, in practice, these algorithms converge in substantially fewer iterations than the theoretically established worst-case bound.</description>

      <title>Growing Self-Similar Markov Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can we obtain a Brownian CRT of mass $1/2$ from a CRT of mass $1$ by cutting certain branches?
  In this paper, we will answer that question in the much more general setting of self-similar Markov trees. Self-similar Markov trees (ssMt) are random decorated trees that encode the genealogy of a system of particles carrying positive labels, and where particles undergo splitting and growth depending on their labels in a self-similar fashion. Introduced and developed in the recent monograph (Bertoin-Curien-Riera, 2024), they provide a broad generalization of Brownian and stable continuum random trees and arise naturally in various models of random geometry such as the Brownian sphere/disk. The law of a ssMt is characterized by its quadruplet $(\mathrm{a}, \sigma^2, \boldsymbol{\Lambda}; \alpha)$, which specifies the features of the underlying growth-fragmentation mechanism, together with the initial decoration $x&gt;0$. In this work, we focus on special cases of ssMt in which the trees started from different initial values $x&gt;0$ can be coupled into a continuous, increasing family of nested subtrees. In the case of the Brownian and stable continuum random trees, this yields surprisingly simple novel dynamics corresponding to the scaling limit of the leaf-growth algorithms of Luczak-Winkler and Caraceni-Stauffer.</description>

      <title>Decision-Focused Bias Correction for Fluid Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluid approximation is a widely used approach for solving two-stage stochastic optimization problems, with broad applications in service system design such as call centers and healthcare operations. However, replacing the underlying random distribution (e.g., demand distribution) with its mean (e.g., the time-varying average arrival rate) introduces bias in performance estimation and can lead to suboptimal decisions. In this paper, we investigate how to identify an alternative point statistic, which is not necessarily the mean, such that substituting this statistic into the two-stage optimization problem yields the optimal decision. We refer to this statistic as the decision-corrected point estimate (time-varying arrival rate). For a general service network with customer abandonment costs, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such a corrected point estimate and propose an algorithm for its computation. Under a decomposable network structure, we further show that the resulting decision-corrected point estimate is closely related to the classical newsvendor solution. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of our decision-focused correction method compared to the traditional fluid approximation.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Kalman Filter for Systems with Unknown Initial Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The models of partially observed linear stochastic differential equations with unknown initial values of the non-observed component are considered in two situations. In the first problem, the initial value is deterministic, and in the second problem, it is assumed to be a Gaussian random variable. The main problem is the computation of adaptive Kalman filters and the discussion of their asymptotic optimality. The realization of this program for both models is done in several steps. First, a preliminary estimator of the unknown parameter is constructed by observations on some learning interval. Then, this estimator is used for the calculation of recurrent one-step MLE estimators, which are subsequently substituted in the equations of Kalman filtration.</description>

      <title>Full classification of de Finetti type theorems for *-random variables in classical and free probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical distributional symmetries can be described as invariance under the actions of semigroups (or groups) of matrix structures, and subsequently under the coactions of continuous functions on the matrix semigroups (or groups) generated by entry functions. By considering noncommutative entry functions on matrix structures, Woronowicz introduced corepresentations of compact quantum groups, namely Woronowicz's $C^*$-algebras (also known as compact matrix pseudogroups). We demonstrate that every nontrivial finite sequence of random variables admits a maximal distributional symmetry determined by a Woronowicz $C^*$-algebra. This establishes a probabilistic framework for classifying compact quantum groups. Furthermore, we classify all de Finetti-type theorems for *-random variables that are invariant under distributional symmetries arising from compact matrix quantum groups in both classical and free probability settings. Our results show that only finitely many types of de Finetti theorems exist in these contexts, and the associated categories of (quantum) groups are the easy (quantum) groups introduced by Banica and Speicher.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Euler scheme is a standard time discretization for BSDEs, but its implementation hinges on approximating conditional expectations and the associated martingale terms at each time step. We propose an implementation based on the Wiener chaos decomposition to approximate these quantities. In contrast to many numerical schemes that rely on a forward-backward (Markovian) structure, our approach accommodates arbitrary $\mathcal{F}_T$-measurable square-integrable terminal conditions. We provide a comprehensive convergence analysis and illustrate the method on several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>The Fourier Ratio: Uncertainty, Restriction, and Approximation for Compactly Supported Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a continuous analog of the Fourier ratio for compactly supported Borel measures. For a measure \(\mu\) on \(\mathbb{R}^d\) and \(f\in L^2(\mu)\), the Fourier ratio compares \(L^1\) and \(L^2\) norms of a regularized Fourier transform at scale \(R\). We develop a fractal uncertainty principle giving sharp two-sided bounds in terms of covering numbers of spatial and frequency supports, with applications to exact signal recovery. We show that small Fourier ratio implies efficient approximation by low-degree trigonometric polynomials in \(L^1\), \(L^2\), and \(L^\infty\). In contrast, restriction estimates reveal a sharp gap between curved measures and random fractal measures, yielding strong lower bounds on approximation degree. Applications to convex surface measures are also obtained.</description>

      <title>Rao-Blackwellized e-variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for any concave utility, the expected utility of an e-variable can only increase after conditioning on a sufficient statistic. The simplest form of the result has an extremely straightforward proof, which follows from a single application of Jensen's inequality. Similar statements hold for compound e-variables, asymptotic e-variables, and e-processes. These results echo the Rao-Blackwell theorem, which states that the expected squared error of an estimator can only decrease after conditioning on a sufficient statistic. We provide several applications of this insight, including a simplified derivation of the log-optimal e-variable for linear regression with known variance.</description>

      <title>On The Hidden Biases of Flow Matching Samplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the implicit bias of flow matching (FM) samplers via the lens of empirical flow matching. Although population FM may produce gradient-field velocities resembling optimal transport (OT), we show that the empirical FM minimizer is almost never a gradient field, even when each conditional flow is. Consequently, empirical FM is intrinsically energetically suboptimal. In view of this, we analyze the kinetic energy of generated samples. With Gaussian sources, both instantaneous and integrated kinetic energies exhibit exponential concentration, while heavy-tailed sources lead to polynomial tails. These behaviors are governed primarily by the choice of source distribution rather than the data. Overall, these notes provide a concise mathematical account of the structural and energetic biases arising in empirical FM.</description>

      <title>Control of McKean--Vlasov SDEs with Contagion Through Killing at a State-Dependent Intensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a novel McKean--Vlasov control problem with contagion through killing of particles and common noise. Each particle is killed at an exponential rate according to an intensity process that increases whenever the particle is located in a specific region. The removal of a particle pushes others towards the removal region, which can trigger cascades that see particles exiting the system in rapid succession. We study the control of such a system by a central agent who intends to preserve particles at minimal cost. Our theoretical contribution is twofold. Firstly, we rigorously justify the McKean--Vlasov control problem as the limit of a corresponding sequences of controlled finite particle systems. Our proof is based on a controlled martingale problem and tightness arguments. Secondly, we connect our framework with models in which particles are killed once they hit the boundary of the removal region. We show that these models appear in the limit as the exponential rate tends to infinity. As a corollary, we obtain new existence results for McKean--Vlasov SDEs with singular interaction through hitting times which extend those in the established literature. We conclude the paper with numerical investigations of our model applied to government control of systemic risk in financial systems.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Approaches to The Energy Equality in Forced Surface Quasi-Geostrophic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore probabilistic approaches to the deterministic energy equality for the forced Surface Quasi-Geostrophic (SQG) equation on a torus. First, we prove the zero-noise dynamical large deviations for a corresponding stochastic SQG equation, where the lower bound matches the upper bound on a certain closure of the weak-strong uniqueness class for the deterministic forced SQG equation. Furthermore, we show that the energy equality for the deterministic SQG equation holds on arbitrary time-reversible subsets of the domain where we match the upper bound and the lower bound. Conversely, the violation of the deterministic energy equality breaks the lower bound of large deviations. These results extend the existing techniques in Gess, Heydecker, and the second author \cite{arXiv:2311.02223} to generalized Sobolev spaces with negative indices. Finally, we provide an analysis of the restricted quasi-potential and prove a conditional equivalence compared to the rate function of large deviations for the Gaussian distribution. This suggests a potential connection between non-Gaussian large deviations in equilibrium for the stochastic SQG equation and the open problem regarding the uniqueness of the deterministic SQG equation.</description>

      <title>Free infinite divisibility, fractional convolution powers, and Appell polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20488v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Initiated by a result of Gorin and Marcus [Int. Math. Res. Not., (3):883--913, 2020] and an observation of Steinerberger [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 147(11):4733--4744, 2019], there has been a recent growing body of literature connecting repeated differentiation of polynomials to free additive convolution semigroups in free probability. Roughly, this connection states that in the large degree limit the empirical measure of the roots after many derivatives is, up to a rescaling, the original empirical measure of the roots raised to a free additive convolution power. If the original real roots satisfy some bounds and the number of derivatives is such that the remaining degree is fixed, then these high derivatives converge to the Hermite polynomials. In the context of convolution semigroups and finite free probability these results have a natural interpretation as a central limit theorem for repeated differentiation. We consider the case when these root bounds are removed and identify the potential limits of repeated differentiation as the real rooted Appell sequences. We prove that a sequence of polynomials is in the domain of attraction of an Appell sequence exactly when the empirical measures of the roots are, up to a rescaling, in the domain of attraction of a free infinitely divisible distribution naturally associated to the Appell sequence. We additionally extend these notions of infinite divisibility and fractional convolution semigroups to rectangular finite free probability. Our approach is based on the finite free R-transform of the polynomials, providing a step towards an analytic theory of finite free probability. These transforms provide a clear connection between Appell polynomials and free infinitely divisible distributions, where the finite free R-transform of a real rooted Appell polynomial is a truncated version of the R-transform of an infinitely divisible distribution.</description>

      <title>Residual Diffusivity for Expanding Bernoulli Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a discrete time Markov process $X^\epsilon$ on $\mathbf R^d$ that makes a deterministic jump based on its current location, and then takes a small Gaussian step of variance $\epsilon^2$. We study the behavior of the asymptotic variance as $\epsilon \to 0$. In some situations (for instance if there were no jumps), then the asymptotic variance vanishes as $\epsilon \to 0$. When the jumps are "chaotic", however, the asymptotic variance may be bounded from above and bounded away from $0$, as $\epsilon \to 0$. This phenomenon is known as residual diffusivity, and we prove this occurs when the jumps are determined by certain expanding Bernoulli maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19164v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a non-oriented edge-weighted graph, we show how to make some estimation of the associated Laplacian eigenvalues through Monte Carlo evaluation of spectral quantities computed along Kirchhoff random rooted spanning forest trajectories. The sampling cost of this estimation is only linear in the node number, up to a logarithmic factor. By associating a double cover of such a graph with any symmetric real matrix, we can then perform spectral estimation in the same way for the latter.</description>

      <title>Delocalization of Non-Mean-Field Random Matrices in Dimensions $d\ge 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20274v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $N \times N$ random band matrices $H = (H_{xy})$ with mean-zero complex Gaussian entries, where $x,y$ lie on the discrete torus $(\mathbb{Z} / \sqrt[d]{N} \mathbb{Z})^d$ in dimensions $d \ge 3$. The variance profile satisfies $\mathbb{E}|H_{xy}|^2 = S_{xy}$, with $S_{xy} = 0$ whenever the distance between $x$ and $y$ exceeds a bandwidth parameter $W$. We prove that if $W \geq N^{\mathfrak{c}}$ for some constant $\mathfrak{c} &gt; 0$, then in the large-$N$ limit, bulk eigenvectors are delocalized, quantum unique ergodicity (QUE) holds, and the local bulk eigenvalue statistics are universal. Our proof is based on the tree approximation of the loop hierarchy (arXiv:2501.01718) and diagrammatic techniques developed in earlier works (arXiv:1807.02447, arXiv:2104.12048, arXiv:2107.05795, arXiv:2412.15207, arXiv:2503.07606).
  Besides random band matrices, we also study two classical non-mean-field random matrix models: the Wegner orbital and the block Anderson models. Specifically, we consider Hermitian matrices $H = V + g \Psi$ on the same discrete torus $(\mathbb{Z} / \sqrt[d]{N} \mathbb{Z})^d$, where $V$ is a random block potential consisting of i.i.d. complex Gaussian diagonal blocks of size $W^d \times W^d$, and $\Psi$ encodes the interactions between neighboring blocks--random in the Wegner orbital model and deterministic in the block Anderson model. The parameter $g &gt; 0$ represents the coupling strength between blocks. Assuming again that $W \geq N^{\mathfrak{c}}$, we establish delocalization of bulk eigenvectors, QUE, and bulk universality under the condition $W^{-d/2+\varepsilon}\le g \le \varepsilon^{-1}$ for any small constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$. Combined with the localization results of arXiv:1608.02922 for $g \ll W^{-d/2}$, this identifies a localization--delocalization transition at the scale $g=W^{-d/2}$ in dimensions $d \ge 3$.</description>

Abstract: We consider extremal processes and random walks generated by heavy-tailed random vectors taking values in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with the $\ell_p$ distance. We establish limit theorems for their paths in the triangular array setting when both the number of steps $n$ and the dimension $d$ grow to infinity. It is shown that it is possible to map the paths using isometries of $\ell_p$ such that the images converge and to identify the limit as derived from a Poisson cluster process. This also implies the convergence in distribution of the paths interpreted as finite metric spaces on the family of metric spaces equipped with the Gromov-Hausdorff distance. We also show that the images of the paths converge in distribution in the space of counting measures on the line equipped with the Hausdorff metric generated by a suitable variant of $\ell_p$ distance between counting measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the mean-field limit of the Atlas model and its connection to SDEs with dependence on the distribution of hitting and local times. The Atlas model describes a system of Brownian particles on the real line, where only the lowest ranked particle receives a positive drift, proportional to the number of particles. We show that in the mean-field limit the particle system converges to a novel SDE with reflection at a moving boundary, whose motion is such that the average local time spent at the boundary grows at a constant rate. In general, the boundary is represented by a measure, so the reflection must be interpreted in a relaxed sense. However, for sufficiently regular initial particle profiles, we prove that the boundary is a continuous function. Our analysis relies on a reformulation of the problem via McKean--Vlasov SDEs with interaction through hitting and local times.</description>

      <title>Ergodic robust maximization of asymptotic growth with stochastic factor processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a robust asymptotic growth problem under model uncertainty in the presence of stochastic factors. We fix two inputs representing the instantaneous covariance for the asset price process $X$, which depends on an additional stochastic factor process $Y$, as well as the invariant density of $X$ together with $Y$. The stochastic factor process $Y$ has continuous trajectories but is not even required to be a semimartingale. Our setup allows for drift uncertainty in $X$ and model uncertainty for the local dynamics of $Y$. This work builds upon a recent paper of Kardaras &amp; Robertson, where the authors consider an analogous problem, however, without the additional stochastic factor process. Under suitable, quite weak assumptions we are able to characterize the robust optimal trading strategy and the robust optimal growth rate. The optimal strategy is shown to be functionally generated and, remarkably, does not depend on the factor process $Y$. Our result provides a comprehensive answer to a question proposed by Fernholz in 2002. We also show that the optimal strategy remains optimal even in the more restricted case where $Y$ is a semimartingale and the joint covariation structure of $X$ and $Y$ is prescribed as a function of $X$ and $Y$. Our results are obtained using a combination of techniques from partial differential equations, calculus of variations, and generalized Dirichlet forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04845v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide abstract, general and highly uniform rates of asymptotic regularity for a generalized stochastic Halpern-style iteration, which incorporates a second mapping in the style of a Krasnoselskii-Mann iteration. This iteration is general in two ways: First, it incorporates stochasticity completely abstractly, rather than fixing a sampling method; second, it includes as special cases stochastic versions of various schemes from the optimization literature, including Halpern's iteration as well as a Krasnoselskii-Mann iteration with Tikhonov regularization terms in the sense of Bo\c{t}, Csetnek and Meier (where this stochastic variant of the latter is considered for the first time in this paper). For these specific cases, we obtain linear rates of asymptotic regularity, matching (or improving) the currently best known rates for these iterations in stochastic optimization, and quadratic rates of asymptotic regularity are obtained in the context of inner product spaces for the general iteration. We conclude by discussing how variance can be managed in practice through sampling methods in the style of minibatching, how our convergence rates can be adapted to provide oracle complexity bounds, and by sketching how the schemes presented here can be instantiated in the context of reinforcement learning to yield novel methods for Q-learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent interest in graphon mean field games and their applications, this paper provides a comprehensive probabilistic analysis of graphon mean field control (GMFC) problems, where the controlled dynamics are governed by a graphon mean field stochastic differential equation with heterogeneous mean field interactions. We formulate the GMFC problem with general graphon mean field dependence and establish the existence and uniqueness of the associated graphon mean field forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs). We then derive a version of the Pontryagin stochastic maximum principle tailored to GMFC problems. Furthermore, we analyze the solvability of the GMFC problem for linear dynamics and study the continuity and stability of the graphon mean field FBSDEs under the optimal control profile. Finally, we show that the solution to the GMFC problem provides an approximately optimal solution for large systems with heterogeneous mean field interactions, based on a propagation of chaos result.</description>

Abstract: We investigate harmonic analysis of random matrices of large size with their Dyson indices going simultaneous to zero, that is in the high temperature limit. In this regime, we show that the multivariate Bessel function/Heckman-Opdam hypergeometric function of the empirical spectral distribution converges to the Fourier/Mellin transform of a measure, which and the limiting empirical distribution are intimately related by the Markov-Krein correspondence. The uniqueness, existence and other properties of the Markov-Krein correspondence can be studied using the theory of the Dirichlet process.</description>

Our algorithm is Weitz-type for two reasons. First, it expresses the partition function as a telescoping product of ratios, with the key being to approximate each ratio. Second, it uses Weitz's self-avoiding walk tree, and truncates it at logarithmic depth to give a good and efficient approximation. The key difference from the standard Weitz algorithm is that we approximate a carefully designed edge-deletion ratio instead of the marginal probability of a vertex being assigned a particular spin, ensuring our algorithm does not require SSM.
  Furthermore, by establishing local dependence of coefficients (LDC), we prove a novel form of SSM for these edge-deletion ratios, which, in turn, implies the standard SSM for the random cluster model. This is the first SSM result for the random cluster model on general graphs, beyond lattices. Our proof of LDC is based on a new divisibility relation, and we show such relations hold quite universally. This leads to a broadly applicable framework for proving LDC across a variety of models, including the Potts model, the hypergraph independence polynomial, and Holant problems. Combined with existing zero-freeness results for these models, we derive new SSM results for them.</description>

      <title>Extended regime of nematic order in an interacting monomer-dimer model of Heilmann and Lieb</title>

Abstract: We revisit a two-dimensional model of liquid crystals introduced by Heilmann and Lieb (1979), which consists of a system of dimers on the square lattice at chemical potential $\lambda$, interacting via a hard-core repulsion and an attractive interaction of strength $-a&lt;0$ between adjacent, colinear dimers. The model is conjectured to exhibit nematic order at low temperatures, in the sense of orientational symmetry breaking coupled with the absence of translational order, provided that $\lambda+a&gt;0$. In this paper, we prove the conjecture under the additional condition that $3a&gt;\lambda$, which corresponds physically to the regime where vacancies, as opposed to misaligned dimers, are the dominant mechanism for decorrelation, significantly extending the parameter regime under which the conjecture is known to hold. Our proof adapts the strategy of Hadas and Peled (2025) for proving the existence of a columnar phase in the hard-square model, combining a mesoscopic characterization of orientational order with the disagreement percolation method of van den Berg (1993) to prove the absence of translational order. To deal with the non-nearest neighbor interactions in the model, we also introduce an extension of the chessboard estimate applicable to finite products of periodic Gibbs measures.</description>

      <title>The Universal Property of Measure-Theoretic Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on work of Chen, we give a universal property of the Markov category BorelStoch of standard Borel spaces and Markov kernels between them. To do this, we introduce a new notion of *coinflip*, or unbiased binary choice, in a Markov category. These are unique if they exist, and automatically preserved by all Markov functors which preserve coproducts. We also provide universal characterizations of various Markov categories of discrete kernels.</description>
