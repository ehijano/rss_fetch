      <title>A3T-GCN for FTSE100 Components Price Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the predictive power of a novel hybrid A3T-GCN architecture for forecasting closing stock prices of FTSE100 constituents. The dataset comprises 79 companies and 375,329 daily observations from 2007 to 2024, with node features including technical indicators (RSI, MACD), normalized and log returns, and annualized log returns over multiple windows (ALR1W, ALR2W, ALR1M, ALR2M). Graphs are constructed based on sector classifications and correlations of returns or financial ratios. Our results show that the A3T-GCN model using annualized log-returns and shorter sequence lengths improves prediction accuracy while reducing computational requirements. Additionally, longer historical sequences yield only modest improvements, highlighting their importance for longer-term forecasts.</description>

      <title>Factors Influencing Cryptocurrency Prices: Evidence from Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, Litecoin, and Monero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines factors that influence prices of most common five cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, Litecoin, and Monero over 2010-2018 using weekly data. The study employs ARDL technique and documents several findings. First, cryptomarket-related factors such as market beta, trading volume, and volatility appear to be significant determinant for all five cryptocurrencies both in short- and long-run. Second, attractiveness of cryptocurrencies also matters in terms of their price determination, but only in long-run. This indicates that formation (recognition) of the attractiveness of cryptocurrencies are subjected to time factor. In other words, it travels slowly within the market. Third, SP500 index seems to have weak positive long-run impact on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litcoin, while its sign turns to negative losing significance in short-run, except Bitcoin that generates an estimate of -0.20 at 10% significance level. Lastly, error-correction models for Bitcoin, Etherem, Dash, Litcoin, and Monero show that cointegrated series cannot drift too far apart, and converge to a long-run equilibrium at a speed of 23.68%, 12.76%, 10.20%, 22.91%, and 14.27% respectively.</description>

      <title>Signature approach for pricing and hedging path-dependent options with frictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel signature approach for pricing and hedging path-dependent options with instantaneous and permanent market impact under a mean-quadratic variation criterion. Leveraging the expressive power of signatures, we recast an inherently nonlinear and non-Markovian stochastic control problem into a tractable form, yielding hedging strategies in (possibly infinite) linear feedback form in the time-augmented signature of the control variables, with coefficients characterized by non-standard infinite-dimensional Riccati equations on the extended tensor algebra. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these signature-based strategies for pricing and hedging general path-dependent payoffs in the presence of frictions. In particular, market impact naturally smooths optimal trading strategies, making low-truncated signature approximations highly accurate and robust in frictional markets, contrary to the frictionless case.</description>
