      <title>A holographic global uniqueness in passive imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a radiation solution $\psi$ for the Helmholtz equation in an exterior region in $\mathbb R^3$. We show that the restriction of $\psi$ to any ray $L$ in the exterior region is uniquely determined by its imaginary part $\Im\psi$ on an interval of this ray. As a corollary, the restriction of $\psi$ to any plane $X$ in the exterior region is uniquely determined by $\Im\psi$ on an open domain in this plane. These results have holographic prototypes in the recent work [Novikov, arXiv:2310.11127]. In particular, these and known results imply a holographic type global uniqueness in passive imaging and for the Gelfand-Krein-Levitan inverse problem in the monochromatic case. Some other surfaces for measurements instead of the planes $X$ are also considered.</description>

      <title>The jet problem for three-dimensional axisymmetric compressible subsonic flows with large vorticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the existence of three-dimensional axisymmetric compressible jet flows for steady Euler system with large vorticity by using the variational method. More precisely, for given axial velocity of the flow at the upstream, if the mass flux is sufficiently large, we can find a unique outer pressure such that a smooth subsonic three-dimensional axisymmetric jet flow with large vorticity exists and has certain far fields behavior.</description>

      <title>Suppression of blow-up in Patlak-Keller-Segel system coupled with linearized Navier-Stokes equations via the 3D Couette flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that finite-time blow-up in the 3D Patlak-Keller-Segel system may occur for arbitrarily small values of the initial mass. It's interesting whether one can prevent the finite-time blow-up via the stabilizing effect of the moving fluid. Consider the three-dimensional Patlak-Keller-Segel system coupled with the linearized Navier-Stokes equations near the Couette flow $(\ Ay, 0, 0 \ )$ in a finite channel $\mathbb{T}\times\mathbb{I}\times\mathbb{T}$ with $ \mathbb{T}=[0,2\pi) $ and $ \mathbb{I}=[-1,1] $, with the non-slip boundary condition, and we show that if the shear flow is sufficiently strong (A is large enough), then the solutions to Patlak-Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes system are global in time as long as the initial cell mass is sufficiently small (for example, $M&lt;\frac49$) and $ A\left(\|u_{2,0}(0)\|_{L^{2}}+\|u_{3,0}(0)\|_{L^{2}} \right)\leq C_{0} $, which seems to be the first result of considering the suppression effect of Couette flow in the 3D Patlak-Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes model, and also the first time considering the non-slip boundary condition.</description>

      <title>Diffusive Limit of the Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann System without Angular Cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusive limit of the non-cutoff Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann system in perturbation framework still remains open. By employing a new weight function and making full use of the anisotropic dissipation property of the non-cutoff linearized Boltzmann operator, we solve this problem with some novel treatments for non-cutoff potentials $\gamma &gt; \max\{-3, -\frac{3}{2}-2s\}$, including both strong angular singularity $\frac{1}{2} \leq s &lt;1$ and weak angular singularity $0 &lt; s &lt; \frac{1}{2}$. Uniform estimate with respect to the Knudsen number $\varepsilon\in (0,1]$ is established globally in time, which eventually leads to the global existence of solutions to the non-cutoff Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann system as well as hydrodynamic limit to the two-fluid incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier-Maxwell system with Ohm's law. The indicators $\gamma &gt; \max\{-3, -\frac{3}{2}-2s\}$ and $0 &lt; s &lt;1$ in this paper cover all ranges that can be achieved by the previously established global solutions to the non-cutoff Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann system in perturbation framework.</description>

      <title>Limiting Korn-Maxwell-Sobolev inequalities for general incompatibilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give sharp conditions for the limiting Korn-Maxwell-Sobolev inequalities \begin{align*}
  \lVert P\rVert_{{\dot{W}}{^{k-1,\frac{n}{n-1}}}(\mathbb{R}^n)}\le c\big(\lVert\mathscr{A}[P]\rVert_{{\dot{W}}{^{k-1,\frac{n}{n-1}}}(\mathbb{R}^n)}+\lVert\mathbb{B}P\rVert_{L^{1}(\mathbb{R}^n)}\big)
  \end{align*} to hold for all $P\in C_{c}^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{n};V)$, where $\mathscr{A}$ is a linear map between finite dimensional vector spaces and $\mathbb{B}$ is a $k$-th order, linear and homogeneous constant-coefficient differential operator. By the appearance of the $L^{1}$-norm of the differential expression $\mathbb{B}P$ on the right-hand side, such inequalities generalise previously known estimates to the borderline case $p=1$, and thereby answer an open problem due to M\"{u}ller, Neff and the second author (Calc. Var. PDE, 2021) in the affirmative.</description>

      <title>Remarks on the uniqueness of weak solutions of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article studies the uniqueness of the weak solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations in the 3-dimensional case. Here, the investigation is provided using two different approaches. The first (the main) result is obtained for given functions possessing a certain smoothness using the new approach. The second result is without the complementary conditions but is, in some sense, the "local" result investigated by another approach. In addition, here the solvability and uniqueness of the weak solutions to auxiliary problems lead out from the main problem are investigated.</description>

      <title>The free boundary for semilinear problems with highly oscillating singular terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate general semilinear (obstacle-like) problems of the form $\Delta u = f(u)$, where $f(u)$ has a singularity/jump at $\{u=0\}$ giving rise to a free boundary. Unlike many works on such equations where $f$ is approximately homogeneous near $u = 0$, we work under assumptions allowing for highly oscillatory behavior.
  We establish the $C^\infty$ regularity of the free boundary $\partial \{u&gt;0\}$ at flat points. Our approach is to first establish that flat free boundaries are Lipschitz, using a comparison argument with the Kelvin transform. For higher regularity, we study the highly degenerate PDE satisfied by ratios of derivatives of $u$, using changes of variable and then the hodograph transform. Along the way, we prove and make use of new Caffarelli-Peral type $W^{1, p}$ estimates for such degenerate equations. Much of our approach appears new even in the case of Alt-Phillips and classical obstacle problems.</description>

      <title>Local Rigidity of the Couette Flow for the Stationary Triple-Deck Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Triple-Deck equations are a classical boundary layer model which describes the asymptotics of a viscous flow near the separation point, and the Couette flow is an exact stationary solution to the Triple-Deck equations. In this paper we prove the local rigidity of the Couette flow in the sense that there are no other stationary solutions near the Couette flow in a scale invariant space. This provides a stark contrast to the well-studied stationary Prandtl counterpart, and in particular offers a first result towards the rigidity question raised by R. E. Meyer in 1983.</description>

      <title>An optimal design problem for a charge qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a simple variational model describing the ground state of a superconducting charge qubit. The model gives rise to a shape optimization problem that aims at maximizing the number of qubit states at a given gating voltage. We show that for small values of the charge optimal shapes exist and are $C^{2,\alpha}$-nearly spherical sets. In contrast, for large values of the charge the optimal shape does not exist, with the energy favoring disjoint collections of sets.</description>

      <title>Local theory of wave equations with timelike curves of conic singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general theory for the existence, uniqueness, and higher regularity of solutions to wave-type equations on Lorentzian manifolds with timelike curves of cone-type singularities. These singularities may be of geometric type (cone points with time-dependent cross sectional metric), of analytic type (such as asymptotically inverse square singularities or first order asymptotically scaling-critical singular terms), or any combination thereof. We can treat tensorial equations without any symmetry assumptions; we only require a condition of mode stability type for the stationary model operators defined at each point along the curve of cone points. In symmetric ultrastatic settings, we recover the solvability theory given by the functional calculus for the Friedrichs extension.</description>

      <title>Deformable porous media with degenerate hysteresis in gravity field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hysteresis in the pressure-saturation relation in unsaturated porous media, which is due to surface tension on the liquid-gas interface, exhibits strong degeneracy in the resulting mass balance equation. Solutions to such degenerate equations have been recently constructed by the method of convexification even if the permeability coefficient depends on the hysteretic saturation. The model is extended here to the case that the solid matrix material is viscoelastic and that the system is coupled with a gravity driven moisture flux. The existence of a solution is proved by compact anisotropic embedding involving Orlicz spaces with respect to the time variable.</description>

Abstract: We study fully nonlinear elliptic equations on Hermitian manifolds through blow-up argument and partial uniform ellipticity. We apply our results to draw geometric conclusions on finding conformal Hermitian metrics with prescribed Chern-Ricci curvature functions. By some obstruction from geometric function theory, our assumptions are almost sharp.</description>

      <title>The well-posedness and blow up phenomenon for a Tsunamis model with time-fractional derivative</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the well-posedness of a time-fractional shallow-water equations, which has received little attention. In the realm of fractional calculus, numerous types of fractional derivatives have been explored in the literature. Among these, one of the most notable and well-structured ones is the conformable fractional derivative. In this paper, we delve into the local well-posedness of the fractional tsunami shallow-water mathematical model in the critical Besov space $B^{\frac{3}{2}}_{2,1}$. Under some symmetric and sign conditions, we show that the strong solution will blow up in finite time.</description>

      <title>Nearly self-similar blowup of generalized axisymmetric Navier-Stokes and Boussinesq equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform numerical investigation of nearly self-similar blowup of generalized axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations and Boussinesq system with a time-dependent fractional dimension. The dynamic change of the space dimension is proportional to the ratio R(t)/Z(t), where (R(t),Z(t)) is the position at which the maximum vorticity achieves its global maximum. This choice of space dimension is to ensure that the advection along the r-direction has the same scaling as that along the z-direction, thus preventing formation of two-scale solution structure. For the generalized axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations with solution dependent viscosity, we show that the solution develops a self-similar blowup with dimension equal to 3.188 and the self-similar profile satisfies the axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations with constant viscosity. We also study the nearly self-similar blowup of the axisymmetric Boussinesq system with constant viscosity. The generalized axisymmetric Boussinesq system preserves almost all the known properties of the 3D Navier-Stokes equations except for the conservation of angular momentum. We present convincing numerical evidence that the generalized axisymmetric Boussinesq system develops a stable nearly self-similar blowup solution with maximum vorticity increased by O(10^{30}).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a particle method for numerically solving the Landau equation, inspired by the score-based transport modeling (SBTM) method for the Fokker-Planck equation. This method can preserve some important physical properties of the Landau equation, such as the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, and decay of estimated entropy. We prove that matching the gradient of the logarithm of the approximate solution is enough to recover the true solution to the Landau equation with Maxwellian molecules. Several numerical experiments in low and moderately high dimensions are performed, with particular emphasis on comparing the proposed method with the traditional particle or blob method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study trace ideal properties of the commutators $[(-\Delta)^{\frac{\epsilon}{2}},M_f]$ of a power of the Laplacian with the multiplication operator by a function $f$ on $\mathbb R^d$. For a certain range of $\epsilon\in\mathbb R$, we show that this commutator belongs to the weak Schatten class $\mathcal L_{\frac d{1-\epsilon},\infty}$ if and only if the distributional gradient of $f$ belongs to $L_{\frac d{1-\epsilon}}$. Moreover, in this case we determine the asymptotics of the singular values. Our proofs use, among other things, the tool of Double Operator Integrals.</description>

Abstract: We consider an optimal control problem where the state is governed by a free boundary problem called the two-phase membrane problem and the control appears in the coefficients of the characteristic function of the positivity and negativity parts of the solution. Our investigation focuses on various properties associated with the control-to-state map. Due to the non-differentiability of this map, we regularize the state equation. The existence, uniqueness, and characterization of the optimal pairs are established.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we define spaces of measures $DS_\beta(\mathbb{R}^d)$ with dimensional stability $\beta \in (0,d)$. These spaces bridge between $M_b(\mathbb{R}^d)$, the space of finite Radon measures, and $DS_d(\mathbb{R}^d)= \mathrm{H}^1(\mathbb{R}^d)$, the real Hardy space. We show the spaces $DS_\beta(\mathbb{R}^d)$ support Sobolev inequalities for $\beta \in (0,d]$, while for any $\beta \in [0,d]$ we show that the lower Hausdorff dimension of an element of $DS_\beta(\mathbb{R}^d)$ is at least $\beta$.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group and elliptic homogenization in high contrast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a quantitative estimate on the homogenization length scale in terms of the ellipticity ratio $\Lambda/\lambda$ of the coefficient field. This upper bound is applicable to high contrast elliptic equations demonstrating near-critical behavior. Specifically, we show that, given a suitable decay of correlation, the length scale at which homogenization is observed is at most $\exp(C \log^3(1+\Lambda/\lambda))$. The proof introduces the new concept of coarse-grained ellipticity, which measures the effective ellipticity ratio of the equation -- and thus the strength of the disorder -- after integrating out smaller scales. By a direct analytic argument, we obtain an approximate differential inequality for this coarse-grained ellipticity as a function of the length scale. This approach can be interpreted as a rigorous renormalization group argument, and provides a quantitative framework for homogenization that can be iteratively applied across an arbitrary number of length scales.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on a mathematical model for water flow in porous media with competition between transport and diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The contribution deals with the mathematical modelling of fluid flow in porous media, in particular water flow in soils. The motivation is to describe the competition between gravity and capillarity, or, in other words, between transport and diffusion. The analysis is based on a mathematical model developed by B. Detmann, C. Gavioli, and P. Krej\v{c}\'i, in which the effects of gravity are included in a novel way. The model consists of a nonlinear partial differential equation describing both the gravitational transport and the capillary diffusion of water. Although analytical solutions can be obtained for some special cases, only numerical solutions are available in more general situations. The solving algorithm is based on a time discretisation and the finite element method, and is written in Matlab. The results of the numerical simulations are shown and the behaviour of the model is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a partial regularity result for solutions of parabolic systems with general $\varphi$-growth, where $\varphi$ is an Orlicz function. In this setting we can develop a unified approach that is independent of the degeneracy of system and relies on two caloric approximation results: the $\varphi$-caloric approximation, which was introduced in Diening, Schwarzacher, Stroffolini and Verde (2017) (arXiv:1606.01706), and an improved version of the \mathcal{A}-caloric approximation, which we prove without using the classical compactness method.</description>

      <title>Quantitative convergence in relative entropy for a moderately interacting particle system on $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article shows how to combine the relative entropy method by D. Bresch, P.-E. Jabin, and Z. Wang in arXiv:1706.09564, arXiv:1906.04093 and the regularized $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$-estimate by Oelschl\"ager (Probability theory and related fields, 1987) to prove a strong propagation of chaos result for the viscous porous medium equation from a moderately interacting particle system in $L^\infty(0,T; L^1(\mathbb{R}^d))$-norm. In the moderate interacting setting, the interacting potential is a smoothed Dirac Delta distribution, however, current results regarding the relative entropy methods for singular potentials do not apply. The result holds on $\mathbb{R}^d$ for any dimension $d\geq 1$ and provides a quantitative result where the rate of convergence depends on the moderate scaling parameter and the dimension $d\geq 1$. Additionally, the presented method can be adapted for moderately interacting systems for which a certain convergence probability holds -- thus a propagation of chaos result in relative entropy can be obtained for kernels approximating Coulomb potentials.</description>

      <title>A viscoelastic model for skin via homogenization theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carry out the homogenization of a fluid-structure interaction problem consisting in the periodic inclusions of a viscous fluid in an elastic body. We get a macrostructure model where the body behaves as a viscoelastic material with a long-range memory term. Our aim is not only to get this limit problem but also to study its main properties. Using the micro-structure variables it is simple to check that it satisfies an energy conservation law assuring in particular the existence and uniqueness of solution. The difficulty is to characterize these properties using only the macroscopic system. We prove that the nonlocal term is given through a convolution kernel which exponentially decreases to zero and satisfies some positive conditions which we write in terms of the Laplace transform. These conditions can be used to directly prove the existence and uniqueness of solution. The results apply to modeling the mechanical behavior of skin as an indicator of what kind of models we should use. In a naive interpretation the fluid inclusions represent the cells and the elastic medium the extracellular matrix.</description>

      <title>On the orbital stability of solitary waves for the fourth order nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present new results regarding the orbital stability of solitary standing waves for the general fourth-order Schr\"odinger equation with mixed dispersion. The existence of solitary waves can be determined both as minimizers of a constrained complex functional and by using a numerical approach. In addition, for specific values of the frequency associated with the standing wave, one obtains explicit solutions with a hyperbolic secant profile. Despite these explicit solutions being minimizers of the constrained functional, they cannot be seen as a smooth curve of solitary waves, and this fact prevents their determination of stability using classical approaches in the current literature. To overcome this difficulty, we employ a numerical approach to construct a smooth curve of solitary waves. The existence of a smooth curve is useful for showing the existence of a threshold power $\alpha_0\approx 4.8$ of the nonlinear term such that if $\alpha\in (0,\alpha_0),$ the explicit solitary wave is stable, and if $\alpha&gt;\alpha_0$, the wave is unstable. An important feature of our work, caused by the presence of the mixed dispersion term, concerns the fact that the threshold value $\alpha_0 \approx 4.8$ is not the same as that established for proving the existence of global solutions in the energy space, as is well known for the classical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the validity of boundary layer expansions for the MHD system in a rectangle. We describe the solution up to the third order when the tangential magnetic field is much smaller or much larger than the tangential velocity field, thereby extending a previous work of S.J.

      <description>arXiv:2308.14506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript we consider optimal control problems of stochastic differential equations with delays in the state and in the control. First, we prove an equivalent Markovian reformulation on Hilbert spaces of the state equation. Then, using the dynamic programming approach for infinite-dimensional systems, we prove that the value function is the unique viscosity solution of the infinite-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. We apply these results to problems coming from economics: stochastic optimal advertising problems and stochastic optimal investment problems with time-to-build.</description>

      <title>A flow approach to the generalized KPZ equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03101v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the flow approach of Duch [Duc21] can be adapted to prove local well-posedness for the generalised KPZ equation. The key step is to extend the flow approach so that it can accommodate semilinear equations involving smooth functions of the solution instead of only polynomials - this is accomplished by introducing coordinates for the flow built out of the elementary differentials associated to the equation.</description>

      <title>An algebraic-geometric construction of "lump" solutions of the KP1 equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we show how certain everywhere-regular real rational function solutions of the KP1 equation ("multi-lumps") can be constructed via the polynomial analogs of theta functions from singular rational curves with cusps. We use two methods, one direct and the other producing a degeneration of the well-understood soliton solutions from nodal singular curves. The second approach can be seen as a variation on the long-wave limit technique of Ablowitz and Satsuma, as developed by Zhang, Yang, Li, Guo, and Stepanyants. We present an explicit example of a three-lump solution constructed via the polynomial analog of the theta function from a rational curve with two cuspidal singular points, each with semigroup $\langle 2,5\rangle$. (In the theory of curve singularities, these are known as $A_4$ double points.) We conjecture that these ideas will generalize to give similar $M$-lump solutions with $M = \frac{N(N+1)}{2}$ for $N &gt; 2$ starting from rational curves with two singular points with semigroup $\langle 2,2N+1\rangle$ ($A_{2N}$ double points). We also show a five-lump solution obtained from a curve with two cusps with semigroup $\langle 3,4\rangle$. Similar solutions have been constructed by other methods previously; our contribution is to show how they arise from the algebraic-geometric setting by considering singular curves with several cusps, as in previous work of Agostini, Celik, and Little.</description>
