      <title>Classical timing noise in gravity-mediated entanglement tests: LOCC structure, metrological bounds, and visibility thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Table-top proposals to test gravity-mediated entanglement aim to distinguish coherent gravitational interactions from classical dephasing processes that generate identical phases on both interferometers. A particularly important contribution is platform-invariant timing noise, which can be accessed through optical-clock cross-spectra and frequency-transfer links. In this work we (i) derive the mapping from clock cross-spectra to an effective common-mode dephasing rate, (ii) show that the corresponding dynamical channel is LOCC and therefore unable to generate entanglement, and (iii) combine published clock and interferometer noise floors to obtain quantitative bounds on the ratio between common-mode and local dephasing rates in representative gravity-entanglement proposals. Across QGEM-, MAQRO-, and levitated-nanoparticle regimes we find a robust hierarchy $\gamma_{\rm com}/\gamma_{\rm loc}\sim10^{-9}$--$10^{-11}$, identifying platform-invariant timing noise as a negligible but calibratable background. We further derive visibility and Bell--CHSH thresholds in the presence of both common-mode and local dephasing, and illustrate the full calibration workflow with a simple synthetic example anchored to state-of-the-art clock metrology. Extended derivations and statistical tools are provided in the Supplemental Material.</description>

      <title>Exponential parallelism in practice: a comparative feature on quantum computing and instantaneous noise-based logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exponential parallelism, a defining principle of advanced computational systems, holds promise for transformative impacts across several scientific and industrial domains. This feature paper provides a comparative overview of Quantum Computing (QC) and Instantaneous Noise-based Logic (INBL), focusing on their practical strengths, limitations, and applications rather than exhaustive technical depth. Both paradigms leverage exponentially large Hilbert spaces: quantum computing achieves this via quantum superposition, while INBL realizes it through the product space of classical noise processes. Quantum computers attain universality for all computational operations, whereas current INBL frameworks are universal only for Boolean logic; notably, essential superposition operations-such as AND and OR gates-are absent, precluding implementations of algorithms like Shor's. However, for certain problem classes where full universality is not required, INBL and quantum computing can offer equivalent time and hardware complexity, as observed with the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. Remarkably, for search tasks such as phonebook lookup, Grover's quantum algorithm provides a quadratic O(n^0.5) speedup compared to the classical approach, while INBL achieves an exponential speedup, requiring only logarithmic time in the size n of the phonebook O(log n). Such INBL algorithms could, in principle, be adapted to quantum hardware to attain similar performance. Importantly, INBL hardware is considerably simpler, being implementable with modest modifications to conventional PC architectures equipped with a true random number generator, and it inherently avoids the decoherence and error correction challenges of quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Manifold Learning for Source Separation in Confusion-Limited Gravitational-Wave Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will observe gravitational waves in a regime that differs sharply from what ground-based detectors such as LIGO handle. Instead of searching for rare signals buried in loud instrumental noise, LISA's main challenge is that its data stream contains millions of unresolved galactic binaries. These blend into a confusion background, and the task becomes identifying sources that stand out from that signal population. We explore whether manifold-learning tools can help with this separation problem. We built a CNN autoencoder trained on the confusion background and used its reconstruction error, while also taking advantage of geometric structure in the latent space by adding a manifold-based normalization term to the anomaly score. The model was trained on synthetic LISA data with instrumental noise and confusion background, and tested on datasets with injected resolvable sources such as massive black hole binaries, extreme mass ratio inspirals, and individual galactic binaries. A grid search over $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in the combined score $\alpha \cdot \mathrm{AE}_{\mathrm{error}} + \beta \cdot \mathrm{manifold}_{\mathrm{norm}}$ found optimal performance near $\alpha = 0.5$ and $\beta = 2.0$, indicating that latent-space geometry provides more discriminatory information than reconstruction error alone. With this combination, the method achieves an AUC of $0.752$, precision $0.81$, and recall $0.61$, a $35\%$ improvement over the autoencoder alone. These results suggest that manifold-learning techniques could complement LISA data-analysis pipelines in identifying resolvable sources within confusion-limited data.</description>

      <title>Antisymmetric Mueller Generator as the Universal Origin of Geometric Phase in Classical Polarization and Quantum Two-Level Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the antisymmetric part of the Mueller matrix of any ideal retarder uniquely determines the geometric phase observed in classical polarization optics. This antisymmetric block encodes the angular-velocity pseudovector that governs the tangential component of the Stokesvector motion on the Poincar\'e sphere and thus fully determines the associated geometric phase, while the symmetric block is geometrically neutral in the sense that it does not contribute to the phase. We further demonstrate that the same antisymmetric generator arises in the adjoint action of any SU(2) unitary operator and fully determines the geometric phase of a qubit, independently of adiabaticity or cyclicity. This identifies a single algebraic structure underlying geometric phases in both classical and quantum two-level systems and provides an operational criterion for isolating geometric-phase contributions either directly from measured Mueller matrices (classical case) or from the adjoint action reconstructed by qubit process tomography</description>

      <title>Spectral evidence from global geomagnetic calibration for stellar-system resonances constraining both quantum physics and geophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02578v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1984, Clarke expanded the domain of observed quantum phenomena from the microscopic regimes of atoms and electrons (10^1-10^3 particles) to macroscopic superconducting circuits exhibiting quantum coherence (10^9-10^12). I show the coherent quantum behavior persists at scales far beyond atoms and circuits: in Earth's (10^51) resonant geophysical cycles, manifesting astro-macroscopic time-crystalline behavior. Thus, based on arguably the most accurate and precise spectral analysis of the most accurate global geomagnetism calibration (CKGPTS95), macroscopic and microscopic phenomena are interconnected through gravitational resonance networks across the cosmos, annulling conventional views of quantum invariance. The analyses unveiled a planet-dominating 9.35-My fundamental cycle arising from Earth's orbital and stellar gravitational influences, which resonantly governs long-term geomagnetic reversals, planetary growth, stratigraphic anomalies that mimic periodic mass extinctions, and the Great Unconformity. The resonances exhibit non-geophysical features of quantum coherence classically confined to microscopic systems, such as time crystals: discrete time-translation symmetry, fractional harmonic locking, and many-body entrainment. Given the ubiquity of the tidal phenomenon, a resonance-based framework exists in which large-scale celestial dynamics calibrate quantum analogously to how extragalactic dynamics calibrate stellar - thereby constraining particle masses, coupling constants, and universal parameters. This data-driven proof completes my 2006 theoretical derivation of G (and thus gravity) from c at both quantum and everyday scales, and confirms the Hyperresonance Unifying Theory, which unified those domains using only high-school algebra arXiv:0801.0876.</description>

      <title>New entropy, thermodynamics of apparent horizon and cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12165v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we consider new nonadditive entropy of the apparent horizon $S_K=S_{BH}/(1+\gamma S_{BH})$ with $S_{BH}$ being the Bekenstein--Hawking entropy. This is an alternative of the R\'{e}nyi and Tsallis entropies, that allows us, by utilising the holographic principle, to develop entropic (holographic) dark energy. When $\gamma\rightarrow 0$ our entropy becomes the Bekenstein--Hawking entropy $S_{BH}$. The generalized Friedmann equations for Friedmann--Lema\^{i}tre--Robertson--Walker (FLRW) spacetime for the barotropic matter fluid with $p=w\rho$ were obtained. We compute the dark energy pressure $p_D$, density of energy $\rho_D$, the normalized density parameters $\Omega_D$, $\Omega_{m}$ and the deceleration parameter $q$ of the universe corresponding to our model. From the second modified Friedmann equation a dynamical cosmological constant was obtained. We show that at some model parameters $w$ and $\gamma$ we obtain $\Omega_{m0}\approx 0.315$ and $q_0\approx -0.535$ which are in agreement with the Planck data. \cite{Aghanim}. It was shown that the model under consideration possesses the phantom divide for the EoS of dark energy. Thus, our model, by virtue of the holographic principle, can describe the universe inflation and the late time of the universe acceleration. It is shown that entropic cosmology with our entropy proposed is equivalent to cosmology based on the teleparallel gravity with the function $F(T)$ obtained. The holographic dark energy model with the generalised entropy of the apparent horizon can be of interest for new cosmology.</description>

      <title>Universality of critical behaviors in the three-dimensional (3D) Ising magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article gives a brief overview on recent advances in experiments of critical exponents in three groups of magnetic materials. Revisiting experimental data verifies that a universality class with the critical exponents beta = 3/8, gamma = 5/4 and delta = 13/3 occurs in the three-dimensional (3D) Ising magnets, such as transition-metal intermetallics, rare-earth transition-metal compounds and manganites. Furthermore, the topological contributions to critical behaviors in the 3D Ising model are estimated by the difference between the exact solutions and the approximation values.</description>
