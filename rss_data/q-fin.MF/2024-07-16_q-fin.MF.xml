      <title>A nonparametric test for rough volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a nonparametric test for deciding whether volatility of an asset follows a standard semimartingale process, with paths of finite quadratic variation, or a rough process with paths of infinite quadratic variation. The test utilizes the fact that volatility is rough if and only if volatility increments are negatively autocorrelated at high frequencies. It is based on the sample autocovariance of increments of spot volatility estimates computed from high-frequency asset return data. By showing a feasible CLT for this statistic under the null hypothesis of semimartingale volatility paths, we construct a test with fixed asymptotic size and an asymptotic power equal to one. The test is derived under very general conditions for the data-generating process. In particular, it is robust to jumps with arbitrary activity and to the presence of market microstructure noise. In an application of the test to SPY high-frequency data, we find evidence for rough volatility.</description>

      <title>Option pricing in Sandwiched Volterra Volatility model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10688v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new model of financial market with stochastic volatility driven by an arbitrary H\"older continuous Gaussian Volterra process. The distinguishing feature of the model is the form of the volatility equation which ensures the solution to be ``sandwiched'' between two arbitrary H\"older continuous functions chosen in advance. We discuss the structure of local martingale measures on this market, investigate integrability and Malliavin differentiability of prices and volatilities as well as study absolute continuity of the corresponding probability laws. Additionally, we utilize Malliavin calculus to develop an algorithm of pricing options with discontinuous payoffs.</description>

      <title>Sandwiched Volterra Volatility model: Markovian approximations and hedging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider stochastic volatility dynamics driven by a general H\"older continuous Volterra-type noise and with unbounded drift. For these so-called SVV-models, we consider the explicit computation of quadratic hedging strategies. While the theoretical hedge is well-known in terms of the non-anticipating derivative for all square integrable claims, the fact that these models are typically non-Markovian provides is a challenge in the direct computation of conditional expectations at the core of the explicit hedging strategy. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a Markovian approximation of the model which stems from an adequate approximation of the kernel in the Volterra noise. We study the approximation of the volatility, of the prices and of the optimal mean-square hedge. We provide the corresponding error estimates. The work is completed with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Optimal Investment with Herd Behaviour Using Rational Decision Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the optimal investment problem considering the herd behaviour between two agents, including one leading expert and one following agent whose decisions are influenced by those of the leading expert. In the objective functional of the optimal investment problem, we introduce the average deviation term to measure the distance between the two agents' decisions and use the variational method to find its analytical solution. To theoretically analyze the impact of the following agent's herd behaviour on his/her decision, we decompose his/her optimal decision into a convex linear combination of the two agents' rational decisions, which we call the rational decision decomposition. Furthermore, we define the weight function in the rational decision decomposition as the following agent's investment opinion to measure the preference of his/her own rational decision over that of the leading expert. We use the investment opinion to quantitatively analyze the impact of the herd behaviour, the following agent's initial wealth, the excess return, and the volatility of the risky asset on the optimal decision. We validate our analyses through numerical experiments on real stock data. This study is crucial to understanding investors' herd behaviour in decision-making and designing effective mechanisms to guide their decisions.</description>
