      <title>Once more about radiation from uniformly accelerating charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an electric charge uniformly accelerating along $x$ direction and moving with constant velocity along $y$ direction. We show that in the co-accelerating along $x$ direction Rinder's frame this charge creates non-zero Poynting vector, which, however, does not lead to a non-vanishing flux through an infinitely distant surface. Furthermore, we show that in the laboratory Minkowski frame such a charge creates a stress energy flux that does not vanish at infinity. We interpret these observations as that while the Rindler's frame corresponds to the static zone around the charge, the Minkowski frame does contain the wave zone. We give detailed calculations and explanations concluding that uniformly accelerating charge does radiate</description>

      <title>Characteristics of Rayleigh Waves in Nonlocal Porous Orthotropic Thermoelastic Layer with Diffusion Under Three-Phase-Lag Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article delves into the intricate dynamics of Rayleigh wave propagation within a nonlocal orthotropic medium, where the presence of void and diffusion adds an intriguing layer to the analysis. Grounded in Eringen nonlocal elasticity theory and embracing the three-phase-lag model of hyperbolic thermoelasticity, the study focuses on the interplay between the mass diffusion principles of Fick and the Fourier law under the framework of hyperbolic thermoelasticity. The investigation employs a methodological approach centered around normal mode analysis to navigate the complexities of the problem at hand. The derived frequency equation governing Rayleigh waves undergoes meticulous scrutiny through the exploration of specific cases. The elliptical trajectory of surface particles and its eccentricity during Rayleigh wave propagation are identified and calculated.</description>

      <title>Numerical search for three-body periodic free-fall orbits with central symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A specialized high-precision numerical search for equal-mass collisionless three-body periodic free-fall orbits with central symmetry is conducted. The search is based on Newton's method with initial approximations obtained by the grid-search method. Instead of solving the standard periodicity equation on the entire period a quarter-period equation that also characterizes the periodic orbits is solved. The number of the known orbits from the class is significantly enlarged. The linear stability of the orbits is also investigated. All of them are unstable. A discussion in relation to the efficiency of Newton's method applied with grid-search initial approximations is held.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Motion of a Charged Rigid Body under the Influence of a Gyrostatic Torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research investigates the rotational dynamics of a charged axisymmetric spinning rigid body influenced by gyrostatic torque. The study also accounts for the effects of transverse and constant body-fixed torques and an electromagnetic force field. Euler's equations of motion are employed to formulate the governing equations for the system. Given the absence of torque along the spin axis and the nearly symmetric structure of the rigid body, the spin rate remains almost constant. By assuming small angular deviations of the spin axis from a fixed spatial direction, approximate analytical solutions in closed form are derived for the attitude, translational, and rotational motions. These solutions, expressed in a compact complex form, provide an effective tool for analyzing the maneuvers of rigid bodies spinning. The study derives analytical solutions for several variables, including angular velocities, Euler angles, transverse and axial displacements, and velocities. Graphical simulations of the solutions demonstrate their accuracy, while additional graphs illustrate the positive effects of varying body parameters on the motion. This work is significant in diverse scientific and engineering fields, offering insights that enhance the design of mechanical systems, explain celestial dynamics, and improve spacecraft performance.</description>

      <title>The shooting methods to solve 3D nonlinear strings assemblies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents an alternative approach to finite elements for modeling and analyzing 3D static mooring lines using string theory and the shooting method (SM) to solve two-point boundary value problems (TPBVPs) for 3D nonlinear static string equations with various boundary condition (BC) types relevant to offshore slender system assemblies.The two-point boundary value problem for nonlinear extensible elastic strings was formulated by incorporating arbitrary 3D external distributed loads that are not restricted to gravity alone. The TPBVP was reformulated based on the formalism of the shooting method. A multi-body/multi-shooting approach is proposed to handle multi-material segments and line assemblies. A formulation of the boundary conditions that allows the modeling of Dirichlet, Robin, and mixed boundary conditions representing the displacement, force, and combined force/displacement constraints is presented.Four validation cases are presented, comparing the results to analytical solutions: (1) a single catenary segment with ball-prismatic joint boundary conditions under several imposed forces, (2) a review of all possible boundary conditions for strings, including spring-based BCs, (3) the Velaria problem with nonlinear radial distributed load, and (4) a three-segment hanging configuration with different material properties connected by a buoy.The results demonstrate an accuracy under 10-9 in terms of absolute errors for both positions and tensions along the entire length of the mooring lines. The proposed method also provides error control through adaptive step integration. It demonstrates high accuracy in modeling complex 3D kinematics and configurations for mooring lines, while limiting the iterative problem size.The proposed method provides an efficient alternative to discretization-based techniques for analyzing static configurations of string kinematics slender systems with various end constraints, such as mooring lines and hawsers assemblies in offshore engineering, while maintaining simplicity in approach and implementation.</description>

      <title>Brownian-motion approach to statistical mechanics: Langevin equations, fluctuations, and timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We briefly review the problem of Brownian motion and describe some intriguing facets. The problem is first treated in its original form as enunciated by Einstein, Langevin, and others. Then, utilizing the problem of Brownian motion as a paradigm and upon using the Langevin equation(s), we present a brief exposition of the modern areas of stochastic thermodynamics and fluctuation theorems in a manner accessible to a non-expert. This is followed by an analysis of non-Markovian Brownian dynamics via generalized Langevin equation(s) in which we particularly shed light onto its derivation, the emergence of the fluctuation-dissipation relation, and the recently-discovered effective-mass framework.</description>
