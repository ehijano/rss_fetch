      <title>The 10 October 2024 geomagnetic storm may have caused the premature reentry of a Starlink satellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short communication, we qualitatively analyze possible effects of the 10 October 2024 geomagnetic storm on accelerating the reentry of a Starlink satellite from low-Earth orbit (LEO). The storm took place near the maximum of solar cycle (SC) 25, which has shown to be more intense than SC24. Based on preliminary geomagnetic indices, the 10 October 2024, along with the 10 May 2024, were the most intense events since the well-known Halloween storms of October/November 2003. By looking at a preliminary version of the Dst index and two-line element (TLE) altitude data of the Starlink-1089 (SL1089) satellite, we observe a possible connection between storm main phase onset and a sharp decay of SL1089. The satellite was scheduled to reenter on 22 October, but it reentered on 12 October, 10 days before schedule. The sharp altitude decay of SL1089 revealed by TLE data coincides with the storm main phase onset. Therefore, we call for future research to establish the eventual causal relationship between storm occurrence and satellite orbital decay. As predicted by previous works, SC25 is already producing extreme geomagnetic storms with unprecedented satellite orbital drag effects and consequences for current megaconstellations in LEO.</description>

      <title>Electron-scale energy transfer due to lower hybrid waves during asymmetric reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission data to investigate electron-scale energy transfer due to lower hybrid drift waves during magnetopause reconnection. We analyze waves observed in an electron-scale plasma mixing layer at the edge of the magnetospheric outflow. Using high-resolution 7.5 ms electron moments, we obtain an electron current density with a Nyquist frequency of ~66 Hz, sufficient to resolve most of the lower hybrid drift wave power observed in the event. We then employ wavelet analysis to evaluate dJ.dE, which accounts for the phase differences between the fluctuating quantities. The analysis shows that the energy exchange is localized within the plasma mixing layer, and it is highly fluctuating, with energy bouncing between waves and electrons throughout the analyzed time and frequency range. However, the cumulative sum over time indicates a net energy transfer from the waves to electrons. We observe an anomalous electron flow toward the magnetosphere, consistent with diffusion and electron mixing. These results indicate that waves and electrons interact dynamically to dissipate the excess internal energy accumulated by sharp density gradients. We conclude that the electron temperature profile within the plasma mixing layer is produced by a combination of electron diffusion across the layer, as well as heating by large-scale parallel potential and lower hybrid drift waves.</description>

      <title>On The Influence Of The Solar Wind On The Propagation Of Earth-impacting Coronal Mass Ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are subject to changes in their direction of propagation, tilt, and other properties as they interact with the variable solar wind. We investigated the heliospheric propagation of 15 Earth-impacting CMEs observed during April 2010 to August 2018 in the field of view (FOV) of the Heliospheric Imager (HI) onboard the STEREO. About half of the 15 events followed self-similar expansion up to 40 $R_\odot$. The remaining events showed deflection either in latitude, longitude, or a tilt change. Only two events showed significant rotation in the HI1 FOV. We also use toroidal and cylindrical flux rope fitting on the in situ observations of interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and solar wind parameters to estimate the tilt at L1 for these two events. Although the sample size is small, this study suggests that CME rotation is not very common in the heliosphere. We attributed the observed deflections and rotations of CMEs to a combination of factors, including their interaction with the ambient solar wind and the influence of the ambient magnetic field. These findings contribute to our understanding of the complex dynamics involved in CME propagation and highlight the need for comprehensive modeling and observational studies to improve space weather prediction. In particular, HI observations help us to connect observations near the Sun and near Earth, improving our understanding of how CMEs move through the heliosphere.</description>

      <title>Generation of fast magnetoacoustic waves in the corona by impulsive bursty reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast-mode magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves in the solar corona are often known to be produced by solar flares and eruptive prominences. We here simulate the effect of the interaction of an external perturbation on a magnetic null in the solar corona which results in the formation of a current sheet (CS). Once the CS undergoes a sufficient extension in its length and squeezing of its width, it may go unstable to the formation of multiple impulsive plasmoids. Eventually, the plasmoids merge with one another to form larger plasmoids and/or are expelled from the sheet. The formation, motion and coalescence of plasmoids with each other and with magnetic Y-points at the outer periphery of the extended CS are found to generate wave-like perturbations. An analysis of the resultant quasi-periodic variations of pressure, density, velocity and magnetic field at certain locations in the model corona indicate that these waves are predominantly fast-mode magnetoacoustic waves. For typical coronal parameters, the resultant propagating waves carry an energy flux of $\mathrm{10^{5}~\mathrm{erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}}$ to a large distance of at least 60 Mm away from the current sheet. In general, we suggest that both waves and reconnection play a role in heating the solar atmosphere and driving the solar wind and may interact with one another in a manner that we refer to as a $"$Symbiosis of WAves and Reconnection (SWAR)$"$.</description>

      <title>Forecasting High-Speed Solar Wind Streams from Solar Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The solar wind, a stream of charged particles originating from the Sun and transcending interplanetary space, poses risks to technology and astronauts.In this work, we develop a prediction model to forecast the solar wind speed at the Earth. We focuse on high-speed streams (HSSs) and their solar source regions, coronal holes. As input, we use the coronal hole area, extracted from solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images and mapped on a fixed grid, as well as the solar wind speed 27 days before. We use a polynomial regression model and a distribution transformation to predict the solar wind speed with a lead time of four days. Our forecast achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 68.1 km/s for the solar wind speed prediction and an RMSE of 76.8 km/s for the HSS peak velocity prediction for 2010 to 2019. We also demonstrate the applicability of our model to the current solar cycle 25 in an operational setting, resulting in an RMSE of 80.3 km/s and an HSS peak velocity RMSE of 92.2 km/s. The study shows that a small number of physical features explains most of the solar wind variation, and that focusing on these features with simple machine learning algorithms even outperforms current approaches based on deep neural networks and MHD simulations. In addition, we explain why the typically used loss function, the mean squared error, systematically underestimates the HSS peak velocities, aggravates operational space weather forecasts, and how a distribution transformation can resolve this issue.</description>
