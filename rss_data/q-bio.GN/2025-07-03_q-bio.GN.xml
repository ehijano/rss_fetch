      <title>Genetic Features for Drug Responses in Cancer -- Investigating an Ensemble-Feature-Selection Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting drug responses using genetic and transcriptomic features is crucial for enhancing personalized medicine. In this study, we implemented an ensemble of machine learning algorithms to analyze the correlation between genetic and transcriptomic features of cancer cell lines and IC50 values, a reliable metric for drug efficacy. Our analysis involved a reduction of the feature set from an original pool of 38,977 features, demonstrating a strong linear relationship between genetic features and drug responses across various algorithms, including SVR, Linear Regression, and Ridge Regression. Notably, copy number variations (CNVs) emerged as more predictive than mutations, suggesting a significant reevaluation of biomarkers for drug response prediction. Through rigorous statistical methods, we identified a highly reduced set of 421 critical features. This set offers a novel perspective that contrasts with traditional cancer driver genes, underscoring the potential for these biomarkers in designing targeted therapies. Furthermore, our findings advocate for IC50 values as a predictable measurement of drug responses and underscore the need for more data that can represent the dimensionality of genomic data in drug response prediction. Future work will aim to expand the dataset and refine feature selection to enhance the generalizability of the predictive model in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>MARS: Processing-In-Memory Acceleration of Raw Signal Genome Analysis Inside the Storage Subsystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Raw signal genome analysis (RSGA) has emerged as a promising approach to enable real-time genome analysis by directly analyzing raw electrical signals. However, rapid advancements in sequencing technologies make it increasingly difficult for software-based RSGA to match the throughput of raw signal generation. This paper demonstrates that while hardware acceleration techniques can significantly accelerate RSGA, the high volume of genomic data shifts the performance and energy bottleneck from computation to I/O data movement. As sequencing throughput increases, I/O overhead becomes the main contributor to both runtime and energy consumption. Therefore, there is a need to design a high-performance, energy-efficient system for RSGA that can both alleviate the data movement bottleneck and provide large acceleration capabilities. We propose MARS, a storage-centric system that leverages the heterogeneous resources within modern storage systems (e.g., storage-internal DRAM, storage controller, flash chips) alongside their large storage capacity to tackle both data movement and computational overheads of RSGA in an area-efficient and low-cost manner. MARS accelerates RSGA through a novel hardware/software co-design approach. First, MARS modifies the RSGA pipeline via two filtering mechanisms and a quantization scheme, reducing hardware demands and optimizing for in-storage execution. Second, MARS accelerates the RSGA steps directly within the storage by leveraging both Processing-Near-Memory and Processing-Using-Memory paradigms. Third, MARS orchestrates the execution of all steps to fully exploit in-storage parallelism and minimize data movement. Our evaluation shows that MARS outperforms basecalling-based software and hardware-accelerated state-of-the-art read mapping pipelines by 93x and 40x, on average across different datasets, while reducing their energy consumption by 427x and 72x.</description>
