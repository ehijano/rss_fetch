      <title>Global existence of smooth solution to evolutionary Faddeev model with short-pulse data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the Cauchy problem of the evolutionary Faddeev model, a system that maps from the Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$ to the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$. The model is a system of nonlinear wave equations whose nonlinearities exhibit a null structure and include semilinear terms, quasilinear terms, and the unknowns themselves. By considering a class of large initial data (in energy norm) of the short pulse type, we prove that the evolutionary Faddeev model admits a globally smooth solution via energy estimates. The main result is achieved through the selection of appropriate multipliers that are specially adapted to the geometry of the system.</description>

      <title>Biharmonic non-linear Schr\"odinger equation with an unbounded inhomogeneous term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the analysis of a focusing nonlinear biharmonic Schr\"odinger equation in the presence of an unbounded growing up inhomogeneous term. The first main contribution of this work is the derivation of an inhomogeneous Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality adapted to the unbounded weight, which provides the necessary control over the nonlinear term in terms of Sobolev norms. Building on this inequality, we then investigate the long-time behavior of solutions and establish a sharp dichotomy: solutions with initial data below the ground state energy either exist globally in time or experience finite-time blow-up. A distinctive feature of our results is that the analysis of the unbounded inhomogeneous term requires the imposition of radial symmetry on the initial data, which allows us to exploit certain Strauss type Sobolev estimates that would not hold in the general non-radial case. This work complements previous studies on biharmonic Schr\"odinger equations with singular inhomogeneities, highlighting both the challenges and the new phenomena that arise when the nonlinearity is weighted by a growing up unbounded function, which broke the space translation invariance of the standard homogeneous associated equation.</description>

      <title>Cahn-Hilliard Equations on Lattices: Dynamic Transitions and Pattern Formations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article examines the dynamic phase transitions and pattern formations attributed to binary systems modeled by the Cahn-Hilliard equation. In particular, we consider a two-dimensional lattice structure and determine how different choices of the spanning vectors influence the resulting dynamical tramsitions and pattern formations. As the basic steady-state loses its linear stability, the binary system undergoes a dynamic transition which is shown to be characterized by both the geometry of the domain and the choice of physical parameters of the model. Unlike rectangular domains, we are able to observe the emergence of hexagonally-packed circles, as well as the familiar rolls and square structures. We begin with the decomposition of our function space into a stable and unstable eigenspace before calculating the center manifold that maps the former to the later. In analyzing the resulting reduced equations, we consider the different multiplicities that the critical eigenvalue can have, which is shown to be geometry-dependent. We briefly consider the long-range interaction model and determine that it produces similar results to the original model.</description>

      <title>A note on two Collatz evolution flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two evolution models based on the generalized Collatz operator are introduced. These models are characterized by coefficients $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in the Collatz dynamics, and are suitably defined. Here, $\alpha=\beta=1$, and $\alpha=3$, $\beta=1$ correspond to the Nollatz and classical Collatz operators, respectively. In general, the first evolution model is a continuum, Fourier side based, motivated by the Cubic Szeg\H{o} operator of G\'erard and Grellier. The second evolution considers discrete time derivatives of the Collatz orbits. In this paper we describe the evolution of both models, with particular emphasis on dynamical properties. For the first one, it is proved local and global existence in the space $L^2(\mathbb T)$, and a one-to-one characterization of the existence of nontrivial periodic and unbounded orbits of the Collatz mapping in terms of particular set of solutions of this continuous Collatz flow. For the discrete part, a sort of discrete energy is introduced. This energy has the property of being conserved by the discrete flow. An estimate of each term in this energy is given, proving suitable growth bounds. Finally, the meaning of the discrete time derivative for the generalized Collatz orbits is discussed. It is proved that, except for the Nollatz and Collatz operators, the sum of coefficients related to this discrete time derivative is an increasing sequence in $n$ as the iteration parameter $n$ evolves.</description>

      <title>Long-Time Dynamics of the Zakharov-Kuznetsov Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript presents the results of stabilization for the Zakharov--Kuznetsov equation, a two-dimensional Korteweg--de Vries-type equation. We provide rigorous proofs using two different approaches, showing that when a damping mechanism and an internal delay term (anti-damping) are introduced, the solutions of the Zakharov--Kuznetsov equation exhibit both local and global exponential stabilization properties. A significant contribution of our work is the determination of the optimal constant and the minimal time required to ensure exponential decay of the energy associated with this two-dimensional system.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory behavior of solutions to the critical Fujita equation in 6D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long time dynamics of solutions to the 6D energy critical heat equation
  $u_t=\Delta u+|u|^{p-1}u$ on $\R^6\times(0,\infty)$ is investigated.
  It is shown that
  there exists a radially symmetric global solution $u(x,t)\in C([0,\infty);\dot H^1(\R^6))$
  of the form
  \begin{align*}
  u(x,t)
  =
  \lambda(t)^{-\frac{n-2}{2}}
  {\sf Q}(\tfrac{x}{\lambda(t)})
  +
  \text{error}
  (x,t),
  \end{align*}
  where the function \( \lambda(t) \) satisfies:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
  $\dis\lim_{t\to\infty}\|\text{error}(\cdot,t)\|_{\dot H_x^1(\R^6)}=0$,
  \item
  $\dis\liminf_{t\to\infty}\lambda(t)=0$,
  \item
  $\dis\limsup_{t\to\infty}\lambda(t)=\infty$.
  \end{itemize}
  The solutions constructed here
  demonstrate that the dynamical behavior in
  \( \dot H^1(\mathbb{R}^n) \) can differ significantly
  from the behavior in \( H^1(\mathbb{R}^n) \).</description>

      <title>Stability of constant steady states of an attraction-repulsion chemotaxis system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cauchy problem for the attraction-repulsion chemotaxis system in the whole $n$-dimensional space has uncountable constant steady states. In the attraction chemotaxis system, each positive constant steady state is stable if it is in a certain region. On the other hand, in the repulsion chemotaxis system, every positive constant steady state is stable. Our main purpose of this paper is to give a suitable condition under which the attraction-repulsion chemotaxis system has also stable constant steady states.</description>

      <title>The nonlinear porous medium equation for the f-Laplacian: Hamilton-Souplet-Zhang type gradient estimates and implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents new gradient estimates for positive solutions to the nonlinear porous medium equation (NPME) in the context of smooth metric measure spaces. The diffusion operator here is the f-Laplacian and the gradient estimates of interest are mainly of Hamilton-Souplet-Zhang types. These estimates are established using a variety of methods and techniques and several implications, most notably, to parabolic Liouville-type results and characterisation of ancient solutions are given. The problem is posed in the general framework where the metric and potential evolve with time and the proofs make use of natural lower bounds on the time derivative of the metric and the Bakry-\'Emery m-Ricci curvature tensors. Our results extend and improve various existing ones in the literature.</description>

      <title>Quantitative unique continuation property for fourth-order Baouendi-Grushin type subelliptic operators with a potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantitative unique continuation property for solutions to
  $$\Delta^2_{X} u = V u,$$
  where $\Delta_{X} = \Delta_{x} + |x|^{2\beta} \Delta_{y}$ ($0 &lt; \beta \leq 1$), with $x \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$ and $y \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$, denotes a class of subelliptic operators of Baouendi-Grushin type. The potential $V$ is assumed to be bounded and satisfy $|Z V| \leq K \psi$ for some constant $K&gt;0$,
  where $Z= \sum_{i=1}^m x_i \partial_{x_i} + (\beta+1)\sum_{j=1}^n y_j \partial_{y_j}$, $\psi$ is the angle function given by $\psi = \frac{|x|^{2\beta}}{\rho^{2\beta}}$,
  and $$\rho(x,y) = \left(|x|^{2(\beta+1)} + (\beta+1)^2 |y|^2\right)^{\frac{1}{2(\beta+1)}}$$ defines the associated pseudo-gauge. By adapting Almgren's approach, we establish an almost monotonicity formula for the frequency function. As a consequence, we derive a quantitative unique continuation result for solutions to the fourth-order subelliptic equation.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness to nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Gerdjikov-Ivanon equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Riemann-Hilbert approach is extended to discuss the well-posedness of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Gerdjikov-Ivanon equation. The Lipschitz continuity of potential in $H^{2}(\mathbb{R})\cap H^{1,1}(\mathbb{R})$ to scattering data is obtained through direct scattering transform. Two Riemann-Hilbert problems are constructed, and two sets of the reflection coefficients, that is $r(k)$ and $r_\pm(z)$, are introduced. The Lipschitz continuity from the reflection coefficients $r_\pm(z)$ in $H^{1}(\mathbb{R})\cap L^{2,1}(\mathbb{R})$ to the potential is estimated via the potential reconstruction. Existence of global solutions of NLS-GI equation is considered by the Riemann-Hilbert problem without eigenvalues or resonances.</description>

      <title>Expanding Solutions to Free Boundary 3D Spherically Symmetric Compressible Navier-Stokes-Poisson Equations near the Lane-Emden Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the gravitational Navier-Stokes-Poisson equations with the equation of state $P(\rho)=K\rho^{\gamma}$, where $\gamma\in(\frac{6}{5},\frac{4}{3}]$, which models the viscous polytropic gaseous stars. We prove the existence of global weak solutions to the equations with constant viscosity and radially symmetric initial data. For $\gamma=\frac{4}{3}$, we require the initial data having mass less than the mass of the Lane-Emden stars; for $\gamma\in(\frac{6}{5},\frac{4}{3})$, we require that the initial data belong to an invariant set where initial initial data can be taken near the Lane-Emden stars. For $\gamma\in(\frac{6}{5},\frac{4}{3})$, we show that the invariant set contains some initial data that are not allowed in previous literature. We also prove the support of any strong solution expands to infinity for the Navier-Stokes-Poisson equations with constant viscosity and a class of density-dependent viscosity, which indicates the strong instability of Lane-Emden solutions for the Navier-Stokes-Poisson equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M=(0,\infty)_r\times Y$ be a $d$-dimensional ($d\ge 3$) metric cone with metric&lt;br/&gt;$g=dr^2+r^2h$, where $(Y,h)$ is a closed Riemannian manifold. Let&lt;br/&gt;$H=\Delta+V_0/r^2$ be the associated Schrodinger operator, with&lt;br/&gt;$V_0\in C^\infty(Y)$ satisfying the positivity condition&lt;br/&gt;$\Delta_Y+V_0+(d-2)^2/4&gt;0$. First, we complement previous results by proving&lt;br/&gt;Lorentz-type endpoint estimates for the Riesz transform $\nabla H^{-1/2}$:&lt;br/&gt;it is of restricted weak type at both endpoints of its $L^p$-boundedness range.&lt;br/&gt;Second, we establish the sharp reverse inequality&lt;br/&gt;$\|H^{1/2}f\|_{L^p}\le C\big(\|\nabla f\|_{L^p}+\|f/r\|_{L^p}\big)$&lt;br/&gt;which holds if and only if&lt;br/&gt;\[&lt;br/&gt;\frac{d}{\min\big((d+4)/2+\mu_0,\,d\big)}&lt;br/&gt; &lt; p &lt;&lt;br/&gt;\frac{d}{\max\big((d-2)/2-\mu_0,\,0\big)}.\]</description>

      <title>Emergent behaviors of relativistic thermodynamic flocks with Synge energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective motion and self-organization of interacting particles, such as flocking and swarming, can be viewed as nonequilibrium analogues of collective dynamics in gases. Motivated by the analogy between gas mixtures and Cucker--Smale models, we introduce a polyatomic classical model and its relativistic counterpart based on the Synge energy, and analyze their large-time behavior. The relativistic formulation provides a physically consistent setting for multi-species systems where inertia and internal energy depend on temperature, as occurs in astrophysical plasmas or relativistic fluids. Using the entropy principle, we derive uniform lower bounds for temperature and establish asymptotic flocking under various communication kernels. For nearly constant interactions, flocking emerges from arbitrary initial data. The results clarify how thermodynamic effects and relativistic corrections modify the emergence of coherent motion in particle systems, bridging kinetic theory, relativistic fluid mixtures, and collective dynamics.</description>

      <title>Classical limit of the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical essence of the non-relativistic limit, from the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau system to the Vlasov-Poisson-Landau system, lies in the transition from finite-speed electromagnetic waves to instantaneous Coulomb interactions, and from relativistic to Newtonian particle dynamics. We rigorously justify this limit (mathematically corresponding to the light speed $c \to \infty$) in a periodic box via three key technical advances: establishing a uniform-in-$c$ coercivity estimate for the relativistic Landau collision operator, constructing a novel weighted energy functional to overcome the weakening dissipation of the electromagnetic field at large $c$, and proving a corresponding global well-posedness result.</description>

      <title>Sharp uniform-in-diffusivity mixing rates for passive scalars in parallel shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the advection-diffusion equation describing the evolution of a passive scalar in a background shear flow. We prove the optimal uniform-in-diffusivity mixing rate $\| f \|_{H^{-1}} \lesssim \langle t \rangle^{-1/(N+1)}$, $t \geq 0$, where $N$ is the maximal order of vanishing of the derivative $b'(y)$ of the shear profile, e.g., $N=1$ for plane Pouseille flow. Our proof is based on the description of the solution in terms of resolvents and involves pointwise estimates on the resolvent kernel. In the non-degenerate case, we further give a rigorous asymptotic description of generic solutions in terms of shear layers localized around the critical points. This verifies formal asymptotics in [McLaughlin-Camassa-Viotti, \textit{Physics of Fluids}, 22(11), 2010].</description>

      <title>Desingularization of nondegenerate rotating vortex patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyses the space of steady rotating solutions to the two-dimensional incompressible Euler equations nearby vortex patch solutions satisfying a natural nondegeneracy condition. We address the question of desingularization and prove that such vortex patch states are the limit of rotating Euler solutions that are smooth to infinite order, have compact vorticity support, and respect dihedral symmetry. Our nondegeneracy condition is proved to be satisfied by Kirchhoff ellipses and along the local bifurcation curves emanating from the Rankine vortex. The construction, that is based on a local stream function formulation in a tubular neighborhood of the patch boundary, is a synthesis of delicate analysis on thin domains, nonlinear a priori estimates, and a custom version of Newton's method. Our techniques are robust enough to additionally allow us to construct exotic families of singular rotating vortex patch-like solutions nearby a given nondegenerate state. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this work constitutes the first desingularization procedure applicable to general families of steady rotating vortex patches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stationary phi^6 model given by the equation -phi''(x) + 2 phi(x) - 8 phi(x)^3 + 6 phi(x)^5 = 0 for x in R, and establish sharp quantitative stability estimates for configurations close to two weakly interacting kinks. More precisely, there exist constants a &gt; 0 and epsilon &gt; 0 such that, for any function u in L-infinity satisfying || u - H_{0,1}(x + x1) - H_{-1,0}(x + x2) ||_{H1} &lt; epsilon with x2 - x1 &gt; a, there exist constants y1, y2 such that || u - H_{0,1}(x + y1) - H_{-1,0}(x + y2) ||_{H1} + exp(-sqrt(2) (y2 - y1)) &lt;= C * || u'' - 2 u + 8 u^3 - 6 u^5 ||_{L2}.</description>

      <title>A direct proof of the equivalence between Dirichlet's principle and Perron's method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a short proof that for a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ and continuous boundary data $g\in C(\partial\Omega)$ admitting a continuous finite-energy extension $\phi\in H^{1}(\Omega)\cap C(\bar\Omega)$, the minimizer of the Dirichlet energy \[
  E(v) = \int_{\Omega} |\nabla v|^{2}\,dx,
  \qquad v-\phi\in H^{1}_{0}(\Omega), \] coincides with the Perron solution $h_g$ of the Dirichlet problem $\Delta u = 0$ in $\Omega$ with boundary data $g$. The argument stays entirely in $H^{1}(\Omega)$ and uses only strong convergence via strict convexity of the Dirichlet energy, Friedrichs' inequality, Weyl's lemma, and Wiener's exhaustion by regular subdomains. No weak convergence, Poisson problems with distributional right hand sides, or general elliptic theory are needed.</description>

      <title>Elastic scattering by locally rough interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the first well-posedness result for elastic scattering by locally rough interfaces in both two and three dimensions. Inspired by the Helmholtz decomposition, we first discover a fundamental identity for the stress vector, revealing an intrinsic relationship among the generalized stress vector, the Lame constants and certain tangential differential operators. This identity leads to two key limits for surface integrals involving scattered solutions, from which we deduce the first uniqueness result of direct problem for all frequencies. Through a detailed analysis, applying the steepest descent method, subsequently we derive the existence and uniqueness of the corresponding two-layered Green's tensor along with its explicit expression when the transmission coefficient equals 1. Finally, by leveraging properties of the Green's tensor, we establish the existence of solutions via the variational method and the boundary integral equation, thereby achieving the first well-posedness result for elastic scattering by rough interfaces.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the inverse Stokes problem of determining a discontinuous viscosity coefficient $\mu$ in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^3$. By analyzing the singularity of the Dirichlet Green's functions in $H^1$-norm and constructing a specifically coupled Stokes-Brinkman system in a localized domain, we prove a global uniqueness theorem that the viscosity coefficient $\mu$ can be uniquely determined from boundary measurements.</description>

Abstract: We consider a model of the compressible non-Newtonian fluids for power-law flow fulfilling a periodic domain in ${\mathbb R}^3,$ in which the extra stress tensor is induced by a potential with $p(t,x)$-structure. The local-in-time existence of strong solution is proved for all $\frac{7}{5} &lt; \inf p(t,x) \leqslant \sup p(t,x) \leqslant 2.$ Further, an improved blow-up criterion for strong solutions is given in terms of the $L^\infty(0,T;L^3(\Omega))$-norm of the gradient of the velocity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we adapt our recent article [BDD25] to the setting of Dirichlet boundary conditions. A key part is the study of the parabolic equation $a\partial_t w - \Delta w = f$ with a rough coefficient $a$, homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, and the special assumption $\partial_tw \ge 0$. We then apply it to prove existence of global strong solutions to the triangular Shigesada-Kawasaki-Teramoto (SKT) cross-diffusion system with Lotka-Volterra reaction terms in three dimensions and Dirichlet boundary conditions, and to obtain estimates for solutions to reaction-diffusion systems modeling reversible chemistry (still when Dirichlet boundary conditions are considered).</description>

      <title>The local Turnpike Property in Mean Field Control and Games with quadratic Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the local stability properties of solutions to ergodic and discounted mean field games systems in the long time horizon, around stationary equilibria, when the Hamiltonian is quadratic. We replace the usual monotonicity of the coupling term with a weaker, local assumption on the stationary equilibrium (that need not be unique), stemming from a second-order strict positivity condition. This new stability assumption, together with a symmetry property of the system, allows us to derive an exponential turnpike property for those solutions that are close to the stationary one. Finally, through a fixed-point argument, we establish the actual existence of stable solutions, both on the finite horizon $[0,T]$ and on the infinite horizon, provided that the initial (and terminal) data are close enough to the stationary equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Self-Similar Radially Symmetric Solutions of the Relativistic Euler Equations with Synge Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider self-similar, radially symmetric solutions of the relativistic Euler equations with constitutive relations from relativistic kinetic theory, based on Synge energies for monatomic and its extension to diatomic gases. For the corresponding initial--boundary value problem, including the spherical piston problem, we prove existence and uniqueness of solutions valid for all values of the relativistic parameter $\gamma = mc^{2}/(k_{B}T)$, thus covering both the classical limit $(\gamma \to \infty)$ and the ultra-relativistic regime $(\gamma \to 0)$. We further establish key structural properties of Synge energies, showing the strict negativity of the second derivative with respect to pressure at constant entropy and the monotone dependence of the characteristic velocity on $\gamma$. These results extend the classical theory of self-similar flows to the relativistic framework with kinetic-theory-based constitutive equations.</description>

      <title>Long-time behavior of resonant time-dependent perturbations of periodic transport equations on $\mathbb{R}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider linear, time-dependent and skew-adjoint perturbations of periodic transport equations on the one-dimensional torus. We describe the long-time behavior of solutions for all non-degenerate perturbations in resonant regime, proving that either there exist solutions whose Sobolev norms explode exponentially fast, provoking energy transfer phenomena, or all solutions remain stable for arbitrarily long time scales. The proof combines pseudodifferential tools with dynamical systems results: we perform a resonant normal form procedure to reduce our analysis to the classical dynamics for the resonant equation. The main difficulty lies in the proof of the instability result, for which we explicitly construct an escape function associated to the dynamics. This is obtained by means of a positive commutator estimate on the operator associated with the escape function, exploiting microlocal analysis.</description>

      <title>Optimal regularity results for the Stokes--Dirichlet problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a sharp maximal regularity theory for the resolvent and evolution Stokes equations with no-slip boundary conditions, focusing on bounded domains of low regularity. Our framework covers the full scales of Besov and Sobolev spaces, $B^s_{p,q}$ and $H^{s,p}$, including endpoint cases such as $L^\infty$. Our approach also allows extending the classical $L^p$-theory for $1\leqslant p\leqslant\infty$, giving a complete picture that includes both Bessel potential spaces $H^{s,p}$ and Besov spaces $B^s_{p,q}$, $p,q\in[1,\infty]$.\\ Our first main result establishes resolvent estimates in the half-space encompassing endpoint function spaces, while the second addresses bounded domains of minimal boundary regularity. In both cases we derive resolvent bounds, prove boundedness of the $\mathbf{H}^\infty$-functional calculus for the Stokes--Dirichlet operator, and characterize precisely the domains of its fractional powers.\\ In the half space setting, we work with homogeneous Sobolev and Besov spaces following the notion due to Bahouri, Chemin and Danchin, further refined by the second author. The analysis of solenoidal function spaces provides here a complete toolkit for the study of incompressible fluid flows. As a consequence of our analysis, we obtain an explicit description for the Stokes--Dirichlet operator on $L^\infty(\mathbb R^n_+)$, which seems completely new.\\ For bounded domains, we obtain sharp results for a wide class of rough domains under minimal assumptions on boundary regularity. To this end, we rely on Sobolev multiplier theory. The assumptions coincide with those of Maz'ya--Shaposhnikova, already shown to be optimal in the case of the Laplace equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of spectral stability of traveling wave solutions $u=\gamma(x-Wt)$ for a system of viscous conservation laws $\partial_t u + \partial_x F(u) = \partial^2_x u$. Such solutions correspond to heteroclinic trajectories $\gamma$ of a system of ODE. In general conditions of stability can be obtained only numerically. We propose a model class of piece-wise linear (discontinuous) vector fields $F$ for which the stability problem is reduced to a linear algebra problem. We show that the stability problem makes sense in such low regularity and construct several examples of stability loss. Every such example can be smoothed to provide a smooth example of the same phenomenon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence and multiplicity of positive normalized solutions with prescribed $L^{2}$-norm for the Sobolev critical Schr\"odinger equation $-\Delta U + V(x) U = \lambda U + |U|^{2^*-2} U$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$, $\int_{\mathbb{R}^N} U^2\,dx = \rho^2$, where $N \ge 3$, $V\ge 0$ is a trapping potential, $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ and $2^*=\frac{2N}{N-2}$. Our first result is that the existence of local minimum solutions for $\rho \in (0, \rho^*)$, for some suitable $\rho^* &gt; 0$, under appropriate assumptions on the potential. These solutions correspond to ground states. Our second result concerns the existence of mountain pass solutions, under the same assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence and the 1/2-H\"older continuity in time of flat flows for periodic Lipschitz subgraphs, whose evolution is governed by the gradient flow of generalized nonlocal perimeters. Moreover, we show that the flat flow satisfies the semigroup property and, as a consequence, the generalized perimeter decreases along the evolution. Finally, we prove that halfspaces are global minimizers of the generalized nonlocal perimeters and act as attractors for the dynamics. Our theory covers several generalized perimeters, including fractional and Riesz-type perimeters (defined on entire periodic subgraphs through suitable renormalization procedures) and the Minkowski pre-content.</description>

      <title>Wigner and Gabor phase-space analysis of propagators for evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Wigner kernel and the Gabor matrix associated with the propagators of a broad class
  of linear evolution equations, including the complex heat, wave,
  and Hermite equations. Within the framework of time-frequency analysis, we derive
  explicit expressions for the Wigner kernels of Fourier multipliers and establish quantitative
  decay estimates for the corresponding Gabor matrices. These results are obtained under symbol
  regularity conditions formulated in the Gelfand-Shilov scale and ensure exponential off-diagonal
  decay or quasi-diagonality of the matrix representation. We believe this approach can be extended to more general symbols in the pseudodifferential setting, improving the existing results in terms of their Gabor matrix decay. For the complex heat equation, we obtain closed-form formulas exhibiting both dissipative
  and oscillatory behavior governed respectively by the real and imaginary parts of the diffusion
  parameter. The modulus of the Gabor matrix is shown to display Gaussian decay and temporal
  spreading consistent with diffusion phenomena. In contrast, the complex Hermite equation
  is analyzed via H\"ormander's metaplectic semigroup, where the propagator decomposes as the product
  of a real Hermite semigroup and a fractional Fourier transform. In this setting, the Gabor matrix
  retains its Gaussian shape while undergoing a pure rotation on the time-frequency plane,
  reflecting the symplectic structure of the underlying flow.
  The analysis provides a unified operator-theoretic and phase-space perspective on parabolic
  and hyperbolic evolution equations, linking the geometry of their symbols with the
  sparsity and localization properties of their Gabor representations. Explicit formulas are
  given in a form suitable for numerical computation and visualization of phase-space dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the Fujita Phenomenon for a Forced Spatio-Temporal Fractional Diffusion Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Cauchy problem for a semilinear fractional diffusion equation with a time-dependent forcing term: \[ \partial_t^\alpha u + (-\Delta)^{\mathsf{s}} u = |u|^p + t^{\sigma}\,\mathbf{w}(x), \quad (t,x) \in (0,\infty) \times \mathbb{R}^N, \] with parameters $\alpha, \mathsf{s} \in (0,1)$, $\sigma &gt; -\alpha$, and a continuous function $\mathbf{w}$. The operator $\partial_t^\alpha$ denotes the Caputo fractional derivative. Our main contributions are threefold. First, we prove the local existence of mild solutions and demonstrate a finite-time blow-up in the subcritical regime, provided $\int_{\mathbb{R}^N} \mathbf{w}(x)\,dx &gt; 0$. Second, for the supercritical case with $-\alpha &lt; \sigma &lt; 0$, we establish the global existence for sufficiently small initial data and a forcing term, and we determine the critical exponent to be \[ p_F=\frac{N\alpha-2\mathsf{s}\sigma}{N\alpha-2\mathsf{s}(\alpha+\sigma)}. \] Finally, for this supercritical range, we prove a more robust global existence result under assumptions requiring only local smallness and controlled growth of the data.</description>

      <title>Weighted graphs in the sense of John and a global Poincar\'e inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a condition on weighted graphs with finite measure that guarantees the validity of a global Poincar\'e inequality. This condition can be viewed as a discrete analogue of the criterion introduced by J. Boman in 1982 for Whitney cubes, which in turn characterizes the condition originally proposed by F. John in his seminal 1961 work.</description>

      <title>Local Laws and Fluctuations for Super-Coulombic Riesz Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the local statistical behavior of the super-Coulombic Riesz gas of particles in Euclidean space of arbitrary dimension, with inverse power distance repulsion integrable near $0$, and with a general confinement potential, in a certain regime of inverse temperature. Using a bootstrap procedure, we prove local laws on the next order energy and control on fluctuations of linear statistics that are valid down to the microscopic lengthscale, and provide controls for instance, on the number of particles in a (mesoscopic or microscopic) box, and the existence of a limit point process up to subsequences.
  As a consequence of the local laws, we derive an almost additivity of the free energy that allows us to exhibit for the first time a CLT for Riesz gases corresponding to small enough inverse powers, at small mesoscopic length scales, which can be interpreted as the convergence of the associated potential to a fractional Gaussian field.
  Compared to the Coulomb interaction case, the main new issues arise from the nonlocal aspect of the Riesz kernel. This manifests in (i) a novel technical difficulty in generalizing the transport approach of Lebl\'e and the second author to the Riesz gas which now requires analyzing a degenerate and singular elliptic PDE, (ii) the fact that the transport map is not localized, which makes it more delicate to localize the estimates, (iii) the need for coupling the local laws and the fluctuations control inside the same bootstrap procedure.</description>

      <title>The Willmore energy and curvature concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study isometric immersions of a Riemannian surface $(\W,\g)$, where $\W\subset \R^2$, into $\R^3$. We consider their bending energy, i.e., the square of the $L^2$-norm of their second fundamental form, which is equivalent to the Willmore functional. We obtain two new lower bounds for this energy, one in terms of the Gaussian curvature of the surface, and the other in terms of a Burgers vector -- a measure of non-flatness connected to torsion. These new estimates provide optimal blowup rates of the energy when the curvature is concentrated (e.g., in a conical geometry). In the more subtle case of dipoles of concentrated curvature, we use the Burgers vector estimates to obtain an optimal blowup rate in terms of the size of the system. Our motivation comes from non-Euclidean elasticity, in which cones and curvature-dipoles play a central role. The lower bounds derived in this work directly yield lower bounds for the elastic energy of thin elastic sheets. The derivation of the curvature-based lower bound involves an isoperimetric inequality for framed loops, which we believe to be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Growth Estimates for Solutions to the Wave Equation on Damek--Ricci Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{L}$ be the left-invariant distinguished Laplacian, and let $\mathrm{d}\rho$ denote the right Haar measure on a Damek--Ricci space $S$. Let $u(t,x)$ denote the solution to the wave equation $\partial_t^2 u-\mathcal{L} u=0$ with initial data $(u,\partial_t u)|_{t=0}=(f,g)$. In this paper, we establish the sharp-in-regularity $L^p$ bounds \begin{align*} \|u(t,\cdot)\|_{L^p(S ,\mathrm{d}\rho)} \lesssim_p (1+|t|)^{2|\frac{1}{p}-\frac{1}{2}|}\|(\mathrm{Id}+\mathcal{L})^{\frac{\alpha_0}{2}}\!f\|_{L^p(S ,\mathrm{d}\rho)}+(1+|t|)\,\|(\mathrm{Id}+\mathcal{L})^{\frac{\alpha_1}{2}}\!g\|_{L^p(S,\mathrm{d}\rho)} \end{align*} for all $t\in\mathbb{R}^*$ and $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, where the exponents $\alpha_0 = n\left|1/p-1/2\right|$ and $\alpha_1 = n\left|1/p-1/2\right| -1$ attain their critical values. This result settles, in full generality, the conjecture raised by M\"{u}ller, Thiele, and Vallarino.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Mean Field Games on Networks and Related Optimal Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of deterministic mean field games and related optimal control problems, with a finite time horizon and in which the state space is a network.
  An agent controls her velocity, and, when she occupies a vertex, she can either remain still or enter any adjacent edge. The running and terminal costs are assumed to be continuous in each edge, but may jump at the vertices. Compared to the companion paper [4], we make more general assumptions about the costs and consider networks with an arbitrary number of vertices; this higher degree of generality brings new difficulties.
  For the optimal control problems mentioned above, we obtain in particular the existence of optimal trajectories and regularity results concerning the optimal trajectories and the value function.
  These control theoretic results make it possible to address a class of mean field games on networks, with costs that do not depend separately on the control and on the distribution of states, and that are non-local with respect to the latter. Focusing on a Lagrangian formulation, we obtain the existence of relaxed equilibria consisting of probability measures on admissible trajectories. To any relaxed equilibrium corresponds a mild solution, i.e. a pair $(u, m)$ made of the value function $u$ of a related optimal control problem and a family $m = (m(t))_t$ of probability measures on the network. Given $m$, the value function $u$ is a viscosity solution of a Hamilton-Jacobi problem on the network. We then investigate the regularity properties of $u$ and a weak form of a Fokker-Planck equation satisfied by $m$.</description>

      <title>A modified Consensus-Based Optimization model: consensus formation and uniform-in-time propagation of chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a modified Consensus-Based Optimization model that admits a fully unified and rigorous analysis of its finite-particle dynamics, the associated McKean--Vlasov equation, and their optimization behavior under a single set of structural framework. The key ingredient is a regularized Gibbs weight that stabilizes the consensus point and avoids degeneracies present in the classical formulation, eliminating the need for cutoffs, rescaling, or boundedness assumptions on the objective function. Our first main result establishes large-time consensus for the particle system: when the drift exceeds an explicit threshold, all particles converge exponentially to a common random limit that concentrates near the global minimizer. Our second result proves uniform-in-time propagation of chaos, providing quantitative and dimension-free convergence of the empirical measure to the McKean--Vlasov dynamics. Finally, we show that the mean-field system reaches deterministic consensus and that its consensus point approaches the global minimizer in the regime of highly concentrated Gibbs weights. Together, these results yield a unified and internally consistent theoretical framework for consensus-based optimization under substantially relaxed regularity assumptions on the objective function.</description>

      <title>Duality Perspective on Nonlinear Eigenproblems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate nonlinear eigenproblems for a broad class of proper, closed, convex functionals in reflexive Banach spaces. We develop a dual formulation of the nonlinear eigenproblem using the Fenchel conjugate and establish an equivalence to the primal problem. Further, we introduce a duality gap and a geometric characterization of eigenvectors that apply in general Banach spaces. We interpret the dual problem as the eigenproblem for the inverse operator of the primal problem. Concerning numerical methods for solving nonlinear eigenproblems, we analyze the inverse power method, framed as a dual power method, showing strong convergence in the case of absolutely p-homogeneous functionals. Our theoretical results are validated by extensive numerical experiments for the p-Laplacian. We further connect the flow-based proximal power method from the literature to the inverse power method and discuss two numerical approaches to approximate higher-order nonlinear eigenfunctions.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the laws of the BPHZ random models satisfy some transportation cost inequalities in the full subcritical regime if there is no variance blowup and the law of the noise is translation invariant and satisfies some transportation cost inequality. As a consequence, the laws of a number of solutions to some singular stochastic partial differential equations also satisfy some transportation cost inequalities. This is in particular the case of the $\Phi^4_{4-\delta}$ measures over the 4-dimensional torus, for all $0&lt;\delta&lt;4$.</description>

      <title>Chernoff-Mehler Approximation for L\'evy Processes with Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an approximation scheme for L\'evy processes with drift in terms of a representation that is akin to the celebrated Mehler formula for L\'evy-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. The approximation scheme is based on a variant of the Chernoff product formula on the space of bounded continuous functions. In a first step, we provide sufficient and necessary conditions for arbitrary families of probability measures, indexed by positive real numbers, to give rise to a convolution semigroup via a Chernoff approximation on the space of bounded continuous functions, equipped with the mixed topology. In this context, we provide explicit criteria both for the convergence of subsequences and the entire family, and discuss fine properties related to the domain of the associated generator of the L\'evy process and the infinitesimal behavior of the approximating family of measures. In a second step, we enrich the family of measures by a deterministic component and derive explicit conditions that ensure both the convergence of subsequences and the entire family to a L\'evy process with drift under a Chernoff approximation. In a series of examples, we show that our general conditions on the dynamics are satisfied, for example, by flows of Lipschitz ordinary differential equations, Euler schemes, and arbitrary Runge-Kutta methods, and that the Central Limit Theorem can be subsumed under our framework.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Bernoulli type free boundary problem on collapsed RCD(K,N)-spaces. We prove the existence of minimizers and prove the local Lipschitz continuity of minimizers provided that the negative part is locally Lipschitz continuous. In particular, we prove the local Lipschitz continuity of minimizers for the one-phase problem (i.e. when the solution is non-negative). And then we prove that the free boundaries of minimizers have locally finite perimeter. We emphasize that the proof in this paper applies to collapsed RCD(K,N)-spaces and does not rely on the non-collapsed condition.</description>

Abstract: Polyconvexity is an important concept in the analysis of energies related to elasticity. A function $f \colon \R^{d\times d} \to \R$ is called polyconvex if it can be written as a convex function in the minors of the argument. We show that for isotropic functions it suffices to consider diagonal matrices. For $d=3$, this leads to a dimension reduction for the convex representative of $f$ from $\R^{19}$ to $\R^7$. Moreover, we present a new result for the polyconvexity of functions formulated in the principal invariant of the left or right stretch tensor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the convergence of their infinitesimal generators in the mixed topology, we provide a stability result for strongly continuous convex monotone semigroups on spaces of continuous functions. In contrast to previous results, we do not rely on the theory of viscosity solutions but use a recent comparison principle which uniquely determines the semigroup via its $\Gamma$-generator defined on the Lipschitz set and therefore resembles the classical analogue from the linear case. The framework also allows for discretizations both in time and space and covers a variety of applications. This includes Euler schemes and Yosida-type approximations for upper envelopes of families of linear semigroups, stability results and finite-difference schemes for convex HJB equations, Freidlin-Wentzell-type results and Markov chain approximations for a class of stochastic optimal control problems and continuous-time Markov processes with uncertain transition probabilities.</description>

The cases that the transmission coefficient $\mu\neq1$ and $\mu=1$, which creates certain difficulties in the direct and inverse problem, respectively, are both considered. We first estalish the well-posedness of the direct problem using the integral equation method through an elaborate analysis. Then we carefully consider the singularity of the solutions to the problem with incident point source or hypersingular point source, where a simple and novel perspective is given for the derivation of the singularity. Finally, a global uniqueness result is proven for the inverse problem on the unique determination of the unbounded rough surface, the transmission coefficient and the wave number in the lower half plane from the measurements of the near field only on a line segment above the interface at a fixed frequency.</description>

      <title>Existence of viscosity solutions for Hamilton-Jacobi equations via Lyapunov control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a new perspective on the existence of viscosity solutions for a stationary and a time-dependent first-order Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Following recent comparison principles, we work in a framework in which we consider a subsolution and a supersolution for two equations in terms of two Hamiltonians that can be seen as an upper semi-continuous upper and lower semi-continuous lower bound of our original Hamiltonian respectively. The bounds are made rigorous in terms of Youngs inequality.
  The bounds are furthermore formulated in a way that incorporate a Lyapunov function which allows us to restrict part of the analysis to compact sets and to work with almost optimizers of the considered control problems. For this reason, we can relax assumptions on the control problem: most notably, we do not need completeness of set of controlled paths. Moreover, this strategy avoids a-priori analysis on the regularity of the candidate solutions.
  To complete our picture, we exhibit our result in two contexts. First, we consider Riemannian manifolds with smooth boundary, in which the dynamics allows for both "inward" and "outward" drift. The boundary conditions are embedded into the Hamiltonians itself. Second, we consider the solutions to a Fillipov differential equation, i.e. one with discontinuous vector field. We show that our notion of Hamiltonians leverages the natural embedding of the discontinuity in an associated set-valued differential inclusion.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Stability of 3D Out-flowing Compressible Viscous Fluid under Non-Spherical Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an outflow problem for the $3$-dimensional isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The fluid under consideration occupies the exterior domain of the unit ball $\Omega=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^3\,\vert\, |x|\ge 1\}$ and it is flowing out from the unit ball $\Omega$ at a constant speed $|u_b|$, in the normal direction to the boundary surface $\partial\Omega$. The existence of a unique spherically symmetric stationary solution $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})$ is obtained by I.~Hashimoto and A.~Matsumura in 2021, provided that the fluid velocity at the far-field is assumed to be zero, and $|u_b|$ is sufficiently small. Subsequently, authors of the present article prove in 2024 that $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})$ is time-asymptotically stable under large spherically symmetric initial perturbations in the suitable Sobolev norm. The main purpose of the present paper is to investigate the case when the initial perturbations are possibly non-spherically symmetric. We show that $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})$ remains asymptotically stable in time, under general small initial perturbations in the $H^3$-norm.</description>

Abstract: We establish the spatial differentiability of weak solutions to nonstationary Stokes equations in divergence form with variable viscosity coefficients having $L_2$-Dini mean oscillations. As a corollary, we derive local spatial Schauder estimates for such equations if the viscosity coefficient belongs to $C^\alpha_x$. Similar results also hold for strong solutions to nonstationary Stokes equations in nondivergence form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the controllability property of partial differential equations (PDEs) is closely linked to the proof of an observability inequality for the adjoint system, which, sometimes, involves analyzing a spectral problem associated with the PDE under consideration. In this work, we study a series of spectral issues that ensure the controllability of the renowned Korteweg-de Vries equation on a star-graph. This investigation reduces to determining when certain functions, associated with this spectral problem, are entire. The novelty here lies in presenting this detailed analysis in the context of a star graph structure.</description>

      <title>Local minimizers in $3$d of vector Allen-Cahn with a quadruple junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $\Omega$ a perturbation of the unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^3$, we establish the existence of a sequence of local minimizers for the vector Allen-Cahn energy. The sequence converges in $L^1$ to a partition of $\Omega$ whose skeleton is given by a tetrahedral cone and thus contains a quadruple point. This is accomplished by proving that the partition is an isolated local minimizer of a weighted perimeter problem arising as the associated $\Gamma$-limit of the sequence of Allen-Cahn functionals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the minimizers of \begin{equation} \lambda_k^s(A) + |A| \end{equation} where $\lambda^s_k(A)$ is the $k$-th Dirichlet eigenvalue of the fractional Laplacian on $A$. Unlike in the case of the Laplacian, the free boundary of minimizers exhibit distinct global behavior. Our main results include: the existence of minimizers, optimal H\"older regularity for the corresponding eigenfunctions, and in the case where $\lambda_k$ is simple, non-degeneracy, density estimates, separation of the free boundary, and free boundary regularity. We propose a combinatorial toy problem related to the global configuration of such minimizers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18697v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a comparison result for semi-continuous viscosity solutions of a class of second-order PDEs in the Wasserstein space. This allows us to remove the Lipschitz continuity assumption with respect to the Fourier-Wasserstein distance in AriX: 2309.05040 and obtain uniqueness by directly working in the Wasserstein space. In terms of its application, we characterize the value function of a stochastic control problem with partial observation as the unique viscosity solution to its corresponding HJB equation. Additionally, we present an application to a prediction problem under partial monitoring, where we establish an upper bound on the limit of regret using our comparison principle for degenerate dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20592v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the generalized existence of extremizers for the sharp $p$-Sobolev inequality on noncompact Riemannian manifolds in connection with nonnegative curvature and Euclidean volume growth assumptions. Assuming a nonnegative Ricci curvature lower bound, we show that almost extremal functions are close in gradient norm to radial Euclidean bubbles. In the case of nonnegative sectional curvature lower bounds, we additionally deduce that vanishing is the only possible behavior, in the sense that almost extremal functions are almost zero globally. Our arguments rely on nonsmooth concentration compactness methods and Mosco-convergence results for the Cheeger energy on noncompact varying spaces, generalized to every exponent $p\in (1,\infty)$.</description>

      <title>Subelliptic Random Walks on Riemannian Manifolds and Their Convergence to Equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to study the convergence to equilibrium of an $(h,\rho)$-subelliptic random walk on a closed, connected Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ associated with a subelliptic second-order differential operator $A$ on $M$. In such a random walk, $h$ roughly represents the step size and $\rho$ the speed at which it is carried out. To construct the random walk and prove the convergence result, we employ a technique due to Fefferman and Phong, which reduces the problem to the study of a constant-coefficient operator $\tilde{A}$ that is locally equivalent to our second-order subelliptic operator $A$, in the sense that the diffusion generated by $\tilde{A}$ induces a local diffusion for $A$. By using the compactness of $M$ this local diffusion can be lifted to a global diffusion, and the convergence result is then obtained via the spectral theory of the associated Markov operator.</description>

Abstract: We consider positive one-dimensional solutions of a Lane-Emden relative Dirichlet problem in a cylinder and study their stability/instability properties as the energy varies with respect to domain perturbations. This depends on the exponent $p &gt;1$ of the nonlinearity and we obtain results for $p$ close to 1 and for $p$ large. This is achieved by a careful asymptotic analysis of the one-dimensional solution as $p \to 1$ or $p \to \infty$, which is of independent interest. It allows to detect the limit profile and other qualitative properties of these solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-frequency representations stemmed in 1932 with the introduction of the Wigner distribution. For most of the 20th century, research in this area primarily focused on defining joint probability distributions for position and momentum in quantum mechanics. Applications to electrical engineering were soon established with the seminal works of Gabor and the researchers at Bell Labs. In 2012, Bai, Li and Cheng used for the first time metaplectic operators, defined in the middle of 20th century by Van Hove, to generalize the Wigner distribution and unify effectively the most used time-frequency representations under a common framework. This work serves as a comprehensive up-to-date survey on time-frequency representations defined by means of metaplectic operators, with particular emphasis on the recent contributions by Cordero and Rodino, who exploited metaplectic operators to their limits to generalize the Wigner distributions. Their idea provides a fruitful framework where properties of time-frequency representations can be explained naturally by the structure of the symplectic group.</description>

      <title>Inverse stability for hyperbolic equations with different initial conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish Lipschitz stability for both the potential and the initial conditions from a single boundary measurement in the context of a hyperbolic boundary initial value problem. In our setting, the initial conditions are allowed to differ for different potentials. Compared to the traditional B-K method, our approach does not require the time reflection step. This advantage makes it possible to apply our method to the fixed angle inverse scattering problem, which remains unresolved for the single incident wave case. To achieve our result, we impose certain pointwise positivity assumption on the difference of initial conditions. The assumption generalizes previous stability results that usually assume the difference to be zero. We propose the initial-potential problem and prove a potential inverse stable recovery result of it. The initial-potential problem serves as an attempt to relate initial boundary value problem with the scattering problem, and to explore the possibility to relax the positivity requirement on the initial data. We also establish a new pointwise Carleman estimate, whose proof is significantly shorter and the reasoning is much clearer than traditional ones.</description>

Abstract: In [1], Caffarelli-Charro introduced a fractional Monge-Amp\`{e}re operator. Later, Wu [17] generalized it to a fractional analogue of $k$-Hessian operators and proved the strict ellipticity for $k=2$. In this paper, we introduce a fractional analogue of general Hessian operators and prove the stability. We also show that the fractional analogue $k$-Hessian operators defined in [17] are strictly elliptic with respect to convex solutions for all $2 \leq k \leq n$. Furthermore, we provide a new proof for the case $k=2$ without the convexity condition.</description>

      <title>A Wave Front Tracking Scheme for Flux Reconstruction in $2\times 2$ Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel wave front tracking framework for reconstructing unknown flux functions in $2\times 2$ hyperbolic conservation laws, extending beyond the well-studied scalar case. By analyzing Riemann solutions at fixed observation times, we develop explicit reconstruction formulas that handle arbitrary combinations of shock and rarefaction waves through a unified equivalent shock concept. Our method constructs piecewise quadratic $C^1$ flux approximations with rigorous convergence guarantees: the approximation errors decrease quadratically with the discretization parameters for function values and linearly for derivatives under $C^{1,1}$ regularity, with enhanced cubic and quadratic convergence respectively under $C^3$ regularity. Applications to the isentropic Euler equations and the mathematically equivalent p-system in compressible fluid dynamics demonstrate the method's capability to identify complete equations of state from limited dynamic measurements, providing a systematic approach to a fundamental inverse problem in continuum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: We prove new Lipschitz properties for transport maps along heat flows, constructed by Kim and Milman. For (semi)-log-concave measures and Gaussian mixtures, our bounds have several applications: eigenvalues comparisons, dimensional functional inequalities, and domination of distribution functions.</description>

      <title>An Unconditional Representation of the Conditional Score in Infinite-Dimensional Linear Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15643v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models (SDMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for sampling from the posterior distribution in Bayesian inverse problems. However, existing methods often require multiple evaluations of the forward mapping to generate a single sample, resulting in significant computational costs for large-scale inverse problems. To address this, we propose an unconditional representation of the conditional score function (UCoS) tailored to linear inverse problems, which avoids forward model evaluations during sampling by shifting computational effort to an offline training phase. In this phase, a \emph{task-dependent} score function is learned based on the linear forward operator. Crucially, we show that the conditional score can be derived \emph{exactly} from a trained (unconditional) score using affine transformations, eliminating the need for conditional score approximations. Our approach is formulated in infinite-dimensional function spaces, making it inherently discretization-invariant. We support this formulation with a rigorous convergence analysis that justifies UCoS beyond any specific discretization. Finally we validate UCoS through high-dimensional computed tomography (CT) and image deblurring experiments, demonstrating both scalability and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Volume forms on balanced manifolds and the Calabi-Yau equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00995v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the space of mixed-volume forms endowed with a $L^2$ metric on a balanced manifold. A geodesic equation can be derived in this space that has an interesting structure and extends the equation of Donaldson \cite{Donaldson10} and Chen-He \cite{CH11} in the space of volume forms on a Riemannian manifold. This nonlinear PDE is studied in detail and we prove several estimates, under a positivity assumption. Later we study the Calabi-Yau equation for balanced metrics and introduce a geometric criterion for prescribing volume forms, that is closely related to the positivity assumption above. By deriving $C^0$ a priori estimates, we prove the existence of solutions on all such manifolds.</description>

      <title>Machine learning on manifolds for inverse scattering: Lipschitz stability analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07093v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Establishing Lipschitz stability estimates is crucial for ensuring the mathematical robustness of neural network (NN) approximations in machine learning (ML)-based parameter estimation, particularly in physics-informed settings. In this work, we derive such estimates for the inverse of a nonlinear map defined on a manifold that captures both unknown parameters and the nonlinear physical processes they influence. Our analysis is based on finite-dimensional, learnable representations of the manifold and provides Lipschitz stability estimates on the manifold-based subspaces, for a class of inverse maps associated with parameter dependent linear compact operators. Such operators model scattered and far-field data that can be used to detect structures such as cracks. We apply our theoretical ML manifold framework to inverse Helmholtz problems in unbounded regions exterior to cracks, addressing the scattered-field data-driven inverse problem while ensuring injectivity conditions on the manifold, a requirement for the Lipschitz stability. Our method accurately recovers crack-defining parameters without requiring prior knowledge of inputs such as incident wave types or external forces on the crack. Numerical experiments using NN approximations confirm the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Compact embeddings of Bessel Potential Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01677v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bessel potential spaces have gained renewed interest due to their robust structural properties and applications in fractional partial differential equations (PDEs). These spaces, derived through complex interpolation between Lebesgue and Sobolev spaces, are closely related to the Riesz fractional gradient. Recent studies have demonstrated continuous and compact embeddings of Bessel potential spaces into Lebesgue spaces. This paper extends these findings by addressing the compactness of continuous embeddings from the perspective of abstract interpolation theory. We present three distinct proofs, leveraging compactness results, translation estimates, and the relationship between Gagliardo and Bessel spaces. Our results provide a deeper understanding of the functional analytic properties of Bessel potential spaces and their applications in fractional PDEs.</description>

      <title>On the non-convexity issue in the radial Calder\'on problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03379v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A classical approach to the Calder\'on problem is to estimate the unknown conductivity by solving a nonlinear least-squares problem. It leads to a nonconvex optimization problem which is generally believed to be riddled with bad local minimums. We revisit this issue in the case of piecewise constant radial conductivities and prove that, contrary to previous claims, there are no spurious critical points in the case of two scalar unknowns with no measurement noise. We also provide a partial proof of this result in the general setting which holds under a numerically verifiable assumption. Finally, we investigate whether a recently proposed approach based on convexification yields better reconstructions. For the first time, we propose a way to implement it in practice and show that it is consistently outperformed by some least squares solvers, which are also faster and require less measurements.</description>

      <title>Error analysis for the deep Kolmogorov method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deep Kolmogorov method is a simple and popular deep learning based method for approximating solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) of the Kolmogorov type. In this work we provide an error analysis for the deep Kolmogorov method for heat PDEs. Specifically, we reveal convergence with convergence rates for the overall mean square distance between the exact solution of the heat PDE and the realization function of the approximating deep neural network (DNN) associated with a stochastic optimization algorithm in terms of the size of the architecture (the depth/number of hidden layers and the width of the hidden layers) of the approximating DNN, in terms of the number of random sample points used in the loss function (the number of input-output data pairs used in the loss function), and in terms of the size of the optimization error made by the employed stochastic optimization method.</description>

Abstract: On a volume doubling metric measure space endowed with a family of $p$-energies such that the Poincar\'e inequality and the cutoff Sobolev inequality with $p$-walk dimension $\beta_p$ hold, for $p$ in an open interval $I\subseteq (1,+\infty)$, we prove the following dichotomy: either $\beta_p=p$ for all $p\in I$, or $\beta_p&gt;p$ for all $p\in I$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the convergence of a finite volume method based on the method of bicharacteristics for multidimensional hyperbolic conservation laws. In particular, we concentrate on the linear wave equation system and nonlinear Euler equations of gas dynamics. We show the stability and the consistency of the numerical approximations. By means of the generalized Lax equivalence principle we prove the convergence of numerical solutions to the strong solution on the lifespan.</description>

      <title>A general comparison principle for the pluripotential complex Monge-Amp\`ere flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a comparison principle for the pluripotential complex Monge-Amp\`ere flows for the right-hand side of the form $dt \wedge d\mu$ where $d\mu$ is dominated by a Monge-Amp\`ere measure of a bounded plurisubharmonic function. As a consequence, we obtain the uniqueness of the weak solution to the pluripotential Cauchy-Dirichlet problem. We also study the long-term behavior of the solution under some assumption.</description>
