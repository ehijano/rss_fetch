      <title>Ultrasound Autofocusing: Common Midpoint Phase Error Optimization via Differentiable Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wavefield imaging reconstructs physical properties from wavefield measurements across an aperture, using modalities like radar, optics, sonar, seismic, and ultrasound imaging. Propagation of a wavefront from unknown sources through heterogeneous media causes phase aberrations that degrade the coherence of the wavefront leading to reduced image resolution and contrast. Adaptive imaging techniques attempt to correct phase aberration and restore coherence leading to improved focus. We propose an autofocusing paradigm for aberration correction in ultrasound imaging by fitting an acoustic velocity field to pressure measurements, via optimization of the common midpoint phase error (CMPE), using a straight-ray wave propagation model for beamforming in diffusely scattering media. We show that CMPE induced by heterogeneous acoustic velocity is a robust measure of phase aberration that can be used for acoustic autofocusing. CMPE is optimized iteratively using a differentiable beamforming approach to simultaneously improve the image focus while estimating the acoustic velocity field of the interrogated medium. The approach relies solely on wavefield measurements using a straight-ray integral solution of the two-way time-of-flight without explicit numerical time-stepping models of wave propagation. We demonstrate method performance through in silico simulations, in vitro phantom measurements, and in vivo mammalian models, showing practical applications in distributed aberration quantification, correction, and velocity estimation for medical ultrasound autofocusing.</description>

      <title>MRI quantification of liver fibrosis using diamagnetic susceptibility: An ex-vivo feasibility study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In chronic liver disease, liver fibrosis develops as excessive deposition of extracellular matrix macromolecules, predominantly collagens, progressively form fibrous scars that disrupt the hepatic architecture, and fibrosis, iron, and fat are interrelated. Fibrosis is the best predictor of morbidity and mortality in chronic liver disease but liver biopsy, the reference method for diagnosis and staging, is invasive and limited by sampling and interobserver variability and risks of complications. The overall objective of this study was to develop a new non-invasive method to quantify fibrosis using diamagnetic susceptibility sources with histology validation in ex vivo liver explants.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Propagation from Projections to Region Counts in Tomographic Imaging: Application to Radiopharmaceutical Dosimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiopharmaceutical therapies (RPTs) present a major opportunity to improve cancer therapy. Although many current RPTs use the same injected activity for all patients, there is interest in using absorbed dose measurements to enable personalized prescriptions. Image-based absorbed dose calculations incur uncertainties from calibration factors, partial volume effects and segmentation methods. While previously published dose estimation protocols incorporate these uncertainties, they do not account for uncertainty originating from the reconstruction process itself with the propagation of Poisson noise from projection data. This effect should be accounted for to adequately estimate the total uncertainty in absorbed dose estimates. This paper proposes a computationally practical algorithm that propagates uncertainty from projection data through clinical reconstruction algorithms to obtain uncertainties on the total measured counts within volumes of interest (VOIs). The algorithm is first validated on ${}^{177}$Lu and ${}^{225}$Ac phantom data by comparing estimated uncertainties from individual SPECT acquisitions to empirical estimates obtained from multiple acquisitions. It is then applied to (i) Monte Carlo and (ii) multi-time point ${}^{177}$Lu-DOTATATE and ${}^{225}$Ac-PSMA-617 patient data for time integrated activity (TIA) uncertainty estimation. The outcomes of this work are two-fold: (i) the proposed uncertainty algorithm is validated, and (ii) a blueprint is established for how the algorithm can be inform dosimetry protocols via TIA uncertainty estimation. The proposed algorithm is made publicly available in the open-source image reconstruction library PyTomography.</description>

      <title>Photoacoustic tracking of photo-magnetically powered nanoparticles for cancer therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The in vivo propulsion and monitoring of nanoparticles (NPs) have received tremendous achievements in the past decade. Developing functional NPs that can be efficiently manipulated inside the human body with a non-invasive tracking modality is critical to clinical translation. This study synthesized a photo-magnetically powered nanoparticle (PMN) with a Fe3O4 core and gold spiky surface. The Au-nanotips ensure PMNs have a strong light absorption in the second near-infrared (NIR) window and produce outstanding photoacoustic signals. The Bio-transmission electron microscopy and simulation results prove that the assembly of PMNs under a magnetic field further enhances the photothermal conversion in cells, contributing to the reduction of ambient viscosity. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) realized real-time monitoring of PMN movements and revealed that laser plus magnetic coupling couldimprove intratumoral distribution and retention. The proposed methods exhibit excellent potential for the clinical research of cancer nanotherapies.</description>

      <title>Utilizing entropy to systematically quantify the resting-condition baroreflex regulation function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14584</link>

Abstract: Baroreflex is critical to maintain the blood pressure homeostasis, and the quantification of the baroreflex regulation function (BRF) can provide guidance for disease diagnosis, treatment and healthcare. Current quantification of the BRF such as baroreflex sensitivity cannot represent the BRF systematically. From the perspective of complex systems, we regard that the BRF is the emergence result of the diverse states and interactions in the physiological mechanisms. Therefore, the three-layer emergence is constructed in this work, which is from the physiological mechanisms to the physiological indexes and then to the BRF. On this basis, since the entropy in statistical physics macroscopically measures the diversity of the system's states, a new index called the PhysioEnt is proposed to represent the BRF and quantify the physical relationships between the BRF and four physiological indexes, baroreflex sensitivity, heart rate, heart rate variability, and systolic blood pressure. Based on the proposed method, some new findings with medical significance are obtained, including the mechanisms that aging and obesity affect the resting-condition BRF are different, and the resting-condition BRFs of men and older people depend more on the physiological processes among organs/tissues. Based on the measurable indexes, the proposed method would support the individualized medicine prospectively.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Deep Learning-Based Low-Dose CT Image Denoising Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long lasting efforts have been made to reduce radiation dose and thus the potential radiation risk to the patient for computed tomography acquisitions without severe deterioration of image quality. To this end, numerous reconstruction and noise reduction algorithms have been developed, many of which are based on iterative reconstruction techniques, incorporating prior knowledge in the projection or image domain. Recently, deep learning-based methods became increasingly popular and a multitude of papers claim ever improving performance both quantitatively and qualitatively. In this work, we find that the lack of a common benchmark setup and flaws in the experimental setup of many publications hinder verifiability of those claims. We propose a benchmark setup to overcome those flaws and improve reproducibility and verifiability of experimental results in the field. In a comprehensive and fair evaluation of several deep learning-based low dose CT denoising algorithms, we find that most methods perform statistically similar and improvements over the past six years have been marginal at best.</description>
