      <title>GraPPI: A Retrieve-Divide-Solve GraphRAG Framework for Large-scale Protein-protein Interaction Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drug discovery (DD) has tremendously contributed to maintaining and improving public health. Hypothesizing that inhibiting protein misfolding can slow disease progression, researchers focus on target identification (Target ID) to find protein structures for drug binding. While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks have accelerated drug discovery, integrating models into cohesive workflows remains challenging. We conducted a user study with drug discovery researchers to identify the applicability of LLMs and RAGs in Target ID. We identified two main findings: 1) an LLM should provide multiple Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) based on an initial protein and protein candidates that have a therapeutic impact; 2) the model must provide the PPI and relevant explanations for better understanding. Based on these observations, we identified three limitations in previous approaches for Target ID: 1) semantic ambiguity, 2) lack of explainability, and 3) short retrieval units. To address these issues, we propose GraPPI, a large-scale knowledge graph (KG)-based retrieve-divide-solve agent pipeline RAG framework to support large-scale PPI signaling pathway exploration in understanding therapeutic impacts by decomposing the analysis of entire PPI pathways into sub-tasks focused on the analysis of PPI edges.</description>

      <title>ILETIA: An AI-enhanced method for individualized trigger-oocyte pickup interval estimation of progestin-primed ovarian stimulation protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) stands as one of the most prevalent treatments for infertility. During an IVF-ET cycle, the time interval between trigger shot and oocyte pickup (OPU) is a pivotal period for follicular maturation, which determines mature oocytes yields and impacts the success of subsequent procedures. However, accurately predicting this interval is severely hindered by the variability of clinicians'experience that often leads to suboptimal oocyte retrieval rate. To address this challenge, we propose ILETIA, the first machine learning-based method that could predict the optimal trigger-OPU interval for patients receiving progestin-primed ovarian stimulation (PPOS) protocol. Specifically, ILETIA leverages a Transformer to learn representations from clinical tabular data, and then employs gradient-boosted trees for interval prediction. For model training and evaluating, we compiled a dataset PPOS-DS of nearly ten thousand patients receiving PPOS protocol, the largest such dataset to our knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves strong performance (AUROC = 0.889), outperforming both clinicians and other widely used computational models. Moreover, ILETIA also supports premature ovulation risk prediction in a specific OPU time (AUROC = 0.838). Collectively, by enabling more precise and individualized decisions, ILETIA has the potential to improve clinical outcomes and lay the foundation for future IVF-ET research.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping in Clinical Brain Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) of the brain is an advanced MRI technique for assessing tissue characteristics based on magnetic susceptibility, which varies with the composition of the tissue, such as iron, calcium, and myelin levels. QSM consists of multiple processing steps, with various choices for each step. Despite its increasing application in detecting and monitoring neurodegenerative diseases, the impact of algorithmic choices in QSM's workflow on clinical outcomes has not been thoroughly quantified.
  Objective: This study aimed to evaluate how choices in background field removal (BFR), dipole inversion algorithms, and anatomical referencing impact the sensitivity and reproducibility error of QSM in detecting group-level and longitudinal changes in deep gray matter susceptibility in a clinical setting.
  Methods: We compared 378 different QSM pipelines using a 10-year follow-up dataset of healthy adults. We analyzed the sensitivity of pipelines to detect known aging-related susceptibility changes in the DGM over time.
  Results: We found high variability in the sensitivity of QSM pipelines to detect susceptibility changes. The study highlighted that while most pipelines could detect changes reliably, the choice of BFR algorithm and the referencing strategy substantially influenced the outcome reproducibility error and sensitivity. Notably, pipelines using RESHARP with AMP-PE, HEIDI or LSQR inversion showed the highest overall sensitivity.
  Conclusions: The findings underscore the critical influence of algorithmic choices in QSM processing on the accuracy and reliability of detecting physiological changes in the brain. This has profound implications for clinical research and trials where QSM is used as a biomarker for disease progression, highlighting that careful consideration should be given to pipeline configuration to optimize clinical outcomes.</description>

      <title>TockyPrep: Data Preprocessing Methods for Flow Cytometric Fluorescent Timer Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04111v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Fluorescent Timer proteins, which display time-dependent changes in their emission spectra, are invaluable for analyzing the temporal dynamics of cellular events at the single-cell level. We previously developed the Timer-of-cell-kinetics-and-activity (Tocky) tools, utilizing a specific Timer protein, Fast-FT, to monitor temporal changes in cellular activities. Despite their potential, the analysis of Timer fluorescence in flow cytometry is frequently compromised by variability in instrument settings and the absence of standardized preprocessing methods. The development and implementation of effective data preprocessing methods remain to be achieved.
  Results: In this study, we introduce the R package that automates the data preprocessing of Timer fluorescence data from flow cytometry experiments for quantitative analysis at single-cell level. Our aim is to standardize Timer data analysis to enhance reproducibility and accuracy across different experimental setups. The package includes a trigonometric transformation method to elucidate the dynamics of Fluorescent Timer proteins. We have identified the normalization of immature and mature Timer fluorescence data as essential for robust analysis, clarifying how this normalization affects the analysis of Timer maturation. These preprocessing methods are all encapsulated within the TockyPrep R package.
  Conclusions: TockyPrep is available for distribution via GitHub at https://github.com/MonoTockyLab/TockyPrep, providing tools for data preprocessing and basic visualization of Timer fluorescence data. This toolkit is expected to enhance the utility of experimental systems utilizing Fluorescent Timer proteins, including the Tocky tools.</description>
