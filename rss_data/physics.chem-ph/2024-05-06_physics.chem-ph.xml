      <title>Compactification of Determinant Expansions via Transcorrelation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although selected configuration interaction (SCI) algorithms can tackle much larger Hilbert spaces than the conventional full CI (FCI) method, the scaling of their computational cost with respect to the system size remains inherently exponential. Additionally, inaccuracies in describing the correlation hole at small interelectronic distances lead to the slow convergence of the electronic energy relative to the size of the one-electron basis set. To alleviate these effects, we show that the non-Hermitian, transcorrelated (TC) version of SCI significantly compactifies the determinant space, allowing to reach a given accuracy with a much smaller number of determinants. Furthermore, we note a significant acceleration in the convergence of the TC-SCI energy as the basis set size increases. The extent of this compression and the energy convergence rate are closely linked to the accuracy of the correlation factor used for the similarity transformation of the Coulombic Hamiltonian. Our systematic investigation of small molecular systems in increasingly large basis sets illustrates the magnitude of these effects.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chemistry Model of Surface Reactions and Kinetic Model of Diamond Growth: Effects of CH3 Radicals and C2H2 Molecules at Low-Temperatures CVD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this study is to explore conditions that facilitate a significant reduction in substrate temperature during diamond growth. The typical temperature for this process is around 1200K; we aim to reduce it to a much lower level. To achieve this, we need to understand processes that limit the diamond growth at low temperatures. Therefore, we developed a detailed chemical kinetic model to analyze diamond growth on the (100) surface. This model accounts for variations in substrate temperature and gas composition. Using an ab initio quantum chemistry, we calculated the reaction rates of all major gas phase reactants with the diamond surface, totaling 91 elemental surface reactions. Consistent with previous studies, the model identifies that CH3 is a major precursor of diamond growth, and the contribution from C2H2 to the growth is significantly smaller. However, C2H2 can also contribute to forming a sp2-phase instead of a sp3-phase, and this process becomes dominant below a critical temperature. As a result, C2H2 flux inhibits diamond growth at low temperatures. To quantify this deleterious process, we developed a new mechanism for sp2-phase nucleation on the (100) surface. Similar to the so-called HACA mechanism for soot formation it involves hydrogen abstraction and C2H2 addition. Consequently, optimal low-temperature CVD growth could be realized in a reactor designed to maximize the CH3 radical production, while minimizing the generation of C2H2 and other sp and sp2 hydrocarbons.</description>

      <title>Interactions and cold collisions of AlF in the ground and excited electronic states with He</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aluminium monofluoride (AlF) is a promising candidate for laser cooling and the production of dense ultracold molecular gases, thanks to its relatively high chemical stability and diagonal Frank-Condon factors. In this study, we examine the interactions and collisions of AlF in its $X^1\Sigma^+$, $a^3\Pi$, and $A^{1}\Pi$ electronic states with ground-state He using state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} quantum chemistry techniques. We construct accurate potential energy surfaces (PESs) employing either the explicitly correlated coupled-cluster CCSD(T)-F12 method augmented by the CCSDT correction or the multireference configuration-interaction method for higher-excited electronic states. Subsequently, we employ these PESs in coupled-channel calculations to determine the scattering cross-sections for AlF+He collisions and bound states of the complex. We estimate the uncertainty of the calculated PESs and apply it to assess the uncertainty of the scattering results. We find a relatively low sensitivity of the cross-sections to the variation of the PESs, but the positions of shape resonances remain uncertain. The present results are relevant for further improvements and optimizations of buffer-gas cooling of AlF molecules.</description>

      <title>Reverse Intersystem Crossing Dynamics in Vibronically Modulated Inverted Singlet-Triplet Gap System: A Wigner Phase Space Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We inspect the origin of the inverted singlet-triplet gap (INVEST) and slow change in the reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) rate with temperature, as recently observed. A Wigner phase space study reveals, that though INVEST is found at equilibrium geometry, variation in the exchange interaction and the doubles-excitation for other geometries in the harmonic region leads to non- INVEST behavior. This highlights the importance of nuclear degrees of freedom for the INVEST phenomenon and in this case, geometric puckering of the studied molecule determines INVEST and the associated rISC dynamics.</description>

      <title>Predicting the impact of water transport on carbonation-induced corrosion in variably saturated reinforced concrete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A modelling framework for predicting carbonation-induced corrosion in reinforced concrete is presented. The framework constituents include a new model for water transport in cracked concrete, a link between corrosion current density and water saturation, and a theory for characterising concrete carbonation. The theoretical framework is numerically implemented using the finite element method and model predictions are extensively benchmarked against experimental data. The results show that the model is capable of accurately predicting carbonation progress, as well as wetting and drying of cracked and uncracked concrete, revealing a very good agreement with independent experiments from a set of consistent parameters. In addition, insight is gained into the evolution of carbonation penetration and corrosion current density under periodic wetting and drying conditions. Among others, we find that cyclic wetting periods significantly speed up the carbonation progress and that the induced corrosion current density is very sensitive to concrete saturation.</description>

      <title>Fermi's golden rule rate expression for transitions due to nonadiabatic derivative couplings in the adiabatic basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from a compact but general molecular Hamiltonian expressed in the bases of adiabatic electronic states and position states of nuclei, we make careful consideration of nonadiabatic derivative coupling (NDC) terms between adiabatic states. It is clarified that the conventional use of NDC terms evaluated for an adiabatic electronic state in the textbook expression for the Fermi's golden rule (FGR) rate implicitly invokes an additional approximation that ignores non-orthogonality of adiabatic states at different geometries. Thus, we derive a well-defined FGR rate expression based on a quasi-adiabatic approximation that explicitly uses the adiabatic states and NDC terms evaluated at the minimum potential energy state of the initial adiabatic states. We then clarify conditions and approximations leading to the modeling of all the nuclear degrees of freedom as a set of harmonic oscillators, and then derive a closed form FGR rate expression while accounting for the non-Condon effects due to momenta in NDC terms explicitly. The resulting rate expression includes terms due to quadratic contribution of NDC terms and also their couplings to Franck-Condon modes. Model calculations for the case where nuclear vibrations consist of both a sharp high frequency mode and a broad Ohmic bath spectral density illustrate new features and implications of the rate expression.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystal Orbital Overlap Population (COOP) is one of the effective tools for chemical-bonding analysis, and thus it has been utilized in the materials development and characterization. In this study, we developed a code to perform the COOP-based chemical-bonding analysis based on the wavefunction obtained from a first principles all-electron calculation with numeric atom-centered orbitals. The chemical-bonding analysis using the developed code was demonstrated for F2 and Si. Furthermore, we applied the method to analyze the chemical-bonding changes associated with a Li intercalation in three representative layered materials: graphite, MoS2, and ZrNCl, because of their great industrial importance, particularly for the applications in battery and superconducting materials. The COOP analysis provided some insights for understanding the intercalation mechanism and the stability of the intercalated materials from a chemical-bonding viewpoint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the transverse and longitudinal properties of hard disks confined in narrow channels. We employ an exact mapping of the system onto a one-dimensional polydisperse, nonadditive mixture of hard rods with equal chemical potentials. We compute various thermodynamic properties, including the transverse and longitudinal equations of state, along with their behaviors at both low and high densities. Structural properties are analyzed using the two-body correlation function and the radial distribution function, tailored for the highly anisotropic geometry of this system. The results are corroborated by computer simulations.</description>

      <title>Exploiting the hessian for a better convergence of the SCF RDMFT procedure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One-body reduced density matrix functional theory (RDMFT) provides an alternative to Density Functional Theory (DFT), able to treat static correlation while keeping a relatively low computation scaling. Its disadvantageous cost comes mainly from a slow convergence of the self-consistent energy optimisation. To improve on that problem, we propose in this work to use the hessian of the energy, including the coupling term. We show that using the exact hessian is very effective in reducing the number of iterations. However, since the exact hessian is too expensive to use in practice, we test different approximations based on an inexpensive exact part and/or BFGS updates.</description>

      <title>Resilience of Hund's rule in the Chemical Space of Small Organic Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13801v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We embark on a quest to identify small molecules in the chemical space that can potentially violate Hund's rule. Utilizing twelve TDDFT approximations and the ADC(2) many-body method, we report the energies of S$_1$ and T$_1$ excited states of 12,880 closed-shell organic molecules within the bigQM7$\omega$ dataset with up to 7 CONF atoms. In this comprehensive dataset, none of the molecules, in their minimum energy geometry, exhibit a negative S$_1$-T$_1$ energy gap at the ADC($2$) level while several molecules display values $&lt;0.1$ eV. The spin-component-scaled double-hybrid method, SCS-PBE-QIDH, demonstrates the best agreement with ADC(2). Yet, at this level, a few molecules with a strained $sp^3$-N center turn out as false-positives with the S$_1$ state lower in energy than T$_1$. We investigate a prototypical cage molecule with an energy gap $&lt;-0.2$ eV, which a closer examination revealed as another false positive. We conclude that in the chemical space of small closed-shell organic molecules, it is possible to identify geometric and electronic structural features giving rise to S$_1$-T$_1$ degeneracy; still, there is no evidence of a negative gap. We share the dataset generated for this study as a module, to facilitate seamless molecular discovery through data mining.</description>

      <title>SCINE -- Software for Chemical Interaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02865v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The software for chemical interaction networks (SCINE) project aims at pushing the frontier of quantum chemical calculations on molecular structures to a new level. While calculations on individual structures as well as on simple relations between them e.g., as given by an intrinsic reaction coordinate) have become routine in chemistry, new developments have pushed the frontier in the field to high-throughput calculations. Chemical relations may be created by a search for specific molecular properties in a molecular design attempt or they can be defined by a set of elementary reaction steps that form a chemical reaction network. The software modules of SCINE have been designed to facilitate such studies. The features of the modules are (i) general applicability of the applied methodologies ranging from electronic structure (no restriction to specific elements of the periodic table) to microkinetic modeling (with little restrictions on molecularity), full modularity so that SCINE modules can also be applied as stand-alone programs or be exchanged for external software packages that fulfill a similar purpose (to increase options for computational campaigns and to provide alternatives in case of tasks that are hard or impossible to accomplish with certain programs), (ii) high stability and autonomous operations so that control and steering by an operator is as easy as possible, and (iii) easy embedding into complex heterogeneous environments for molecular structures taken individually or in the context of a reaction network. A graphical user interface unites all modules and ensures interoperability. All components of the software have been made available open source and free of charge.</description>

      <title>FeNNol: an Efficient and Flexible Library for Building Force-field-enhanced Neural Network Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural network interatomic potentials (NNPs) have recently proven to be powerful tools to accurately model complex molecular systems while bypassing the high numerical cost of ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations. In recent years, numerous advances in model architectures as well as the development of hybrid models combining machine-learning (ML) with more traditional, physically-motivated, force-field interactions have considerably increased the design space of ML potentials. In this paper, we present FeNNol, a new library for building, training and running force-field-enhanced neural network potentials. It provides a flexible and modular system for building hybrid models, allowing to easily combine state-of-the-art embeddings with ML-parameterized physical interaction terms without the need for explicit programming. Furthermore, FeNNol leverages the automatic differentiation and just-in-time compilation features of the Jax Python library to enable fast evaluation of NNPs, shrinking the performance gap between ML potentials and standard force-fields. This is demonstrated with the popular ANI-2x model reaching simulation speeds nearly on par with the AMOEBA polarizable force-field on commodity GPUs (GPU=Graphics processing unit). We hope that FeNNol will facilitate the development and application of new hybrid NNP architectures for a wide range of molecular simulation problems.</description>

      <title>Cousins Of The Vendi Score: A Family Of Similarity-Based Diversity Metrics For Science And Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12952v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring diversity accurately is important for many scientific fields, including machine learning (ML), ecology, and chemistry. The Vendi Score was introduced as a generic similarity-based diversity metric that extends the Hill number of order q=1 by leveraging ideas from quantum statistical mechanics. Contrary to many diversity metrics in ecology, the Vendi Score accounts for similarity and does not require knowledge of the prevalence of the categories in the collection to be evaluated for diversity. However, the Vendi Score treats each item in a given collection with a level of sensitivity proportional to the item's prevalence. This is undesirable in settings where there is a significant imbalance in item prevalence. In this paper, we extend the other Hill numbers using similarity to provide flexibility in allocating sensitivity to rare or common items. This leads to a family of diversity metrics -- Vendi scores with different levels of sensitivity -- that can be used in a variety of applications. We study the properties of the scores in a synthetic controlled setting where the ground truth diversity is known. We then test their utility in improving molecular simulations via Vendi Sampling. Finally, we use the Vendi scores to better understand the behavior of image generative models in terms of memorization, duplication, diversity, and sample quality.</description>

      <title>Global analysis of CP-violation in atoms, molecules and role of medium-heavy systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detection of parity (P) and time-reversal (T) symmetry-odd electric dipole moments (EDMs) within currently achievable resolution would evidence physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Via the CPT-theorem, which includes charge conjugation (C), such low-energy searches complement high-energy physics experiments that probe CP-violation up to the TeV scale. Heavy-elemental atoms and molecules are considered to be among the most promising candidates for a first direct detection of P,T-violation due to enhancement effects that increase steeply with increasing nuclear charge number $Z$. However, different P,T-odd sources on the subatomic level can contribute to molecular or atomic EDMs, which are target of measurements, and this complicates obtaining rigorous bounds on P,T-violation on a fundamental level. Consequently, several experiments of complementary sensitivity to these individual P,T-odd sources are required for this purpose. Herein, a simply-applicable qualitative model is developed for global analysis of the P,T-odd parameter space from an electronic-structure theory perspective. Rules of thumb are derived for the choice of atoms and molecules in terms of their angular momenta and nuclear charge number. Contrary to naive expectations from $Z$-scaling laws, it is demonstrated that medium-heavy molecules with $Z\leq54$ can be of great value to tighten global bounds on P,T-violating parameters, in particular, if the number of complementary experiments increases. The model is confirmed by explicit density functional theory calculations of all relevant P,T-odd electronic structure parameters in systems that were used in past experiments or are of current interest for future experiments, respectively: the atoms Xe, Cs, Yb, Hg, Tl, Ra, Fr and the molecules CaOH, SrOH, YO, CdH, BaF, YbF, YbOH, HfF$^+$, WC, TlF, PbO, RaF, ThO, ThF$^+$ and PaF$^{3+}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of semiconductor nanocrystals in scalable quantum technologies requires characterization of the exciton coherence dynamics in an \emph{ensemble} of electronically isolated crystals in which system-bath interactions are nevertheless strong. In this communication, we identify signatures of Fano-like interference between excitons and photocarriers in the coherent two-dimensional photoluminescence excitation spectral lineshapes of mixed lead-halide perovskite nanocrystals in dilute solution. Specifically, by tuning the femtosecond-pulse spectrum, we show such interference in an intermediate coupling regime, which is evident in the coherent lineshape when simultaneously exciting the exciton and the free-carrier band at higher energy. We conclude that this interference is an intrinsic effect that will be consequential in the quantum dynamics of the system and will thus dictate decoherence dynamics, with consequences in their application in quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an autocatalytic aggregation model in which the rate at which two clusters merge to form a cluster is controlled by the presence of a third "catalytic" cluster whose mass must equal to the mass of one of the reaction partners. The catalyst is unaffected by the joining event and is available to either participate in or catalyze subsequent reactions. This model is meant to mimic the self-replicating reactions that occur in models for the origin of life. We solve the kinetics of this catalytic coagulation model for the case of mass-independent rates and show that the total cluster density decays as $t^{-1/3}$, while the density of clusters of any fixed mass decays as $t^{-2/3}$. These behaviors contrast with the corresponding $t^{-1}$ and $t^{-2}$ scalings for classic aggregation. We extend our model to mass-dependent reaction rates, to situations where only "magic" mass clusters can catalyze reactions, and to include steady monomer input.</description>
