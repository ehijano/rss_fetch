      <title>On the equilibrium measure for the Lukyanov integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2000, Lukyanov conjectured that a certain ratio of $N$-fold integrals should provide access, in the large-$N$ regime, to the ground state expectation value of the exponential of the Sinh-Gordon quantum field in 1+1 dimensions and finite volume $R$. This work aims at rigorously constructing the fundamental objects necessary to address the large-$N$ analysis of such integrals. More precisely, we construct and establish the main properties of the the equilibrium measure minimising a certain $N$-dependent energy functional that naturally arises in the study of the leading large-$N$ behaviour of the Lukyanov integral. Our construction allows us to heuristically advocate the leading term in the large-$N$ asymptotic behaviour of the mentioned ratio of Lukyanov integrals, hence supporting Lukyanov's prediction -- obtained by other means -- on the exponent $\sigma$ of the power-law $N^{\sigma}$ term of its asymptotic expansion as $N\rightarrow + \infty$.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic and Macroscopic Entropy Balance Equations in a Stochastic Dynamics and Its Deterministic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropy, its production, and its change in a dynamical system can be understood from either a fully stochastic dynamic description or from a deterministic dynamics exhibiting chaotic behavior. By taking the former approach based on the general diffusion process with diffusion $\tfrac{1}{\alpha}{\bf D}(\bf x)$ and drift $\bf b(\bf x)$, where $\alpha$ represents the ``size parameter'' of a system, we show that there are two distinctly different entropy balance equations. One reads ${\rm d} S^{(\alpha)}/{\rm d} t = e^{(\alpha)}_p + Q^{(\alpha)}_{ex}$ for all $\alpha$. However, the leading $\alpha$-order, ``extensive'', terms of the entropy production rate $e^{(\alpha)}_p$ and heat exchange rate $Q^{(\alpha)}_{ex}$ are exactly cancelled. Therefore, in the asymptotic limit of $\alpha\to\infty$, there is a second, local ${\rm d} S/{\rm d} t = \nabla\cdot{\bf b}({\bf x}(t))+\left({\bf D}:{\bf \Sigma}^{-1}\right)({\bf x}(t))$ on the order of $O(1)$, where $\tfrac{1}{\alpha}{\bf D}(\bf x(t))$ represents the randomness generated in the dynamics usually represented by metric entropy, and $\tfrac{1}{\alpha}{\bf \Sigma}({\bf x}(t))$ is the covariance matrix of the local Gaussian description at ${\bf x}(t)$, which is a solution to the ordinary differential equation $\dot{\bf x}={\bf b}(\bf x)$ at time $t$. This latter equation is akin to the notions of volume-preserving conservative dynamics and entropy production in the deterministic dynamic approach to nonequilibrium thermodynamics {\it \`{a} la} D. Ruelle. As a continuation of [17], mathematical details with sufficient care are given in four Appendices.</description>

      <title>Monodromies of Second Order $q$-difference Equations from the WKB Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the space of monodromy data of second order $q$-difference equations through the framework of WKB analysis. We compute the connection matrices associated to the Stokes phenomenon of WKB wavefunctions and develop a general framework to parameterize monodromies of $q$-difference equations. Computations of monodromies are illustrated with explicit examples, including a $q$-Mathieu equation and its degenerations. In all examples we show that the monodromy around the origin of $\mathbb{C}^*$ admits an expansion in terms of Voros symbols, or exponentiated quantum periods, with integer coefficients. Physically these monodromies correspond to expectation values of Wilson line operators in five dimensional quantum field theories with minimal supersymmetry. In the case of the $q$-Mathieu equation, we show that the trace of the monodromy can be identified with the Hamiltonian of a corresponding $q$-Painlev\'e equation.</description>

      <title>Capped Vertex Functions for $\text{Hilb}^n (\mathbb{C}^2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain explicit formulas for capped descendent vertex functions of $\text{Hilb}^n(\mathbb{C}^2)$ for descendents given by chern classes of tautological bundles. The expression is the result of twisting a well known generating function for normalized Macdonald polynomials. This gives an explicit description of the rational function the capped vertex is an expansion of. Along the way we prove various limit expressions of the capping operator and the bare vertex function.</description>

      <title>Baker-Akhiezer function for the deformed root system $BC(l,1)$ and bispectrality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a Sergeev-Veselov difference operator of rational Macdonald-Ruijsenaars (MR) type for the deformed root system $BC(l,1)$ preserves a ring of quasi-invariants in the case of non-negative integer values of the multiplicity parameters. We prove that in this case the operator admits a (multidimensional) Baker-Akhiezer eigenfunction, which depends on spectral parameters and which is, moreover, as a function of the spectral variables an eigenfunction for the (trigonometric) generalised Calogero-Moser-Sutherland (CMS) Hamiltonian for $BC(l,1)$. By an analytic continuation argument, we generalise this eigenfunction also to the case of more general complex values of the multiplicities. This leads to a bispectral duality statement for the corresponding MR and CMS systems of type $BC(l,1)$.</description>

      <title>Volichenko-type metasymmetry of braided Majorana qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents different mathematical structures connected with the parastatistics of braided Majorana qubits and clarifies their role; in particular, mixed-bracket Heisenberg-Lie algebras are introduced. These algebras belong to a more general framework than the Volichenko algebras defined in 1990 by Leites-Serganova as metasymmetries which do not respect even/odd gradings and lead to mixed brackets interpolating ordinary commutators and anticommutators. In a previous paper braided $Z_2$-graded Majorana qubits were first-quantized within a graded Hopf algebra framework endowed with a braided tensor product. The resulting system admits truncations at roots of unity and realizes, for a given integer $s=2,3,4,\ldots$, an interpolation between ordinary Majorana fermions (recovered at $s=2$) and bosons (recovered in the $s\rightarrow \infty$ limit); it implements a parastatistics where at most $s-1$ indistinguishable particles are accommodated in a multi-particle sector. The structures discussed in this work are: - the quantum group interpretation of the roots of unity truncations recovered from reps of the quantum superalgebra ${\cal U}_q({{osp}}(1|2))$; - the reconstruction, via suitable intertwining operators, of the braided tensor products as ordinary tensor products; - the introduction of mixed brackets for the braided creation/annihilation operators which define generalized Heisenberg-Lie algebras; - the $s\rightarrow \infty$ untruncated limit of the mixed-bracket Heisenberg-Lie algebras producing parafermionic oscillators; - (meta)symmetries of ordinary differential equations given by matrix Schr\"{o}dinger equations in $0+1$ dimension induced by the braided creation/annihilation operators; - in the special case of a third root of unity truncation, a nonminimal realization of the intertwining operators defines the system as a ternary algebra.</description>

      <title>Remarks on the geometric structure of port-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the geometric structure of port-Hamiltonian systems. Starting with the intuitive understanding that port-Hamiltonian systems are "in between" certain closed Hamiltonian systems, the geometric structure of port-Hamiltonian systems must be "in between" the geometric structures of the latter systems. These are Courant algebroids; and hence the geometric structures should be related by Courant algebroid morphisms. Using this idea, we propose a definition of an intrinsic geometric structure and show that it is unique, if it exists.</description>

      <title>The Optimal Reduction of a 2-Body Problem in R^3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we describe optimal reduction for the system of two bodies in $\mathbb{R}^3$ whose Hamiltonian is invariant under rotations and translations. In doing this, we introduce parametrizations and charts which help giving explicit expressions in order to deal with geometric and dynamical aspects of the reduction process. For this system, the standard assumptions of the Marsden-Weinstein reduction process are only partially satisfied while optimal reduction can be readily applied, and we study a comparison between those two reduction processes. We describe potential applications to the study of Post-Newtonian Hamiltonian systems for binary systems in astronomy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If the Universe is closed, there must exist a constant and positive energy density of vacuum (cosmological constant). By analyzing the McVittie metric, we show that in the expanding Universe: the Hubble parameters at the event horizons of all centrally symmetric black holes are equal and related to the cosmological constant, black holes do not grow with the expansion of the Universe, and different regions of the Universe expand at different rates (Hubble tension).</description>

      <title>Can you hear the Planck mass?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the Laplacian of an $n$-Riemannian manifold $X$, the Weyl law states that the $k$-th eigenvalue is asymptotically proportional to $(k/V)^{2/n}$, where $V$ is the volume of $X$. We show that this result can be derived via physical considerations by demanding that the gravitational potential for a compactification on $X$ behaves in the expected $(4+n)$-dimensional way at short distances. In simple product compactifications, when particle motion on $X$ is ergodic, for large $k$ the eigenfunctions oscillate around a constant, and the argument is relatively straightforward. The Weyl law thus allows to reconstruct the four-dimensional Planck mass from the asymptotics of the masses of the spin 2 Kaluza--Klein modes. For warped compactifications, a puzzle appears: the Weyl law still depends on the ordinary volume $V$, while the Planck mass famously depends on a weighted volume obtained as an integral of the warping function. We resolve this tension by arguing that in the ergodic case the eigenfunctions oscillate now around a power of the warping function rather than around a constant, a property that we call weighted quantum ergodicity. This has implications for the problem of gravity localization, which we discuss. We show that for spaces with D$p$-brane singularities the spectrum is discrete only for $p =6,7,8$, and for these cases we rigorously prove the Weyl law by applying modern techniques from RCD theory.</description>

      <title>Local Hamiltonian dynamics from non-local action principles and applications to binary systems in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of finite-dimensional dynamical systems whose equations of motion are derived from a non-local-in-time action principle. The action functional has a zeroth order piece derived from a local Hamiltonian and a perturbation in the form of a non-local functional of the trajectory on phase space. We prove that the dynamics of these systems admits a local Hamiltonian description to all order in the perturbation and we provide explicit formulae for the $\mathcal{N}^{\text{th}}$ order Hamiltonian and symplectic form in terms of the $(\mathcal{N}-1)^{\text{th}}$ order Hamiltonian flow. In the context of general relativity, these systems arise in the study of binary systems such as pairs of black holes or neutron stars in the small mass-ratio and post-Newtonian approximations. We provide applications of the formalism to binary systems in these regimes.</description>

      <title>Virial identities across the spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virial-like identities obtained through Derrick's scaling argument are powerful, multi-purpose tools to study general relativistic models. Applications comprise establishing no-go/hair theorems and numerical accuracy tests. In the presence of a horizon (\textit{aka} boundary), the spacetime can be divided into regions, each with its own identity. So far, such identities have only been computed in the region outside the event horizon; however, adding a positive cosmological constant endows an additional boundary (the cosmological horizon), with the region between the latter and the former of particular interest. In this letter, by performing a radial coordinate transformation, we generalise Derrick's scaling argument to compute virial identities \textit{across the whole} non-asymptotically flat spacetimes. The developed method is applied to the entire Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter spacetime. A convenient gauge that trivialises the gravitational contribution to the identity between horizons is also found.</description>

      <title>The Lagrangian formulation for wave motion with a shear current and surface tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lagrangian formulation for the irrotational wave motion is straightforward and follows from a Lagrangian functional which is the difference between the kinetic and the potential energy of the system. In the case of fluid with constant vorticity, which arises for example when a shear current is present, the separation of the energy into kinetic and potential is not at all obvious and neither is the Lagrangian formulation of the problem. Nevertheless, we use the known Hamiltonian formulation of the problem in this case to obtain the Lagrangian density function, and utilising the Euler-Lagrange equations we proceed to derive some model equations for different propagation regimes. While the long-wave regime reproduces the well known KdV equation, the short- and intermediate long wave regimes lead to highly nonlinear and nonlocal evolution equations.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase transition of infrared radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a phase transition of infrared radiation, driven by quantum fluctuations, which takes place at the boundary of (the conformal diagram of) Minkowski spacetime. Specifically, we consider a family of states interpolating between the vacuum and the Kraus-Polley-Reents infravacuum. A state from this family can be imagined as a static source emitting flashes of infrared radiation in distant past. The flashes are in suitable squeezed states and the time intervals between them are controlled by a certain parameter r. For r&lt;0 the states are lightcone normal, thus physically indistinguishable from local excitations of the vacuum. They suffer from the usual infrared problems such as disintegration of the Bloch-Nordsieck S-matrix and rotational symmetry breaking by soft photon clouds. However, for r&gt;0 lightcone normality breaks down, the S-matrix is stabilized by the Kraus-Polley-Reents mechanism and the rotational symmetry is restored. We interpret these two situations as ordered (r&lt;0) and disordered (r&gt;0) phase of infrared radiation, and show that they can be distinguished by asymptotic fluctuations of the fields. We also determine the singular behaviour of some S-matrix elements near the critical point r=0.</description>

Abstract: In this note we consider a class of $q$-hypergeometric equations describing the quantum difference equation for the cotangent bundle over projective space $X=T^{*}\mathbb{P}^n$ . We show that over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ these equations are equipped with the Frobenius action $z\to z^p$. We obtain an explicit formula for the constant term of the Frobenius intertwiner in therms of $p$-adic $q$-gamma function of Koblitz. In the limit $q\to 1$ our formula degenerates to the Frobenius intertwiners for the hypergeometric differential equations discovered by B.Dwork.</description>

      <title>Physical interpretations of infinite symmetries and the establishment of unified hierarchies in supersymmetric, ren-symmetric, and classical integrable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quest to elucidate potential physical interpretations of infinitely many symmetries and conservation laws inherent in integrable systems constitutes a longstanding challenge within the scientific communities of physics and mathematics. This letter delves into this unresolved issue through an unconventional lens. For a integrable system, there exist various categories of n-wave solutions, such as the n-soliton, multiple breathers, complexitons, and the n-periodic wave solutions, wherein n denotes an arbitrary integer that can approach infinity. Each subwave comprising the n-wave solution may possess certain free parameters, including center parameters, width parameters, and periodic parameters. It is evident that these solutions are invariant with respect to all free parameters. We postulate that the entirety of the recognized infinitely many symmetries merely constitute linear combinations of these finite wave parameter translation symmetries. This conjecture appears to hold true for all integrable systems with n-wave solutions. By considering the KdV equation and the Burgers equation as exemplar cases, the conjecture is substantiated for the n-soliton solutions. It is unequivocal that any linear combination of the wave parameter translation symmetries retains its status as a symmetry associated with the particular solution. This observation suggests that by introducing a ren-variable and a ren-symmetric derivative which serve as generalizations of the Grassmann variable and the super derivatives, it may be feasible to unify classical integrable systems, supersymmetric integrable systems, and ren-symmetric integrable systems within a cohesive hierarchical framework. Notably, a ren-symmetric integrable Burgers hierarchy is explicitly derived. Both the supersymmetric and the classical integrable hierarchies are encompassed within the ren-symmetric integrable hierarchy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we completely settle the Almgren problem in $\mathbb R^3$ under some generic conditions on the potential and tension functions. The problem, among other things, appears in classical thermodynamics when one is to understand if minimizing the free energy with convex potential and under a mass constraint generates a convex crystal. Our new idea in proving a three-dimensional convexity theorem is to utilize a stability theorem when $m$ is small, convexity when $m$ is small, and the first variation PDE with a new maximum principle approach.</description>

Abstract: For a class of nonlinear hyperbolic systems of second order the paper shows that all Lax modes associated with their first-order formulations are linearly degenerate. This property holds for recently considered models of dissipative relativistic fluid dynamics, supporting the possibility that solutions to these models generally avoid singularity formation.</description>

Abstract: In the present work, we show the existence and uniqueness of the two-dimensional turbulent vorticity term under conditions given on the weak solutions to the classical incompressible Navier-Stokes problem in a compact domain $R$ with periodic boundary conditions and initial conditions in Sobolev space $H^m(R)$. To achieve this, we derive a pressureless incompressible system and calculate kinetic energy quantities on the turbulent vorticity from the properties of the classical curl. Finally, since the system obtained is algebraic, we experimented with the possibilities of reducing it by applying the Rosenfeld-Groebner algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce twisted quantum $K$-rings, defined via twisted $K$-theoretic Gromov-Witten invariants. We develop a toolkit for computing relations by adapting some results about ordinary quantum K rings to our setting, and discuss some applications, including Ruan-Zhang's quantum $K$-theory with level structure, and complete intersections inside projective space, confirming some predictions coming from physics.
  In addition, we formulate a ring-theoretic abelian/non-abelian correspondence conjecture, relating the quantum K-ring of a GIT quotient $X//G$ to a certain twist of the quantum K-ring of $X//T$, the quotient by the maximal torus. We prove this conjecture for the case of Grassmanians, and use this to give another proof of the Whitney relations of Mihalcea-Gu-Sharpe-Zhou.</description>

      <title>Intertwining and propagation of mixtures for generalized KMP models and harmonic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of stochastic models of mass transport on discrete vertex set $V$. For these models, a one-parameter family of homogeneous product measures $\otimes_{i\in V} \nu_\theta$ is reversible. We prove that the set of mixtures of inhomogeneous product measures with equilibrium marginals, i.e., the set of measures of the form \[ \int\Big(\bigotimes_{i\in V} \nu_{\theta_i}\Big) \,\Xi(\prod_{i\in V}d\theta_i) \] is left invariant by the dynamics in the course of time, and the ``mixing measure'' $\Xi$ evolves according to a Markov process which we then call ``the hidden parameter model''. This generalizes results from [7] to a larger class of models and on more general graphs. The class of models includes discrete and continuous generalized KMP models, as well as discrete and continuous harmonic models. The results imply that in all these models, the non-equilibrium steady state of their reservoir driven version is a mixture of product measures where the mixing measure is in turn the stationary state of the corresponding ``hidden parameter model''. For the boundary-driven harmonic models on the chain $\{1,\ldots, N\}$ with nearest neighbor edges, we recover that the stationary measure of the hidden parameter model is the joint distribution of the ordered Dirichlet distribution (cf. [3]), with a purely probabilistic proof based on a spatial Markov property of the hidden parameter model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism is applied to quantise the ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric generalisation of the Freedman-Townsend (FT) model proposed by Lindstr\"om and Ro\v{c}ek in 1983. This super FT theory describes a non-Abelian tensor multiplet and is known to be classically equivalent to a supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model. Using path integral considerations, we demonstrate that this equivalence holds at the quantum level. A modified Faddeev-Popov procedure is employed to quantise models for the ${\cal N}=2$ tensor multiplet in harmonic superspace.</description>

      <title>Exact quantization conditions and full transseries structures for ${\cal PT}$ symmetric anharmonic oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study exact Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin analysis (EWKB) for a ${\cal PT}$ symmetric quantum mechanics (QM) defined by the potential that $V_{\cal PT}(x) = \omega^2 x^2 + g x^{2 K} (i x)^{\varepsilon}$ with $\omega \in {\mathbb R}_{\ge 0}$, $g \in {\mathbb R}_{&gt;0}$ and $K, \varepsilon \in {\mathbb N}$ to clarify its perturbative/non-perturbative structure. In our analysis, we mainly consider the massless cases, i.e., $\omega = 0$, and derive the exact quantization conditions (QCs) for arbitrary $(K,\varepsilon)$ including all perturbative/non-perturbative corrections. From the exact QCs, we clarify full transseries structure of the energy spectra with respect to the inverse energy level expansion, and then formulate the Gutzwiller trace formula, the spectral summation form, and the Euclidean path-integral. For the massive cases, i.e., $\omega &gt; 0$, we show the fact that, by requiring existence of solution of the exact QCs, the path of analytic continuation in EWKB is uniquely determined for a given $N = 2K + \varepsilon$, and in consequence the exact QCs, the energy spectra, and the three formulas are all perturbative. Similarities to Hermitian QMs and resurgence are also discussed as additional remarks.</description>

      <title>The stability analysis of volatile liquid films in different evaporation regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of the evaporation regime on the stability of a volatile liquid film flowing over an inclined heated surface while considering the dynamics of both the liquid phase and the diffusion of its vapor. We (i) modify the kinetic-diffusion evaporation model of Sultan et al. [Sultan et al., J. Fluid Mech. 543, 183, (2005)] to allow for the reduction in film thickness caused by evaporative mass loss, (ii) combine it with the liquid film formulation of Joo et al. [Joo et al., J. Fluid Mech. 230, 117, (1991)], and then (iii) utilize long-wave theory to derive a governing equation encapsulating the effects of inertia, hydrostatic pressure, surface tension, thermocapillarity, and evaporation. The system's dispersion relationship reveals that the Marangoni effect has two distinct components. The first results from surface tension gradients driven by the uneven heating of the liquid interface and is always destabilizing, while the second arises from surface tension gradients caused by imbalances in its latent cooling tied to vapor diffusion above it and is either stabilizing or destabilizing depending on the evaporation regime. These two components interact with evaporative mass loss and vapor recoil in a rich and dynamic manner. Moreover, we identify an evaporation regime where the kinetic and diffusion phenomena are precisely balanced and we clarify the dependence of the mass loss instability on the wave number, which we attribute to the presence of a variable vapor gradient above the liquid. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of film thinning on its stability at the two opposing limits of the evaporation regime. Finally, we conduct a spatiotemporal analysis which indicates that the strength of vapor diffusion effects is generally correlated with a shift towards absolute instability, while the thinning of the film can cause convective-to-absolute-to-convective transitions.</description>

      <title>The system of the vortex-like structures: the viewpoint on a turbulence modelling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study we suggest new approach to turbulence modeling. To develop this approach, we construct the set of the vortex-like dynamical systems evolving in the space $E_3$. These systems are constructed using the AKNS hierarchy so that they generalize thin closed vortex filament described in the local induction approximation. We construct and investigate the Hamiltonian dynamics of these systems in terms of the non - standard variables. We formulate the principles of quantization these systems focusing on the quantum description of the filaments with linearized dynamics. To describe the energy of vortex-like structures, we apply a new method based on the use of the central extended Galilei group. In a special case, we calculate the energy levels of a system of quantized vortices. The proposed approach makes it possible to describe both the interaction of such vortex - like filaments and the processes of their creation and annihilation in a natural way. As a result, we have constructed a quantum turbulent flow model that demonstrates the relationship between stochastic and integrable dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using Chern-Simons formulation, we investigate higher spin (HS) black holes in AdS$_{3}$ with soft Heisenberg hair and establish linkage with the real forms of the underlying complexified gauge symmetries taken here as $SL(N,C)_{L}\times SL(N,C)_{R}.$ We study the various conserved currents characterizing the HS black flowers (HS-BF) and show that they can be formed of layers indexed by the elements of the centre of the gauge symmetry. This feature follows from requiring the holonomy of the asymptotic gauge connection around the thermal cycle to sit in the centre $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ of the symmetry group. With regard to the compact subgroups of the real forms of the complexified gauge symmetry, we calculate the entropies of the HS-BF and verify that, unless we are considering trivial holonomies, there are no continuous paths joining the HS-BF to the core spin 2 black holes. As explicit illustrations, we give quantum field realisations of the soft Heisenberg hair in terms of bosonic and fermionic primary conformal fields and compute the HS-BF entropy as a function of the number of fermions occupying the ground state of the Heisenberg soft hair.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a uniform trigonometric $R$-matrix for the adjoint representations on the exceptional series. The exceptional series is a finite list of points on a projective line with a simple Lie algebra attached to each point. This list of Lie algebras includes the five exceptional Lie algebras. For $L$ a simple Lie algebra there is a rational $R$-matrix in $\mathrm{End}_L(\otimes^2(L\oplus I))$ which has a quantum deformation to a trigonometric $R$-matrix. We construct a sixteen dimensional algebra, $A^\square(\mathit{2})$, which interpolates the quantum deformations of the algebras $\mathrm{End}_L(\otimes^2(L\oplus I))$ and a 287 dimensional algebra, $A^\square(\mathit{3})$, which interpolates the quantum deformations of the algebras $\mathrm{End}_L(\otimes^3(L\oplus I))$. Then we construct an $R$-matrix in $A^\square(\mathit{2})$ which satisfies the Yang--Baxter equation in $A^\square(\mathit{3})$ and which interpolates the trigonometric $R$-matrices for the points in the exceptional series.</description>

      <title>The Hadamard condition on a Cauchy surface and the renormalized stress-energy tensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a Cauchy surface in a curved spacetime and a suitably defined quantum state on the CCR algebra of the Klein Gordon quantum field on that surface, we show, by expanding the squared spacetime geodesic distance and the '$U$' and '$V$' Hadamard coefficients (and suitable derivatives thereof) in sufficiently accurate covariant Taylor expansions on the surface that the renormalized expectation value of the quantum stress-energy tensor on the surface is determined by the geometry of the surface and the first 4 time derivatives of the metric off the surface, in addition to the Cauchy data for the field's two-point function. This result has been anticipated in and is motivated by a previous investigation by the authors on the initial value problem in semiclassical gravity, for which the geometric initial data corresponds {\it a priori} to the metric on the surface and up to 3 time derivatives off the surface, but where it was argued that the fourth derivative can be obtained with aid of the field equations on the initial surface.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Quantization and General Constraint Structure of a Prototypical Second-Class System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a general prototypical constrained Hamiltonian system with a broad application in quantum field theory and similar contexts where dynamics is defined through a functional action obeying a stationarity principle. The prototypical model amounts to a Dirac-Bergmann singular system, whose constraints restrict the actual dynamics to occur within a differential submanifold, as is the case in the major part of field theoretical models with gauge symmetry. We apply the Dirac-Bergmann algorithm in its full generality unraveling a total of $4m$ second-class constraints and obtain the corresponding Dirac brackets algebra in phase space. We follow with the Faddeev-Jackiw-Barcelos-Wotzasek approach in which the geometric character of the mentioned submanifold is emphasized by means of an internal metric function encoding its symplectic properties. We consider two straightforward examples, applying our general results to constrained motion along a toroidal geometry and to a Lorentz violating toy model in field theory. Since toroidal geometry has been recently used in cosmological models, we suggest how our results could lead to different proposals for the shape of the universe in cosmology.</description>

Abstract: We provide a concise PDE-based proof of anomalous diffusion in the Kraichan model -- a stochastic, white-in-time model of passive scalar turbulence. That is, we show an exponential rate of $L^2$ decay in expectation of a passive scalar advected by a certain white-in-time, correlated-in-space, divergence-free Gaussian field, uniform in the initial data and the diffusivity of the passive scalar. Additionally, we provide examples of correlated-in-time versions of the Kraichnan model which fail to exhibit anomalous diffusion despite their (formal) white-in-time limits exhibiting anomalous diffusion. As part of this analysis, we prove that anomalous diffusion of a scalar advected by some flow implies non-uniqueness of the ODE trajectories of that flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sensitivity of an eigenvalue $\lambda_i$ to the perturbation of matrix elements is controlled by the eigenvalue condition number defined as $\kappa_i = \sqrt{\left&lt; L_i | L_i\right&gt; \left&lt; R_i|R_i \right&gt; }$, where $\left&lt;L_i\right|$ and $\left|R_i\right&gt;$ are left and right eigenvectors to the eigenvalue $\lambda_i$. In Random Matrix Theory the squared eigenvalue condition number is also known as the eigenvector self-overlap. In this work we calculate the asymptotics of the joint probability density function of the real eigenvalue and the square of the corresponding eigenvalue condition number for the real elliptic ensemble in the double scaling regime of almost Hermiticity and close to the edge of the spectrum. As a byproduct, we also calculate the one-parameter deformation of the Scorer's function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a duality between spectral triples and pseudo-Riemannian spectral triples. This duality is based on the fundamental connection between twists and Krein products. A concept of isomorphism of spectral triples is introduced, transforming one spectral triple to the dual one. In the case of even-dimensional manifolds, we show how this implements a signature change through the parity operator, given by the twist itself. The signature change transformation is then only parametrized by one operator, given by the unitary that implements the twist. This unitary is a central ingredient of the approach, being directly connected to the Krein product, the twist and the parity operator that implement the signature change.</description>

Abstract: We study the action of the free quantum Hamiltonian in the Schr\"odinger representation on functional spaces generated by Gaussian states with boundary conditions set by localized external sources. It turns out that inspite of very general initial assumptions the proposed scheme requires at least two sources at a distance limited by non-zero constant of the model. In this way we provide example of quntum field evolved by the action of the free Hamiltonian confining external sources which set boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Shadow Hamiltonians of structure-preserving integrators for Nambu mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symplectic integrators are widely implemented numerical integrators for Hamiltonian mechanics, which preserve the Hamiltonian structure (symplecticity) of the system. Although the symplectic integrator does not conserve the energy of the system, it is well known that there exists a conserving modified Hamiltonian, called the shadow Hamiltonian. For the Nambu mechanics, which is a kind of generalized Hamiltonian mechanics, we can also construct structure-preserving integrators by the same procedure used to construct the symplectic integrators. In the structure-preserving integrator, however, the existence of shadow Hamiltonians is nontrivial. This is because the Nambu mechanics is driven by multiple Hamiltonians and it is nontrivial whether the time evolution by the integrator can be cast into the Nambu mechanical time evolution driven by multiple shadow Hamiltonians. In this paper we present a general procedure to calculate the shadow Hamiltonians of structure-preserving integrators for Nambu mechanics, and give an example where the shadow Hamiltonians exist. This is the first attempt to determine the concrete forms of the shadow Hamiltonians for a Nambu mechanical system. We show that the fundamental identity, which corresponds to the Jacobi identity in Hamiltonian mechanics, plays an important role in calculating the shadow Hamiltonians using the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. It turns out that the resulting shadow Hamiltonians have indefinite forms depending on how the fundamental identities are used. This is not a technical artifact, because the exact shadow Hamiltonians obtained independently have the same indefiniteness.</description>

      <title>Equality of magnetization and edge current for interacting lattice fermions at positive temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the bulk magnetization is equal to the edge current in the thermodynamic limit for a large class of models of lattice fermions with finite-range interactions satisfying local indistinguishability of the Gibbs state, a condition known to hold for sufficiently high temperatures. Our result implies that edge currents in such systems are determined by bulk properties and are therefore stable against large perturbations near the boundaries. Moreover, the equality persists also after taking the derivative with respect to the chemical potential. We show that this form of bulk-edge correspondence is essentially a consequence of homogeneity in the bulk and locality of the Gibbs state. An important intermediate result is a new version of Bloch's theorem for two-dimensional systems, stating that persistent currents vanish in the bulk.</description>

Abstract: For quantum observables $H$ truncated on the range of orthogonal projections $\Pi_N$ of rank $N$, we study the corresponding Weyl symbol in the phase space in the semiclassical limit of vanishing Planck constant $\hbar\to0$ and large quantum number $N\to\infty$, with $\hbar N$ fixed. Under certain assumptions, we prove the $L^2$- convergence of the Weyl symbols to a symbol truncated (hence, in general discontinuous) on the classically allowed region in phase space. As an illustration of the general theorems we analyse truncated observables for the harmonic oscillator and for a free particle in a one-dimensional box. In the latter case, we also compute the microscopic pointwise limit of the symbols near the boundary of the classically allowed region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1903.07928v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a homological mirror symmetry equivalence for pairs of multiplicative hypertoric varieties, and we calculate monodromy autoequivalences of these categories by promoting our result to an equivalence of perverse schobers. We prove our equivalence by matching holomorphic Lagrangian skeleta, on the A-model side, with non-commutative resolutions on the B-model side. The hyperk\"ahler geometry of these spaces provides each category with a natural t-structure, which helps clarify SYZ duality in a hyperk\"ahler context. Our results are a prototype for mirror symmetry statements relating pairs of K-theoretic Coulomb branches.</description>

      <title>Naturality of ${\rm SL}_3$ quantum trace maps for surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.06286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fock-Goncharov's moduli spaces $\mathscr{X}_{{\rm PGL}_3,\frak{S}}$ of framed ${\rm PGL}_3$-local systems on punctured surfaces $\frak{S}$ provide prominent examples of cluster $\mathscr{X}$-varieties and higher Teichm\"uller spaces. In a previous paper of the author (arXiv:2011.14765), building on the works of others, the so-called ${\rm SL}_3$ quantum trace map is constructed for each triangulable punctured surface $\frak{S}$ and an ideal triangulation $\Delta$ of $\frak{S}$, as a homomorphism from the stated ${\rm SL}_3$-skein algebra of the surface to a quantum torus algebra that deforms the ring of Laurent polynomials in the cube-roots of the cluster coordinate variables for the cluster $\mathscr{X}$-chart for $\mathscr{X}_{{\rm PGL}_3,\frak{S}}$ associated to $\Delta$. We develop quantum mutation maps between special subalgebras of the cube-root quantum torus algebras for different triangulations and show that the ${\rm SL}_3$ quantum trace maps are natural, in the sense that they are compatible under these quantum mutation maps. As an application, the quantum ${\rm SL}_3$-${\rm PGL}_3$ duality map constructed in the previous paper is shown to be independent of the choice of an ideal triangulation.</description>

      <title>Gauge field marginal of an Abelian Higgs model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05443v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the gauge field marginal of an Abelian Higgs model with Villain action defined on a 2D lattice in finite volume. Our first main result, which holds for gauge theories on arbitrary finite graphs and does not assume that the structure group is Abelian, is a loop expansion of the Radon--Nikodym derivative of the law of the gauge field marginal with respect to that of the pure gauge theory. This expansion is similar to the one of Seiler but holds in greater generality and uses a different graph theoretic approach. Furthermore, we show ultraviolet stability for the gauge field marginal of the model in a fixed gauge. More specifically, we show that moments of the H{\"o}lder--Besov-type norms introduced in arXiv:1808.09196 are bounded uniformly in the lattice spacing. This latter result relies on a quantitative diamagnetic inequality that in turn follows from the loop expansion and elementary properties of Gaussian random variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.13260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the mathematical-physical model of pavement mechanics, a multilayer elastic system with interlayer friction conditions is constructed. Given the complex boundary conditions, the corresponding variational inequalities of the partial differential equations are derived, so that the problem can be analyzed under the variational framework. First, the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the variational inequality is proved; then the approximation error of the numerical solution based on the finite element method is analyzed, and when the finite element space satisfies certain approximation conditions, the convergence of the numerical solution is proved; finally, in the trivial finite element space, the convergence order of the numerical solution is derived. The above conclusions provide basic theoretical support for solving the displacement-strain problem of multilayer elastic systems under the framework of variational inequalities.</description>

      <title>Manipulating fermionic mode entanglement in the presence of superselection rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04559v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superselection rules (SSRs), linked to the conservation of physical quantities such as parity or particle number, impose constraints on allowable physical operations in fermionic systems. This affects the amount of extractable mode entanglement possessed in a given state and its manipulation by the so-called entanglement-free operations. Here, we present a majorization-based algorithm for the mixed state transformations of bipartite mode entanglement, where the allowed operations (i.e., resource non-generating operations), that is, local operations and classical communication, are restricted by local SSRs. We then focus on the local parity SSR and investigate the possibility to relax the constraints imposed by it through a catalyst. In particular, we show that an ancillary mode system can catalyze the change in local parity. Finally, we discuss the application of our methodology to various problems in different fields. Accordingly, we propose that it may shed new light on the activation of orbital entanglement in chemical molecules and the manipulation of multipartite entanglement or quantum discord in distinguishable quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Coexistence, enhancements and short loops in random walk loop soups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a general random walk loop soup which includes, or is related to, several models of interest, such as the Spin O(N) model, the double dimer model and the Bose gas. The analysis of this model is challenging because of the presence of spatial interactions between the loops. For this model it is known from Quitmann and Taggi (2022) that macroscopic loops occur in dimension three and higher when the inverse temperature is large enough. Our first result is that, on the $d$ dimensional lattice, the presence of repulsive interactions is responsible for a shift of the critical inverse temperature, which is strictly greater than $\frac{1}{2d}$, the critical value in the non interacting case. Our second result is that a positive density of microscopic loops exists for all values of the inverse temperature. This implies that, in the regime in which macroscopic loops are present, microscopic and macroscopic loops coexist. Moreover, we show that, even though the increase of the inverse temperature leads to an increase of the total loop length, the density of microscopic loops is uniformly bounded from above in the inverse temperature. Our last result is confined to the special case in which the random walk loop soup is the one associated to the Spin O(N) model with arbitrary integer values of $N \geq 2$ and states that, on $\mathbb{Z}^2$, the probability that two vertices are connected by a loop decays at least polynomially fast with their distance.</description>

      <title>HBS Tilings extended: State of the art and novel observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Penrose tilings are the most famous aperiodic tilings, and they have been studied extensively. In particular, patterns composed with hexagons ($H$), boats ($B$) and stars ($S$) were soon exhibited and many physicists published on what they later called $HBS$ tilings, but no article or book combines all we know about them. This work is done here, before introducing new decorations and properties including explicit substitutions. For the latter, the star comes in three versions so we have 5 prototiles in what we call the Star tileset. Yet this set yields exactly the strict $HBS$ tilings formed using 3 tiles decorated with either the usual decorations (arrows) or Ammann bar markings for instance. Another new tileset called Gemstones is also presented, derived from the Star tileset.</description>

      <title>Zeros of random polynomials undergoing the heat flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of the empirical distribution of the complex roots of high-degree random polynomials, when the polynomial undergoes the heat flow. In one prominent example of Weyl polynomials, the limiting zero distribution evolves from the circular law into the elliptic law until it collapses to the Wigner semicircle law, as was recently conjectured for characteristic polynomials of random matrices by Hall and Ho, 2022. Moreover, for a general family of random polynomials with independent coefficients and isotropic limiting distribution of zeros, we determine the zero distribution of the heat-evolved polynomials in terms of its logarithmic potential. Furthermore, we explicitly identify two critical time thresholds, at which singularities develop and at which the limiting distribution collapses to the semicircle law. We completely characterize the limiting root distribution of the heat-evolved polynomials before singularities develop as the push-forward of the initial distribution under a transport map. Finally, we discuss the results from the perspectives of partial differential equations (in particular Hamilton-Jacobi equation and Burgers' equation), optimal transport, and free probability. The theory is accompanied by explicit examples, simulations, and conjectures.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Floquet non-Abelian topological insulator and multifold bulk-edge correspondence"</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We comment on the recent paper ``Floquet non-Abelian topological insulator and multifold bulk-edge correspondence" by Tianyu Li and Haiping Hu, Nat. Comm. {\bf 14}, 6418 (2023). Apart from the fact that the authors unjustly imply to study multi-gap topology in Floquet systems for the first time, only known homotopic relations are presented. While such insights are used to present interesting Floquet phenomena and phases, which is an attractive result in itself, they cannot be used to deduce the total bulk characterization in the dynamical context without further proof. In fact, the authors essentially rephrase a Zak phase description. These results should in particular be contrasted to earlier results, arXiv:2208.12824, in which static-compatible Zak phases {\it and} dynamical Dirac strings were shown to be able to {\it distinguish} rather similar non-Abelian Floquet phases in $2+1$ dimensional systems. As a result, the claim of a sharp multifold bulk-edge correspondence cannot be concluded from the given arguments.</description>

As an application of the computation, we verify the volume conjecture proposed by Bonahon-Wong-Yang for the four puncture sphere bundles with some technical conditions. Together with the one-puncture torus bundles, this is the first family of examples for which the conjecture is verified providing evidence for the conjecture</description>

      <title>Poisson Geometric Formulation of Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Poisson geometrical formulation of quantum mechanics for finite dimensional mixed and pure states. Equivalently, we show that quantum mechanics can be understood in the language of classical mechanics. We review the symplectic structure of the Hilbert space and identify its canonical coordinates. We extend the geometric picture to the space of density matrices $D_N^+$. We find it is not symplectic but admits a linear $\mathfrak{su}(N)$ Poisson structure. We identify Casimir surfaces of $D_N^+$ and show that the space of pure states $P_N \equiv \mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ is one of its symplectic submanifolds which is an intersection of primitive Casimirs. We identify generic symplectic submanifolds of $D_N^+$ and calculate their dimensions. We find that $D_N^+$ is singularly foliated by the symplectic leaves of varying dimensions, also known as coadjoint orbits. We also find an ascending chain of Poisson submanifolds $D_N^M \subset D_N^{M+1}$ for $ 1 \leq M \leq N-1$. Each such Poisson submanifold $D_N^M$ is obtained by tracing out the $\mathbb{C}^M$ states from the bipartite system $\mathbb{C}^N \times \mathbb{C}^M$ and is an intersection of $N-M$ primitive Casimirs of $D_N^+$. Their Poisson structure is induced from the symplectic structure of the bipartite system. We also show their foliations. Finally, we study the positive semi-definite geometry of the symplectic submanifold $E_N^M$ consisting of the mixed states with maximum entropy in $D_N^M$.</description>

      <title>Photon-Gravity Coupling in Schwarzschild Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A canonical formalism for quantum electrodynamics in curved spacetime is developed. This formalism enables a systematic investigation of photons in the Schwarzschild gravitational field, yielding novel results as well as refining previous results that were predicted by heuristic methods. The claim that "the gravitational redshift is a shift in the sharp frequencies of the photons for all frequencies of the spectrum" is proved. It is shown the gravitational decoherence is due to photon-gravity coupling and observer-dependent quantum electrodynamics in curved spacetime phenomena. The proper value of the photon gravitational interferometric relative phase shift is calculated and its full quantum-general relativistic nature is demonstrated. It is shown its observation will falsify the validity of Newtonian gravity and the extension of the Einstein equivalence principle beyond a single point (even in the weak uniform gravitational field.)</description>

      <title>Quantitative Reducibility of $C^k$ Quasi-Periodic Cocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09132v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes an extreme $C^k$ reducibility theorem of quasi-periodic $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$ cocycles in the local perturbative region, revealing both the essence of Eliasson [Commun.Math.Phys.1992] and Hou-You [Invent.Math.2012] in respectively the non-resonant and resonant cases. By paralleling further the reducibility process with the almost reducibility, we are able to acquire the least initial regularity as well as the least loss of regularity for the whole KAM iterations. This, in return, makes various spectral applications of quasi-periodic Schr\"odinger operators wide open.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Memory into Propagation of 1-Electron Reduced Density Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any linear system where the unreduced dynamics are governed by unitary propagators, we derive a closed, time-delayed, linear system for a reduced-dimensional quantity of interest. We apply this method to understand the memory-dependence of $1$-electron reduced density matrices in time-dependent configuration interaction (TDCI), a scheme to solve for the correlated dynamics of electrons in molecules. Though time-dependent density functional theory has established that the $1$-electron reduced density possesses memory-dependence, the precise nature of this memory-dependence has not been understood. We derive a self-contained, symmetry/constraint-preserving method to propagate reduced TDCI electron density matrices. Our method preserves properties of density matrices such as Hermitian symmetry and constant trace. In numerical tests on two model systems ($\text{H}_2$ and $\text{HeH}^+$), we show that with sufficiently large time-delay (or memory-dependence), our method propagates reduced TDCI density matrices with high quantitative accuracy. We study the dependence of our results on time step and basis set. To implement our method, we derive the $4$-index tensor that relates reduced and full TDCI density matrices. Our derivation applies to any TDCI system, regardless of basis set, number of electrons, or choice of Slater determinants in the wave function. This derivation enables a proof that the trace of the reduced TDCI density matrix is constant and equals the number of electrons.</description>

      <title>Non-ultralocal classical r-matrix structure for 1+1 field analogue of elliptic Calogero-Moser model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider 1+1 field generalization of the elliptic Calogero-Moser model. It is shown that the Lax connection satisfies the classical non-ultralocal $r$-matrix structure of Maillet type. Next, we consider 1+1 field analogue of the spin Calogero-Moser model and its multipole (or multispin) extension. Finally, we discuss the field analogue of the classical IRF-Vertex correspondence, which relates utralocal and non-ultralocal $r$-matrix structures.</description>

      <title>Quantum symmetries of noncommutative tori</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of building non-invertible quantum symmetries (as characterized by actions of unitary fusion categories) on noncommutative tori. We introduce a general method to construct actions of fusion categories on inductive limit C*-algberas using finite dimenionsal data, and then apply it to obtain AT-actions of arbitrary Haagerup-Izumi categories on noncommutative 2-tori, of the even part of the $E_{8}$ subfactor on a noncommutative 3-torus, and of $\text{PSU}(2)_{15}$ on a noncommutative 4-torus.</description>

      <title>Informationally overcomplete measurements from generalized equiangular tight frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00560v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Informationally overcomplete measurements find important applications in quantum tomography and quantum state estimation. The most popular are maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases, for which trace relations between measurement operators are well known. In this paper, we introduce a more general class of informationally overcomplete POVMs that are generated by equiangular tight frames of arbitrary rank. This class provides a generalization of equiangular measurements to non-projective POVMs, which include rescaled mutually unbiased measurements and bases. We provide a method of their construction, analyze their symmetry properties, and provide examples for highly symmetric cases. In particular, we find a wide class of generalized equiangular measurements that are conical 2-designs, which allows us to derive the index of coincidence. Our results show benefits of considering a single informationally overcomplete measurement over informationally complete collections of POVMs.</description>

      <title>Generalized classical Yang-Baxter equation and regular decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The focus of the paper is on constructing new solutions of the generalized classical Yang-Baxter equation (GCYBE) that are not skew-symmetric. Using regular decompositions of finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras, we construct Lie algebra decompositions of $\mathfrak{g}(\!(x)\!) \times \mathfrak{g}[x]/x^m \mathfrak{g}[x]$. The latter decompositions are in bijection with the solutions to the GCYBE. Under appropriate regularity conditions, we obtain a partial classification of such solutions. The paper is concluded with the presentations of the Gaudin-type models associated to these solutions.</description>

      <title>Pattern formation in three-state systems: Towards understanding morphology formation in the presence of evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by experimental evidence collected when processing thin films from ternary solutions made of two solutes, typically polymers, and one solvent, we computationally study the morphology formation of domains obtained in three-state systems using both a lattice model and a continuum counterpart. The lattice-based approach relies on the Blume-Capel nearest neighbor model with bulk conservative Kawasaki dynamics, whereas as continuum system we consider a coupled system of evolution equations that is derived as hydrodynamic limit when replacing the nearest neighbor interaction in the lattice case by a suitable Kac potential. We explore how the obtained morphology depends on the solvent content in the mixture. In particular, we study how these scenarios change when the solvent is allowed to evaporate.</description>
