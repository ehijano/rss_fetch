      <title>A Neural Surrogate-Enhanced Multi-Method Framework for Robust Wing Design Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a modular and scalable design optimization framework for the wing design process that enables faster early-phase design while ensuring aerodynamic stability. The pipeline starts with the generation of initial wing geometries and then proceeds to optimize the wing using several algorithms. Aerodynamic performance is assessed using a Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) applied to a carefully selected dataset of wing configurations. These results are employed to develop surrogate neural network models, which can predict lift and drag rapidly and accurately. The stability evaluation is implemented by setting the control surfaces and components to fixed positions in order to have realistic flight dynamics. The approach unifies and compares several optimization techniques, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithms (GA), gradient-based MultiStart methods, Bayesian optimization, and Lipschitz optimization. Each method ensures constraint management via adaptive strategies and penalty functions, where the targets for lift and design feasibility are enforced. The progression of aerodynamic characteristics and geometries over the optimization iterations will be investigated in order to clarify each algorithm's convergence characteristics and performance efficiency. Our results show improvement in aerodynamic qualities and robust stability properties, offering a mechanism for wing design at speed and precision. In the interest of reproducibility and community development, the complete implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/AmirHosseinGhaemi2000/CHIMERA.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Computation as Natural Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has achieved remarkable success across a range of domains, but its capabilities remain constrained to statistical models of finite training sets and learning based on local gradient signals. This often results in artifacts that are more derivative than genuinely generative. In contrast, Evolutionary Computation (EC) offers a search-driven pathway to greater diversity and creativity, expanding generative capabilities by exploring uncharted solution spaces beyond the limits of available data. This work establishes a fundamental connection between EC and GenAI, redefining EC as Natural Generative AI (NatGenAI) -- a generative paradigm governed by exploratory search under natural selection. We demonstrate that classical EC with parent-centric operators mirrors conventional GenAI, while disruptive operators enable structured evolutionary leaps, often within just a few generations, to generate out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, the methods of evolutionary multitasking provide an unparalleled means of integrating disruptive EC (with cross-domain recombination of evolved features) and moderated selection mechanisms (allowing novel solutions to survive), thereby fostering sustained innovation. By reframing EC as NatGenAI, we emphasize structured disruption and selection pressure moderation as essential drivers of creativity. This perspective extends the generative paradigm beyond conventional boundaries and positions EC as crucial to advancing exploratory design, innovation, scientific discovery, and open-ended generation in the GenAI era.</description>

      <title>The Enduring Dominance of Deep Neural Networks: A Critical Analysis of the Fundamental Limitations of Quantum Machine Learning and Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in QML and SNNs have generated considerable excitement, promising exponential speedups and brain-like energy efficiency to revolutionize AI. However, this paper argues that they are unlikely to displace DNNs in the near term. QML struggles with adapting backpropagation due to unitary constraints, measurement-induced state collapse, barren plateaus, and high measurement overheads, exacerbated by the limitations of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware, overfitting risks due to underdeveloped regularization techniques, and a fundamental misalignment with machine learning's generalization. SNNs face restricted representational bandwidth, struggling with long-range dependencies and semantic encoding in language tasks due to their discrete, spike-based processing. Furthermore, the goal of faithfully emulating the brain might impose inherent inefficiencies like cognitive biases, limited working memory, and slow learning speeds. Even their touted energy-efficient advantages are overstated; optimized DNNs with quantization can outperform SNNs in energy costs under realistic conditions. Finally, SNN training incurs high computational overhead from temporal unfolding. In contrast, DNNs leverage efficient backpropagation, robust regularization, and innovations in LRMs that shift scaling to inference-time compute, enabling self-improvement via RL and search algorithms like MCTS while mitigating data scarcity. This superiority is evidenced by recent models such as xAI's Grok-4 Heavy, which advances SOTA performance, and gpt-oss-120b, which surpasses or approaches the performance of leading industry models despite its modest 120-billion-parameter size deployable on a single 80GB GPU. Furthermore, specialized ASICs amplify these efficiency gains. Ultimately, QML and SNNs may serve niche hybrid roles, but DNNs remain the dominant, practical paradigm for AI advancement.</description>

      <title>A Denoising Diffusion-Based Evolutionary Algorithm Framework: Application to the Maximum Independent Set Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Denoising diffusion models (DDMs) offer a promising generative approach for combinatorial optimization, yet they often lack the robust exploration capabilities of traditional metaheuristics like evolutionary algorithms (EAs). We propose a Denoising Diffusion-based Evolutionary Algorithm (DDEA) framework that synergistically integrates these paradigms. It utilizes pre-trained DDMs for both high-quality and diverse population initialization and a novel diffusion-based recombination operator, trained via imitation learning against an optimal demonstrator. Evaluating DDEA on the Maximum Independent Set problem on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, we demonstrate notable improvements over DIFUSCO, a leading DDM solver. DDEA consistently outperforms it given the same time budget, and surpasses Gurobi on larger graphs under the same time limit, with DDEA's solution sizes being 3.9% and 7.5% larger on the ER-300-400 and ER-700-800 datasets, respectively. In out-of-distribution experiments, DDEA provides solutions of 11.6% higher quality than DIFUSCO under the same time limit. Ablation studies confirm that both diffusion initialization and recombination are crucial. Our work highlights the potential of hybridizing DDMs and EAs, offering a promising direction for the development of powerful machine learning solvers for complex combinatorial optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Fast and robust parametric and functional learning with Hybrid Genetic Optimisation (HyGO)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hybrid Genetic Optimisation framework (HyGO) is introduced to meet the pressing need for efficient and unified optimisation frameworks that support both parametric and functional learning in complex engineering problems. Evolutionary algorithms are widely employed as derivative-free global optimisation methods but often suffer from slow convergence rates, especially during late-stage learning. HyGO integrates the global exploration capabilities of evolutionary algorithms with accelerated local search for robust solution refinement. The key enabler is a two-stage strategy that balances exploration and exploitation. For parametric problems, HyGO alternates between a genetic algorithm and targeted improvement through a degradation-proof Dowhill Simplex Method (DSM). For function optimisation tasks, HyGO rotates between genetic programming and DSM. Validation is performed on (a) parametric optimisation benchmarks, where HyGO demonstrates faster and more robust convergence than standard genetic algorithms, and (b) function optimisation tasks, including control of a damped Landau oscillator. Practical relevance is showcased through aerodynamic drag reduction of an Ahmed body via Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes simulations, achieving consistently interpretable results and reductions exceeding 20% by controlled jet injection in the back of the body for flow reattachment and separation bubble reduction. Overall, HyGO emerges as a versatile hybrid optimisation framework suitable for a broad spectrum of engineering and scientific problems involving parametric and functional learning.</description>

      <title>Man-Made Heuristics Are Dead. Long Live Code Generators!</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Policy design for various systems controllers has conventionally been a manual process, with domain experts carefully tailoring heuristics for the specific instance in which the policy will be deployed. In this paper, we re-imagine policy design via a novel automated search technique fueled by recent advances in generative models, specifically Large Language Model (LLM)-driven code generation. We outline the design and implementation of PolicySmith, a framework that applies LLMs to synthesize instance-optimal heuristics. We apply PolicySmith to two long-standing systems policies - web caching and congestion control, highlighting the opportunities unraveled by this LLM-driven heuristic search. For caching, PolicySmith discovers heuristics that outperform established baselines on standard open-source traces. For congestion control, we show that PolicySmith can generate safe policies that integrate directly into the Linux kernel.</description>

      <title>FedL2T: Personalized Federated Learning with Two-Teacher Distillation for Seizure Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The training of deep learning models in seizure prediction requires large amounts of Electroencephalogram (EEG) data. However, acquiring sufficient labeled EEG data is difficult due to annotation costs and privacy constraints. Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative training by sharing model updates instead of raw data. However, due to the inherent inter-patient variability in real-world scenarios, existing FL-based seizure prediction methods struggle to achieve robust performance under heterogeneous client settings. To address this challenge, we propose FedL2T, a personalized federated learning framework that leverages a novel two-teacher knowledge distillation strategy to generate superior personalized models for each client. Specifically, each client simultaneously learns from a globally aggregated model and a dynamically assigned peer model, promoting more direct and enriched knowledge exchange. To ensure reliable knowledge transfer, FedL2T employs an adaptive multi-level distillation strategy that aligns both prediction outputs and intermediate feature representations based on task confidence. In addition, a proximal regularization term is introduced to constrain personalized model updates, thereby enhancing training stability. Extensive experiments on two EEG datasets demonstrate that FedL2T consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods, particularly under low-label conditions. Moreover, FedL2T exhibits rapid and stable convergence toward optimal performance, thereby reducing the number of communication rounds and associated overhead. These results underscore the potential of FedL2T as a reliable and personalized solution for seizure prediction in privacy-sensitive healthcare scenarios.</description>

      <title>Neural Codecs as Biosignal Tokenizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurophysiological recordings such as electroencephalography (EEG) offer accessible and minimally invasive means of estimating physiological activity for applications in healthcare, diagnostic screening, and even immersive entertainment. However, these recordings yield high-dimensional, noisy time-series data that typically require extensive pre-processing and handcrafted feature extraction to reveal meaningful information. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in applying representation learning techniques from large pre-trained (foundation) models to effectively decode and interpret biosignals. We discuss the challenges posed for incorporating such methods and introduce BioCodec, an alternative representation learning framework inspired by neural codecs to capture low-level signal characteristics in the form of discrete tokens. Pre-trained on thousands of EEG hours, BioCodec shows efficacy across multiple downstream tasks, ranging from clinical diagnostic tasks and sleep physiology to decoding speech and motor imagery, particularly in low-resource settings. Additionally, we provide a qualitative analysis of codebook usage and estimate the spatial coherence of codebook embeddings from EEG connectivity. Notably, we also document the suitability of our method to other biosignal data, i.e., electromyographic (EMG) signals. Overall, the proposed approach provides a versatile solution for biosignal tokenization that performs competitively with state-of-the-art models. The source code and model checkpoints are shared.</description>

      <title>Estimating Brain Activity with High Spatial and Temporal Resolution using a Naturalistic MEG-fMRI Encoding Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current non-invasive neuroimaging techniques trade off between spatial resolution and temporal resolution. While magnetoencephalography (MEG) can capture rapid neural dynamics and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can spatially localize brain activity, a unified picture that preserves both high resolutions remains an unsolved challenge with existing source localization or MEG-fMRI fusion methods, especially for single-trial naturalistic data. We collected whole-head MEG when subjects listened passively to more than seven hours of narrative stories, using the same stimuli in an open fMRI dataset (LeBel et al., 2023). We developed a transformer-based encoding model that combines the MEG and fMRI from these two naturalistic speech comprehension experiments to estimate latent cortical source responses with high spatiotemporal resolution. Our model is trained to predict MEG and fMRI from multiple subjects simultaneously, with a latent layer that represents our estimates of reconstructed cortical sources. Our model predicts MEG better than the common standard of single-modality encoding models, and it also yields source estimates with higher spatial and temporal fidelity than classic minimum-norm solutions in simulation experiments. We validated the estimated latent sources by showing its strong generalizability across unseen subjects and modalities. Estimated activity in our source space predict electrocorticography (ECoG) better than an ECoG-trained encoding model in an entirely new dataset. By integrating the power of large naturalistic experiments, MEG, fMRI, and encoding models, we propose a practical route towards millisecond-and-millimeter brain mapping.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Decoding via Hierarchical Neural Information Gradients in Mouse Visual Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the encoding and decoding mechanisms of dynamic neural responses to different visual stimuli is an important topic in exploring how the brain represents visual information. Currently, hierarchically deep neural networks (DNNs) have played a significant role as tools for mining the core features of complex data. However, most methods often overlook the dynamic generation process of neural data, such as hierarchical brain's visual data, within the brain's structure. In the decoding of brain's visual data, two main paradigms are 'fine-grained decoding tests' and 'rough-grained decoding tests', which we define as focusing on a single brain region and studying the overall structure across multiple brain regions, respectively. In this paper, we mainly use the Visual Coding Neuropixel dataset from the Allen Brain Institute, and the hierarchical information extracted from some single brain regions (i.e., fine-grained decoding tests) is provided to the proposed method for studying the adaptive topological decoding between brain regions, called the Adaptive Topological Vision Transformer, or AT-ViT. In numerous experiments, the results reveal the importance of the proposed method in hierarchical networks in the visual tasks, and also validate the hypothesis that "the hierarchical information content in brain regions of the visual system can be quantified by decoding outcomes to reflect an information hierarchy." Among them, we found that neural data collected in the hippocampus can have a random decoding performance, and this negative impact on performance still holds significant scientific value.</description>

      <title>Differential Analysis of Pseudo Haptic Feedback: Novel Comparative Study of Visual and Auditory Cue Integration for Psychophysical Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pseudo-haptics exploit carefully crafted visual or auditory cues to trick the brain into "feeling" forces that are never physically applied, offering a low-cost alternative to traditional haptic hardware. Here, we present a comparative psychophysical study that quantifies how visual and auditory stimuli combine to evoke pseudo-haptic pressure sensations on a commodity tablet. Using a Unity-based Rollball game, participants (n = 4) guided a virtual ball across three textured terrains while their finger forces were captured in real time with a Robotous RFT40 force-torque sensor. Each terrain was paired with a distinct rolling-sound profile spanning 440 Hz - 4.7 kHz, 440 Hz - 13.1 kHz, or 440 Hz - 8.9 kHz; crevice collisions triggered additional "knocking" bursts to heighten realism. Average tactile forces increased systematically with cue intensity: 0.40 N, 0.79 N and 0.88 N for visual-only trials and 0.41 N, 0.81 N and 0.90 N for audio-only trials on Terrains 1-3, respectively. Higher audio frequencies and denser visual textures both elicited stronger muscle activation, and their combination further reduced the force needed to perceive surface changes, confirming multisensory integration. These results demonstrate that consumer-grade isometric devices can reliably induce and measure graded pseudo-haptic feedback without specialized actuators, opening a path toward affordable rehabilitation tools, training simulators and assistive interfaces.</description>

      <title>Enabling Population-Level Parallelism in Tree-Based Genetic Programming for GPU Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17168v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tree-based Genetic Programming (TGP) is a widely used evolutionary algorithm for tasks such as symbolic regression, classification, and robotic control. Due to the intensive computational demands of running TGP, GPU acceleration is crucial for achieving scalable performance. However, efficient GPU-based execution of TGP remains challenging, primarily due to three core issues: (1) the structural heterogeneity of program individuals, (2) the complexity of integrating multiple levels of parallelism, and (3) the incompatibility between high-performance CUDA execution and flexible Python-based environments. To address these issues, we propose EvoGP, a high-performance framework tailored for GPU acceleration of TGP via population-level parallel execution. First, EvoGP introduces a tensorized representation that encodes variable-sized trees into fixed-shape, memory-aligned arrays, enabling uniform memory access and parallel computation across diverse individuals. Second, EvoGP adopts an adaptive parallelism strategy that dynamically combines intra- and inter-individual parallelism based on dataset size, ensuring high GPU utilization across a broad spectrum of tasks. Third, EvoGP embeds custom CUDA kernels into the PyTorch runtime, achieving seamless integration with Python-based environments such as Gym, MuJoCo, Brax, and Genesis. Experiments show that EvoGP attains a peak throughput exceeding $10^{11}$ GPops/s, with speedups of up to $528\times$ over GPU-based TGP implementations and $18\times$ over the fastest CPU-based libraries, while maintaining comparable accuracy and improved scalability across large population sizes. EvoGP is open source and accessible at: https://github.com/EMI-Group/evogp.</description>
