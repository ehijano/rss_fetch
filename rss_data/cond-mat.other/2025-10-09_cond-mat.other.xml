      <title>Beyond the non-Hermitian skin effect: scaling-controlled topology from Exceptional-Bound Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a novel mechanism for topological transitions in non-Hermitian systems that are controlled by the system size. Based on a new paradigm known as exceptional-bound (EB) band engineering, its mechanism hinges on the unique critical scaling behavior near an exceptional point, totally unrelated to the well-known non-Hermitian skin effect. Through a series of ansatz models, we analytically derive and numerically demonstrate how topological transitions depend on the system size with increasingly sophisticated topological phase boundaries. Our approach can be generically applied to design scaling-dependent bands in multi-dimensional lattices, gapped or gapless, challenging established critical and entanglement behavior. It can be experimentally demonstrated in any non-Hermitian platform with versatile couplings or multi-orbital unit cells, such as photonic crystals, as well as classical and quantum circuits. The identification of this new EB band mechanism provides new design principles for engineering band structures through scaling-dependent phenomena unique to non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Effects in a Molecular Quantum NAND Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecules provide the smallest possible circuits in which quantum interference and electron correlation can be engineered to perform logical operations, including the universal NAND gate. We investigate a chemically encoded quantum NAND tree based on alkynyl-extended iso-polyacetylene backbones, where inputs are set by end-group substitution and outputs are read from the presence or absence of transmission nodes. Using quantum many-body transport theory, we show that NAND behavior persists in the presence of dynamic correlations, but that the nodal positions and their chemical shifts depend sensitively on electron-electron interactions. This sensitivity highlights the potential of these systems not only to probe the strength of electronic correlations but also to harness them in shaping logical response. The thermopower is identified as a chemically robust readout of gate logic, providing discrimination margins that greatly exceed typical experimental uncertainties, in an observable governed primarily by the variation of transport rather than its absolute magnitude.</description>

      <title>Thermal gradient-driven skyrmion dynamics with near-zero skyrmion Hall angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal gradient driven skyrmion dynamics offers a promising route toward green spintronics, enabling the utilization of waste heat for information transport and processing. Using micromagnetic simulations, we investigate Neel skyrmions in a Co-Pt bilayer nanoracetrack and demonstrate that stochastic torques induced by a thermal gradient drive skyrmion motion toward the hotter region with a nearly vanishing Hall angle. The dynamics depends sensitively on intrinsic material parameters - the skyrmion velocity decreases with increasing damping constant, increases with stronger thermal gradients, and varies systematically with saturation magnetization, interfacial DMI strength, and uniaxial out of plane anisotropy. Importantly, we identify a specific range of material parameters within which the skyrmion velocity changes sharply while the Hall angle remains strongly suppressed, saturating near zero. This comprehensive parameter-dependent study establishes a universal design framework for minimizing the Hall effect in thermal gradient driven spintronic systems.</description>

      <title>Dispersion and the transport of exciton-polaritons in an optical conveyor belt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing interest in exciton-polaritons has driven the need to manipulate their motion and engineer their band structures to the forefront of contemporary research. This study explores the band structures that emerge from a spatially modulated potential, ingeniously realized through the use of an optical conveyor belt. By leveraging Bloch theory and conducting a meticulous analysis of the time evolution of polariton intensity in Fourier space, we have derived the energy dispersion relations both analytically and numerically within the context of a static lattice model. For time-dependent potentials, we employ the Lagrange variational method to elucidate the dynamics of polariton motion. Our results reveal that polaritons exhibit linear dispersion and follow linear trajectories with minor oscillations superimposed. This investigation not only deepens our fundamental understanding of exciton-polaritons but also provides a robust tool for advancing photonic devices and exerting precise control over current transport in quantum computing. Our findings pave the way for future innovations in high-speed and high-performance technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Interference Supernodes, Thermoelectric Enhancement, and the Role of Dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum interference (QI) can strongly enhance thermoelectric response, with higher-order "supernodes" predicted to yield scalable gains in thermopower and efficiency. A central question, however, is whether such features are intrinsically more fragile to dephasing. Using $B\"uttiker$ voltage-temperature probes, we establish an order-selection rule: the effective near-node order is set by the lowest among coherent and probe-assisted channels. Supernodes are therefore fragile in an absolute sense because their transmission is parametrically suppressed with order. However, once an incoherent floor dominates, the fractional suppression of thermopower, efficiency, and figure of merit becomes universal and order-independent. Illustrating these principles with benzene- and biphenyl-based junction calculations, we show that the geometry of environmental coupling -- through a single orbital or across many -- dictates whether coherence is lost by order reduction or by floor building. These results yield general scaling rules for the thermoelectric response of interference nodes under dephasing.</description>
