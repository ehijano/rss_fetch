      <title>Phonon-Induced Exchange Gate Infidelities in Semiconducting Si-SiGe Spin Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-spin exchange interactions between semiconductor spin qubits allow for fast single and two-qubit gates. During exchange, coupling of the qubits to a surrounding phonon bath may cause errors in the resulting gate. Here, the fidelities of exchange operations with semiconductor double quantum dot spin qubits in a Si-SiGe heterostructure coupled to a finite temperature phonon bath are considered. By employing a master equation approach, the isolated effect of each spin-phonon coupling term may be resolved, as well as leakage errors of encoded qubit operations. As the temperature is increased, a crossover is observed from where the primary source of error is due to a phonon induced perturbation of the two electron spin states, to one where the phonon induced coupling to an excited orbital state becomes the dominant error. Additionally, it is shown that a simple trade-off in pulse shape and length can improve robustness to spin-phonon induced errors during gate operations by up to an order of magnitude. Our results suggest that for elevated temperatures within 200-300 mK, exchange gate operations are not currently limited by bulk phonons. This is consistent with recent experiments.</description>

      <title>Gibbs Sampling gives Quantum Advantage at Constant Temperatures with $O(1)$-Local Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling from Gibbs states $\unicode{x2013}$ states corresponding to system in thermal equilibrium $\unicode{x2013}$ has recently been shown to be a task for which quantum computers are expected to achieve super-polynomial speed-up compared to classical computers, provided the locality of the Hamiltonian increases with the system size (Bergamaschi et al., arXiv: 2404.14639). We extend these results to show that this quantum advantage still occurs for Gibbs states of Hamiltonians with O(1)-local interactions at constant temperature by showing classical hardness-of-sampling and demonstrating such Gibbs states can be prepared efficiently using a quantum computer. In particular, we show hardness-of-sampling is maintained even for 5-local Hamiltonians on a 3D lattice. We additionally show that the hardness-of-sampling is robust when we are only able to make imperfect measurements. Beyond these hardness results, we present a lower bound on the temperatures that Gibbs states become easy to sample from classically in terms of the maximum degree of the Hamiltonian's interaction graph.</description>
