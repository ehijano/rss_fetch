      <title>Logarithmic double phase problems with generalized critical growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study logarithmic double phase problems with variable exponents involving nonlinearities that have generalized critical growth. We first prove new continuous and compact embedding results in order to guarantee the well-definedness by studying the Sobolev conjugate function of our generalized $N$-function. In the second part we prove the concentration compactness principle for Musielak-Orlicz Sobolev spaces having logarithmic double phase modular function structure. Based on this we are going to show multiplicity results for the problem under consideration for superlinear and sublinear growth, respectively.</description>

      <title>On the removal of the barotropic condition in helicity studies of the compressible Euler and ideal compressible MHD equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The helicity is a topological conserved quantity of the Euler equations which imposes significant constraints on the dynamics of vortex lines. In the compressible setting the conservation law only holds under the assumption that the pressure is barotropic. We show that by introducing a new definition of helicity density $h_{\rho}=(\rho\textbf{u})\cdot\mbox{curl}\,(\rho\textbf{u})$ this assumption on the pressure can be removed, although $\int_V h_{\rho}dV$ is no longer conserved. However, we show for the non-barotropic compressible Euler equations that the new helicity density $h_{\rho}$ obeys an entropy-type relation (in the sense of hyperbolic conservation laws) whose flux $\textbf{J}_{\rho}$ contains all the pressure terms and whose source involves the potential vorticity $q = \omega \cdot \nabla \rho$. Therefore the rate of change of $\int_V h_{\rho}dV$ no longer depends on the pressure and is easier to analyse, as it only depends on the potential vorticity and kinetic energy as well as $\mbox{div}\,\textbf{u}$. This result also carries over to the inhomogeneous incompressible Euler equations for which the potential vorticity $q$ is a material constant. Therefore $q$ is bounded by its initial value $q_{0}=q(\textbf{x},\,0)$, which enables us to define an inverse resolution length scale $\lambda_{H}^{-1}$ whose upper bound is found to be proportional to $\|q_{0}\|_{\infty}^{2/7}$. In a similar manner, we also introduce a new cross-helicity density for the ideal non-barotropic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations.</description>

      <title>L2 geometric ergodicity for the kinetic Langevin process with non-equilibrium steady states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In non-equilibrium statistical physics models, the invariant measure $\mu$ of the process does not have an explicit density. In particular the adjoint $L^*$ in $L^2(\mu)$ of the generator $L$ is unknown and many classical techniques fail in this situation. An important progress has been made in [5] where functional inequalities are obtained for non-explicit steady states of kinetic equations under rather general conditions. However in [5] in the kinetic case the geometric ergodicity is only deduced from the functional inequalities for the case with conservative forces, corresponding to explicit steady states. In this note we obtain $L^2$ convergence rates in the non-equilibrium case.</description>

      <title>Invariance properties of the solution operator for measure-valued semilinear transport equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide conditions under which we prove for measure-valued transport equations with non-linear reaction term in the space of finite signed Radon measures, that positivity is preserved, as well as absolute continuity with respect to Lebesgue measure, if the initial condition has that property. Moreover, if the initial condition has $L^p$ regular density, then the solution has the same property.</description>

      <title>Stochastic scattering control of spider diffusion governed by an optimal diffraction probability measure selected from its own local-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to study a new problem of stochastic control, related to Walsh's spider diffusion, named: stochastic optimal scattering control. The optimal scattering control of the spider diffusion at the junction point is governed by an appropriate and highly non-trivial condition of the Kirchhoff Law type, involving an optimal diffraction probability measure selected from the own local time of the spider process at the vertex. In this work, we prove first the weak dynamic programming principle in the spirit of [32], adapted to the new class of spider diffusion introduced recently in [37]-[38]. Thereafter, we show that the value function of the problem is characterized uniquely in terms of a Hamilton Jacobi Bellman (HJB) system posed on a star-shaped network, having a new boundary condition at the vertex called : non linear local-time Kirchhoff's transmission. The key main point is to use the recent comparison theorem obtained in [40], that has significantly unlocked the study of this type of problem. We conclude by discussing the formulation of stochastic scattering control problems, where there is no dependency w.r.t. the local-time variable, for which their well-posedness appear as a simpler consequence of the results of this work and the advances contained in [40].</description>

      <title>Global existence for semi-linear hyperbolic equations in a neighbourhood of future null infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the global existence of a semi-linear class of hyperbolic equations in 3+1 dimensions, that satisfy the bounded weak null condition. We propose a conformal compactification of the future directed null-cone in Minkowski spacetime, enabling us to establish the solution to the wave equation in a neighbourhood of future null infinity. Using this framework, we formulate a conformal symmetric hyperbolic Fuchsian system of equations. The existence of solutions to this Fuchsian system follows from an application of the existence theory developed in [1], and [2].</description>

      <title>On the modelling of polyatomic molecules in kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This communication is both a pedagogical note for understanding polyatomic modelling in kinetic theory and a ''cheat sheet'' for a series of corresponding concepts and formulas. We explain, detail and relate three possible approaches for modelling the polyatomic internal structure, that are: the internal states approach, well suited for physical modelling and general proofs, the internal energy levels approach, useful for analytic studies and corresponding to the common models of the literature, and the internal energy quantiles approach, less known while being a powerful tool for particle-based numerical simulations such as Direct Simulation Monte-Carlo (DSMC). This note may in particular be useful in the study of non-polytropic gases.</description>

      <title>The global estimate for regular axially-symmetric solutions to the Navier Stokes equations coupled with the heat conduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The axially-symmetric solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the heat conduction are considered. in a bounded cylinder $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^3$. We assume that $v_r, v_{\varphi}, \omega_{\varphi}$ vanish on the lateral part $S_1$ of the boundary $\partial \Omega$ and $v_z, \omega_{\varphi}, \partial_z v_{\varphi}$ vanish on the top and bottom of the cylinder, where we used standard cylindrical coordinates and $\omega=\text{rot} v$ is the vorticity of the fluid. Moreover, vanishing of the heat flux through the boundary is imposed. Assuming existence of a sufficiently regular solution we derive a global a priori estimate in terms of data. The estimate is such that a global regular solutions can be proved. We prove the estimate because some reduction of nonlinearity are found.Moreover, deriving the global estimate for a local solution implies a possibility of its extension in time as long as the estimate holds.</description>

      <title>Upwind filtering of scalar conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of multi-dimensional non-local conservation laws of the form $\partial_t u = \operatorname{div}^{\Phi} \mathbf{F}(u)$, where the standard local divergence $\operatorname{div}$ of the flux vector $\mathbf{F}(u)$ is replaced by an average upwind divergence operator $\operatorname{div}^{\Phi}$ acting on the flux along a continuum of directions given by a reference measure and a filter $\Phi$. The non-local operator $\operatorname{div}^{\Phi}$ applies to a general non-monotone flux $\mathbf{F}$, and is constructed by decomposing the flux into monotone components according to wave speeds determined by $\mathbf{F}'$. Each monotone component is then consistently subjected to a non-local derivative operator that utilizes an anisotropic kernel supported on the "correct" half of the real axis. We establish well-posedness, derive a priori and entropy estimates, and provide an explicit continuous dependence result on the kernel. This stability result is robust with respect to the "size" of the kernel, allowing us to specify $\Phi$ as a Dirac delta $\delta_0$ to recover entropy solutions of the local conservation law $\partial_t u = \operatorname{div} \mathbf{F}(u)$ (with an error estimate). Other choices of $\Phi$ (and the reference measure) recover known numerical methods for (local) conservation laws. This work distinguishes itself from many others in the field by developing a consistent non-local approach capable of handling non-monotone fluxes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to prove a theorem of C.~Miranda on the H\"older regularity of convolution operators acting on the boundary of an open set in the limiting case in which the open set is of class $C^{1,1}$ and the densities are of class $C^{0,1}$. The convolution operators that we consider are generalizations of those that are associated to layer potential operators, which are a useful tool for the analysis of boundary value problems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review a method to obtain optimal Poincar\'e-Hardy-type inequalities on the hyperbolic spaces, and discuss briefly generalisations to certain classes of Riemannian manifolds.
  Afterwards, we recall a corresponding result on homogeneous regular trees and provide a new proof using the aforementioned method. The same strategy will then be applied to obtain new optimal Hardy-type inequalities on weakly spherically symmetric graphs which include fast enough growing trees and anti-trees. In particular, this yields optimal weights which are larger at infinity than the optimal weights classically constructed via the Fitzsimmons ratio of the square root of the minimal positive Green's function.</description>

      <title>Multisoliton solutions and blow up for the $L^2$-critical Hartree equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct multisoliton solutions for the $L^2$-critical Hartree equation with trajectories asymptotically obeying a many-body law for an inverse square potential. Precisely, we consider the $m$-body hyperbolic and parabolic non-trapped dynamics. The pseudo-conformal symmetry then implies finite-time collision blow up in the latter case and a solution blowing up at $m$ distinct points in the former case. The approach we take is based on the ideas of [Krieger-Martel-Rapha\"el, 2009] and the third author's recent extension. The approximation scheme requires new aspects in order to deal with a certain degeneracy for generalized root space elements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the local decomposition of pressure in the Navier-Stokes equations is dynamically refined to prove that a relevant critical energy of a suitable Leray-type solution inside a backward paraboloid, regardless of its aperture is controlled near the vertex by a critical behavior confined to a neighborhood of the paraboloid's boundary. This neighborhood excludes the interior near the vertex and remains separated from the temporal profile of the vertex, except at the vertex itself.</description>

      <title>A Global Existence Theorem for a Fourth-Order Crystal Surface Model with Gradient Dependent Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study the existence of solutions to a fourth-order nonlinear PDE related to crystal surface growth. The key difficulty in the equations comes from the mobility matrix, which depends on the gradient of the solution. When the mobility matrix is the identity matrix there are now many existence results, however when it is allowed to depend on the solution we lose crucial estimates in the time direction. In this work we are able to prove the global existence of weak solutions despite this lack of estimates in the time direction.</description>

Abstract: This paper gives a concise but rigorous mathematical description of a material control volume that is separated into two parts by a singular surface at which physical states are discontinuous. The geometrical background material is summarized in a unified manner. Transport theorems for use in generic balance laws are given with proofs since they provide some insight into the results. Also the step from integral balances to differential equations is given in some detail.</description>

Abstract: For all $\alpha\in(0,1)$, we construct an explicit divergence-free vector field $V\in L^\infty_tC^\alpha_x \cap C^{\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}}_t L^\infty_x$ so that the solutions to the drift-diffusion equations $$\partial_t\theta^\kappa-\kappa\Delta\theta^\kappa+V\cdot\nabla\theta^\kappa=0$$ exhibit asymptotic total dissipation for all mean-zero initial data: $\lim_{\kappa\rightarrow 0}\|\theta^\kappa(1,\cdot)\|_{L^2}=0$. Additionally, we give explicit rates in $\kappa$ and uniform dependence on initial data.</description>

      <title>Smoothing of operator semigroups under relatively bounded perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a smoothing property for strongly-continuous operator semigroups, akin to ultracontractivity in parabolic evolution equations. Specifically, we establish the stability of this property under certain relatively bounded perturbations of the semigroup generator. This result yields a spectral perturbation theorem, which has implications for the long-term dynamics of evolution equations driven by elliptic operators of second and higher orders.</description>

      <title>Aggregation-Confinement-Diffusion Evolutions with Saturation: Regularity and Long-Time Asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish H\"older regularity for the weak solution to a degenerate diffusion equation in the presence of a local (drift) potential and nonlocal (interaction) term, posed in a bounded domain with no-flux boundary conditions. The degeneracy is due to saturation, i.e., it occurs when the solution reaches its maximal value. As a byproduct of the established regularity and the underlying dissipative structure of the evolution, we prove the uniform convergence to the unique, energy-minimizing stationary state in the absence of the interaction term.</description>

      <title>Gradient estimates for scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A gradient estimate is a crucial tool used to control the rate of change of a function on a manifold, paving the way for deeper analysis of geometric properties. A celebrated result of Cheng and Yau gives gradient bounds on manifolds with Ricci curvature $\geq 0$. The Cheng-Yau bound is not sharp, but there is a gradient sharp estimate. To explain this, a Green's function $u$ on a manifold can be used to define a regularized distance $b= u^{\frac{1}{2-n}}$ to the pole. On $\bf{R}^n$, the level sets of $b$ are spheres and $|\nabla b|=1$. If $\text{Ric} \geq 0$, then [C3] proved the sharp gradient estimate $|\nabla b| \leq 1$. We show that the average of $|\nabla b|$ is $\leq 1$ on a three manifold with nonnegative scalar curvature. The average is over any level set of $b$ and if the average is one on even one level set, then $M=\bf{R}^3$.</description>

Abstract: We derive a noise term to account for fluctuation corrections based on the particle system approximation for the n-species Shigesada-Kawasaki-Teramoto (SKT) system. For the resulting system of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), we establish the existence of nonnegative, global, weak martingale solutions. Our approach utilizes the regularization technique, which is grounded in the entropy structure of the system.</description>

      <title>Generic topological screening and approximation of Sobolev maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This manuscript develops a framework for the strong approximation of Sobolev maps with values in compact manifolds, emphasizing the interplay between local and global topological properties. Building on topological concepts adapted to VMO maps, such as homotopy and the degree of continuous maps, it introduces and analyzes extendability properties, focusing on the notions of $\ell$-extendability and its generalization, $(\ell, e)$-extendability.
  We rely on Fuglede maps, providing a robust setting for handling compositions with Sobolev maps. Several constructions -- including opening, thickening, adaptive smoothing, and shrinking -- are carefully integrated into a unified approach that combines homotopical techniques with precise quantitative estimates.
  Our main results establish that a Sobolev map $u \in W^{k, p}$ defined on a compact manifold of dimension $m &gt; kp$ can be approximated by smooth maps if and only if $u$ is $(\lfloor kp \rfloor, e)$-extendable with $e = m$. When $e &lt; m$, the approximation can still be carried out using maps that are smooth except on structured singular sets of rank $m - e - 1$.</description>

Abstract: The statistical features of homogeneous, isotropic, two-dimensional stochastic turbulence are discussed. We derive some rigorous bounds for the mean value of the bulk energy dissipation rate $\mathbb{E} [\varepsilon ]$ and enstrophy dissipation rates $\mathbb{E} [\chi] $ for 2D flows sustained by a variety of stochastic driving forces. We show that $$\mathbb{E} [ \varepsilon ] \rightarrow 0 \hspace{0.5cm}\mbox{and} \hspace{0.5cm} \mathbb{E} [ \chi ] \lesssim \mathcal{O}(1)$$ in the inviscid limit, consistent with the dual-cascade in 2D turbulence.</description>

      <title>A Unified Perspective on the Dynamics of Deep Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers, which are state-of-the-art in most machine learning tasks, represent the data as sequences of vectors called tokens. This representation is then exploited by the attention function, which learns dependencies between tokens and is key to the success of Transformers. However, the iterative application of attention across layers induces complex dynamics that remain to be fully understood. To analyze these dynamics, we identify each input sequence with a probability measure and model its evolution as a Vlasov equation called Transformer PDE, whose velocity field is non-linear in the probability measure. Our first set of contributions focuses on compactly supported initial data. We show the Transformer PDE is well-posed and is the mean-field limit of an interacting particle system, thus generalizing and extending previous analysis to several variants of self-attention: multi-head attention, L2 attention, Sinkhorn attention, Sigmoid attention, and masked attention--leveraging a conditional Wasserstein framework. In a second set of contributions, we are the first to study non-compactly supported initial conditions, by focusing on Gaussian initial data. Again for different types of attention, we show that the Transformer PDE preserves the space of Gaussian measures, which allows us to analyze the Gaussian case theoretically and numerically to identify typical behaviors. This Gaussian analysis captures the evolution of data anisotropy through a deep Transformer. In particular, we highlight a clustering phenomenon that parallels previous results in the non-normalized discrete case.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear SPDEs and Maximal Regularity: An Extended Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this survey, we provide an in-depth exposition of our recent results on the well-posedness theory for stochastic evolution equations, employing maximal regularity techniques. The core of our approach is an abstract notion of critical spaces, which, when applied to nonlinear SPDEs, coincides with the concept of scaling invariant spaces. This framework leads to several sharp blow-up criteria and enables one to obtain instantaneous regularization results. Additionally, we refine and unify our previous results, while also presenting several new contributions.
  In the second part of the survey, we apply the abstract results to several concrete SPDEs. In particular, we give applications to stochastic perturbations of quasi-geostrophic equations, Navier-Stokes equations, and reaction-diffusion systems (including Allen--Cahn, Cahn--Hilliard and Lotka--Volterra models). Moreover, for the Navier--Stokes equations, we establish new Serrin-type blow-up criteria. While some applications are addressed using $L^2$-theory, many require a more general $L^p(L^q)$-framework. In the final section, we outline several open problems, covering both abstract aspects of stochastic evolution equations, and concrete questions in the study of linear and nonlinear SPDEs.</description>

      <title>Sparse identification of nonlocal interaction kernels in nonlinear gradient flow equations via partial inversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06355v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the inverse problem of identifying nonlocal interaction potentials in nonlinear aggregation-diffusion equations from noisy discrete trajectory data. Our approach involves formulating and solving a regularized variational problem, which requires minimizing a quadratic error functional across a set of hypothesis functions, further augmented by a sparsity-enhancing regularizer. We employ a partial inversion algorithm, akin to the CoSaMP [57] and subspace pursuit algorithms [31], to solve the Basis Pursuit problem. A key theoretical contribution is our novel stability estimate for the PDEs, validating the error functional ability in controlling the 2-Wasserstein distance between solutions generated using the true and estimated interaction potentials. Our work also includes an error analysis of estimators caused by discretization and observational errors in practical implementations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods through various 1D and 2D examples showcasing collective behaviors.</description>

      <title>Rotating Rayleigh-Benard convection: Attractors, bifurcations and heat transport via a Galerkin hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the need for energetically consistent climate models, the Boussinessq-Coriolis (BC) equations are studied with a focus on the averaged vertical heat transport, ie the Nusselt number. A set of formulae are derived by which arbitrary Fourier truncations of the BC model can be explicitly generated, and Criteria are given which precisely guarantee that such truncated models obey energy relations consistent with the PDE. The Howard-Krishnamurti-Coriolis (HKC) hierarchy of such energetically consistent ODE models is then implemented in MATLAB, with code available on GitHub. Several theoretical results are proven to support a numerical analysis. Well-posedness and convergence of the HKC hierarchy toward the BC model are proven, as well as the existence of an attractor for the BC model. Since the rate of convergence is unknown, explicit upper and lower bounds on the attractor dimension are proven so as to provide guidance for the required spatial resolution for an accurate approximation of the Nusselt number. Finally, a series of numerical studies are performed using MATLAB, which investigate the required spatial resolution and indicate the presence of multiple stable values of the Nusselt number, setting the stage for an energetically consistent analysis of convective heat transport.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the large-time asymptotics of a passive tracer with drift equal to the curl of the Gaussian free field in two dimensions with ultra-violet cut-off at scale unity. We prove that the mean-squared displacement scales like $t \sqrt{\ln t}$, as predicted in the physics literature and recently almost proved by the work of Cannizzaro, Haunschmidt-Sibitz, and Toninelli (2022), which uses mathematical-physics type analysis in Fock space. Our approach involves studying the effective diffusivity $\lambda_{L}$ of the process with an infra-red cut-off at scale $L$, and is based on techniques from stochastic homogenization.</description>

      <title>Generation of chaos in the cumulant hierarchy of the stochastic Kac model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the time-evolution of cumulants of velocities and kinetic energies in the stochastic Kac model for velocity exchange of $N$ particles, with the aim of quantifying how fast these degrees of freedom become chaotic in a time scale in which the collision rate for each particle is order one. Chaos here is understood in the sense of the original Sto\ss zahlansatz, as an almost complete independence of the particle velocities which we measure by the magnitude of their cumulants up to a finite, but arbitrary order. Known spectral gap results imply that typical initial densities converge to uniform distribution on the constant energy sphere at a time which has order of $N$ expected collisions. We prove that the finite order cumulants converge to their small stationary values much faster, already at a time scale of order one collisions. The proof relies on stability analysis of the closed, but nonlinear, hierarchy of energy cumulants around the fixed point formed by their values in the stationary spherical distribution. It provides the first example of an application of the cumulant hierarchy method to control the properties of a microscopic model related to kinetic theory.</description>
