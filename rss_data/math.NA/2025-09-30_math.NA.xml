      <title>An unfitted HDG discretization for a model problem in shape optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply an unfitted HDG discretization to a model problem in shape optimization. The method proposed uses a fixed, shape regular, non-geometry conforming mesh and a high order transfer technique to deal with the curved boundaries arising in the optimization process. The use of this strategy avoids the need for constant remeshing and enables a highly accurate description of the domain using a coarse computational mesh. We develop a rigorous analysis of the well-posedness of the problems that arise from the optimality conditions, and provide an a priori error analysis for the resulting discrete schemes. Numerical examples with manufactured problems are provided demonstrating the convergence of the scheme and the efficiency of the transfer path method. The approach proposed yields high resolution approximations of the boundary using grids with as few as 100 times less elements than an interpolatory technique.</description>

      <title>Accelerating High-Fidelity Fixed Point Schemes with On-the-fly Reduced Order Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general method for accelerating fixed point schemes for problems related to partial differential equations is presented in this article. The speedup is obtained by training a reduced-order model on-the-fly, removing the need to do an offline training phase and any dependence to a precomputed reduced basis (e.g. a fixed geometry or mesh). The surrogate model can adapt itself along the iterations because of an error criterion based on error propagation, ensuring the high fidelity of the converged result. Convergence results are given for a general class of fixed point problems with complex dependence structures between multiple auxiliary linear systems. The proposed algorithm is applied to the solution of a system of coupled partial differential equations. The speedups obtained are significant, and the output of the method can be considered high-fidelity when compared to the reference solution.</description>

      <title>Mathematical and numerical modeling of coupled oxygen dynamics and neuronal electrophysiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how oxygen supply shapes neuronal excitability is crucial for explaining brain function in pathological scenarios, such as ischemia. This condition is caused by a reduced blood supply, leading to oxygen and other metabolites deprivation; this energy deficit impairs ionic pumps and causes cellular swelling. In this work, this phenomenon is modeled through a volumetric variation law that links cell swelling to local oxygen concentration and the percentage of blood flow reduction. The swelling law ties volume changes to local oxygen and the degree of blood-flow depression, providing a simple pathway from hypoxia to tortuosity-driven transport impairment. To study the interplay between oxygen supply and excitability in brain tissue, we employ a monodomain model coupled with specific neuronal ionic and metabolic models that characterize ion and metabolite concentration dynamics. From a numerical point of view, suitable space- and time-adaptive schemes are employed to capture the sharp and fast-traveling wavefronts representing action potentials more accurately. This multiscale model is discretized in space with the high-order p-adaptive discontinuous Galerkin method on polygonal and polyhedral grids (PolyDG) and integrated in time with a Crank-Nicolson scheme. We numerically investigate different pathological scenarios on a two-dimensional, idealized square domain discretized with a polygonal grid, analyzing how subclinical and severe ischemia can affect brain electrophysiology and metabolic concentrations.</description>

      <title>Superconvergence of High-order Magnus Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Magnus expansion has long been a celebrated subject in numerical analysis, leading to the development of many useful classical integrators. More recently, it has been discovered to be a powerful tool for designing quantum algorithms for Hamiltonian simulation in quantum computing. In particular, surprising superconvergence behavior has been observed for quantum Magnus algorithms applied to the simulation of the Schr\"odinger equation, with the first- and second-order methods exhibiting doubled convergence order. In this work, we provide a rigorous proof that such superconvergence extends to general high-order quantum Magnus algorithms. Specifically, we show that a quantum Magnus algorithm of order $p$ achieves the superconvergence of order $2p$ in time when applying to the Schr\"odinger equation simulation in the interaction picture. Our analysis combines techniques from semiclassical analysis and Weyl calculus, offering a new perspective on the mathematical foundations of quantum algorithms for time-dependent Hamiltonian simulation.</description>

      <title>A Virtual Element Method on polyhedra with curved faces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we construct conforming Virtual Element approximations on domains with curved boundary and/or internal curved interfaces, both in two and three dimensions. Our approach allows to impose both Dirichlet and Neumann non-homogeneous boundary conditions, and provides, for degree of accuracy $k \geq 1$, optimal convergence rates. Whenever the exact solution is a polynomial of degree $k$, local spaces of degree $k$ ensure satisfaction of the patch test. The proposed method is theoretically analyzed in the two-dimensional case, whereas it is numerically validated both in two and three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical feedback control with operator learning for the Vlasov-Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To meet the demands of instantaneous control of instabilities over long time horizons in plasma fusion, we design a dynamic feedback control strategy for the Vlasov-Poisson system by constructing an operator that maps state perturbations to an external control field. In the first part of the paper, we propose learning such an operator using a neural network. Inspired by optimal control theory for linearized dynamics, we introduce a low-rank neural operator architecture and train it via adjoint state method. The resulting controller is effective at suppressing instabilities well beyond the training time horizon. To generalize control across varying initial data, we further introduce a novel cancellation-based control strategy that removes the destabilizing component of the electric field. This approach naturally defines an operator without requiring any training, ensures perturbation decay over infinite time, and demonstrates strong robustness under noisy feedback. Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the method in both one- and multidimensional settings.</description>

      <title>A FFT-based GMRES for fast solving of Poisson equation in concatenated geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based solvers for the Poisson equation are highly efficient, exhibiting $O(N\log N)$ computational complexity and excellent parallelism. However, their application is typically restricted to simple, regular geometries due to the separability requirement of the underlying discrete operators. This paper introduces a novel domain decomposition method that extends the applicability of FFT-based solvers to complex composite domains geometries constructed from multiple sub-regions. The method transforms the global problem into a system of sub-problems coupled through Schur complements at the interfaces. A key challenge is that the Schur complement disrupts the matrix structure required for direct FFT-based inversion. To overcome this, we develop a FFT-based preconditioner to accelerate the Generalized Minimal Residual (GMRES) method for the interface system. The central innovation is a novel preconditioner based on the inverse of the block operator without the Schur complement, which can be applied efficiently using the FFT-based solver. The resulting preconditioned iteration retains an optimal complexity for each step. Numerical experiments on a cross-shaped domain demonstrate that the proposed solver achieves the expected second-order accuracy of the underlying finite difference scheme. Furthermore, it exhibits significantly improved computational performance compared to a classic sparse GMRES solver based on Eigen libeary. For a problem with $10^5$ grid points, our method achieves a speedup of over 40 times.</description>

      <title>On the rotating nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation with multiscale effects: structure-preserving methods and applications to vortex dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study numerical methods for the rotating nonlinear Klein-Gordon (RKG) equation, a fundamental model in relativistic quantum physics, which exhibits highly oscillatory multiscale behavior due to the presence of a small parameter {\epsilon}. The RKG equation models rotating galaxies under the Minkowski metric and also provides an effective description of phenomena such as cosmic superfluids. This work focuses on the development and rigorous analysis of structure-preserving Galerkin finite element methods (FEMs) for the RKG equation. A central challenge is that the rotational terms prevent traditional nonconforming FEMs from simultaneously conserving energy and charge. By employing a conservation-adjusting technique, we construct a consistent structure-preserving algorithm applicable to both conforming and nonconforming FEMs. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive convergence analysis, establishing unconditional optimal and high-order accuracy error estimates. These theoretical results are further validated through extensive numerical experiments, which demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the structure-preserving schemes. Finally, simulations of vortex dynamics, ranging from the relativistic to the nonrelativistic regimes, are presented to illustrate vortex creation, relativistic effects on bound states, and interactions of vortex pairs.</description>

      <title>A Besov-based integration-by-parts method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note introduces a novel numerical analysis framework for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations based on Besov spaces. The key contribution of this note is to establish the stability and convergence of a semi-implicit time-stepping scheme by deriving precise error estimates in the $B^0_{\infty,1}$ and $B^0_{\infty,2}$ spaces. Another contribution of our analysis is the detailed treatment of the $B^0_{\infty,2}$ case, where a crucial integration-by-parts technique is employed to adeptly handle the nonlinear advection term. This technique allows for a refined estimate that effectively transfers derivatives onto the test functions, mitigating the inherent analytical challenges posed by the low regularity of these spaces. Our results provide sharper, more localized error bounds than in classical Sobolev spaces, directly linking the scheme's convergence to the critical regularity of the continuous solution. This work underscores the advantage of Besov spaces for the numerical analysis of nonlinear fluid PDEs.</description>

      <title>An Accelerated Newton-GMRES Method for Multilinear PageRank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling complex multiway relationships in large-scale networks is becoming more and more challenging in data science. The multilinear PageRank problem, arising naturally in the study of higher-order Markov chains, is a powerful framework for capturing such interactions, with applications in web ranking, recommendation systems, and social network analysis. It extends the classical Google PageRank model to a tensor-based formulation, leading to a nonlinear system that captures multi-way dependencies between states. Newton-based methods can achieve local quadratic convergence for this problem, but they require solving a large linear system at each iteration, which becomes too costly for large-scale applications. To address this challenge, we present an accelerated Newton-GMRES method that leverages Krylov subspace techniques to approximate the Newton step without explicitly forming the large Jacobian matrix. We further employ vector extrapolation methods, including Minimal Polynomial Extrapolation (MPE), Reduced Rank Extrapolation (RRE), and Anderson Acceleration (AA), to improve the convergence rate and enhance numerical stability. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms classical Newton-based solvers in terms of efficiency, robustness, and scalability.</description>

      <title>Penalized Weighted Trace Minimization for Optimal Control Device Design and Placement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new analytical framework for determining the well-posedness of constrained optimization problems that arise in the study of optimal control device design and placement within the context of infinite dimensional linear quadratic control systems. We first prove the well-posedness of the newly minted "strong form" of the time-independent operator-valued Riccati equation. This form of the equation then enables the use of trace-class operator analysis and the Lagrange multiplier formalism to analyze operator-valued Riccati equation-constrained optimization problems. Using this fundamental result, we then determine the conditions under which there exists unique solutions to two important classes of penalized trace minimization problems for optimal control device placement and design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an energy functional that arises in micromagnetic and liquid crystal theory on thin films. In particular, our energy comprises a non-convex term that models anti-symmetric exchange as well as an anisotropy term. We devise an algorithm for energy minimization in the continuous case and show weak convergence of a subsequence towards a solution of the corresponding Euler--Lagrange equation. Furthermore, an algorithm for numerical energy minimization is presented. We show empirically that this numerical algorithm converges to the correct solutions for a benchmark problem without the need for user-supplied parameters, and present a rigorous convergence analysis for important special cases.</description>

      <title>Multi-order Runge-Kutta methods or how to numerically solve initial value problems of any order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When one wishes to numerically solve an initial value problem, it is customary to rewrite it as an equivalent first-order system to which a method, usually from the class of Runge-Kutta methods, is applied. Directly treating higher-order initial value problems without such rewriting, however, allows for significantly greater accuracy. We therefore introduce a new generalization of Runge-Kutta methods, called multi-order Runge-Kutta methods, designed to solve initial value problems of arbitrary order. We establish fundamental properties of these methods, including convergence, order of consistency, and linear stability. We also analyze the structure of the system satisfied by the approximations of a method, which enables us to provide a proper definition of explicit methods and to gain a finer understanding of implicit methods.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Error Analysis of Gauss Quadrature for Nonsmooth Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an asymptotic error formula for Gauss--Legendre quadrature applied to functions with limited regularity, using the contour-integral representation of the remainder term. To address the absence of uniformly valid approximations of Legendre functions near $[-1,1]$, we approximate the integrand by smoother functions with singularities displaced from the interval and then obtain asymptotic expansions of the Legendre functions that hold uniformly along the contour. The resulting error formula identifies not only the optimal convergence rate but also the leading coefficient, expressed in terms of $\cos((2n+1)\phi)$, where $n$ is the number of quadrature points and $\cos(\phi)$ locates the singularity. This characterization enables both the selection of quadrature sizes that minimize the leading error and the use of the error formula as a correction term to accelerate convergence. Applications to functions with power and logarithmic singularities are presented, and numerical experiments confirm the accuracy of the analysis.</description>

      <title>Performance and Numerical Aspects of Decompositional Factorizations with FP64 Floating-Point Emulation in INT8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixing precisions for performance has been an ongoing trend as the modern hardware accelerators started including new, and mostly lower-precision, data formats. The advantage of using them is a great potential of performance gain and energy savings. The disadvantage are the numerical issues not present in the standard-mandated floating-point formats. Split integer emulation of FP64 takes this to an extreme with the computation performed only by fixed-point tensor core units. We present the new issues the emulation faces for practical cases involving dense linear solver. We show extensive numerical tests indicating the effect of extended numerical range of matrix entries. We also scaled the input sizes to study the performance and numerical profiles on the NVIDIA Hopper GPUs.</description>

      <title>A space-time generalized finite difference method for solving the transient Stokes/Parabolic interface problem in the moving system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23702</link>

Abstract: In this paper, a space-time generalized finite difference method (ST-GFDM) is proposed to solve the transient Stokes/Parabolic moving interface problem which is a type of fluid-structure interaction problem. The ST-GFDM considers the time dimension as the third space dimension, and the 2D time-dependent Stokes/Parabolic moving interface problem can be seen as a 3D interface problem where the interface is formed by the initial interface shape and the moving trajectory. The GFDM has an advantage in dealing with interface problems with complex interface shape and moving interface in the ST domain. More irregular moving direction, more complex interface shape, and the translation and deformation of interface are analyzed to show the advantage of the ST-GFDM. The interface problem can be transformed into coupled sub-problems and locally dense nodes is used when the subdomain is too small to satisfy the needs of the numbers of the nodes to improve the performance of the ST-GFDM. Five examples are provided to verify the existence of the good performance of the ST-GFDM for Stokes/Parabolic moving interface problems, including those of the simplicity, accuracy, high efficiency and stability.</description>

      <title>Finite Element Complexes with Traces Structures: A unified framework for cohomology and bounded interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the cohomology and bounded interpolation of nonstandard finite element complexes, e.g. Stokes, Hessian, Elasticity, divdiv. Compared to the standard finite element exterior calculus, the main challenge is the existence of extra smoothness. This paper provides a unified framework for finite element complexes with extra smoothness. The trace structure is introduced to derive the bubble complexes in different dimensions (vertices, edges, faces). It is shown that if the bubble complexes in different dimensions are all exact, then the finite element has the correct cohomology. Moreover, the $L^2$ bounded interpolation can be constructed.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing the singularity swap quadrature for near-singular line integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singularity swap quadrature (SSQ) is an effective method for the evaluation at nearby targets of potentials due to densities on curves in three dimensions. While highly accurate in most settings, it is known to suffer from catastrophic cancellation when the kernel exhibits both near-vanishing numerators and strong singularities, as arises with scalar double layer potentials or tensorial kernels in Stokes flow or linear elasticity. This precision loss turns out to be tied to the interpolation basis, namely monomial (for open curves) or Fourier (closed curves). We introduce a simple yet powerful remedy: target-specific translated monomial and Fourier bases that explicitly incorporate the near-vanishing behavior of the kernel numerator. We combine this with a stable evaluation of the constant term which now dominates the integral, significantly reducing cancellation. We show that our approach achieves close to machine precision for prototype integrals, and up to ten orders of magnitude lower error than standard SSQ at extremely close evaluation distances, without significant additional computational cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formulation of norms on continuous-domain Banach spaces with exact pixel-based discretization is advantageous for solving inverse problems (IPs). In this paper, we investigate a new regularization that is a convex combination of a TV term and the $\M(\R^2)$ norm of mixed derivatives. We show that the extreme points of the corresponding unit ball are indicator functions of polygons whose edges are aligned with either the $x_1$- or $x_2$-axis. We then apply this result to construct a new regularization for IPs, which can be discretized exactly by tensor products of first-order B-splines, or equivalently, pixels. Furthermore, we exactly discretize the loss of the denoising problem on its canonical pixel basis and prove that it admits a unique solution, which is also a solution to the underlying continuous-domain IP.</description>

      <title>Analytical and Numerical Approaches for Finding Functional Iterates and Roots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate solutions to the functional equation $f(f(x)) = e^x$, which can be interpreted as the problem of finding a half iterate of the exponential map. While no elementary solution exists, we construct and analyze non-elementary solutions using methods based on the Lambert W function, tetration, and Abel's functional equation. We examine structural properties of possible solutions, including monotonicity, injectivity, and behavior across different intervals, and provide a piecewise-defined framework that extends to the entire real domain. Building on this, we introduce the super-logarithm and its inverse, the super-root, as analytic tools for defining fractional iterates of $e^x$. Using a power-series expansion near $x = 1$, we numerically approximate the super-logarithm and demonstrate a procedure for computing fractional iterates, including the half-iterate of the exponential function. Our approach is validated by comparisons to known constructions such as Kneser's tetration, with an emphasis on computational feasibility and numerical stability. Finally, we explore the broader landscape of fractional iteration, showing that similar techniques can be applied to other functions beyond $e^x$. Through numerical approximations and series-based methods using genetic algorithms and other optimization techniques, we confirm that fractional iterates not only exist for many analytic functions but can be computed with practical accuracy, opening pathways to further applications in dynamical systems and functional analysis.</description>

      <title>Numerical and analytical modeling of heat equation in current-carrying conductors using the heat equation implemented using Finite-JAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current-carrying conductors inevitably experience resistive heating due to the finite electrical conductivity of the material. The resulting temperature distribution within the wire has essential implications for structural integrity, efficiency, and long-term reliability of electronic and power systems. In this work, we model the spatiotemporal evolution of heat in a current-carrying wire using the classical heat conduction equation. In a two-dimensional formulation, heat transport is considered both along and across the conductor. The governing partial differential equation is discretized using finite-difference methods implemented using Finite-JAX under appropriate initial and boundary conditions, including the Dirichlet condition relevant to practical scenarios. Time integration is performed using the explicit scheme, and stability constraints are systematically examined. To assess the accuracy of the numerical approach, we compare the computed temperature fields with the exact analytical solution of the heat equation for canonical geometry. Results show that the numerical prediction converges toward the analytical solution, with error norms decreasing at the expected order of accuracy. This study demonstrates how the heat equation provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for modeling resistive heating in conductors.</description>

      <title>Spectral equivalence of unsymmetric kernel matrices and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetric kernel matrices are a well researched topic in the literature of kernel based approximation. In particular stability properties in terms of lower bounds on the smallest eigenvalue of such symmetric kernel matrices are thoroughly investigated, as they play a fundamental role in theory and practice. In this work, we focus on unsymmetric kernel matrices and derive stability properties under small shifts by establishing a spectral equivalence to their unshifted, symmetric versions. This extends and generalizes results for translational invariant kernels upon Quak et al [SIAM Journal on Math. Analysis, 1993] and Sivakumar and Ward [Numerische Mathematik, 1993], however focussing instead on finitely smooth kernels. As applications, we consider convolutional kernels over domains, which are no longer translational invariant, but which are still an important class of kernels for applications. For these, we derive novel lower bounds for the smallest eigenvalue of the kernel matrices in terms of the separation distance of the data points, and thus derive stability bounds in terms of the condition number.</description>

      <title>Universal $L_2$-approximation using median lattice algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of multivariate $L_2$-approximation of functions in a weighted Korobov space using a median lattice-based algorithm recently proposed by the authors. In the original work, the algorithm requires knowledge of the smoothness and weights of the Korobov space to construct the hyperbolic cross index set, where each coefficient is estimated via the median of approximations obtained from randomly shifted, randomly chosen rank-1 lattice rules. In this paper, we introduce a \emph{universal median lattice-based algorithm}, which eliminates the need for any prior information on smoothness and weights. Although the tractability property of the algorithm slightly deteriorates, we prove that, for individual functions in the Korobov space with arbitrary smoothness and (downward-closed) weights, it achieves an $L_2$-approximation error arbitrarily close to the optimal rate with respect to the number of function evaluations.</description>

      <title>Coupling Physics Informed Neural Networks with External Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current work aims to incorporate physics-based loss in Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) directly using the numerical residual obtained from the governing equation in any dicretized forward solver. PINN's major difficulties in coupling with external forward solvers arise from the inability to access the discretized form (Finite difference, finite volume, finite element, etc.) of the governing equation directly through the network and to include them in its computational graph. This poses a significant challenge to conventional automatic-differentiation-based derivative computation of physics-based loss terms concerning the neural network hyperparameters if gradient-based optimization techniques are adopted. Therefore, we propose modifying the physics-based loss term to account for the residual arising from the external solver and to compute the derivative required for the optimization machinery. The proposed methodologies are demonstrated on benchmark full-order and reduced-order systems.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Finite Element Method for Multi-dimensional Nonlocal Laplacian on Uniform Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing the stiffness matrix for the finite element discretization of the nonlocal Laplacian on unstructured meshes is difficult, because the operator is nonlocal and can even be singular. In this paper, we focus on the $C^0$-piecewise linear finite element method (FEM) for the nonlocal Laplacian on uniform grids within a $d$-dimensional rectangular domain. By leveraging the connection between FE bases and B-splines (having attractive convolution properties), we can reduce the involved $2d$-dimensional integrals for the stiffness matrix entries into integrations over $d$-dimensional balls with explicit integrands involving cubic B-splines and the kernel functions, which allows for explicit study of the singularities and accurate evaluations of such integrals in spherical coordinates. We show the nonlocal stiffness matrix has a block-Toeplitz structure, so the matrix-vector multiplication can be implemented using fast Fourier transform (FFT). In addition, when the interaction radius $\delta\to 0^+,$ the nonlocal stiffness matrix automatically reduces to the local one. Although our semi-analytic approach on uniform grids cannot be extended to general domains with unstructured meshes, the resulting solver can seamlessly integrate with the grid-overlay (Go) technique for the nonlocal Laplacian on arbitrary bounded domains.</description>

      <title>A posteriori existence of strong solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global existence of strong solutions to the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations remains an open problem. A posteriori existence results offer a way to rigorously verify the existence of strong solutions by ruling out blow-up on a certain time interval, using only numerical solutions. In this work we present such a result for the Navier-Stokes equations subject to periodic boundary conditions, which makes use of a version of the celebrated blow-up criterion in the critical space $L^\infty(L^3)$ by Iskauriaza, Ser\"egin and Shverak (2003). Our approach is based on a conditional stability estimate in $L^2$ and $L^3$. The a posteriori criterion that, if satisfied, verifies existence of strong solutions, involves only negative Sobolev norms of the residual. We apply the criterion to numerical approximations computed with mixed finite elements and an implicit Euler time discretisation. A posteriori error estimates allow us to derive a fully computable criterion without imposing any extra assumptions on the solution. While limited to short time intervals, with sufficient computational resources in principle the criterion might allow for a verification over longer time intervals than what can be achieved by theoretical means.</description>

      <title>Diffuse Domain Methods with Dirichlet Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) on complex domains often presents a significant computational challenge by requiring the generation of fitted meshes. The Diffuse Domain Method (DDM) is an alternative which reformulates the problem on a larger, simple domain where the complex geometry is represented by a smooth phase-field function.
  This paper introduces and analyses several new DDM methods for solving problems with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We derive two new methods from the mixed formulation of the governing equations. This approach transforms the essential Dirichlet conditions into natural boundary conditions. Additionally, we develop coercive formulations based on Nitsche's method, and provide proofs of coercivity for all new and key existing approximations.
  Numerical experiments demonstrate the improved accuracy of the new methods, and reveal the balance between $L^2$ and $H^1$ errors. The practical effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through the simulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on a benchmark fluid dynamics problems.</description>

      <title>A bound-preserving multinumerics scheme for steady-state convection-diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve the convection-diffusion equation using a coupling of cell-centered finite volume (FV) and discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods. The domain is divided into disjoint regions assigned to FV or DG, and the two methods are coupled through an interface term. DG is stable and resolves sharp layers in convection-dominated regimes, but it can produce sizable spurious oscillations and is computationally expensive; FV (two-point flux) is low-order and monotone, but inexpensive. We propose a novel adaptive partitioning strategy that automatically selects FV and DG subdomains: whenever the solution's cell average violates the bounds, we switch to FV on a small neighborhood of that element. Viewed as a natural analog of $p$-adaptivity, this process is repeated until all cell averages are bound-preserving (up to some specified tolerance). Thereafter, standard conservative limiters may be applied to ensure the full solution is bound-preserving. Standard benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of the adaptive technique.</description>

      <title>A convergence rate result for front tracking approximations of conservation laws with discontinuous flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the initial value problem for a scalar conservation law in one space dimension with a
  single spatial flux discontinuity, the so-called two-flux problem. We prove that a well-known
  front tracking algorithm has a convergence rate of at least one-half. The fluxes are required to be smooth, but are not required to be
  convex or concave, monotone, or even unimodal. We require that there are no more than
  finitely many flux crossings, but we do not require that they satisfy the so-called crossing condition.
  If both fluxes are strictly increasing or strictly decreasing then our analysis yields a
  convergence rate of one, in agreement with a recent result. Similarly, if the fluxes
  are equal, i.e., there is no flux discontinuity, we obtain a convergence rate of one
  in this case also, in agreement with a classical result.
  The novelty of this paper is that the class of discontinuous-flux conservation laws
  for which there is a front tracking error estimate is expanded, and that the method of analysis is new;
  we do not use the Kuznetsov lemma which is commonly used for this type of analysis.</description>

      <title>Unlicensed Band Allocation for Heterogeneous Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the License-Assisted Access (LAA) small cell architecture, the LAA coexisting with Wi-Fi heterogeneous networks provides LTE mobile users with high bandwidth efficiency as the unlicensed channels are shared among LAA and Wi-Fi. However, LAA and Wi-Fi interfere with each other when both systems use the same unlicensed channel in heterogeneous networks. In such a network, unlicensed band allocation for LAA and Wi-Fi is an important issue that may affect the quality of service (QoS) of both systems significantly. In this paper, we propose an analytical model and conduct simulation experiments to study four allocations for the unlicensed band: unlicensed full allocation (UFA), unlicensed time-division allocation (UTA), and UFA/UTA with buffering mechanism (UFAB and UTAB) for the LAA data packets. We evaluate the performance of these unlicensed band allocation schemes in terms of the acceptance rate of both LAA and Wi-Fi packet data in the LAA buffer queue. Our study provides guidelines for designing the channel occupation phase and the buffer size of the LAA small cell.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Unlicensed Band Allocation for LAA With Buffering Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose an analytical model and conduct simulation experiments to study listen-before-talk-based unlicensed band allocation with the buffering mechanism for the License-Assisted Access (LAA) packets in the heterogeneous networks. In such a network, unlicensed band allocation for LAA and Wi-Fi is an important issue, which may affect the quality of service for both systems significantly. We evaluate the performance of these unlicensed band allocations in terms of the acceptance rate of both LAA and Wi-Fi packets. This letter provides the guidelines for designing the channel occupation phase and buffer threshold of the LAA systems.</description>

      <title>Markov Modeling for Licensed and Unlicensed Band Allocation in Underlay and Overlay D2D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel analytical model for resource allocation is proposed for a device-to-device (D2D) assisted cellular network. The proposed model can be applied to underlay and overlay D2D systems for sharing licensed bands and offloading cellular traffic. The developed model also takes into account the problem of unlicensed band sharing with Wi-Fi systems. In the proposed model, a global system state reflects the interaction among D2D, conventional cellular, and Wi-Fi packets. Under the standard traffic model assumptions, a threshold-based flow control is proposed for guaranteeing the quality-of-service (QoS) of Wi-Fi. The packet blockage probability is then derived. Simulation results show the proposed scheme sacrifices conventional cellular performance slightly to improve overlay D2D performance significantly while maintaining the performance for Wi-Fi users. Meanwhile, the proposed scheme has more flexible adjustments between D2D and Wi-Fi than the underlay scheme.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Subspace Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is often possible to perform reduced order modelling by specifying linear subspace which accurately captures the dynamics of the system. This approach becomes especially appealing when linear subspace explicitly depends on parameters of the problem. A practical way to apply such a scheme is to compute subspaces for a selected set of parameters in the computationally demanding offline stage and in the online stage approximate subspace for unknown parameters by interpolation. For realistic problems the space of parameters is high dimensional, which renders classical interpolation strategies infeasible or unreliable. We propose to relax the interpolation problem to regression, introduce several loss functions suitable for subspace data, and use a neural network as an approximation to high-dimensional target function. To further simplify a learning problem we introduce redundancy: in place of predicting subspace of a given dimension we predict larger subspace. We show theoretically that this strategy decreases the complexity of the mapping for elliptic eigenproblems with constant coefficients and makes the mapping smoother for general smooth function on the Grassmann manifold. Empirical results also show that accuracy significantly improves when larger-than-needed subspaces are predicted. With the set of numerical illustrations we demonstrate that subspace regression can be useful for a range of tasks including parametric eigenproblems, deflation techniques, relaxation methods, optimal control and solution of parametric partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>New Insights and Algorithms for Optimal Diagonal Preconditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preconditioning (scaling) is essential in many areas of mathematics, and in particular in optimization. In this work, we study the problem of finding an optimal diagonal preconditioner. We focus on minimizing two different notions of condition number: the classical, worst-case type, $\kappa$-condition number, and the more averaging motivated $\omega$-condition number. We provide affine based pseudoconvex reformulations of both optimization problems. The advantage of our formulations is that the gradient of the objective is inexpensive to compute and the optimization variable is just an $n\times 1$ vector. We also provide elegant characterizations of the optimality conditions of both problems.
  We develop a competitive subgradient method, with convergence guarantees, for $\kappa$-optimal diagonal preconditioning that scales much better and is more efficient than existing SDP-based approaches. We also show that the preconditioners found by our subgradient method leads to better PCG performance for solving linear systems than other approaches. Finally, we show the interesting phenomenon that we can apply the $\omega$-optimal preconditioner to the exact $\kappa$-optimally diagonally preconditioned matrix $A$ and get consistent, significantly improved convergence results for PCG methods.</description>

      <title>Sketching Low-Rank Plus Diagonal Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many relevant machine learning and scientific computing tasks involve high-dimensional linear operators accessible only via costly matrix-vector products. In this context, recent advances in sketched methods have enabled the construction of *either* low-rank *or* diagonal approximations from few matrix-vector products. This provides great speedup and scalability, but approximation errors arise due to the assumed simpler structure. This work introduces SKETCHLORD, a method that simultaneously estimates both low-rank *and* diagonal components, targeting the broader class of Low-Rank *plus* Diagonal (LoRD) linear operators. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that this joint estimation is superior also to any sequential variant (diagonal-then-low-rank or low-rank-then-diagonal). Then, we cast SKETCHLORD as a convex optimization problem, leading to a scalable algorithm. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic (approximate) LoRD matrices confirm SKETCHLORD's performance in accurately recovering these structures. This positions it as a valuable addition to the structured approximation toolkit, particularly when high-fidelity approximations are desired for large-scale operators, such as the deep learning Hessian.</description>

      <title>Equation-Free Coarse Control of Distributed Parameter Systems via Local Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The control of high-dimensional distributed parameter systems (DPS) remains a challenge when explicit coarse-grained equations are unavailable. Classical equation-free (EF) approaches rely on fine-scale simulators treated as black-box timesteppers. However, repeated simulations for steady-state computation, linearization, and control design are often computationally prohibitive, or the microscopic timestepper may not even be available, leaving us with data as the only resource. We propose a data-driven alternative that uses local neural operators, trained on spatiotemporal microscopic/mesoscopic data, to obtain efficient short-time solution operators. These surrogates are employed within Krylov subspace methods to compute coarse steady and unsteady-states, while also providing Jacobian information in a matrix-free manner. Krylov-Arnoldi iterations then approximate the dominant eigenspectrum, yielding reduced models that capture the open-loop slow dynamics without explicit Jacobian assembly. Both discrete-time Linear Quadratic Regulator (dLQR) and pole-placement (PP) controllers are based on this reduced system and lifted back to the full nonlinear dynamics, thereby closing the feedback loop.</description>

      <title>Dimension-dependent bounds for the SDIEP via phase optimisation and Paley-type constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We refine the cycle-walk (Fourier) template of Gnacik and the author to quantify when a~$\delta$-Sule\u{\i}manova spectrum $(1,\lambda_2,\dots,\lambda_n)$ (with $\lambda_j\le 0$) is realised by a symmetric doubly stochastic matrix. For the canonical cycle basis we compute the \emph{exact} size-dependent threshold \[ \delta_n \;=\; 1-\frac{1}{2\cos^2\!\Big(\frac{\pi}{4n}\rho(n)\Big)}, \quad \rho(n)\in\{0,1,2,4\}\ \text{determined by } n\bmod 8, \] which improves $1/2$ if and only if $8\nmid n$; we also prove sharpness for that template. We then introduce an \emph{optimally phase-aligned} cycle basis which removes the `$8\mid n$' artefact and yields better sufficient bound \[ \delta_n^{\rm (ph)} \;=\; \begin{cases} \displaystyle 1-\dfrac{1}{2\cos^2(\pi/n)}, &amp; n\equiv 0\pmod{4},\\[2mm] \displaystyle 1-\dfrac{1}{2\cos^2(\pi/2n)}, &amp; n\equiv 2\pmod{4},\\[2mm] \displaystyle 1-\dfrac{1}{2\cos^2(\pi/4n)}, &amp; n\ \text{odd}, \end{cases} \] so that $\delta_n^{\rm (ph)}&lt;\tfrac12$ for \emph{every} $n\ge3$ and $\delta_n^{\rm (ph)}=\delta_n$ unless $8\mid n$. Next, on abelian $2$-groups, the Walsh--Hadamard basis has coherence $M=1$ and hence suffices for \emph{all} Sule\u{\i}manova lists ($\delta=0$); the same conclusion holds in every Hadamard order (\emph{e.g.}, Paley families).</description>

      <title>MDD-Thinker: Towards Large Reasoning Models for Major Depressive Disorder Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of global disability, yet current diagnostic approaches often rely on subjective assessments and lack the ability to integrate multimodal clinical information. Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for enhancing diagnostic accuracy through advanced reasoning but face challenges in interpretability, hallucination, and reliance on synthetic data.
  Methods We developed MDD-Thinker, an LLM-based diagnostic framework that integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning (RL) to strengthen reasoning ability and interpretability. Using the UK Biobank dataset, we generated 40,000 reasoning samples, supplemented with 10,000 samples from publicly available mental health datasets. The model was fine-tuned on these reasoning corpora, and its diagnostic and reasoning performance was evaluated against machine learning, deep learning, and state-of-the-art LLM baselines.
  Findings MDD-Thinker achieved an accuracy of 0.8268 and F1-score of 0.8081, significantly outperforming traditional baselines such as SVM and MLP, as well as general-purpose LLMs. Incorporating both SFT and RL yielded the greatest improvements, with relative gains of 29.0% in accuracy, 38.1% in F1-score, and 34.8% in AUC. Moreover, the model demonstrated comparable reasoning performance compared to much larger LLMs, while maintaining computational efficiency.
  Interpretation This study presents the first reasoning-enhanced LLM framework for MDD diagnosis trained on large-scale real-world clinical data. By integrating SFT and RL, MDD-Thinker balances accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency, offering a scalable approach for intelligent psychiatric diagnostics. These findings suggest that reasoning-oriented LLMs can provide clinically reliable support for MDD detection and may inform broader applications in mental health care.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of recovering a mixture of spike signals convolved with distinct point spread functions (PSFs) lying on a parametric manifold, under the assumption that the spike locations are known, is studied. The PSF unmixing problem is formulated as a projected non-linear least squares estimator. A lower bound on the radius of the region of strong convexity is established in the presence of noise as a function of the manifold coherence and Lipschitz properties, guaranteeing convergence and stability of the optimization program. Numerical experiments highlight the speed of decay of the PSF class in the problem's conditioning and confirm theoretical findings. Finally, the proposed estimator is deployed on real-world spectroscopic data from laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), removing the need for manual calibration and validating the method's practical relevance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe algorithms and data structures to extend a neural network library with automatic precision estimation for floating point computations. We also discuss conditions to make estimations exact and preserve high computation performance of neural networks training and inference. Numerical experiments show the consequences of significant precision loss for particular values such as inference, gradients and deviations from mathematically predicted behavior.
  It turns out that almost any neural network accumulates computational inaccuracies. As a result, its behavior does not coincide with predicted by the mathematical model of neural network. This shows that tracking of computational inaccuracies is important for reliability of inference, training and interpretability of results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models are a highly effective method for generating samples from a distribution of images. We consider scenarios where the training data comes from a noisy version of the target distribution, and present an efficiently implementable modification of the inference procedure to generate noiseless samples. Our approach is motivated by the manifold hypothesis, according to which meaningful data is concentrated around some low-dimensional manifold of a high-dimensional ambient space. The central idea is that noise manifests as low magnitude variation in off-manifold directions in contrast to the relevant variation of the desired distribution which is mostly confined to on-manifold directions. We introduce the notion of an extended score and show that, in a simplified setting, it can be used to reduce small variations to zero, while leaving large variations mostly unchanged. We describe how its approximation can be computed efficiently from an approximation to the standard score and demonstrate its efficacy on toy problems, synthetic data, and real data.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-preserving random batch Ewald method for constant-potential simulation of electrochemical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constant potential molecular dynamics simulation plays important role for applications of electrochemical systems, yet the calculation of charge fluctuation on electrodes remains a computational bottleneck. We propose a highly scalable, symmetry-preserving random batch Ewald (SRBE) algorithm to address this challenge. The SRBE algorithm deterministically computes the low-frequency components along the direction perpendicular to electrodes, while efficiently approximating the remaining components using random batch sampling. This approach simultaneously reduces charge and force fluctuations while satisfying the symmetry-preserving mean field condition in anisotropic systems with large aspect ratios. Numerical experiments on electrode/ionic liquid systems validate the high accuracy of the SRBE method in capturing dynamic charging processes and equilibrium electric double layer structures. The SRBE method achieves parallel efficiency improvements of up to two orders of magnitude compared with conventional FFT-based algorithms. These findings highlight its strong potential for enabling large-scale electrochemical simulations and its broad applicability to practical problems in the field.</description>

Abstract: We study spectral learning for orthogonally decomposable (odeco) tensors, emphasizing the interplay between statistical limits, optimization geometry, and initialization. Unlike matrices, recovery for odeco tensors does not hinge on eigengaps, yielding improved robustness under noise. While iterative methods such as tensor power iterations can be statistically efficient, initialization emerges as the main computational bottleneck. We investigate perturbation bounds, non-convex optimization analysis, and initialization strategies, clarifying when efficient algorithms attain statistical limits and when fundamental barriers remain.</description>

      <title>Impact of spatial coarsening on Parareal convergence for the linear advection equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.10228v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Parareal parallel-in-time integration method often performs poorly when applied to hyperbolic partial differential equations. This effect is even more pronounced when the coarse propagator uses a reduced spatial resolution. However, some combinations of spatial discretization and numerical time stepping nevertheless allow for Parareal to converge with monotonically decreasing errors. This raises the question how these configurations can be distinguished theoretically from those where the error initially increases, sometimes over many orders of magnitude. For linear problems, we prove a theorem that implies that the 2-norm of the Parareal iteration matrix is not a suitable tool to predict convergence for hyperbolic problems when spatial coarsening is used. We then show numerical results that suggest that the pseudo-spectral radius can reliably indicate if a given configuration of Parareal will show transient growth or monotonic convergence. For the studied examples, it also provides a good quantitative estimate of the convergence rate in the first few Parareal iterations.</description>

      <title>A $C^0$ finite element algorithm for the sixth order problem with simply supported boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a sixth order elliptic equation with the simply supported boundary conditions in a polygonal domain. We propose a new method that decouples the sixth order problem into a system of second order equations. Unlike the direct decomposition, which yields three Poisson problems but is restricted to polygonal domains with the largest interior angle no more than ${\pi}/{2}$, we rigorously analyze and construct extra Poisson problems to confine the solution into the same function space as that of the original sixth order problem. Consequently, the proposed method can be applied to general polygonal domains. In turn, we also present a $C^0$ finite element algorithm to discretize the new resulting system and establish optimal error estimates for the numerical solution on quasi-uniform meshes. Finally, numerical experiments are performed to validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Symmetric resonance based integrators and forest formulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16737v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work we introduce a unified framework that allows for the very first systematic construction of symmetric resonance-based integrators to approximate a wide class of nonlinear dispersive equations at low-regularity. The inclusion of symmetries in the construction of resonance-based schemes presents serious challenges and induces a need for a significant extension of prior approaches to allow for sufficient number of degrees of freedom in the resulting schemes while preserving the favorable low-regularity convergence properties of prior constructions. Motivated by recent work arXiv:2005.01649, we achieve this by introducing a novel formalism based on forest formulae that allows us to encode a wider range of possibilities of iterating Duhamel's formula and interpolatory approximations of lower order parts in the construction of these time-stepping methods. The forest formulae allow for a simple characterisation of symmetric schemes and provides a fascinating algebraic structure in its own right which echo those used in Quantum Field Theory for renormalising Feynman diagrams and those used for the renormalisation of singular SPDEs via the theory of Regularity Structures. Our constructions lead to the development of several new symmetric low regularity integrators that exhibit remarkable structure preservation and convergence properties which are witnessed in numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a refined Frozen Gaussian approximation (FGA) for the fractional Schr\"odinger equation in the semi-classical regime, where the solution exhibits rapid oscillations as the scaled Planck constant $\varepsilon$ becomes small. Our approach utilizes an integral representation based on asymptotic analysis, offering a highly efficient computational framework for high-frequency wave function evolution. Crucially, we introduce the momentum space representation of the FGA and a regularization parameter $\delta$ to address singularities in the higher-order derivatives of the Hamiltonian flow coefficients, which are typically assumed to be second-order differentiable or smooth in conventional analysis. We rigorously prove convergence of the method to the true solution and provide numerical experiments that demonstrate its precision and robust convergence behavior.</description>

      <title>Towards a fully well-balanced and entropy-stable scheme for the Euler equations with gravity: General equations of state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19710v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work concerns the derivation of a fully well-balanced Godunov-type finite volume scheme for the Euler equations with a gravitational potential based on an approximate Riemann solver in a one-dimensional framework. It is an extension to general equations of states of the entropy-stable and fully well-balanced scheme for ideal gases recently forwarded in [Berthon et al., 2025]. A second-order extension preserving the properties of the first-order scheme is given. The scheme is provably entropy-stable and positivity-preserving for all thermodynamic variables. Numerical test cases illustrate the performance and entropy stability of the new scheme, using six different equations of state as examples, four analytic and two tabulated ones.</description>

      <title>The Frequency Reduced-Basis method: Reduced order models for time-dependent problems using the Laplace transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a reduced basis method to solve time-dependent partial differential equations based on the Laplace transform. Unlike traditional approaches, we start by applying said transform to the evolution problem, yielding a time-independent boundary value problem that depends on the complex Laplace parameter. First, in an offline stage, we appropriately sample the Laplace parameter and solve the collection of problems using the finite element method. Next, we apply a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) to this collection of solutions in order to obtain a reduced basis that is of dimension much smaller than that of the original solution space. This reduced basis, in turn, is then used to solve the evolution problem using any suitable time-stepping method. A key insight to justify the formulation of the method resorts to Hardy spaces of analytic functions. By applying the widely-known Paley-Wiener theorem we can then define an isometry between the solution of the time-dependent problem and its Laplace transform. As a consequence of this result, one may conclude that computing a POD with samples taken in the Laplace domain produces an exponentially accurate reduced basis for the time-dependent problem. Numerical experiments characterizing the performance of the method, in terms of accuracy and speed-up, are included for a variety of relevant time-evolution equations.</description>

      <title>A categorical embedding discontinuity-capturing shallow neural network for anisotropic elliptic interface problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a categorical embedding discontinuity-capturing shallow neural network for anisotropic elliptic interface problems. The architecture comprises three hidden layers: a discontinuity-capturing layer, which maps domain segments to disconnected sets in a higher-dimensional space; a categorical embedding layer, which reduces the high-dimensional information into low-dimensional features; and a fully connected layer, which models the continuous mapping. This design enables a single neural network to approximate piecewise smooth functions with high accuracy, even when the number of discontinuous pieces ranges from tens to hundreds. By automatically learning discontinuity embeddings, the proposed categorical embedding technique avoids the need for explicit domain labeling, providing a scalable, efficient, and mesh-free framework for approximating piecewise continuous solutions. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply the proposed method to solve anisotropic elliptic interface problems, training by minimizing the mean squared error loss of the governing system. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, despite its shallow and simple structure, the proposed method achieves accuracy and efficiency comparable to traditional grid-based numerical methods.</description>

Abstract: We propose and analyze an HDG scheme for the Laplace-domain interaction between a transient acoustic wave and a bounded elastic solid embedded in an unbounded fluid medium. Two mixed variables (the stress tensor and the velocity of the acoustic wave) are included while the symmetry of the stress tensor is imposed weakly by considering the antisymmetric part of the strain tensor (the spin or vorticity tensor) as an additional unknown. Convergence of the method is demonstrated and theoretical rates are obtained; numerical results suggesting optimal order of convergence and superconvergence of the traces are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current work investigates the effectiveness of block triangular preconditioners in accelerating and stabilizing the numerical solution of inverse source problems governed by time-space fractional diffusion equations (TSFDEs). We focus on the recovery of an unknown spatial source function in a multi-dimensional TSFDE, incorporating Caputo time-fractional derivatives and the fractional Laplacian. The inherent ill-posedness is addressed via a quasi-boundary value regularization, followed by a finite difference discretization that leads to large, structured linear systems. We develop and analyze a block triangular preconditioning strategy that mimics the coefficient matrix, while simplifying its structure for computational efficiency. Numerical experiments using the GMRES solver demonstrate that the proposed preconditioner significantly improve convergence rates, robustness, and accuracy, making it well-suited for large-scale, real-world inverse problems involving fractional modeling.</description>

      <title>Tropical solution of discrete best approximation problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider discrete best approximation problems in the setting of tropical algebra that is concerned with the theory and application of algebraic systems with idempotent operations. Given a set of input-output pairs of an unknown function defined on a tropical semifield, the problem is to determine an approximating rational function formed by two Puiseux polynomials as numerator and denominator. With specified numbers of monomials in both polynomials, the approximation aims at evaluating the exponent and coefficient for each monomial in the polynomials to fit the rational function to the data in the sense of a tropical distance function. To solve the problem, we transform it into approximation of a vector equation with unknown vectors on both sides, where one side corresponds to the numerator polynomial and the other side to the denominator. Each side involves a matrix with entries dependent on the unknown exponents, multiplied by the vector of unknown coefficients of monomials. We propose an algorithm that constructs a series of approximate solutions by alternately fixing one side of the equation to an already found result and leaving the other intact. Each equation obtained is approximated with respect to the vector of coefficients, which yields this vector and approximation error both parameterized by the exponents. The exponents are found by minimizing the error with an optimization procedure based on an agglomerative clustering technique. To illustrate, we present results for an approximation problem in terms of max-plus algebra (a real semifield with addition defined as maximum and multiplication as arithmetic addition), which corresponds to an ordinary problem of piecewise linear approximation of real functions. As our numerical experience shows, the proposed algorithm converges in a finite number of steps and provides a reasonable accurate solution to the problems considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural network-based solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) have attracted considerable attention, yet they often face challenges in accuracy and computational efficiency. In this work, we focus on time-dependent PDEs and observe that coupling space and time in a single network can increase the difficulty of approximation. To address this, we propose a semi-discrete in time method (SDTM) which leverages classical numerical time integrators and random neural basis (RNB). Additional adaptive operations are introduced to enhance the network's ability to capture features across scales to ensure uniform approximation accuracy for multi-scale PDEs. Numerical experiments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and confirm the convergence of the temporal integrator as well as the network's approximation performance.</description>

Abstract: Many algorithms in scientific computing and data science take advantage of low-rank approximation of matrices and kernels, and understanding why nearly-low-rank structure occurs is essential for their analysis and further development. This paper provides a framework for bounding the best low-rank approximation error of matrices arising from samples of a kernel that is analytically continuable in one of its variables to an open region of the complex plane. Elegantly, the low-rank approximations used in the proof are computable by rational interpolation using the roots and poles of Zolotarev rational functions, leading to a fast algorithm for their construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15936v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new method that uses AAA approximation to reliably compute all the zeros of a holomorphic function in a specified search region in the complex plane. Specifically, the method is based on rational approximation of the logarithmic derivative in combination with subdivision of the search region based on Cauchy's argument principle. This is motivated by the fact that, while it is straightforward to compute the zeros of a AAA rational approximation, there is no guarantee that all of the zeros of the function being approximated will be found. Many of the ideas presented are also applicable to computing both the zeros and the poles of a meromorphic function. A implementation of the method is provided by the Python package skzeros.</description>

Abstract: This work extends the discrete compactness results of Walkington (SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 47(6):4680-4710, 2010) for high-order discontinuous Galerkin time discretizations of parabolic problems to more general function space settings. In particular, we show a discrete version of the Aubin-Lions-Simon lemma that holds for general Banach spaces $X$, $B$, and $Y$ satisfying $X \hookrightarrow B$ compactly and $B \hookrightarrow Y$ continuously. Our proofs rely on the properties of a time reconstruction operator and remove the need for quasi-uniform time partitions assumed in previous works.</description>

Abstract: We explore and analyze the use of multiprecision arithmetic for several classes of Schwarz methods and preconditioners, where the approximate solution of the local problems is performed at a lower precision, i.e., with fewer digits of accuracy than in the underlying (double precision) computation. Conditions for the appropriate round-off criteria for the lower precision are presented. It is found experimentally that for the model problems about 5 digits of accuracy are sufficient to achieve the theoretical restrictions, and thus, single precision suffices for the local solves. Several numerical experiments illustrate the obtained results.</description>

      <title>DeepONet for Solving Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations with Physics-Informed Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04344v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the applications of operator learning, specifically DeepONet, for solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Unlike conventional function learning methods that require training separate neural networks for each PDE, operator learning enables generalization across different PDEs without retraining. This study examines the performance of DeepONet in physics-informed training, focusing on two key aspects: (1) the approximation capabilities of deep branch and trunk networks, and (2) the generalization error in Sobolev norms. Our results show that complex branch networks provide substantial performance gains, while trunk networks are most effective when kept relatively simple. Furthermore, we derive a bound on the generalization error of DeepONet for solving nonlinear PDEs by analyzing the Rademacher complexity of its derivatives in terms of pseudo-dimension. This work bridges a critical theoretical gap by delivering rigorous error estimates. This paper fills a theoretical gap by providing error estimates for a wide range of physics-informed machine learning models and applications.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process Priors for Boundary Value Problems of Linear Partial Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Working with systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) is a fundamental task in computational science. Well-posed systems are addressed by numerical solvers or neural operators, whereas systems described by data are often addressed by PINNs or Gaussian processes. In this work, we propose Boundary Ehrenpreis--Palamodov Gaussian Processes (B-EPGPs), a novel probabilistic framework for constructing GP priors that satisfy both general systems of linear PDEs with constant coefficients and linear boundary conditions and can be conditioned on a finite data set. We explicitly construct GP priors for representative PDE systems with practical boundary conditions. Formal proofs of correctness are provided and empirical results demonstrating significant accuracy and computational resource improvements over state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Fast Krasnoselskii-Mann Method with Overrelaxation and Preconditioners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study accelerated Krasnoselskii-Mann-type methods with preconditioners in both continuous and discrete time. From a continuous-time model, we derive a generalized fast Krasnoselskii-Mann method, providing a new yet simple proof of convergence that leads to unprecedented flexibility in parameter tuning, allowing up to twice larger relaxation parameters. Our analysis unifies inertial and anchoring acceleration mechanisms and offers a broad range of parameter choices, which prove beneficial in practice. Additionally, we extend our analysis to the case where preconditioners are allowed to be degenerate, unifying the treatment of various splitting methods and establishing the weak convergence of shadow sequences.</description>

      <title>Min-Max Optimisation for Nonconvex-Nonconcave Functions Using a Random Zeroth-Order Extragradient Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores the performance of the random Gaussian smoothing Zeroth-Order ExtraGradient (ZO-EG) scheme considering \Af{deterministic} min-max optimisation problems with possibly NonConvex-NonConcave (NC-NC) objective functions. We consider both unconstrained and constrained, differentiable and non-differentiable settings. We discuss the min-max problem from the point of view of variational inequalities. For the unconstrained problem, we establish the convergence of the ZO-EG algorithm to the neighbourhood of an $\epsilon$-stationary point of the NC-NC objective function, whose radius can be controlled under a variance reduction scheme, along with its complexity. For the constrained problem, we introduce the new notion of proximal variational inequalities and give examples of functions satisfying this property. Moreover, we prove analogous results to the unconstrained case for the constrained problem. For the non-differentiable case, we prove the convergence of the ZO-EG algorithm to a neighbourhood of an $\epsilon$-stationary point of the smoothed version of the objective function, where the radius of the neighbourhood can be controlled, which can be related to the ($\delta,\epsilon$)-Goldstein stationary point of the original objective function.</description>

      <title>Localized Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are state-of-the-art tools for various generative tasks. Yet training these models involves estimating high-dimensional score functions, which in principle suffers from the curse of dimensionality. It is therefore important to understand how low-dimensional structure in the target distribution can be exploited in these models. Here we consider locality structure, which describes certain sparse conditional dependencies among the target random variables. Given some locality structure, the score function is effectively low-dimensional, so that it can be estimated by a localized neural network with significantly reduced sample complexity. This observation motivates the localized diffusion model, where a localized score matching loss is used to train the score function within a localized hypothesis space. We prove that such localization enables diffusion models to circumvent the curse of dimensionality, at the price of additional localization error. Under realistic sample size scaling, we then show both theoretically and numerically that a moderate localization radius can balance the statistical and localization errors, yielding better overall performance. Localized structure also facilitates parallel training, making localized diffusion models potentially more efficient for large-scale applications.</description>
