      <title>Star-Disk Collisions: Implications for QPEs and Other Transients Near Supermassive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Athena++ to study the hydrodynamics of repeated star-accretion disk collisions close to supermassive black holes, and discuss their implications for the origin of quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) and other repeating nuclear transients. We quantify the impact of the collisions on the stellar structure, the amount of stripped stellar debris, and the debris' orbital properties. We provide simple fitting functions for the stellar mass-loss per collision; the mass-loss is much larger after repeated collisions due to the dilute stellar atmosphere shock-heated in earlier collisions. The lifetime of the QPE-emitting phase set by stellar mass-loss in star-disk collision models for QPEs is thus at most ~100 years; it is shortest for eRO-QPE2, of order a few decades. The mass of the stripped stellar debris per collision and its orbital properties imply that currently observed QPEs are not powered by direct star-disk collisions but rather by collisions between the stellar debris liberated in previous collisions and the accretion disk (`circularization shocks'). We discuss how the hydrodynamics of this interaction can explain the diverse timing properties of QPEs including the regular timing of GSN 069 and eRO-QPE2 and the large flare-to-flare timing variations observed in eRO-QPE1. QPEs with recurrence times of many days, if observed, may have more regular timing.</description>

      <title>Echo Location: Distances to Galactic Supernovae From ASAS-SN Light Echoes and 3D Dust Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light echoes occur when light from a luminous transient is scattered by dust back into our line of sight with a time delay due to the extra propagation distance. We introduce a novel approach to estimating the distance to a source by combining light echoes with recent three-dimensional dust maps. We identify light echoes from the historical supernovae Cassiopeia A and Tycho's SN in nearly a decade of imaging from the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN). Using these light echoes, we find distances of $3.6\pm0.1$ kpc and $3.2^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$ kpc to Cas A and Tycho, respectively, which are generally consistent with previous estimates but are more precise. These distance uncertainties are primarily dominated by the low distance resolution of the 3D dust maps, which will likely improve in the future. The candidate single degenerate explosion donor stars B and G in Tycho are clearly foreground stars. Finally, the inferred reddening towards each SN agrees well with the intervening H I column density estimates from X-ray analyses of the remnants.</description>

      <title>Optical spectroscopy of 1A 0535+262 before, during, and after the 2020 giant X-ray outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the findings from our study of the Be/X-ray binary 1A 0535+262/HD 245770 during the giant X-ray outburst in October 2020. We utilized the 1.2-m telescope at Mount Abu Infrared observatory for optical observations of the Be companion star. The outburst reached a peak X-ray flux of approximately 11 Crab in the 15-50 keV range, marking the highest ever recorded X-ray outburst from the pulsar. We conducted optical observations in the 6000-7200 angstrom range before, during, and after the X-ray outburst, aiming to examine the evolution of the circumstellar disc of the Be star from February 2020 to February 2022. Our optical spectra displayed prominent emission lines at 6563 angstrom (H I), 6678 angstrom (He I), and 7065 angstrom (He I). Notably, the H$\alpha$ line exhibited significant variability in the spectra. Prior to and during the outburst, the line profiles appeared single-peaked, and asymmetric with broad red and blue wings, respectively. However, post-outburst observations revealed a double-peaked profile with asymmetry in the blue wing. Our pre-outburst observations confirmed a larger Be circumstellar disc that diminished in size as the outburst progressed. Additionally, the observed variations in the H$\alpha$ line profile and parameters indicate the presence of a highly misaligned, precessing, and warped Be disc.</description>

      <title>Radioactive Gamma-Ray Lines from Long-lived Neutron Star Merger Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of a kilonova AT2017gfo associated with the gravitational wave event GW170817 provides the first strong evidence that neutron star mergers are dominant contributors to the production of heavy $r$-process elements. Radioactive gamma-ray lines emitted from neutron star merger remnants provide a unique probe for investigating the nuclide composition and tracking its evolution. In this work, we studied the gamma-ray line features arising from the radioactive decay of heavy nuclei in the merger remnants based on the $r$-process nuclear reaction network and the astrophysical inputs derived from numerical relativity simulations. The decay chain of $^{126}_{50}$Sn ($T_{1/2}=230$ kyr) $\to$ $^{126}_{51}$Sb ($T_{1/2}=12.35$ days) $\to$ $^{126}_{52}$Te (stable) produces several bright gamma-ray lines with energies of $415$, $667$, and $695$ keV, making it the most promising decay chain during the remnant phase. The photon fluxes of these bright gamma-ray lines reach $\sim10^{-5}$ $\gamma$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ for Galactic merger remnants with ages less than $100$~kyr, which can be detected by the high energy resolution MeV gamma-ray detectors like the MASS mission.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamical simulations of wind interaction in spider systems : A step toward understanding transitional millisecond pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detected population of "spiders" has significantly grown in the past decade thanks to multiwavelength follow-up investigations of unidentified Fermi sources. These systems consist of low-mass stellar companions orbiting rotation-powered millisecond pulsars in short periods of a few hours up to day. Among them, a subset of intriguing objects called transitional millisecond pulsars (tMSPs) has been shown to exhibit a remarkable behavior, transitioning between pulsar-binary and faint low-mass X-ray binary states over a span of a few years. Our objective is to study the interaction of stellar winds in tMSPs in order to understand their observational properties. To this end we focus on the parameter range that places the system near Roche-lobe overflow. Employing the adaptative mesh refinement (AMR) AMRVAC 2.0 code, we performed 2D hydrodynamical (HD) simulations of the interaction between the flows from both stars, accounting for the effects of gravity and orbital motion. By studying the mass loss and launch speed of the winds, we successfully recreated two phenomenologically distinct regimes: the accretion stream and the radio pulsar state. We also identified the tipping point that marks the sharp transition between these two states. In the pulsar state, we reconstructed the corresponding X-ray light curves of the system that produces the characteristic double-peak pattern of these systems. The position of the peaks is shifted due to orbital motion and the leading peak is weaker due to eclipsing by the companion. We suggest that a smaller leading peak in X-rays is indicative of a nearly edge-on system. This study highlights the importance of gravity and orbital motion in the interaction between the companion and pulsar winds. Our setup allows the study of the complex interaction between the pulsar wind and an accretion stream during mass transfer.</description>

      <title>A physical model for radio and X-ray correlation in black hole X-ray binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A tight correlation between the radio and X-ray emission in the hard state of black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs) indicates an intrinsic disc-jet connection in stellar black hole accretion systems, though the detailed physics processes at work are still quite unclear. A hot accretion flow is suggested to match the outer cold thin disc at a certain radius in the hard state, which may vary with the accretion rate. In this work, we assume that the magnetic field generated in the outer thin disc is advected inwards by the inner hot accretion flow, which is substantially enhanced near the BH. Such a strong field threading the horizon of a spinning BH is responsible for launching relativistic jets in BHXRBs via the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. Thus, both the jet power and the X-ray emission increase with the mass accretion rate, and we find that our model calculations are able to reproduce the observed radio/X-ray correlation quantitatively. For some individual BHXRBs, the slopes of the radio/X-ray correlations become steeper when the sources are brighter. Our model calculations show that this feature is due to the transition of the outer disc with gas pressure dominated to radiation pressure dominated, which leads to different accretion rate dependence of the field strength in the outer disc.</description>

      <title>Polarization Patterns of Non-Circular Hotspots around Kerr Black Holes: A Preliminary Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-wavelength polarized light signals from supermassive black holes have sparked a range of studies on polarized images of accretion disks and hotspots. However, the polarization patterns within the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) region remain to be explored. In this study, we focus on two specific types of orbits, namely the plunging geodesics inward from the ISCO and homoclinic geodesics, to uncover the polarization features associated with non-circular motion in a Kerr spacetime. For an on-axis observer, we specifically develop an approximate function to describe gravitational lensing along the azimuthal direction, and establish a simplified synchrotron emission model. Based on these, we analyze the polarized patterns of hotspots accumulated over time and their Stokes parameters. Moreover, we explore the polarized image of the plunging region within a thin accretion disk.</description>

      <title>Fast radio bursts as precursor radio emission from monster shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been proposed recently that the breaking of MHD waves in the inner magnetosphere of strongly magnetized neutron stars can power different types of high-energy transients. Motivated by these considerations, we study the steepening and dissipation of a strongly magnetized fast magnetosonic wave propagating in a declining background magnetic field, by means of particle-in-cell simulations that encompass MHD scales. Our analysis confirms the formation of a monster shock as $B^2-E^2 \to 0$, that dissipates about half of the fast magnetosonic wave energy. It also reveals, for the first time, the generation of a high-frequency precursor wave by a synchrotron maser instability at the monster shock front, carrying a fraction of $\sim 10^{-3}$ of the total energy dissipated at the shock. The spectrum of the precursor wave exhibits several sharp harmonic peaks, with frequencies in the GHz band under conditions anticipated in magnetars. Such signals may appear as fast radio bursts.</description>

      <title>Profiling stellar environments of gravitational wave sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) have enabled direct detections of compact binary coalescences (CBCs). However, their poor sky localisation and the typical lack of observable electromagnetic (EM) counterparts make it difficult to confidently identify their hosts, and study the environments that nurture their evolution. In this work, we show that $\textit{detailed}$ information of the host environment (e.g. the mass and steepness of the host potential) can be directly inferred by measuring the kinematic parameters (acceleration and its time-derivatives) of the binary's center of mass using GWs alone, without requiring an EM counterpart. We consider CBCs in various realistic environments such as globular clusters, nuclear star clusters, and active galactic nuclei disks to demonstrate how orbit and environment parameters can be extracted for CBCs detectable by ground- and space-based observatories, including the LIGO detector at A+ sensitivity, Einstein Telescope of the XG network, LISA, and DECIGO, $\textit{on a single-event basis}$. These constraints on host stellar environments promise to shed light on our understanding of how CBCs form, evolve, and merge.</description>

      <title>Observational Clues to the Magnetic Evolution of Magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing four archival X-ray datasets taken with the Hard X-ray Detector onboard Suzaku, timing studies were performed on three magnetars, 1E 1841-045 (observed in 2006), SGR 0501+4516 (2008), and 1RXS J170849.0-400910 (2009 and 2010). Their pulsations were reconfirmed, typically in an energy range of 12-50 keV. The 11.783 s pulses of 1E 1841-045, and those of SGR 0501+4516 with 5.762 s were periodically phase modulated, with a long period of about 23.4 ks and about 16.4 ks, respectively. The pulse-phase modulation was also observed, at 46.5 ks, from two datasets of 1RXS J170849.0-400910. In all these cases, the modulation amplitude was 6 to 16 percent of the pulse cycle. Including previously confirmed four objects, this characteristic timing behavior is now detected from seven magnetars in total, and interpreted as a result of free precession of neutron stars that are deformed to an asphericity of ~10^{-4}. Assuming that the deformation is due to magnetic stress, these magnetars are inferred to harbor toroidal magnetic fields of Bt~10^{16} G. By comparing the estimated Bt of these objects with their poloidal dipole field Bd, the Bt/Bd ratio is found to increase with their characteristic age. Therefore, the toroidal fields of magnetars are likely to last longer than their dipole fields. This explains the presence of some classes of neutron stars that have relatively weak Bd but are suspected to hide strong Bt inside them.</description>

      <title>A New Perspective on the Diffuse Gamma-Ray Emission Excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Large High-Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) recently published measurements of diffuse Galactic gamma-ray emission (DGE) in the 10-1000 TeV energy range. The measured DGE flux is significantly higher than the expectation from hadronic interactions between cosmic rays (CRs) and the interstellar medium. This excess has been proposed to originate from unknown extended sources produced by electron radiation, such as pulsar wind nebulae or pulsar halos (PWNe/halos). In this study, we propose a new perspective to explain the DGE excess observed by LHAASO. The masking regions used in the LHAASO DGE measurement may not fully encompass the extended signals of PWNe/halos. By employing a two-zone diffusion model for electrons around pulsars, we find that the DGE excess in most regions of the Galactic plane can be well explained by the signal leakage model under certain parameters. Our results indicate that the signal leakage from known sources and contributions from unresolved sources should be considered complementary in explaining the DGE excess.</description>

      <title>Evolution of current and pressure driven instabilities in relativistic jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instabilities in relativistic magnetized jets are thought to be deeply connected to their energy dissipation properties and to the consequent acceleration of the non-thermal emitting relativistic particles. Instabilities lead to the development of small scale dissipative structures, in which magnetic energy is converted in other forms. In this paper we present three-dimensional numerical simulations of the instability evolution in highly magnetized plasma columns, considering different kinds of equilibria. In fact, the hoop stresses related to the azimuthal component of magnetic field can be balanced either by the magnetic pressure gradient (force-free equilibria, FF) or by the thermal pressure gradient (pressure-balanced equilibria, PB) or by a combination of the two. FF equilibria are prone to current-driven instabilities (CDI), while PB equilibria are prone to pressure-driven instabilities (PDI). We perform a global linear stability analysis, from which we derive the different instability properties in the two regimes, showing that PDI have larger growth rates and are also unstable for high wavenumbers. The numerical simulations of the non-linear instability evolution show similar phases of evolution in which the formation of strong current sheets is followed by a turbulent quasi steady-state. PDI are however characterized by a faster evolution, by the formation of smaller scale dissipative structures and larger magnetic energy dissipation.</description>

      <title>Study of consecutive eclipses of pulsar J0024$-$7204O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eclipses seen in the radio emission of some pulsars can be invaluable to study the properties of the material from the companion stripped away by the pulsar. We present a study of six consecutive eclipses of PSR J0024-7204O in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae as seen by the MeerKAT radio telescope in the UHF (544-1088 MHz) band. A high scintillation state boosted the signal during one of the orbits and allowed a detailed study of the eclipse properties. We measure significant dispersion measure (DM) variations and detect strong scattering that seems to be the dominating mechanism of the eclipses at these frequencies. A complete drop in the linear polarization together with a small increase in the rotation measure suggests the presence of a magnetic field of $\sim 2$ mG. The study of multiple eclipses allowed us to measure difference in the lengths of the eclipses and DM differences of $\sim 0.01$ pc cm$^{-3}$ in consecutive orbits. One orbit in particular shows a delay in recovery of the linear polarization and a visible delay in the arrival of the pulses caused by a stronger scattering event. We suggest that these are caused by a higher variance of density fluctuations during the event.</description>

      <title>Spectro-temporal investigation of the black hole X-ray transient 4U 1543-475 during the 2021 outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a detailed spectro-temporal analysis of the black hole (BH) low mass X-ray binary (LMXB) 4U 1543-475 during its 2021 outburst using the data from LAXPC (Large Area X-ray Proportional Counters) and SXT (Soft X-ray Telescope) instrument on board AstroSat. We investigate the energy and frequency dependency of the source variability to probe the origin of the disc/coronal fluctuations. Following the state transition (from soft to intermediate state), the emergence of a band-limited noise (BLN) component is observed along with the power law noise (PLN) when the disk is recovering from a sudden decrease in the inner disk radius. A possible correlation between the low-frequency variability amplitude (RMS) and the covering fraction of the non-thermal component is detected. During the final AstroSat observation, a flip-flop phenomenon is reported, where rapid variation in RMS occurs in concurrence with sudden flux transition. An indication of the evolution of inner disk temperature along with a significant change in thermal flux was observed during the flip-flop phase, arguing for a disk instability-driven origin for this phenomenon. Our results suggest that the long-term variability evolution is primarily affected by the coronal changes, whereas the disk behavior governs the short-term variability evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The applicability of first-order Fermi acceleration in explaining the cosmic ray spectrum has been reexamined using recent results on shock acceleration mechanisms from the Multiscale Magnetospheric mission in Earth's bow shock. It is demonstrated that the Fermi mechanism is a crude approximation of the ballistic surfing acceleration (BSA) mechanism. While both mechanisms yield similar expressions for the energy gain of a particle after encountering a shock once, leading to similar power-law distributions of the cosmic ray energy spectrum, the Fermi mechanism is found to be inconsistent with fundamental equations of electrodynamics.
  It is shown that the spectral index of cosmic rays is determined by the average magnetic field compression rather than the density compression, as in the Fermi model. It is shown that the knee observed in the spectrum at an energy of 5x10^{15} eV could correspond to ions with a gyroradius comparable to the size of shocks in supernova remnants. The BSA mechanism can accurately reproduce the observed spectral index s = -2.5 below the knee energy, as well as a steeper spectrum, s = -3, above the knee. The acceleration time up to the knee, as implied by BSA, is on the order of 300 years.
  First-order Fermi acceleration does not represent a physically valid mechanism and should be replaced by ballistic surfing acceleration in applications or models related to quasi-perpendicular shocks in space. It is noted that BSA, which operates outside of shocks, was previously misattributed to shock drift acceleration (SDA), which operates within shocks.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Multifaceted GRB 200613A: Prompt Emission Dynamics, Afterglow Evolution, and the Host Galaxy's Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present our optical observations and multi-wavelength analysis of the GRB\,200613A detected by \texttt{Fermi} satellite. Time-resolved spectral analysis of the prompt $\gamma$-ray emission was conducted utilizing the Bayesian block method to determine statistically optimal time bins. Based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), the data generally favor the Band+Blackbody (short as BB) model. We speculate that the main Band component comes from the Blandford-Znajek mechanism, while the additional BB component comes from the neutrino annihilation process. The BB component becomes significant for a low-spin, high-accretion rate black hole central engine, as evidenced by our model comparison with the data. The afterglow light curve exhibits typical power-law decay, and its behavior can be explained by the collision between the ejecta and constant interstellar medium (ISM). Model fitting yields the following parameters: $E_{K,iso} = (2.04^{+11.8}_{-1.50})\times 10^{53}$ erg, $\Gamma_0=354^{+578}_{-217}$, $p=2.09^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$, $n_{18}=(2.04^{+9.71}_{-1.87})\times 10^{2}$ cm$^{-3}$, $\theta_j=24.0^{+6.50}_{-5.54}$ degree, $\epsilon_e=1.66^{+4.09}_{-1.39})\times 10^{-1}$ and $\epsilon_B=(7.76^{+48.5}_{-5.9})\times 10^{-6}$. In addition, we employed the public Python package \texttt{Prospector} perform a spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling of the host galaxy. The results suggest that the host galaxy is a massive galaxy ($\log(M_\ast / M_\odot)=11.75^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$) with moderate star formation rate ($\mbox{SFR}=22.58^{+13.63}_{-7.22} M_{\odot}$/yr). This SFR is consistent with the SFR of $\sim 34.2 M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ derived from the [OII] emission line in the observed spectrum.</description>

      <title>A kiloparsec-scale ordered magnetic field in a galaxy at z=5.6</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields are prevalent on almost all astronomical scales, but their importance in different systems and over cosmic time is yet to be understood. Our current knowledge on the evolution of magnetic fields is limited by scarce observations in the distant Universe, where galaxies have recently been found to be more evolved than most of our model predictions. In this study, we conduct rest-frame 131 $\mu$m full-polarisation ALMA observations of dust emission in a strongly lensed dusty star-forming galaxy, SPT0346-52, at z=5.6, when the Universe was only 1 Gyr old. Dust grains can become aligned with local magnetic fields, resulting in the emission of linearly polarised thermal infrared radiation. Our observations have revealed a median polarisation level of 0.9$\pm$0.2 per cent with a variation of $\pm$0.4 per cent across the regions with polarisation detection, similar to that of local starburst galaxies. The polarised dust emission is patchy. It mostly overlaps with the [C II] emission at a velocity of about -150 km/s, and extends over 3 kiloparsecs with a bimodal distribution in position angles. Our analysis indicates that the kpc-scale polarised dust is most likely aligned by the large-scale magnetic fields associated with a galaxy merger. If the ordered fields are confirmed to be coherent, such early detection of large-scale magnetic fields favours an efficient formation of magnetic fields in primordial galaxies, which highlights the importance of magnetic fields in mediating galaxy evolution over long cosmic timescales. Future surveys towards a wider galaxy population are necessary to test the ubiquitousness of large-scale magnetic fields in early galaxies.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Duet by Resonating Binary Black Holes with Axion-Like Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We leverage gravitational wave observations to explore physics beyond the Standard Model, focusing on axion-like particles (ALPs). This study investigates the resonant effects of ALPs with binary black hole systems, where their oscillatory nature induces time-dependent forces on the black holes. By employing a detailed Fisher matrix analysis, we not only probe a new parameter space for ALPs, characterized by their mass and decay constants, but also assess how these parameters affect gravitational waveforms during black hole mergers. Our approach is distinct as it does not assume interactions of ALPs with photons or nucleons. We demonstrate that as binary black holes spiral inward and lose energy, their orbital frequencies may resonate with those of ALPs, producing distinct oscillatory patterns in gravitational waves detectable by upcoming experiments such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). This work broadens the potential of gravitational wave astronomy as a tool for dark matter searches, offering a promising avenue for studying elusive components of the universe.</description>

      <title>Observational and theoretical aspects of Superspinars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article delves into the observational signatures and theoretical underpinnings of rotating astrophysical objects, with a particular focus on superspinars -exotic objects characterized by preventing the formation of event horizons due to their high angular momentum.
  While solutions within General Relativity (Kerr superspinars) predict such objects, their classical forms harbor naked singularities, violate causality, and exhibit problematic repulsive gravitational effects. These characteristics render classical superspinars theoretically objectionable, leading to the consideration of them as physically implausible. On the other hand, the incompatibility between General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics suggests the exploration of alternative models, particularly those in which Quantum Gravity dominates the core, yielding regular superspinars.
  This work demonstrates that regular superspinars avoid all the complications associated with Kerr superspinars. From a phenomenological standpoint, it is shown that the silhouettes of regular superspinars are markedly distinct from those of black holes and classical Kerr superspinars. To substantiate these differences, we perform a comprehensive analysis of inner null geodesics and investigate the structure of the Planckian region within regular superspinars. Our study reveals that only regular superspinars provide the potential for distant observers to directly observe the extremely high curvature regions within their interiors.</description>

      <title>Energy extraction through Comisso-Asenjo process from a Kerr-Newman black hole in perfect fluid dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a thorough analysis of energy extraction via magnetic reconnection, a novel mechanism recently proposed by Comisso and Asenjo, for a Kerr-Newman black hole immersed in a perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) background. Our studies focus on the impact of black hole spin $a$, electric charge $Q$ and PFDM parameter $\lambda$ on the horizons, ecoregions and circular geodesics at the equatorial plane of this black hole, and how they further influence the reconnection efficiency and energy extraction rate. Our results show that the size of ergoregion does not vary monotonically with increasing dark matter parameters $\lambda$, but it can significantly increase at faster spins ($a&gt;0.8$) as the dark matter parameter $\lambda$ decreases, given the electric charge stays within $Q\in [0.2,0.5]$. We identify the optimal conditions for the combination of $a$, $Q$ and $\lambda$ that enable efficient energy extraction even when the black hole is not rapidly spinning. The Kerr-Newman black hole in PFDM allows for achieving high energy extraction rates comparable to those of most previously studied rotating black holes, which typically require near-extremal spin to reach similar efficiency levels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure of the dense-matter equation of state is essential for the phenomenology of neutron stars. In this work, we relate the thermodynamic properties to the average speed of sound in the interior of a star. We study the consequences of the restoration of conformal symmetry. In particular, we show that if the trace anomaly vanishes in the centers of maximally massive neutron stars, the speed of sound likely exceeds its conformal value and exhibits nonmonotonic behavior. We also find that the additional assumption of positive definiteness of the trace anomaly naturally induces a local peak of the speed of sound at densities realized in the cores of neutron stars. We also discuss the stability condition for the hybrid neutron stars Possible implications for the dense matter equation of state and the phenomenology of neutron stars are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Shell mergers in the late stages of massive star evolution: new insight from 3D hydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One-dimensional (1D) stellar evolution models are widely used across various astrophysical fields, however they are still dominated by important uncertainties that deeply affect their predictive power. Among those, the merging of independent convective regions is a poorly understood phenomenon predicted by some 1D models but whose occurrence and impact in real stars remain very uncertain. Being an intrinsically multi-D phenomenon, it is challenging to predict the exact behaviour of shell mergers with 1D models. In this work, we conduct a detailed investigation of a multiple shell merging event in a 20 M$_\odot$ star using 3D hydrodynamic simulations. Making use of the active tracers for composition and the nuclear network included in the 3D model, we study the merging not only from a dynamical standpoint but also considering its nucleosynthesis and energy generation. Our simulations confirm the occurrence of the merging also in 3D, but reveal significant differences from the 1D case. Specifically, we identify entrainment and the erosion of stable regions as the main mechanisms that drive the merging, we predict much faster convective velocities compared to the mixing-length-theory velocities, and observe multiple burning phases within the same merged shell, with important effects for the chemical composition of the star, which presents a strongly asymmetric (dipolar) distribution. We expect that these differences will have important effects on the final structure of massive stars and thus their final collapse dynamics and possible supernova explosion, subsequently affecting the resulting nucleosynthesis and remnant.</description>

      <title>Best of both worlds: Fusing hyperspectral data from two generations of spectro-imagers for X-ray astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the launch of the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) and the advent of microcalorimeter detectors, X-ray astrophysics is entering in a new era of spatially resolved high resolution spectroscopy. But while this new generation of X-ray telescopes have much finer spectral resolutions than their predecessors (e.g. XMM-Newton, Chandra), they also have coarser spatial resolutions, leading to problematic cross-pixel contamination. This issue is currently a critical limitation for the study of extended sources such as galaxy clusters of supernova remnants. To increase the scientific output of XRISM's hyperspectral data, we propose to fuse it with XMM-Newton data, and seek to obtain a cube with the best spatial and spectral resolution of both generations. This is the aim of hyperspectral fusion. In this article, we have implemented an algorithm that jointly deconvolves the spatial response of XRISM and the spectral response of XMM-Newton. To do so, we construct a forward model adapted for instrumental systematic degradations and Poisson noise, then tackle hyperspectral fusion as a regularized inverse problem. We test three methods of regularization: low rank approximation with Sobolev regularization; low rank approximation with 2D wavelet sparsity ; and 2D-1D wavelet sparsity. We test our method on toy models constructed from hydrodynamic simulations of supernova remnants. We find that our method reconstructs the ground truth well even when the toy model is complex. For the regularization term, we find that while the low rank approximation worked well as a spectral denoiser in models with less spectral variability, it introduced a bias in models with more spectral variability, in which case the 2D-1D wavelet sparsity regularization worked best. After demonstrating a proof of concept in this article, we aim to apply this method to real X-ray astrophysical data in the near future.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present an inference method for determining neutron star parameters and constraining the nuclear equation of state (EOS) using the RIFT parameter inference engine. We incorporate externally-produced prior information about the EOS to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the inference process. We apply this method to the GW170817 event and assess its performance. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating prior EOS information in the inference process, leading to sharper conclusions and more rapid inference on new detections. This approach has the potential to enhance our understanding of neutron stars and the nuclear EOS in future gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Early-Time Observations of SN 2023wrk: A Luminous Type Ia Supernova with Significant Unburned Carbon in the Outer Ejecta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of the nearby Type Ia supernova (SN) 2023wrk at a distance of about 40 Mpc. The earliest detection of this SN can be traced back to a few hours after the explosion. Within the first few days the light curve shows a bump feature, while the B - V color is blue and remains nearly constant. The overall spectral evolution is similar to that of an SN 1991T/SN 1999aa-like SN Ia, while the C II $\lambda6580$ absorption line appears to be unusually strong in the first spectrum taken at $t \approx -$15.4 days after the maximum light. This carbon feature disappears quickly in subsequent evolution but it reappears at around the time of peak brightness. The complex evolution of the carbon line and the possible detection of Ni III absorption around 4700 {\AA} and 5300 {\AA} in the earliest spectra indicate macroscopic mixing of fuel and ash. The strong carbon lines is likely related to collision of SN ejecta with unbound carbon, consistent with the predictions of pulsational delayed-detonation or carbon-rich circumstellar-matter interaction models. Among those carbon-rich SNe Ia with strong C II $\lambda6580$ absorption at very early times, the line-strength ratio of C II to Si II and the B-V color evolution are found to exhibit large diversity, which may be attributed to different properties of unbound carbon and outward-mixing $^{56}$Ni.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray flux limits from brown dwarfs: Implications for dark matter annihilating into long-lived mediators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.08067v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs (BDs) are celestial objects representing the link between the least massive main-sequence stars and giant gas planets. In the first part of this article, we perform a model-independent search of a gamma-ray signal from the direction of nine nearby BDs in 13 years of \Fermi-LAT data. We find no significant excess of gamma rays, and we, therefore, set 95\% confidence level upper limits on the gamma-ray flux with a binned-likelihood approach. In the second part of the paper, we interpret these bounds within an exotic mechanism proposed for gamma-ray production in BDs: If the dark matter (DM) of the universe is constituted of particles with non-negligible couplings to the standard model, BDs may efficiently accumulate them through scatterings. DM particles eventually thermalise, and can annihilate into light, long-lived, mediators which later decay into photons outside the BD. Within this framework, the current Fermi-LAT stacked upper limits on the gamma-ray flux of the selected BDs do not enable setting a bound on the DM-nucleon cross-section. An improvement of approximately a factor of 9 in the gamma-ray limits is required to obtain bounds on the scattering cross-section $\sigma_{\chi n}$ $\sim 10^{-36}$ cm$^{2}$ for DM masses below 10 GeV. This improvement would cover a larger portion of the parameter space in mediator decay length and DM mass. The code and data to reproduce the results of this study are available on GitLab at \github{https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/francesca.calore/brown-dwarfs-gamma}.</description>

      <title>The High resolution Fe K Spectrum of Cygnus X-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.04165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze features of the Fe K spectrum of the high-mass X-ray binary Cygnus X-3. The spectrum was obtained with the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer in the third diffraction order. The increased energy resolution of the third order enables us to fully resolve the Fe XXV He{\alpha} complex and the Fe XXVI Ly{\alpha} lines. The emission-line spectrum shows the expected features of photoionization equilibrium, excited in the dense stellar wind of the companion star. We detect discrete emission from inner-shell transitions, in addition to absorption likely due to multiple unresolved transitions in lower ionization states. The emission-line intensity ratios observed in the range of the spectrum occupied by the Fe XXV n = 1-2 forbidden and intercombination lines suggest that there is a substantial contribution from resonantly scattered inner-shell emission from the Li- and Be-like ionization states. The Fe XXV forbidden and intercombination lines arise in the ionization zone closest to the compact object, and since they are not subject to radiative-transfer effects, we can use them in principle to constrain the radial velocity amplitude of the compact object. We infer that the results indicate a compact object mass of the order of the mass of the Wolf-Rayet companion star, but we note that the presence of resonantly scattered radiation from Li-like ions may complicate the interpretation of the He-like emission spectrum, and specifically of the radial velocity curve of the Fe XXV forbidden line.</description>

      <title>Limits on Neutrino Emission from GRB 221009A from MeV to PeV using the IceCube Neutrino Observatory</title>

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have long been considered a possible source of high-energy neutrinos. While no correlations have yet been detected between high-energy neutrinos and GRBs, the recent observation of GRB 221009A - the brightest GRB observed by Fermi-GBM to date and the first one to be observed above an energy of 10 TeV - provides a unique opportunity to test for hadronic emission. In this paper, we leverage the wide energy range of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory to search for neutrinos from GRB 221009A. We find no significant deviation from background expectation across event samples ranging from MeV to PeV energies, placing stringent upper limits on the neutrino emission from this source.</description>

      <title>IceCube search for neutrinos from GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16354v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GRB 221009A is the brightest Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) ever observed. The observed extremely high flux of high and very-high-energy photons provide a unique opportunity to probe the predicted neutrino counterpart to the electromagnetic emission. We have used a variety of methods to search for neutrinos in coincidence with the GRB over several time windows during the precursor, prompt and afterglow phases of the GRB. MeV scale neutrinos are studied using photo-multiplier rate scalers which are normally used to search for galactic core-collapse supernovae neutrinos. GeV neutrinos are searched starting with DeepCore triggers. These events don't have directional localization, but instead can indicate an excess in the rate of events. 10 GeV - 1 TeV and &gt;TeV neutrinos are searched using traditional neutrino point source methods which take into account the direction and time of events with DeepCore and the entire IceCube detector respectively. The &gt;TeV results include both a fast-response analysis conducted by IceCube in real-time with time windows of T$_0 - 1$ to T$_0 + 2$ hours and T$_0 \pm 1$ day around the time of GRB 221009A, as well as an offline analysis with 3 new time windows up to a time window of T$_0 - 1$ to T$_0 + 14$ days, the longest time period we consider. The combination of observations by IceCube covers 9 orders of magnitude in neutrino energy, from MeV to PeV, placing upper limits across the range for predicted neutrino emission.</description>

      <title>A Radio Flare in the Long-Lived Afterglow of the Distant Short GRB 210726A: Energy Injection or a Reverse Shock from Shell Collisions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the discovery of the radio afterglow of the short $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) 210726A, localized to a galaxy at a photometric redshift of $z\sim 2.4$. While radio observations commenced $\lesssim 1~$day after the burst, no radio emission was detected until $\sim11~$days. The radio afterglow subsequently brightened by a factor of $\sim 3$ in the span of a week, followed by a rapid decay (a "radio flare"). We find that a forward shock afterglow model cannot self-consistently describe the multi-wavelength X-ray and radio data, and underpredicts the flux of the radio flare by a factor of $\approx 5$. We find that the addition of substantial energy injection, which increases the isotropic kinetic energy of the burst by a factor of $\approx 4$, or a reverse shock from a shell collision are viable solutions to match the broad-band behavior. At $z\sim 2.4$, GRB 210726A is among the highest redshift short GRBs discovered to date as well as the most luminous in radio and X-rays. Combining and comparing all previous radio afterglow observations of short GRBs, we find that the majority of published radio searches conclude by $\lesssim 10~$days after the burst, potentially missing these late rising, luminous radio afterglows.</description>

      <title>Apparently ultra-long period radio sources from self-lensed pulsar-black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12494v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsar-black hole (BH) close binary systems, which have not been found yet, are unique laboratories for testing theories of gravity and understanding the formation channels of gravitational-wave sources. We study the self-gravitational lensing effect in a pulsar-BH system on the pulsar's emission. Because this effect occurs once per orbital period for almost edge-on binaries, we find that it could generate apparently ultra-long period (minutes to hours) radio signals when the intrinsic pulsar signal is too weak to detect. Each of such lensed signals, or 'pulse', is composed of a number of amplified intrinsic pulsar pulses. We estimate that a radio telescope with a sensitivity of $10\,\rm mJy$ could detect $\sim$ a few systems that emit such signals in our galaxy. The model is applied to three recently found puzzling long-period radio sources: GLEAM-X J1627, PSR J0901-4046, and GPM J1839-10. To explain their observed signal durations and periods, the masses of their lensing components would be $\sim10^4\,\rm M_{\odot}$, $\sim4\,\rm M_{\odot}$ and $10^{3-6}\,\rm M_{\odot}$, respectively, with their binary coalescence times ranging from a few tens to thousands of years. However, the implied merger rates (as high as $\sim 10^{3-4}\,\rm Myr^{-1}$ per galaxy) and the large period decay rates ($&gt;10^{-8}\,\rm s\,s^{-1}$) tend to disfavour this self-lensing scenario for these three sources. Finally, for a binary containing a millisecond pulsar and a stellar-mass BH, the Shapiro delay effect would cause a $\geq10\%$ variation of the profile width for the sub-pulses in such lensed signals.</description>

      <title>Strong Bow Shocks: Turbulence and An Exact Self-Similar Asymptotic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18080v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that strong bow shocks are turbulent and non-universal near the head, but asymptote to a universal steady, self-similar, and analytically solvable flow in the downstream. The turbulence is essentially 3D, and has been confirmed by a 3D simulation. The asymptotic behavior is confirmed with high resolution 2D and 3D simulations of a cold uniform wind encountering both a solid spherical obstacle and stellar wind. This solution is relevant in the context of: (i) probing the kinematic properties of observed high-velocity compact bodies -- e.g., runaway stars and/or supernova ejecta blobs -- flying through the interstellar medium; and (ii) constraining stellar bow shock luminosities invoked by some quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) models.</description>

      <title>Revisiting thermoelectric effects in the crust of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Large thermal variations have been observed in neutron stars that typically are not aligned with density gradients. Such terms may activate the Biermann battery effect, leading to thermoelectric interactions and to the generation of electromotive force. Aims. We aim to identify the possible impact of a temperature anisotropy on the crust of a neutron star can have in the evolution of its magnetic field, through the thermoelectric terms. Methods. We consider a neutron star crust with large temperature gradients, associated with long-lived hot spots, described by a localized Gaussian-type function. We simulate the interplay between the battery term and the Hall and Ohmic evolution numerically for axisymmetric systems. Results. The results indicate that for crust temperatures of $\sim$$10^9$ K the toroidal field can be amplified up to $\sim$$10^{14}-10^{15}$ G near the points of maximum temperature gradients, and it locally changes the architecture of the poloidal field lines. For internal crustal temperatures of $\sim$$10^8$ K, the temperature gradient generates fields that are lower by about two orders of magnitude. In these cases, saturation is achieved after some hundred thousand years, after which the battery and Ohmic dissipation balance each other, whereas the Hall drift contributes comparatively little to the final field strength, but it can affect its structure. Conclusions. We conclude that the thermoelectric effect can impact the overall magnetic field evolution, provided that the thermal gradient is maintained for a sufficiently long time. Neutron stars endowned with moderate-strength magnetic fields may be affected by the thermoelectric effect if the hotspots survive for timescales of a few kiloyears.</description>

      <title>Detecting superfluid transition in the pulsar core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is believed that the core of a neutron star can be host to various novel phases of matter, from nucleon superfluid phase to exotic high baryon density quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phases. Different observational signals for such phase transitions have been discussed in the literature. Here, we point out a unique phenomenon associated with phase transition to a superfluid phase, which may be the nucleon superfluid phase or a phase like the CFL phase, allowing for superfluid vortices. In any superfluid phase transition, a random network of vortices forms via the so-called Kibble-Zurek mechanism, which eventually mostly decays away, finally leaving primarily vortices arising from the initial angular momentum of the core. This transient, random vortex network can have a non-zero net angular momentum for the superfluid component, which will generally be oriented in an arbitrary direction. This is in contrast to the final vortices, which arise from initial rotation and hence have the initial angular momentum of the neutron star. The angular momentum of the random vortex network is balanced by an equal and opposite angular momentum in the normal fluid due to the conservation of angular momentum, thereby imparting an arbitrarily oriented angular momentum component to the outer shell of the neutron star. This will affect the pulse timing and pulse profile of a pulsar. These changes in the pulses will decay away in a characteristic manner such that the random vortex network decays, obeying specific scaling laws leading to universal features for the detection of superfluid transitions occurring in a pulsar core.</description>

      <title>Upper Limit of Sound Speed in Nuclear Matter: A Harmonious Interplay of Transport Calculation and Perturbative QCD Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Very recently, it has been shown that there is an upper bound on the squared sound speed of nuclear matter from the transport, which reads $c_{\rm s}^2 \leq 0.781$. In this work, we demonstrate that this upper bound is corroborated by the reconstructed equation of state (EOS; modeled with a nonparametric method) for ultra-dense matter. The reconstruction integrates multi-messenger observation for neutron stars (NSs), in particular, the latest radius measurements for PSR J0437-4715 ($11.36^{+0.95}_{-0.63}$ km), PSR J0030+0451 ($11.71^{+0.88}_{-0.83}$ km, in the ST+PDT model), and PSR J0740+6620 ($12.49^{+1.28}_{-0.88}$ km) by NICER have been adopted. The result shows in all cases, the $c_{\rm s}^2 \leq 0.781$ upper limit for EOS will naturally yield the properties of matter near center of the massive neutron star consistent with the causality-driven constraint from pQCD, where in practice, the constraint is applied at ten nuclear saturation density ($n_{\rm L}=10n_{\rm s}$). We also note that there is a strong correlation for the maximum $c_s^2$ with $n_{\rm L}$, and $c_{\rm s}^2 \leq 0.781$ is somehow violated when $n_{\rm L} = n_{\rm c,TOV}$. The result indicates that a higher density in implementing the pQCD constraint, even considering the uncertainties from statistics, is more natural. Moreover, the remarkable agreement between the outcomes derived from these two distinct and independent constraints (i.e., the transport calculation and pQCD boundary) lends strong support to their validity. Besides, the latest joint constraint for $R_{1.4}$, $R_{2.0}$, $R_{1.4}-R_{2.0}$, and $M_{\rm TOV}$ are $11.94_{-0.68}^{+0.77}$ km, $11.99_{-0.67}^{+0.88}$ km, $-0.1_{-0.27}^{+0.42}$ km, and $2.24_{-0.10}^{+0.13}M_\odot$ (at $90\%$ credible level), respectively.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength Modeling for the Shallow Decay Phase of Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We simulate the emission in the shallow decay phase of gamma-ray burst afterglows using a time-dependent code. We test four models: the energy injection model, evolving the injection efficiency of non-thermal electrons, evolving the amplification of the magnetic field, and the wind model with a relatively low bulk Lorentz factor. All of the four models can reproduce the typical X-ray afterglow lightcurve. The spectral shape depends on not only the parameter values at the time corresponding to the observer time but also the past evolution of the parameters. The model differences appear in the evolution of the broadband spectrum, especially in the inverse Compton component. Future gamma-ray observations with imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes such as CTA will reveal the mechanism of the shallow decay phase.</description>

      <title>Low Mass Naked Singularities from Dark Core Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near-solar mass black holes (BHs) could have been involved in the two recent gravitational wave events, GW190425 and GW190814. Since such a low mass BH cannot be formed via stellar evolution, a model has been proposed based on the core collapse of a neutron star initiated by a certain number of dark matter (DM) particles. In this process, the accumulated DM particles collapse to form a tiny BH inside the neutron star, and the entire neutron star is transmuted into a BH after a certain time due to the accretion of matter by the endoparasitic BH from its host. Here, we argue that, depending on the initial conditions, a dark core collapse could give rise to either a BH or a naked singularity. For example, if the accumulated cloud of DM particles in the core of a neutron star can be modeled as an anisotropic fluid and it fulfils the criterion for collapse, an endoparasitic naked singularity could form instead of an endoparasitic BH. Immediately after its formation, the naked singularity should begin accreting matter from the host neutron star, thus eventually transmuting the entire host into a near-solar mass, relatively slowly-spinning naked singularity. We also propose a general technique to constrain the DM particle--neutron scattering cross section using the lack of pulsars near the Galactic centre and assuming that these missing pulsars have already been transmuted into BHs and/or naked singularities. Thus, the missing pulsars also indicate the existence of many such singularities near the Galactic center.</description>

      <title>Probing the Shock Breakout Signal of SN 2024ggi from the Transformation of Early Flash Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07806v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present early-time, hour-to-day cadence spectroscopy of the nearby type II supernova (SN II) 2024ggi, which was discovered at a phase when the SN shock just emerged from the red-supergiant (RSG) progenitor star. Over the first few days after the first light, SN 2024ggi exhibited prominent narrow emission lines formed through intense and persistent photoionization of the nearby circumstellar material (CSM). In the first 63 hours, spectral lines of He, C, N, and O revealed a rapid rise in ionization, as a result of the progressive sweeping-up of the CSM by the shock. The duration of the IIn-like spectra indicates a dense and relatively confined CSM distribution extending up to $\sim 4 \times 10^{14}$ cm. Spectral modeling reveals a CSM mass loss rate at this region exceeding $5 \times 10^{-3}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ is required to reproduce low-ionization emissions, which dramatically exceeds that of an RSG. Analyzing H$\alpha$ emission shift implies the velocity of the unshocked outer CSM to be between 20 and 40 km s$^{-1}$, matching the typical wind velocity of an RSG. The differences between the inner and outer layers of the CSM and an RSG progenitor highlight a complex mass loss history before the explosion of SN 2024ggi.</description>

      <title>NICER timing of the X-ray thermal isolated neutron star RX J0806.4--4123</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The X-ray thermal isolated neutron star (XTINS) RX J0806.4--4123 shows interesting multiwavelength properties that seemingly deviate from those of similar neutron stars. An accurate determination of the spin frequency change over time can assist in interpreting RX J0806.4-4123's properties in comparison to those of other XTINSs and the wider pulsar population. From 2019 to 2023 we carried out a tailored X-ray timing campaign of RX J0806.4-4123 with the NICER instrument. We used statistical properties of the Fourier coefficients and the $Z_K^2$ test for phase-connecting separate observations and finding a timing solution for the entire dataset. We also developed a simple and universal method for estimating the uncertainties of frequency $\nu$ and its derivative $\dot{\nu}$ from the empirical dependencies of $Z_K^2$ on trial values of these parameters, with account of all significant harmonics of the frequency. Applying this method, we determined a spin-down rate $\dot{\nu} = -7.3(1.2)\times 10^{-17}\,{\rm Hz\, s}^{-1}$. The resulting spin-down power $\dot{E}=2.6\times 10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$ is the lowest among the XTINSs, and it is a factor of 60 lower than the X-ray luminosity of this neutron star. RX J0806.4-4123 is also among the pulsars with the lowest measured $\dot{E}$ in general.</description>

      <title>I-Love-Q anisotropically: Universal relations for compact stars with scalar pressure anisotropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:1503.02726v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Certain physical quantities that characterize neutron stars and quark stars (e.g. their mass, spin angular momentum and quadrupole moment) are interrelated in a way that is approximately insensitive to their internal structure. Such approximately universal relations are useful to break degeneracies in data analysis for future radio, X-ray and gravitational wave observations. Although the pressure inside compact stars is most likely nearly isotropic, certain scenarios have been put forth that suggest otherwise, for example due to phase transitions. We here investigate whether pressure anisotropy affects the approximate universal relations and whether it prevents their use in future observations. We achieve this by numerically constructing slowly-rotating and tidally-deformed, anisotropic, compact stars in General Relativity to third order in spin. We find that anisotropy affects the universal relations only weakly; the relations become less universal by a factor of 1.5-3 relative to the isotropic case, but remain approximately universal to 10%. We succeed in explaining this increase in variability as an increase in the eccentricity variation of isodensity contours, which provides further support for the emergent approximate symmetry explanation of universality. Anisotropy does not affect the universal relations to a sufficient level to prevent their use in gravitational wave astrophysics or in experimental relativity. We provide an explicit example of the latter in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity. The increase in variability of the universal relations due to pressure anisotropy could affect their use in future X-ray observations. Given expected observational uncertainties, however, the relations remain sufficiently universal for use in such observations if the anisotropic modifications to the moment of inertia and the quadrupole moment are less than 10% of their isotropic values.</description>

      <title>Black-hole spectroscopy: quasinormal modes, ringdown stability and the pseudospectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16227v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black-hole spectroscopy is a powerful tool to probe the Kerr nature of astrophysical compact objects and their environment. The observation of multiple ringdown modes in gravitational waveforms could soon lead to high-precision gravitational-wave spectroscopy, thus it is critical to understand if the quasinormal mode spectrum itself is affected by astrophysical environments, quantum corrections, and other generic modifications. In this chapter, we will review the black-hole spectroscopy program and its challenges regarding quasinormal mode detection, the overtone status and the recent evidence that supports the existence of nonlinearities in the spectrum of black holes. We will then discuss a newly introduced non-modal tool in black-hole physics, namely the pseudospectrum; a mathematical notion that can shed light on the spectral stability of quasinormal modes, and discuss its novel applications in black holes and exotic horizonless compact objects. We will show that quasinormal modes generically suffer from spectral instabilities, explore how such phenomena can further affect black-hole spectroscopy, and discuss potential ringdown imprints and waveform stability issues in current and future gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Energetic Electrons Accelerated and Trapped in a Magnetic Bottle above a Solar Flare Arcade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Where and how flares efficiently accelerate charged particles remains an unresolved question. Recent studies revealed that a "magnetic bottle" structure, which forms near the bottom of a large-scale reconnection current sheet above the flare arcade, is an excellent candidate for confining and accelerating charged particles. However, further understanding its role requires linking the various observational signatures to the underlying coupled plasma and particle processes. Here we present the first study combining multiwavelength observations with data-informed macroscopic magnetohydrodynamics and particle modeling in a realistic eruptive flare geometry. The presence of an above-the-loop-top magnetic bottle structure is strongly supported by the observations, which feature not only a local minimum of magnetic field strength but also abruptly slowing down plasma downflows. It also coincides with a compact hard X-ray source and an extended microwave source that bestrides above the flare arcade. Spatially resolved spectral analysis suggests that nonthermal electrons are highly concentrated in this region. Our model returns synthetic emission signatures that are well matched to the observations. The results suggest that the energetic electrons are strongly trapped in the magnetic bottle region due to turbulence, with only a small fraction managing to escape. The electrons are primarily accelerated by plasma compression and facilitated by a fast-mode termination shock via the Fermi mechanism. Our results provide concrete support for the magnetic bottle as the primary electron acceleration site in eruptive solar flares. They also offer new insights into understanding the previously reported small population of flare-accelerated electrons entering interplanetary space.</description>

      <title>Constraining the parameters of an isolated neutron star using the lensed HI signal at uGMRT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The strength of the HI signal originating from a distant galaxy at a cosmological distance is several orders of magnitude lower than the foreground and background noise and hence it is difficult to observe this signal at a given radio telescope. However, a few recent studies reported the detection of that signal at the radio band suggests the strength of this signal is somehow magnified. In this analysis, we study the prospects of detecting this signal at different frequency bands of the uGMRT where this signal is supposed to be amplified through the strong gravitational lensing by an isolated neutron star located in a cosmological distance. Our study shows the effects of the lensing parameters on the observables of that amplified signal and discusses its variation with the frequency bands considered here. We present a method to estimate the position and size of an isolated neutron star using the signal-to-noise ratio of that signal supposed to be detected at different frequency bands of the uGMRT. We discuss the scope of multi-messenger astronomy in the era of HI observation where the estimated lensing parameters can be cross-validated using the pulsar detection at the X-ray band from the same location in the sky. Our analysis is equally applicable to any radio telescope with given specifications.</description>
