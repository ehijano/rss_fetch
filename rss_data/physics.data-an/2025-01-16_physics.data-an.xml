      <title>DMCpy: A powder and single crystal neutron diffraction software for DMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently upgraded DMC diffractometer at SINQ, equipped with a state-of-the-art 2D He detector, enables high-resolution neutron diffraction experiments optimized for both powder and single-crystal studies. To address the increased complexity and volume of data produced by this instrument, we developed DMCPy, a Python-based software package tailored specifically for DMC data analysis. DMCPy facilitates seamless data reduction and visualization, supporting conversion to reciprocal space, normalization, and masking of detector artifacts. Its modular architecture integrates tools for analyzing both powder diffraction patterns and single-crystal datasets, including advanced visualization features like 3D reciprocal space mapping and interactive scan inspection. By streamlining workflows and enhancing data interpretation, DMCPy empowers researchers to unlock the full potential of the DMC instrument for probing nuclear and magnetic structures in condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Disentangling sources of multifractality in time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This contribution addresses the question commonly asked in scientific literature about the sources of multifractality in time series. Two primary sources are typically considered. These are temporal correlations and heavy tails in the distribution of fluctuations. Most often, they are treated as two independent components, while true multifractality cannot occur without temporal correlations. The distributions of fluctuations affect the span of the multifractal spectrum only when correlations are present. These issues are illustrated here using series generated by several model mathematical cascades, which by design build correlations into these series. The thickness of the tails of fluctuations in such series is then governed by an appropriate procedure of adjusting them to $q$-Gaussian distributions, and $q$ is treated as a variable parameter that, while preserving correlations, allows to tune these distributions to the desired functional form. Multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA), as the most commonly used practical method for quantifying multifractality, is then used to identify the influence of the thickness of the fluctuation tails in the presence of temporal correlations on the width of multifractal spectra. The obtained results point to the Gaussian distribution, so $q=1$, as the appropriate reference distribution to evaluate the contribution of fatter tails to the width of multifractal spectra. An appropriate procedure is presented to make such estimates.</description>

      <title>Calibration of Scanning Thermal Microscope using Optimal Estimation of Function Parameters by Iterated Linearization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning thermal microscopy is a unique tool for the study of thermal properties at the nanoscale. However, calibration of the method is a crucial problem. When analyzing local thermal conductivity, direct calibration is not possible and reference samples are used instead. As the calibration dependence is non-linear and there are only a few calibration points, this represents a metrological challenge that needs complex data processing. In this contribution we present use of the OEFPIL algorithm for robust and single-step evaluation of local thermal conductivities and their uncertainties, simplifying this procedure. Furthermore, we test the suitability of SThM calibration for automated measurement.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Time-of-Flight Detector Values of Angular Streaking Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Angular streaking experiments enable for experimentation in the attosecond regions. However, the deployed Time-of-flight detectors are susceptible to noise and failure. These shortcomings make the outputs of the Time-of-flight detectors hard to understand for humans and further processing, such as for example the extraction of beam properties. In this article, we present an approach to remove high noise levels and reconstruct up to three failed Time-of-flight detectors from an arrangement of 16 Time-of-flight detectors. Due to its fast evaluation time, the presented method is applicable online during a running experiment. It is trained with simulation data, and we show the results of denoising and reconstruction of our method on real-world experiment data.</description>

      <title>A large population of cell-specific action potential models replicating fluorescence recordings of voltage in rabbit ventricular myocytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent high-throughput experiments unveil substantial electrophysiological diversity among uncoupled healthy myocytes under identical conditions. To quantify inter-cell variability, the values of a subset of the parameters in a well-regarded mathematical model of the action potential of rabbit ventricular myocytes are estimated from fluorescence voltage measurements of a large number of cells. Statistical inference yields a population of nearly 1200 cell-specific model variants that, on a population-level replicate experimentally measured biomarker ranges and distributions, and in contrast to earlier studies, also match experimental biomarker values on a cell-by-cell basis. This model population may be regarded as a random sample from the phenotype of healthy rabbit ventricular myocytes. Uni-variate and bi-variate joint marginal distributions of the estimated parameters are presented, and the parameter dependencies of several commonly utilised electrophysiological biomarkers are revealed. Parameter values are weakly correlated, while summary metrics such as the action potential duration are not strongly dependent on any single electrophysiological characteristic of the myocyte. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of accurately and efficiently fitting entire action potential waveforms at scale.

      <title>A Political Spectrograph: High-Resolution Examinations of the United States' Ideological Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of ``ideology" is central to political discourse and dynamics, and is often cast as falling primarily on a one-dimensional scale from ``left-wing/liberal" to ``right-wing/conservative", but the validity of this simple quantitative treatment is uncertain. Here we investigate and compare various high-resolution measures of ideology, both internal (individuals self-identification and policy-stance agreements) and external (estimating the ideological position of political opinion statements). We find strong consistency between internal measures, although policy-stance agreement ideology yields a systematically centralizing and liberalizing portrait relative to subjective measures. More remarkably, we find that external assessments of ideology, while noisy, are largely consistent across observers, even for highly dissonant ideas and regardless of speaker identity markers. This supports the use of these responses as meaningful, comparable quantities, which general members of the public reliably project from the abstract space of political thought onto a shared one-dimensional domain. We end with observation of some broad initial patterns of political opinion acceptance, feelings towards the major political parties, and propensity for extreme thinking, finding mostly ideologically symmetric results strongly stratified by strong/lean/Independent political party identity. We hope these perspectives on quantification of political ideology serve as an invitation for a broader range of quantitative scientists to model and understand this vital societal arena.</description>

      <title>The geometry of moral decision making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how (resource) bounded rationality can be understood as the interplay of two fundamental moral principles: deontology and utilitarianism. In particular, we interpret deontology as a regularisation function in an optimal control problem, coupled with a free parameter, the inverse temperature, to shield the individual from expected utility. We discuss the information geometry of bounded rationality and aspects of its relation to rate distortion theory. A central role is played by Markov kernels and regular conditional probability, which are also studied geometrically. A gradient equation is used to determine the utility expansion path. Finally, the framework is applied to the analysis of a disutility model of the restriction of constitutional rights that we derive from legal doctrine. The methods discussed here are also relevant to the theory of autonomous agents.</description>

      <title>Revealing Local Structures through Machine-Learning- Fused Multimodal Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomistic structures of materials offer valuable insights into their functionality. Determining these structures remains a fundamental challenge in materials science, especially for systems with defects. While both experimental and computational methods exist, each has limitations in resolving nanoscale structures. Core-level spectroscopies, such as x-ray absorption (XAS) or electron energy-loss spectroscopies (EELS), have been used to determine the local bonding environment and structure of materials. Recently, machine learning (ML) methods have been applied to extract structural and bonding information from XAS/EELS, but most of these frameworks rely on a single data stream, which is often insufficient. In this work, we address this challenge by integrating multimodal ab initio simulations, experimental data acquisition, and ML techniques for structure characterization. Our goal is to determine local structures and properties using EELS and XAS data from multiple elements and edges. To showcase our approach, we use various lithium nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) oxide compounds which are used for lithium ion batteries, including those with oxygen vacancies and antisite defects, as the sample material system. We successfully inferred local element content, ranging from lithium to transition metals, with quantitative agreement with experimental data. Beyond improving prediction accuracy, we find that ML model based on multimodal spectroscopic data is able to determine whether local defects such as oxygen vacancy and antisites are present, a task which is impossible for single mode spectra or other experimental techniques. Furthermore, our framework is able to provide physical interpretability, bridging spectroscopy with the local atomic and electronic structures.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Data Format for Scientific Data Storage and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we present the High-Performance Output (HiPO) data format developed at Jefferson Laboratory for storing and analyzing data from Nuclear Physics experiments. The format was designed to efficiently store large amounts of experimental data, utilizing modern fast compression algorithms. The purpose of this development was to provide organized data in the output, facilitating access to relevant information within the large data files. The HiPO data format has features that are suited for storing raw detector data, reconstruction data, and the final physics analysis data efficiently, eliminating the need to do data conversions through the lifecycle of experimental data. The HiPO data format is implemented in C++ and JAVA, and provides bindings to FORTRAN, Python, and Julia, providing users with the choice of data analysis frameworks to use. In this paper, we will present the general design and functionalities of the HiPO library and compare the performance of the library with more established data formats used in data analysis in High Energy and Nuclear Physics (such as ROOT and Parquete).</description>

      <title>Automated Review Generation Method Based on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20906v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Literature research, vital for scientific work, faces the challenge of surging information volumes exceeding researchers' processing capabilities. We present an automated review generation method based on large language models (LLMs) to overcome efficiency bottlenecks and reduce cognitive load. Our statistically validated evaluation framework demonstrates that the generated reviews match or exceed manual quality, offering broad applicability across research fields without requiring users' domain knowledge. Applied to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts, our method swiftly analyzed 343 articles, averaging seconds per article per LLM account, producing comprehensive reviews spanning 35 topics, with extended analysis of 1041 articles providing insights into catalysts' properties. Through multi-layered quality control, we effectively mitigated LLMs' hallucinations, with expert verification confirming accuracy and citation integrity while demonstrating hallucination risks reduced to below 0.5\% with 95\% confidence. Released Windows application enables one-click review generation, enhancing research productivity and literature recommendation efficiency while setting the stage for broader scientific explorations.</description>
