      <title>Synergism in radiation effects in condensed matter. Fundamental and application aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impressive success achieved by condensed matter radiation physics over its 170-year development period is related to the solution of problems in three areas, the emergence of new materials, the development of new sources of radiation, and the formulation of new concepts with a wide range of applications. In the borderlands of the 20th and 21st centuries, significant changes occurred in each of these aspects (not-so-catastrophic disasters, R. Tom). A major role was played by the emergence of a new ideology - Complexity, which led to the birth of four paradigms, self-organization, dynamic chaos, self-organized criticality and nonadditivity (the first three are related to the concept of synergetics, the fourth - synergism). This article is devoted to radiation synergism, with an emphasis on combinations of radiation and other effects. It presents methods of graphical techniques to identify the specific issue of synergism effects, which is the non-additivity of the overall radiation effect. A parameter expression is proposed to account for the non-additivity of the radiation effect in the experiment, which can be compared to the q parameter introduced by Tsallis in the general science of Complexity, opening up new possibilities in condensed matter radiation physics for both living and non-living objects.</description>

      <title>Optical effects in modified Maxwell electrodynamics under a uniform electromagnetic background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate optical effects in modified Maxwell electrodynamics (ModMax) in the presence of an external electromagnetic field. Considering uniform and constant magnetic and electric backgrounds, the solutions for the refractive indices are revisited. Using these results, we obtain the propagating modes and the phase shift (birefringence) for plane wave solutions in the presence of a pure magnetic background field. Afterwards, we investigate the Goos-H\"anchen effect considering the interface between a simple dielectric and a medium whose electromagnetic response tensors are ruled by the ModMax electrodynamics. Further, based on the general reflection problem, we discuss the complex Kerr rotation with both the electric $(E)$ and magnetic $(B)$ background fields, considering two main cases: i) $B&gt;E$ and ii) $E&gt;B$. Our findings indicate that the $\gamma$ parameter and ratios $(B/E)$ and $(E/B)$ play a central role in describing the Kerr signals (rotation and ellipticity) of systems with optical effects induced by non-linear electromagnetic effects.</description>

      <title>Surface defects in carbon-doped hexagonal boron nitride for negative-contrast direct laser writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiative defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are active in a broad spectral range from deep ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths. Representatives of these defects act as bright single photon sources, spin-1 systems, and multiproperty atomic-scale sensors. They are predominantly investigated in bulk hBN films, where defects are decoupled from surface and interfacial effects. Here, we demonstrate a novel class of surface defects optically active in the green/yellow visible spectral range, which exhibit photophysical properties distinct from their bulk counterparts. High-power resonant laser illumination quenched the emission from the ensemble of such defects, which was attributed to a light-driven structural reconfiguration. The quenched defects were found to recover their emissive capabilities via a thermal cycling process, revealing an activation energy of 24.5 meV for the structural transition. Alternatively, permanent quenching of the defects was triggered by surface chemistry, involving lithiation-enabled attachment of functional groups. These mechanisms were utilized to realize negative-contrast direct laser writing, designing arbitrary geometric emissive patterns on demand in a microscopic configuration. The surface-active radiative centers in hBN appear particularly attractive for exploring environmental sensitivity, surface science, and coupling to photonic structures or electronic devices by taking unique advantage of the two-dimensional characteristics of the host lattice.</description>

      <title>Why is the $d$-Wave spin splitting in CuF$_2$ bulk-like?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of nonrelativistic spin splitting in collinear compensated antiferromagnets, several candidate materials have also been proposed, among which the family of transition-metal difluorides stands out as a prominent example. Within this family, most members exhibit planar $d$-wave spin splitting, whereas CuF$_2$ shows bulk $d$-wave splitting with an explicit $k_z$ dependence. In this work, we show that this transition from planar to bulk $d$-wave splitting in CuF$_2$ is primarily driven by the antipolar displacements of the F ions, which are absent in the tetragonal rutile structure of the other family members. Our calculations reveal that these additional structural distortions introduce an extra plane of anisotropic magnetization density, giving rise to an additional totally symmetric component of the magnetic octupole tensor. The $k$-space representation of this octupole component, consequently, dictates an additional direction of spin splitting, thereby transforming the $d$-wave spin splitting pattern from planar to bulk-like. We further analyze the effect of spin-orbit coupling on the magnetic octupoles and the resulting spin splitting in the band structure. Our work highlights the possibility of controlling the pattern of nonrelativistic spin splitting through structural modifications, for example, via the application of external pressure.</description>

      <title>Ferrocene-functionalized covalent organic framework exceeding the ultimate hydrogen storage targets: a first-principles multiscale computational study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of efficient hydrogen storage materials is crucial for advancing the hydrogen economy and meeting the U.S. Department of Energy's targets of 6.5 wt\% and 50 g \ce{H2} L$^{-1}$ for automotive applications. We present a computational study of ferrocene-functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for hydrogen storage. Following the \textbf{M}ulti-binding \textbf{S}ites \textbf{U}nited in \textbf{C}ovalent-\textbf{O}rganic \textbf{F}ramework (MSUCOF) approach, we introduce MSUCOF-4-FeCp, designed by incorporating ferrocene (\ce{FeCp2}) moieties into IRCOF-102. Notably, it achieves exceptional performance with gravimetric and volumetric uptakes of 18.0 wt\% and 72.6 g \ce{H2} L$^{-1}$ at 298 K and 700 bar. The material exhibits optimal binding energies (15--20 kJ$\cdot$mol$^{-1}$) ensuring both high storage capacity and deliverable hydrogen under practical conditions. This work establishes ferrocene functionalization as a cost-effective alternative to precious metal incorporation in COFs.</description>

      <title>Generalized Brillouin Zone Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Generalized Brillouin Zone (GBZ) encodes how lattice momentum is complex-deformed due to non-Hermitian skin accumulation, and has proved essential in restoring bulk-boundary correspondences. However, we find that generically, the GBZ is neither unique nor well-defined if more than one skin localization direction or strength exists, even in systems with no asymmetric hoppings. Instead, open boundary condition (OBC) eigenstates become complicated superpositions of multiple competing skin modes from "fragments" of all possible GBZs solutions. We develop a formalism that computes the fragmented GBZ in a scalable manner, with fragmentation extent quantified through our newly-defined composition IPR and spectral relative entropy. GBZ fragmentation is revealed to fundamentally challenge the notion of discontinuous phase transitions, since topological winding contributions from different GBZ fragments can "melt away" at different rates. Phenomenologically, GBZ fragmentation also leads to edge localization in all observables in energetically weighted ensembles such as thermal ensembles. This contrasts with conventional GBZs where the skin localization completely cancels in biorthogonal expectations. Occurring universally in multi-mode non-Hermitian media, as we concretely demonstrate with photonic crystal simulations, GBZ fragmentation points towards a new paradigm that is essential for understanding the band structure and the topological and dynamical properties of diverse generic non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Elastic, Quasielastic, and Superelastic Electron Scattering from Thermal Lattice Distortions in Perfect Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In standard treatments of electron transport, momentum relaxation in a perfect, defect-free crystal is linked with phonon creation or annihilation. In this work, we reconsider this problem for a finite, isolated crystal, retaining the lattice center-of-mass (recoil) degree of freedom and enforcing conservation of total mechanical momentum together with discrete crystal pseudomomentum. Starting from the density-density form of the electron-lattice interaction, we show that an electron in the interior of a perfect crystal admits elastic momentum-transfer channels in which total momentum is conserved by recoil of the lattice background without phonon excitation. These elastic channels can provide the leading contribution to momentum relaxation. We further identify mixed quasi-elastic and superelastic processes in which phonon occupations change but do not account entirely for the electron's momentum transfer. The elastic channels arise within the standard microscopic Hamiltonian and do not require additional disorder or defects. The resulting framework provides a complementary microscopic perspective on momentum relaxation in clean crystals and is consistent with experimental phenomena such as weak localization, quantum oscillations, ultrasonic attenuation, and the observed separation of momentum and energy relaxation times.</description>

      <title>Odd viscosity and anomalous Hall effect in two dimensional electron systems with smooth disorder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A microscopic theory of odd viscosity in two-dimensional electron systems with smooth disorder and spin-orbit interaction is developed. It is shown that spin-orbit scattering in presence of spin polarization induced by magnetic field gives rise to an off-diagonal component of the viscosity tensor. Hydrodynamic equations for spin and electric currents are derived for electrons interacting with smooth disorder. The contribution of odd viscosity to the anomalous Hall effect is calculated.</description>

      <title>MagneX: A High-Performance, GPU-Enabled, Data-Driven Micromagnetics Solver for Spintronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to comprehensively investigate the multiphysics coupling in spintronic devices, it is essential to parallelize and utilize GPU-acceleration to address the spatial and temporal disparities inherent in the relevant physics. Additionally, the use of cutting-edge time integration libraries as well as machine learning (ML) approaches to replace and potentially accelerate expensive computational routines are attractive capabilities to enhance modeling capabilities moving forward. Leveraging the Exascale Computing Project software framework AMReX, as well as SUNDIALS time-integration libraries and python-based ML workflows, we have developed an open-source micromagnetics modeling tool called MagneX. This tool incorporates various crucial magnetic coupling mechanisms, including Zeeman coupling, demagnetization coupling, crystalline anisotropy interaction, exchange coupling, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) coupling. We demonstrate the GPU performance and scalability of the code and rigorously validate MagneX's functionality using the mumag standard problems and widely-accepted DMI benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the data-driven capability of MagneX by replacing the computationally-expensive demagnetization physics with neural network libraries trained from our simulation data. With the capacity to explore complete physical interactions, this innovative approach offers a promising pathway to better understand and develop fully integrated spintronic and electronic systems.</description>
