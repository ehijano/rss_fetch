      <title>Kinetic theory an the speed of sound in dense matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a constraint on the speed of sound, $c_s^2$, derived from relativistic kinetic theory and show how it can be expressed in terms of the average sound speed, $\langle c_s^2 \rangle$. This reformulation highlights the interplay between instantaneous and integrated stiffness of the equation of state and allows the kinetic-theory bound to be visualized as a restriction in the $c_s^2$-$\langle c_s^2 \rangle $ plane.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Responses to Two-Body External Fields Studied with the Second Random-Phase-Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates nuclear responses to two-body external fields, interpreted as double-phonon excitations, within the subtracted second random-phase approximation (SSRPA) for 16O. To clarify the underlying characteristics of these modes, Hartree-Fock (HF) and SSRPA with the diagonal approximation are first examined. The resulting strength distributions are nearly identical, indicating that residual interactions in the 1p-1h sector contribute only weakly. This behavior contrasts with that of one-body excitations, where coupling between 1p-1h and 2p-2h configurations is essential for generating collectivity. In the full SSRPA calculation, which incorporates the residual interaction among 2p-2h configurations, the strength distributions are substantially modified. The double IS 0+ and 2+ modes show pronounced redistribution, with peaks shifted to lower energies and additional strength emerging at higher energies, whereas the double IV $1^{-}$ mode shifts predominantly to higher energies due to a largely repulsive interaction. Analysis of single transition amplitudes reveals that low-lying resonances are formed coherently through constructive neutron-neutron, proton-proton, and neutron-proton configurations, while high-lying resonances are dominated by neutron-proton configurations, reflecting their higher state density. These results demonstrate that double-phonon excitations cannot be described by simple folding of one-body responses; a fully microscopic treatment of 2p-2h mixing, as provided by SSRPA, is essential.</description>

      <title>Ab initio Glauber-theory calculations of high-energy nuclear scattering observables using variational Monte Carlo wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments using intermediate- to high-energy radioactive nuclear beams present numerous findings. Extracting important properties of physical observables relies on a firm theoretical analysis. Though Glauber theory is believed to work well, no convincing calculation has so far been done. We perform ab initio Glauber theory calculations of both elastic differential cross sections and total reaction cross sections for p+12C, 12C+12C, and 6He+12C systems. The wave functions of both 6He and 12C are generated by variational Monte Carlo calculations with spatial and spin-isospin correlations induced by realistic two- and three-nucleon potentials. Glauber's phase-shift function is computed by Monte Carlo integration up to all orders of nucleon-nucleon multiple scatterings. We show an excellent performance of the Glauber description to the selected data on the above systems. We also find that the cumulant expansion of the phase-shift function converges rapidly up to the second order for the above systems. This finding will open up interesting applications for the analysis of high-energy nuclear experiments.</description>

      <title>Glauber-theory analysis of nuclear reactions on 12C target with variational Monte Carlo wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of Glauber theory has been playing an increasingly important role with the study of unstable or exotic nuclei. Its adaptation to medium and high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions is severely limited because one has to evaluate the matrix elements of multiple-scattering operators. The extraction of physical observables has been done using 'approximate' Glauber theory whose validity is hard to evaluate. We perform a full calculation of the matrix elements using Monte Carlo integration and analyze the elastic differential cross sections and the total reaction cross sections for p+12C, 4,6He+12C, and 12C+12C collisions. We use the variational Monte Carlo wave functions for 4,6He and 12C obtained by using realistic two- and three-nucleon potentials. We demonstrate the performance of the Glauber-theory calculations by comparing with available experimental data. We further discuss the accuracy of the conventional approximate methods in the light of the cumulant expansion for Glauber's phase-shift function.</description>

      <title>Challenge of nuclear transmutation in heavy-ion colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the production of secondary nuclei in the hadronic fragmentation and electromagnetic dissociation (EMD) of $^{20}$Ne beams at the LHC and $^{124}$Xe beams at NICA. For light nuclei at LHC energies, our calculations show that hadronic interactions are the dominant channel for nuclear transmutation. This contrasts with the previously established dominance of EMD in $^{208}$Pb-$^{208}$Pb collisions. For $^{20}$Ne-$^{20}$Ne collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.36$ TeV, we provide calculated cross sections and momentum distributions of produced nuclei such as $^4$He, $^{12}$C, $^{14}$N, and $^{16}$O. These results are essential for assessing potential contamination of the $^{20}$Ne-$^{20}$Ne event sample by collisions involving other nuclear species. Secondary nuclei will be also produced in the EMD of $^{124}$Xe beams at NICA, but they will not contaminate $^{124}$Xe-$^{124}$Xe data.</description>

      <title>Proton-neutron correlations in baryon-number fluctuations near the liquid-gas transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study net-baryon number density fluctuations in isospin-symmetric matter near the nuclear liquid-gas phase transition using the parity doublet model. We analyze second-order susceptibilities of net-proton and net-neutron numbers and their correlations. We show that proton-neutron correlations are nontrivial and lead to qualitative differences between net-proton and net-baryon fluctuations. We further investigate factorial cumulants and demonstrate that the differences between baryon- and proton-number factorial cumulants are governed by proton-neutron correlations. Our results highlight the importance of interaction-driven correlations for interpreting fluctuation measurements near the liquid-gas critical endpoint.</description>

      <title>Towards compressed baryonic matter densities: thermodynamics and transport coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic and transport properties of hot and dense quantum chromodynamic matter expected to be produced in low-energy heavy-ion collisions, using three different effective quantum chromodynamic frameworks: the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model, the chiral effective model, and the hadron resonance gas model. We briefly outline the theoretical formulation of thermodynamic quantities and transport coefficients within these approaches, where quarks are treated with effective masses in the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio and chiral effective models, and hadronic degrees of freedom are employed in the hadron resonance gas model. The transport coefficients are evaluated using the Boltzmann transport equation in the relaxation-time approximation. Following the theoretical overview, we present a comprehensive analysis of the behavior of these quantities as functions of the baryon chemical potential or net baryon density. The Lorenz ratio $\kappa/(\sigma T)$ is found to increase rapidly-indicating a strong violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law in the low-$\mu_{B}$ regime--while approaching the universal value at higher baryon chemical potentials or densities. The shear-viscosity-to-entropy-density ratio $\eta/s$ remains nearly constant at low $\mu_{B}$ but exhibits a gradual increase as $\mu_{B}$ grows. We also discuss the qualitative similarities of these trends with those observed in the electron-hole plasma of graphene, an emergent quasi-relativistic system characterized by massless energy-momentum dispersion.</description>

      <title>Studying nuclear medium modification using the Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn sum rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn sum rule is a generic relation that has been used to make significant contributions to research in hadronic physics. It connects the spin-dependent cross-section for photoproduction off a particle to the squared ratio of the particle's anomalous magnetic moment and its mass, $(\kappa/M)^2$. Thus, for a nucleon embedded in a nucleus, the sum rule relates the cross-section to $\kappa/M$ averaged quadratically over the nucleons comprising the nucleus. This quadratic averaging can be used to constrain the mechanism responsible for the medium modification of the nucleon. We also point out that the global properties of the embedded nucleon like its axial charge, mass or magnetic moment are observables measurable through sum rules.</description>

      <title>Exploring quark mass dependent three-nucleon forces in medium-mass nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, new quark mass dependent three-nucleon (3N) forces have been identified, whose contributions in nuclear matter exceed expectations of Weinberg power-counting arguments. In this work, we investigate the impact of the most dominant new interaction term, characterized by the coupling $F_2$, in ab initio calculations of medium-mass nuclei. For this, we combine the new $F_2$ interaction with established 3N interactions up to next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^2$LO) and next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) in chiral effective field theory. We explore two fit strategies for the low-energy couplings. The first is based only on few-body observables, while the second also incorporates information from $^{16}$O. Generally, we find that the $F_2$ interaction has a significant impact on energies and radii, however mainly due to changes in the short-range couplings. Overall, we do not find systematic improvements in the reproduction of medium-mass nuclei when the additional $F_2$ interaction is included.</description>

      <title>CT25: Progress toward next-generation PDFs for precision phenomenology at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We summarize recent progress toward the next generation of CTEQ-TEA parton distribution functions, CT25, based on a global NNLO analysis that incorporates a significant sample of newly included LHC data. We present a baseline fit within the forthcoming full CT25 fit, which includes new Drell-Yan, top-pair, and inclusive-jet data at 8 and 13 TeV, and exhibits non-trivial pulls on the high-$x$ gluon and the flavor structure of the quark sea. In the context of progress toward CT25, we also summarize several recent and ongoing studies of the interplay between phenomenological PDFs and lattice-QCD calculations, simultaneous extractions of $\alpha_s(M_Z)$ within the CT framework, and an expanded program of uncertainty quantification that treats parametrization dependence as an explicit source of epistemic uncertainty, among other issues. We also briefly highlight CT efforts to understand the effects of partial implementations of N$^3$LO corrections into PDF fits, which include benchmark calculations for Higgs and vector-boson processes. We comment on the implications of recent improvements to the CT analysis for precision phenomenology at the LHC and future facilities.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical constraints on the cold equation of state of the strongly interacting matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At present, the only experimental access to the properties of cold, dense strongly interacting matter is provided by astrophysical observations. Neutron stars are the only known systems in the Universe that reach densities several times higher than normal nuclear density at nearly zero temperature, making them unique laboratories for studying dense matter. Since most neutron-star observables are sensitive to the equation of state (EOS), observational data place stringent constraints on the EOS of strongly interacting matter. In this work, we investigate constraints arising from the mass of the heaviest observed neutron star (a black widow pulsar), perturbative QCD calculations at asymptotically high densities, NICER mass-radius measurements, and the tidal deformability inferred from the binary neutron star merger GW170817. We parametrize the EOS and allow its parameters to vary freely, using observational data to constrain the admissible parameter space. We find that neutron-star observations significantly restrict the EOS of dense strongly interacting matter. While NICER has already provided measurements for five pulsars, the associated uncertainties remain relatively large. In contrast, the existence of very massive neutron stars and constraints on the tidal deformability emerge as particularly powerful probes of the EOS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the internal structure of near-threshold states is essential for revealing the nature of exotic hadrons. Motivated by this challenge, we discuss the clustering structures of near-threshold $s$-wave eigenstates using the compositeness, which characterizes the clustering nature of the states. We show that shallow bound states usually possess cluster-dominant structures, while near-threshold narrow resonances are non-cluster-dominant. Through this study, we establish a theoretical foundation for the threshold energy rule, which has been known empirically.</description>

      <title>Shear viscosity at finite magnetic field for graphene, non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Present article has addressed finite magnetic field extension of previous work by Cho et al. (Phys. Rev. B 108, 235172, 2023) on microscopic calculation of shear viscosity for electron fluid in graphene system. Our calculation is based on the kinetic theory approach in the relaxation time approximation. In the absence of magnetic field, transport is governed by a single shear viscosity coefficient, whereas the application of a finite magnetic field induces anisotropy, give rise to the five independent shear viscosity coefficients associated with distinct velocity gradient tensors. These coefficient can be physically categorized into perpendicular, parallel and Hall components relative to the magnetic field direction. When the scattering time equals to the cyclotron time, the perpendicular component is suppressed by 80% and parallel component by 50%, and Hall effect can reach maximum. Corresponding magnetic field strength for electron fluid in graphene is around 0.01-0.1 Tesla and the same for non-relativistic electron fluid and ultra-relativistic quark fluid are around 10 Tesla and 10^14 Tesla respectively. They may be considered as required magnetic field strength in three different fluid systems to observe noticeable magnetic field response in their shear viscosity coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: QCD at large densities exhibits a moat regime in the scalar-pseudoscalar sector. The resolution of its dynamics is pivotal for the access to the onset of new phases including the potential critical endpoint of QCD. In this work we present the first selfconsistent analysis of this regime with the functional renormalisation group approach to QCD. We map out the moat regime, including a first analysis of potential inhomogeneous instabilities at baryon chemical potential $\mu_B\gtrsim 600$ MeV on the chiral crossover line.</description>

      <title>A possible solution to the gallium anomaly moving beyond the leptonic wave function factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For over thirty years, a $\sim20\%$ deficit, now exceeding $5\sigma$, has persisted between measured and predicted neutrino capture rates on $^{71}$Ga, as observed in radioactive source experiments (namely GALLEX, SAGE, and more recently BEST) using $^{51}$Cr and $^{37}$Ar. This long-standing discrepancy, referred to as the gallium anomaly, has posed a significant challenge to our understanding of both experimental methods and theoretical predictions. In this work, we revisit the theoretical calculation of the neutrino capture cross-section by moving beyond the standard treatment of the leptonic wave functions, revealing limitations in the commonly used factorization approach based on the detailed balance principle. Incorporating phenomenologically constrained Gamow-Teller transition densities, able to correctly reproduce the precisely measured half-life of $^{71}{\textrm{Ge}}$, we find that the revised cross-section can be significantly reduced, potentially resolving the gallium anomaly without invoking new physics.</description>

      <title>Transport-model investigation of scaling of the number of constituent quarks and the hadronic-partonic transition in Au + Au collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the elliptic flow ($v_2$) in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}} = 3.0$ and 4.5 GeV using both hadronic and partonic transport models, including JAM, SMASH, AMPT-Hadronic Cascade, and AMPT-String Melting. At 3.0 GeV, the JAM model reproduces the number-of-constituent-quark (NCQ) scaling violation observed by STAR, as well as the particle ordering ($K^0_S &gt; p &gt; \pi^+$). Model calculations of the centrality dependence indicate that the scaling violation mainly originates from hadronic interactions rather than spectator effects, while the rapidity dependence further constrains the mechanism of the scaling breaking and the underlying longitudinal dynamics. At 4.5 GeV, partonic interactions in the AMPT-String Melting mode significantly enhance NCQ scaling, and turning off final-state hadronic rescattering further clarifies the scaling pattern, highlighting the increasing role of partonic degrees of freedom. The energy dependence of the $p_T$-integrated $v_2$ is also examined within these models.</description>

      <title>Modifications in clusterization procedures for heavy-ion collisions: minimum spanning tree, simulated annealing, coalescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02084v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new open-source cluster finding library ''Common Clusterization Library'' (CCL) is proposed to describe the clusters production when applied to the transport codes. The new library was applied to the Parton-Hadron-Quantum-Molecular Dynamics approach to be comparable with the established and well known MST and SACA implementations on the exactly same set of the events. The presented procedures were tested with rapidity density distributions and complex observables like $\langle M_{imf} \rangle$ and $\langle Z_{\text{max}} \rangle$ vs $Z_{bound}2$ at the energies of ALADiN and NA49 experiments. An improvement to the simulated annealing chain is proposed to reduce the computational time. The new stable clusters tracking algorithm for the ''lost'' cluster recovering is presented. The results of the ''box-like'' coalescence procedure and a mixed method which incorporates the coalescence algorithm steps and the negative binding energy criteria are presented. The difference between the Helium-3 found by the MST-based cluster finding procedure and the coalescence algorithm applied on the exactly same set of events and baryons is shown for the first time.</description>

      <title>Unfolding Baryon Number Fluctuations from Correlations of Light Nuclei Production in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16331v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Event-by-event fluctuations of the baryon number, which is mostly carried by protons and neutrons, in relativistic heavy-ion collisions provide a sensitive probe for locating the conjectured critical point in the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram. Since current experiments have limited access to neutron fluctuations because detectors are largely insensitive to neutrons, measurements of (net-)proton fluctuations are often used as a proxy for (net-)baryon number fluctuations. Although direct measurements of neutron fluctuations are challenging, their information are encoded in the production and correlations of light nuclei, when they are formed through coalescence of nucleons at kinetic freeze-out. Here, we propose to unfold neutron fluctuations from correlations among light nuclei produced in heavy-ion collisions. Model calculations validate this approach and show that baryon number fluctuations can be unfolded up to the third order. For fourth and higher-order cumulants, however, the uncertainties become sizable, indicating that further methodological developments and refinements are required.</description>

      <title>Constraining color-charge effects of partonic energy loss with jet axis-based inclusive jet substructure measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the color-charge dependence of parton energy loss in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) medium and the associated relative modifications of quark and gluon jet fractions compared to vacuum, using jet axis decorrelation observables. Recent CMS jet axis decorrelation measurements in PbPb collisions at 5.02 TeV are interpreted using Pythia simulations with varied quark/gluon jet compositions and emulated color-charge dependent energy loss. A template-fit procedure is employed to estimate the limits on gluon jet fractions in the published CMS data and average shift in jet momentum due to quenching for quark- and gluon-initiated jets traversing the QGP. The extracted gluon jet fractions and the estimated quark and gluon energy losses based on this study of jet axis decorrelations are found to be consistent with other model calculations based on inclusive observables. This work illustrates the use of jet substructure measurements for providing constraints on the color-charge dependence of parton energy loss and offers valuable insights for jet quenching models.</description>

      <title>Impact of 3D macro physics and nuclear physics on the p nuclei in O-C shell mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: O-C shell mergers in massive stars are a site for producing the p nuclei by the $\gamma$ process, but 1D stellar models rely on mixing length theory, which does not match the radial velocity profiles of 3D hydrodynamic simulations. We investigate how 3D macro physics informed mixing impacts the nucleosynthesis of p nuclei. We post-process the O-shell of the $M_\mathrm{ZAMS} = 15~\mathrm{M}_\odot$, $Z = 0.02$ model from the NuGrid stellar data set. Applying a downturn to velocities at the boundary and increasing velocities across the shell as obtained in previous results, we find non-linear, non-monotonic increase in p-nuclei production with a spread of 0.96 dex, and find that isotopic ratios can change. Reducing C-shell ingestion rates as found in 3D simulations suppresses production, with spreads of 1.22-1.84 dex across MLT and downturn scenarios. Applying dips to the diffusion profile to mimic quenching events also suppresses production, with a 0.51 dex spread. We analyze the impact of varying all photo-disintegration rates of unstable n-deficient isotopes from Se-Po by a factor of 10 up and down. The nuclear physics variations for the MLT and downturn cases have a spread of 0.56-0.78 dex. We also provide which reaction rates are correlated with the p nuclei, and find few correlations shared between mixing scenarios. Our results demonstrate that uncertainties in mixing arising from uncertain 3D macro physics are as significant as nuclear physics and are crucial for understanding p-nuclei production during O-C shell mergers quantitatively.</description>

      <title>Scalar-glueball-mediated scale-anomaly dominance of the confining pressure of the pion in holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the energy density and the stress distribution inside the pion derived from gravitational form factors in top-down holographic QCD. In particular, we show that the dominance of the scale anomaly in the confining pressure, previously observed in the instant form for the nucleon, also holds for the pion in the light-front form. Furthermore, we find that in large-$N_c$ QCD described by this approach, the scalar glueball plays a mediating role in transmitting the confining pressure. These findings support the universal role of the scale anomaly in the stability of hadrons.</description>

      <title>Scale-anomaly-induced binding pressure in hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23786v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effect of the QCD scale anomaly on the internal pressure distribution of hadrons is studied based on the trace-traceless decomposition of the energy-momentum tensor. Using recent model-independent results of gravitational form factors as input, the pressure distributions of both pions and nucleons are analyzed in the instant form and the light-front form. It is found that, in all cases, the scale anomaly dominantly generates the negative binding pressure. This result suggests that the phenomenon is a universal feature, independent of models, types of hadrons, and the choice of form.</description>

      <title>Drell-Yan at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The photon is arguably the most universally important particle across all fields of physics. Despite its status as a fundamental particle, at high energies the photon can be seen as a hadronic source of partons. The partonic content of the photon is very poorly constrained compared to that of the proton, with photon PDF uncertainties typically one or two orders of magnitude larger than their proton counterparts, despite the fact that its source, the $\gamma\to q\bar{q}$ splitting, is perturbatively calculable. The high luminosity, excellent particle identification, and far-backward electron tagging capabilities of the Electron-Ion Collider make it an ideal environment for studying photon parton distribution functions. Similar to the $p+p$ or $\pi+p$ systems, photoproduction at the EIC can be thought of as two parton distributions colliding. One of the most powerful processes in such collisions is production of lepton pairs, i.e. $h+p\rightarrow l^+l^-+X$, known as the Drell--Yan process. This process has the ability to access for the first time the transverse-momentum-dependent parton distributions of the photon. The transversely polarized proton beam of the EIC additionally provides a possible means of accessing the transversity distribution of the proton without relying on fragmentation functions.</description>
