      <title>Probing the Quantized Berry Phases in 1H-NbSe$_2$ Using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topologically trivial insulators are classified into two primary categories: unobstructed and obstructed atomic insulators. While both types can be described by exponentially localized Wannier orbitals, a defining feature of obstructed atomic insulators is that the centers of charge of these orbitals are positioned at empty sites within the unit cell, rather than on atoms. Despite extensive theoretical predictions, the unambiguous and quantitative experimental identification of an obstructed atomic phase has remained elusive. In this work, we present the first direct experimental evidence of such a phase in 1H-NbSe$_2$. We develop a novel method to extract the inter-orbital correlation functions from the local spectral function probed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), leveraging the orbital wave functions obtained from ab initio calculations. Applying this technique to STM images, we determine the inter-orbital correlation functions for the atomic band of 1H-NbSe$_2$ that crosses the Fermi level. Our results show that this band realizes an optimally compact obstructed atomic phase, providing the first unambiguous experimental identification of such a phase. Our approach of deconvolving the STM signal using ab initio orbital wave functions is broadly applicable to other material platforms, offering a powerful tool for exploring other electronic phases.</description>

      <title>Landauer resistivity dipole at one dimensional defect revealed via near-field photocurrent nanoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental question how to describe Ohmic resistance at the nanoscale has been answered by Landauer in his seminal picture of the so-called Landauer resistivity dipole. This picture has been theoretically well understood, however experimentally there are only few studies due to the need for a non-invasive local probe. Here we use the nanometer lateral resolution of near-field photocurrent imaging to thoroughly characterize a buried monolayer - bilayer graphene interface as an ideal one dimensional defect for the Landauer resistivity dipole. Via systematic tuning of the overall charge carrier density and the current flow we are able to detect the formation of Landauer resistivity dipoles due to charge carrier accumulation around the one dimensional defects. We found that, for Fermi energy values near the charge neutrality point (i.e. at low hole or electron doping), the photocurrent exhibits the same polarity as the applied source-drain voltage, which is consistent with changes in carrier concentration induced by the Landauer resistivity dipoles. This signature is no longer evident at higher charge carrier density in agreement with the performed numerical calculations. Photocurrent nanoscopy can thus serve as non-invasive technique to study local dissipation at hidden interfaces.</description>

      <title>Strain distribution in zincblende and wurtzite GaAs nanowires bent by a one-sided (In, Al)As stressor shell: consequences for torsion, chirality, and piezoelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a finite-strain model that is capable of describing the large deformations in bent nanowire heterostructures. The model incorporates a nonlinear strain formulation derived from the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor, coupled with an energy functional that effectively captures the lattice-mismatch-induced strain field. We use the finite element method to solve the resulting partial differential equations and extract cross-sectional maps of the full strain tensor for both zincblende and wurtzite nanowires with lattice-mismatched core and one-sided stressor shell. In either case, we show that the bending is essentially exclusively determined by $\varepsilon_{zz}$. However, the distinct difference in shear strain has important consequences with regard to both the mechanical deformation and the existence of transverse piezoelectric fields in the nanowires.</description>

      <title>Flux channeling induced nano-confinement and enhancement of microwaves imaged by Rabi oscillation mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With rapid advances in qubit technologies, techniques for localizing, modulating, and measuring RF fields and their impact on qubit performance are of the utmost importance. Here, we demonstrate that flux-channeling from a permalloy nanowire can be used to achieve localized spatial modulation of an RF field and that the modulated field can be mapped with high resolution using the Rabi oscillations of an NV center. Rabi maps reveal ~100 mm wavelength microwaves concentrated in sub-300 nm-scale regions with up to ~16$\times$ power enhancement. This modulation is robust over a 20 dBm power range and has no adverse impact on NV $T_2$ coherence time. Micromagnetic simulations confirm that the modulated field results from the nanowire's stray field through its constructive/destructive interference with the incident RF field. Our findings provide a new pathway for controlling qubits, amplifying RF signals, and mapping local fields in various on-chip RF technologies.</description>

      <title>Anomalous and Planar Hall Effects in Cobalt-Holmium Thin Films Near Magnetic Sublattice Compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metallic amorphous ferrimagnets derived from alloying 3d transition metals with 4f electron rare earths host fascinating effects of compensation between the 3d and 4f magnetic sublattices. Here, a detailed study of anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR), planar Hall effect (PHE) and anomalous Hall effect (AHE) are reported on a series of CoHo thin films over a wide field temperature phase space. Close to magnetic compensation temperature, the AHE loops show a double sign reversal and signatures of spin flop transition at higher fields. The AMR and PHE also display strong deviations from the classical angular dependence seen in soft ferromagnets like permalloy as the angle between in-plane current and magnetic field is scanned from 0 to 360 degrees. It is argued that the non zero orbital angular momentum of Ho ions in the lattice and stabilization of bubble domains below magnetic saturation may be responsible for such features. Direct imaging of magnetic textures with X ray photoelectron microscopy shows formation of stripe domain patterns in the regime of sublattice compensation. Such stripes are likely to transform into magnetic bubbles before full saturation is reached in a large magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Optical conductivity of the topologically-nontrivial MXenes, Mo$_2$HfC$_2$O$_2$ and W$_2$HfC$_2$O$_2$: first-principles calculation and effective model analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical conductivity and the relevant electronic excitation processes are investigated in topologically-nontrivial MXenes, Mo$_2$HfC$_2$O$_2$ and W$_2$HfC$_2$O$_2$, utilizing first-principles calculation and effective model analysis. The numerical calculation based on the first-principles band structure reveals the presence of several characteristic features in the spectrum of optical conductivity as a function of photon energy. The drastic dependence on the photon polarization angle is also presented in terms of apparent features. In this paper, an effective model is also generated referring to the crystal symmetries and applied to reveal the microscopic origin of the characteristics. Then, it is shown that some features are strongly related to parity inversion between the conduction and valence bands, the key signature in electronic structures of topologically nontrivial insulators.</description>

      <title>Approaching optimal microwave-acoustic transduction on lithium niobate using SQUID arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic devices exploiting acoustic vibrations are ubiquitous in classical and quantum technologies. Central to these devices is the transducer, which enables the exchange of signals between electrical and acoustic networks. Among the various transduction mechanisms, piezoelectricity remains the most widely used. However, conventional piezoelectric transducers are limited to either small efficiencies or narrow bandwidths and they typically operate at fixed frequency. These limitations restrict their utility in many applications. Here we propose and demonstrate a robust strategy to realize piezoelectric microwave-acoustic transduction close to the maximal efficiency-bandwidth product of lithium niobate. We use SQUID arrays to transform the large complex impedance of wide-band interdigital transducers into 50 $\Omega$ and demonstrate unprecedented efficiency$\times$bandwidth $\approx$ 440 MHz, with a maximum efficiency of 62% at 5.7 GHz. Moreover, leveraging the flux dependence of SQUIDs, we realize transducers with in-situ tunability across nearly an octave around 5.5 GHz. Our transducer can be readily connected to other superconducting quantum devices, with applications in microwave-to-optics conversion schemes, quantum-limited phonon detection, or acoustic spectroscopy in the 4-8 GHz band.</description>

      <title>Geometric effects in the Dyakonov-Shur theory of Teraherz photodetection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear resonances of plasma waves in field-effect transitors enable a well-known photodetection mechanism, first introduced by Dyakonov and Shur in the Nineties, especially suited to the Terahertz (THz) frequency range. Theoretical analyses of the mechanism always assume that the gate of the transistor, which is coupled to the antenna receiving the THz signal, is as long as the channel itself, at odds with typical experimental devices, where short gates are usually employed, e.g. due to fabrication constraints. In this work we overcome this limitation and provide a complete theory of Dyakonov--Shur photodetection in the presence of short gates. We develop our theory in such a general fashion that allows us to also treat the case in which multiple gates are present. We find that a sub-optimal positioning of the gates can substantially decrease the detection efficiency of the device and provide a compact analytical formula to quickly estimate the optimal gate position.</description>

      <title>Magnetic injection photocurrents in valley polarized states of twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene displays a complex phase diagram as a function of flat band filling, featuring compressibility cascade transitions and a variety of competing ground states with broken spin, valley and point group symmetries. Recent THz photocurrent spectroscopy experiments have shown a dependence on the filling which is not consistent with the simplest cascade picture of sequential filling of equivalent flat bands. In this work, we show that when time-reversal symmetry is broken due to valley polarization, a magnetic injection photocurrent develops which can be used to distinguish different spin-valley polarization scenarios. Using the topological heavy fermion model we compute both shift and injection currents as a function of filling and argue that current experiments can be used to determine the spontaneous valley polarization.</description>

      <title>Exact Parent Hamiltonians for All Landau Level States in a Half-flux Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing topological flat bands with tailored single-particle Hilbert spaces is a critical step toward exploring many-body phases, such as those featuring anyonic excitations. One prominent example is the Kapit-Mueller model, a variant of the Harper-Hofstadter model that stabilizes lattice analogs of the lowest Landau level states. The Kapit-Mueller model is constructed based on the Poisson summation rule, an exact lattice sum rule for coherent states. In this work, we consider higher Landau-level generalizations of the Poisson summation rule, from which we derive families of parent Hamiltonians on a half-flux lattice which have exact flat bands whose flatband wavefunctions are lattice version of higher Landau level states. Focusing on generic Bravais lattices with only translation and inversion symmetries, we discuss how these symmetries enforced gaplessness and singular points for odd Landau level series, and how to achieve fully gapped parent Hamiltonians by mixing even and odd series. Our model points to a large class of tight-binding models with suitable energetic and quantum geometries that are potentially useful for realizing non-Abelian fractionalized states when interactions are included. The model exhibits fast decay hopping amplitudes, making it potentially realizable with neutral atoms in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Variational wavefunctions for fractional topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) host bands with opposite Chern number for the two spin species and could thus be host for fractional topological insulator states. In multicomponent quantum Hall systems, where the spins have equal Chern number, the resulting topological liquid states can be well modeled by trial wavefunctions such as the Halperin $(lmn)$ wavefunctions. These wavefunctions are exact zero energy states of certain short-range (pseudopotential) Hamiltonians. However, we show that such a construction fails in the case where the Chern numbers of the two spins are opposite, since the electrons with opposite Chern number cannot avoid one another. This underlines the importance of suppressing the short-range interspin Coulomb repulsion in order to realize fractional topological insulators in twisted TMDs. We introduce a trial wavefunction for the opposite Chern number Landau levels for filling factor $\nu=\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{3}$ in terms of pairing of composite fermions and show that it has good overlaps with the exact diagonalization ground state when the short-range Coulomb repulsion is sufficiently softened.</description>

      <title>High-frequency readout free from transmon multi-excitation resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computation will rely on quantum error correction to counteract decoherence. Successfully implementing an error correction protocol requires the fidelity of qubit operations to be well-above error correction thresholds. In superconducting quantum computers, measurement of the qubit state remains the lowest-fidelity operation. For the transmon, a prototypical superconducting qubit, measurement is carried out by scattering a microwave tone off the qubit. Conventionally, the frequency of this tone is of the same order as the transmon frequency. The measurement fidelity in this approach is limited by multi-excitation resonances in the transmon spectrum which are activated at high readout power. These resonances excite the qubit outside of the computational basis, violating the desired quantum non-demolition character of the measurement. Here, we find that strongly detuning the readout frequency from that of the transmon exponentially suppresses the strength of spurious multi-excitation resonances. By increasing the readout frequency up to twelve times the transmon frequency, we achieve a quantum non-demolition measurement fidelity of 99.93% with a residual probability of leakage to non-computational states of only 0.02%.</description>

      <title>Predicting Fundamental Gaps of Chromium-Based 2D Materials Using GW Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise and accurate predictions of the two-dimensional (2D) material's fundamental gap are crucial for next-generation flexible electronic and photonic devices. We, therefore, evaluated the predictivity of the GW approach in its several variants built on various density functional theory (DFT) inputs. We identified reasons for significant discrepancies between generalized gradient approximation and hybrid DFT results for intricate cases of 2D materials containing chromium and evaluated the diverse behavior of subsequent quasiparticle corrections. We examined the impact of omitted vertex corrections using the more computationally intensive quasiparticle self-consistent QPGW and partially self-consistent QPGW$_0$ methodologies. We observed consistent trends across Cr-based and other 2D materials compared by advanced GW calculations, suggesting that single-shot G$_0$W$_0$@PBE can provide reasonable estimates of fundamental gaps when applied with caution. While this approach shows promise for a variety of 2D materials, including complicated antiferromagnetic chromium-based transition metal carbides (MXenes), further research is required to validate its reliability for strongly correlated systems. In contrast, the G$_0$W$_0$@HSE06 approach may strongly overestimate gaps in some cases.</description>

      <title>Absence of diode effect in chiral type-I superconductor NbGe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry elegantly governs the fundamental properties and derived functionalities of condensed matter. For instance, realizing the superconducting diode effect (SDE) demands breaking space-inversion and time-reversal symmetries simultaneously. Although the SDE is widely observed in various platforms, its underlying mechanism remains debated, particularly regarding the role of vortices. Here, we systematically investigate the nonreciprocal transport in the chiral type-I superconductor NbGe2. Moreover, we induce type-II superconductivity with elevated superconducting critical temperature on the artificial surface by focused ion beam irradiation, enabling control over vortex dynamics in NbGe2 devices. Strikingly, we observe negligible diode efficiency (Q &lt; 2%) at low magnetic fields, which rises significantly to Q ~ 50% at high magnetic fields, coinciding with an abrupt increase in vortex creep rate when the superconductivity of NbGe2 bulk is suppressed. These results unambiguously highlight the critical role of vortex dynamics in the SDE, in addition to the established symmetry rules.</description>

      <title>Chiral Dissociation of Bound Photon Pairs for a Non-Hermitian Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the bound states of interacting photons propagating in a waveguide chirally coupled to an array of atoms. We demonstrate that the bound photon pairs can concentrate at the edge of the array and link this to the non-Hermitian skin effect. Unlike tight-binding non-Hermitian setups, the bound states in the waveguide-coupled array exhibit infinite radiative lifetimes when the array has an infinite size. However, in a finite array, non-Hermiticity and localization of bound pairs emerge due to their chiral dissociation into scattering states. Counterintuitively, when the photons are preferentially emitted to the right, the bound pairs are localized at the left edge of the array and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Which chromium-sulfur compounds exist as 2D material?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) chromium-sulfides are synthesized by molecular beam epitaxy using graphene as a substrate. Structure characterization by employing scanning tunneling microscopy and low energy electron diffraction indicates that there are two 2D phases, Cr$_2$S$_3$-2D and Cr$_{2\frac{2}{3}}$S$_4$-2D, which have not been reported before. Cr$_{2\frac{2}{3}}$S$_4$-2D is related to bulk Cr$_5$S$_6$, but thinner than a bulk unit cell. For Cr$_2$S$_3$-2D, an even thinner material, no bulk counterpart exists. Both 2D materials are found to be structurally stable under ambient conditions and exhibit interesting electronic properties. Extensive first-principles calculations provide further insight into the electronic structure of these systems and indicate that they should be magnetic. Surprisingly, CrS$_2$ recently reported from density functional theory calculations and experiments could not be fabricated.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectricity in layered bismuth oxide down to 1 nanometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic-scale ferroelectrics are of great interest for high-density electronics, particularly field-effect transistors, low-power logic, and nonvolatile memories. We devised a film with a layered structure of bismuth oxide that can stabilize the ferroelectric state down to 1 nanometer through samarium bondage. This film can be grown on a variety of substrates with a cost-effective chemical solution deposition. We observed a standard ferroelectric hysteresis loop down to a thickness of ~1 nanometer. The thin films with thicknesses that range from 1 to 4.56 nanometers possess a relatively large remanent polarization from 17 to 50 microcoulombs per square centimeter. We verified the structure with first-principles calculations, which also pointed to the material being a lone pair-driven ferroelectric material. The structure design of the ultrathin ferroelectric films has great potential for the manufacturing of atomic-scale electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional microwave-optical conversion using an integrated barium-titanate transducer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient, low-noise, high-bandwidth transduction between optical and microwave photons is key to long-range quantum communication between distant superconducting quantum processors. Recent demonstrations of microwave-optical tranduction using the broadband direct electro-optic (Pockels) effect in optical thin films made of AlN or LiNbO$_3$ have shown promise. Due to the quadratic scaling of transduction efficiency with the electro-optic coefficient, material classes with stronger Pockels effects, such as the perovskite titanates BaTiO$_3$ or SrTiO$_3$, may unlock new performance regimes for future transducers. However, these materials require adapted designs and fabrication approaches due to their nonlinear and, in some cases, hysteretic electro-optic response, as well as limited process compatibility. Here, we engineer an on-chip, triply resonant transducer comprising low-loss BaTiO$_3$-on-SiO$_2$ waveguides monolithically integrated with a superconducting microwave resonator made of Nb. Exploiting the bias-induced Pockels effect of BaTiO$_3$, we demonstrate bidirectional microwave-optical transduction at millikelvin temperatures and total off-chip efficiencies reaching $1\times10^{-6}$ in pulsed operation. We establish a device concept permitting in-situ poling of the ferroelectric material without introducing excess microwave loss and tuning of the optical system without sacrificing microwave-optical overlap. Using a fully subtractive process, we fabricate Nb air bridges for crossings of conductors and both air- and oxide-clad optical waveguides. We investigate optically-induced heating through pulsed optical pumping, revealing fast thermalization and quasiparticle resilience of the microwave resonator. Our transducer concept is applicable to other materials with a large bias-induced Pockels effect and paves the way for efficient, low-power quantum interconnects.</description>

      <title>Topological origin of non-Hermitian skin effect in higher dimensions and uniform spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12022v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect is an iconic phenomenon characterized by the aggregation of eigenstates near the system boundaries in non-Hermitian systems. While extensively studied in one dimension, understanding the skin effect and extending the non-Bloch band theory to higher dimensions encounters a formidable challenge, primarily due to infinite lattice geometries or open boundary conditions. This work adopts a point-gap perspective and unveils that non-Hermitian skin effect in all spatial dimensions originates from point gaps. We introduce the concept of uniform spectra and reveal that regardless of lattice geometry, their energy spectra are universally given by the uniform spectra, even though their manifestations of skin modes may differ. Building on the uniform spectra, we demonstrate how to account for the skin effect with generic lattice cuts and establish the connections of skin modes across different geometric shapes via momentum-basis transformations. Our findings highlight the pivotal roles point gaps play, offering a unified understanding of the topological origin of non-Hermitian skin effect in all dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Andreev modes that propagate along a transparent Josephson junction have a perfect transmission at the point where three junctions meet. The chirality and the number of quantized transmission channels is determined by the topology of the Fermi surface and the vorticity of the superconducting phase differences at the trijunction. We explain this chiral adiabatic transmission (CAT) as a consequence of the adiabatic evolution of the scattering modes both in momentum and real space. The dispersion relation of the junction then separates the scattering trajectories by introducing inaccesible regions of phase space. We expect that CAT is observable in nonlocal conductance and thermal transport measurements. Furthermore, because it does not rely on particle-hole symmetry, CAT is also possible to observe directly in metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Evidence of enhanced thermopower from emergent local moments in flatbands of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments on magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBLG) indicate an unusual coexistence of heavy and light electrons, a characteristic of heavy-fermion physics. But a global transport measurement showing clear signatures of strong correlations like local moments (LM) arising from the flatbands is missing. Utilizing thermopower ($V_{Th}$) as a sensitive probe for measuring entropy ($S$), we have extensively studied $V_{Th}$ of MATBLG with filling ($\nu$), temperature ($T$) and magnetic field ($B$), and unveiled the presence of LM through their impact on $S$. While at high $T$, the behavior of $V_{Th}$ and resistance ($R$) are related by the Mott formula, it deviates at lower $T$. Below 120K apart from the Dirac point and full band filling, the resistance exhibits prominent peaks at integer fillings. The $V_{Th}$ however, remains featureless and symmetric across the DP with opposite signs. This disparity implies the dominance of different kinds of carriers in $V_{Th}$ and $R$. The $V_{Th}$ has additional sign changes at $\nu_{cross} \sim \pm 1$. The locations of $\nu_{cross}$ do not change with temperature from $5-60K$. For heavy and light band electrons, it can be shown that the doping profile of the $V_{Th}$, and hence $\nu_{cross}$ is highly sensitive to $T$, and therefore solely the contribution from band electrons does not explain the $V_{Th}$ data. Our data is consistent with the dominant contribution arising from the $S$ of the LMs. Additionally, we have investigated the effect of $B$ on the $V_{Th}$, both $B_{\parallel}$ and $B_{\perp}$ showing 30 and 50$\%$ reduction, respectively, and can be attributed to the partial polarization of the LMs (spin/valley), resulting in decreased $S$. Our $V_{Th}$ results highlight the contribution from LMs arising from flatbands, distinct from the band contributions of heavy and light fermions to the resistivity in MATBLG.</description>

      <title>Stoner ferromagnetism in low-angle twisted bilayer graphene at three-quarters filling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of the magnetic properties exhibited by twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) systems with small twist angles, where the appearance of flat minibands strongly enhances electron-electron interaction effects. We show that, at three-quarters filling of the conduction miniband, the Stoner mechanism induces a ferromagnetic polarization in the AA-stacking regions, which aligns with recent experimental observations. Our approach models the electronic properties by a tight-binding Hamiltonian combined with a Hubbard mean-field interaction term. We employ a real-space recursion technique to self-consistently calculate the system's local density of states and use our method to investigate the magnetic properties of small-angle TBG at three-quarters filling. The recursion method's $O({\cal N})$ efficiency makes it possible to address extremely large superlattices through a full real-space approach. We validate our procedure by comparing it with mean-field momentum-space calculations from the literature, which identify a magnetic phase in charge-neutral TBGs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The continuous improvement of fabrication techniques and high-quality semiconductor-superconductor interfaces allowed for unprecedented tunability of Josephson junction arrays (JJA), making them a promising candidate for analog quantum simulations of many-body phenomena. While most experimental proposals so far focused on quantum simulations of ensembles of two-level systems, the possibility of tuning the current-phase relation beyond the sinusoidal regime paves the way for studying statistical physics models with larger local Hilbert spaces. Here, we investigate a particular JJA architecture that can be mapped into a $\mathbb{Z}_3$ clock model. Through matrix-product-states simulations and bosonization analysis, we show that few experimentally accessible control parameters allow for the exploration of the rich phase diagrams of the associated low-energy field theories. Our results expand the horizon for analog quantum simulations with JJAs towards models that can not be efficiently captured with qubit architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explicit interactions, \textit{e.g.}, dipolar and exchange couplings, usually govern magnetization dynamics. Some interactions may be hidden from the global crystal symmetry. We report that in a large class of \textit{uniaxial} antiferromagnets, a \textit{hidden} Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction with retaining global inversion symmetry quenches the spin of magnon along the N\'eel vector ${\bf n}$, thus forbidding its angular-momentum flow. Some magnon spins, termed ``nodal" and ``corner" spins, survive when they distribute \textit{singularly} at the hot spots, i.e., high-symmetric degeneracy points in the Brillouin zone, and are protected by crystal symmetries. The biased magnetic field along ${\bf n}$ broadens such distributions, allowing bulk spin transport with unique signatures in the magnetic field and temperature dependencies. This explains recent experiments and highlights the role of hidden interaction.</description>

Abstract: We study a two-dimensional topological insulator in the presence of a static non-uniform gravitational field, which mimics the variations in the temperature distribution. We derive an effective boundary free energy functional for the gravitational field and show that, in contrast to the case of massive Dirac fermions, the addition of a Newtonian mass term significantly modifies the quantum anomalous behavior of the system. A non-zero bulk thermal current appears, which violates the Wiedemann-Franz law. The systematic approach we develop to calculate the contribution of edge states to thermal Hall conductivity and energy magnetization can easily be extended to other models.</description>

Abstract: We study multiplicative Chern insulators (MCIs) as canonical examples of multiplicative topological phases of matter. Constructing the MCI Bloch Hamiltonian as a symmetry-protected tensor product of two topologically non-trivial parent Chern insulators (CIs), we study two-dimensional (2D) MCIs and introduce 3D mixed MCIs, constructed by requiring the two 2D parent Hamiltonians share only one momentum component. We study the 2D MCI response to time reversal symmetric flux insertion, observing a $4\pi$ Aharonov-Bohm effect, relating these topological states to fractional quantum Hall states via the effective field theory of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. As part of this response, we observe evidence of quantisation of a proposed topological invariant for compactified many-body states, to a rational number, suggesting higher-dimensional topology may also be relevant. Finally, we study effects of bulk perturbations breaking the symmetry-protected tensor product structure of the child Hamiltonian, finding the MCI evolves adiabatically into a topological skyrmion phase.</description>

      <title>Fate of Bosonic Topological Edge Modes in the Presence of Many-Body Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many magnetic materials are predicted to exhibit bosonic topological edge modes in their excitation spectra, because of the nontrivial topology of their magnon, triplon, or other quasi-particle band structures. However, there is a discrepancy between theory prediction and experimental observation, which suggests some underlying mechanism that intrinsically suppresses the expected experimental signatures, like the thermal Hall current. Many-body interactions that are not accounted for in the non-interacting quasi-particle picture are most often identified as the reason for the absence of the topological edge modes. Here we report persistent bosonic edge modes at the boundaries of a ladder quantum paramagnet with gapped triplon excitations in the presence of the full many-body interaction. We use tensor network methods to resolve topological edge modes in the time-dependent spin-spin correlations and the dynamical structure factor, which is directly accessible experimentally. We further show that signatures of these edge modes survive even when the non-interacting quasi-particle theory breaks down, discuss the topological phase diagram of the model, demonstrate the fractionalization of its low-lying excitations, and propose potential material candidates.</description>

      <title>Identification of mechanisms of magnetic transitions using an efficient method for converging on first order saddle points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A method for locating first order saddle points on the energy surface of a magnetic system is described and several applications presented where the mechanism of various magnetic transitions is identified. The starting point for the iterative search algorithm can be anywhere, even close to a local energy minimum representing an initial state of the system, and the final state need not be specified. Convergence on a saddle point is obtained by inverting the component of the gradient along the minimum mode, thereby effectively transforming the neighbourhood of the saddle point to that of a local minimum. The method requires only the lowest two eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of the Hessian of the system's energy and they are found using a quasi-Newton limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno solver for the minimization of the Rayleigh quotient without explicit evaluation of the Hessian. The method is applicable to large systems as the computational effort scales linearly with system size. Applications are presented to transitions in systems that reveal significant complexity of co-existing magnetic states, such as skyrmions, skyrmion bags, skyrmion tubes, chiral bobbers, and globules. When combined with rate theory within the harmonic approximation, the method can be used for simulations of the long timescale dynamics of complex magnetic systems characterized by multiple metastable states.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Decoupling of Single Impurity Anderson Model through Auxiliary Majorana Fermions</title>

Abstract: We present a method to study the time evolution of the single impurity Anderson model which exploits a mean field decoupling of the interacting impurity and the non-interacting bath (in form of a chain). This is achieved by the introduction of a pair of auxiliary Majorana fermions between the impurity and the chain. After decoupling, we obtain a self-consistent set of equations for the impurity and chain. First, we study the behavior of the system in equilibrium at zero temperature. We obtain a phase transition as a function of the interaction at the impurity and the coupling between the impurity and the chain between the Kondo regime, where the mean field parameters are zero and, hence, we have a well-defined spin at the impurity, to a phase where mean field parameters acquire finite values leading to a screening of the impurity spin by conduction bath electrons. In the latter case, we observe charge and spin fluctuations at the impurity site. Starting from this equilibrium ground state at zero temperature we quench in the interaction strength at the impurity and/or the hybridization strength between the impurity and the chain and study the time evolution of the system. We find that for quenches to weak to intermediate coupling the system converges to the equilibrium state defined by the final set of parameters after the quench. We analyze the oscillation frequency and as well as the thermalization rate during this quench. A quench to a strong interaction value results in persistent oscillations and a trapping of the system in a non-thermal state. We speculate that these two regimes of different long-time behavior are separated by a dynamical phase transition.</description>

      <title>Density matrix renormalization group study of quantum-geometry-facilitated pair density wave order</title>

Abstract: Understanding the formation of novel pair density waves (PDWs) in strongly correlated electronic systems remains challenging. Recent mean-field studies suggest that PDW phases may arise in strong-coupling multiband superconductors by virtue of the quantum geometric properties of paired electrons. However, scrutiny through sophisticated many-body calculations has been lacking. Employing large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations, we obtain in the strong-coupling regime the phase diagram as a function of doping concentration and a tuning interaction parameter for a simple two-orbital model that incorporates quantum geometric effects. The phase diagram reveals a robust PDW phase spanning a broad range of parameters, characterized by a Luttinger parameter $K_{sc} \sim 0.3$ and the absence of coexisting competing spin or charge density wave orders. The observed pairing field configuration aligns with the phenomenological understanding that quantum geometry can promote PDW formation. Our study provides the most compelling numerical evidence to date for quantum-geometry-facilitated intrinsic PDW order in strongly correlated systems, paving the way for further exploration of novel PDW orders and quantum geometric effects in such systems.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Behavior of High-Permittivity Gate Dielectrics: The Impact of the Atomic Layer Deposition Temperature and the Lithographic Patterning Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dielectrics featuring a high relative permittivity, i.e., high-k dielectrics, have become the standard insulators in gate architectures, enhancing the electrical performance of both room temperature and cryogenic electronics. This study delves into the cryogenic (3 K) performance of high-k dielectrics commonly used as gate insulators. We fabricated Al2O3 and HfO2 layers via Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) and we extrapolated relative permittivity (k) and dielectric strength (E_BD) from AC (100 Hz to 100 kHz) and DC measurements on metal-insulator-metal capacitors. Our findings reveal a strong dependence of HfO2 cryogenic performance on the ALD growth temperature, while the latter shows a negligible impact on Al2O3. We estimated a ~9 % and ~14 % reduction of the relative permittivity of HfO2 and Al2O3, respectively, from 300 K to 3 K. Additionally, we designed and fabricated Al2O3/HfO2 bilayers and we checked their properties at cryogenic temperatures. The study also investigates the impact of the patterning method, namely, UV or electron-beam lithography (acceleration voltage of 10, 20, or 30 kV), on the high-k dielectric properties.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19565v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by phenomenology of myriad recently-identified topologically non-trivial phases of matter, we introduce effective field theories (EFTs) for the quantum skyrmion Hall effect (QSkHE). We employ a single, unifying generalisation for this purpose: in essence, a lowest Landau level projection defining a non-commutative, fuzzy sphere with position coordinates proportional to SU(2) generators of matrix representation size $N\times N$, may host an intrinsically 2+1 dimensional, topologically non-trivial many-body state for small $N$ as well as large $N$. That is, isospin degrees of freedom associated with a matrix Lie algebra with $N \times N$ generators potentially encode some finite number of spatial dimensions for $N\ge 2$, a regime in which isospin has previously been treated as a label. This statement extends to more general $p$-branes subjected to severe fuzzification as well as membranes. As a consequence of this generalisation, systems with $d$ Cartesian spatial coordinates and isospin degrees of freedom encoding an additional $\delta$ fuzzy coset space coordinates can realise topologically non-trivial states of intrinsic dimensionality up to $d$+$\delta$+1. We therefore identify gauge theories with extra fuzzy dimensions generalised to retain dependence upon gauge fields over fuzzy coset spaces even for severe fuzzification (small $N$), as EFTs for the QSkHE. We furthermore generalise these EFTs to space manifolds with local product structure exploiting the dimensional hierarchy of (fuzzy) spheres. For this purpose, we introduce methods of anisotropic fuzzification and propose formulating topological invariants on fuzzy coset spaces as artifacts of projecting matrix Lie algebras to occupied subspaces. Importantly, we focus on phenomenology indicating the 2+1 D SU(2) gauge theory should be generalised using this machinery, and serves as a minimal EFT of the QSkHE.</description>
