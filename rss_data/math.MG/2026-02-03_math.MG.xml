      <title>A minimal regularity for the area formula in the Engel group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the upper blow-up theorem in the Engel group holds for $C^1$ submanifolds. Combining this result with the known negligibility of the singular set, we obtain an integral representation of the spherical measure for all surfaces of class $C^{1,\alpha}$ in the Engel group. A new and central aspect of our method is the suitable use of Stokes' theorem to prove the upper blow-up, which relies on the special algebraic structure of left-invariant forms in the Engel group. Some general tools are also introduced to establish area formulas in arbitrary stratified group.</description>

      <title>Pullback theorem and rigidity for Sobolev mappings on Carnot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the pullback theorem of Sobolev mappings on Carnot groups via mollification of mappings. With the pullback theorem we extend the classical result proved by Xiangdong Xie : Rigidity of Sobolev mappings $W^{1,p}(G_1;G_2)$ for $p&gt;\nu$, to the case $p&lt;\nu$, where $\nu$ is the homogeneous dimension of $G_1$. Therefore, some conclusions about continuity of Sobolev mappings on Carnot groups for $p&lt;\nu$ are found. And also, the determine of horizontal gradient $D_Hf$ is invariant under the motion related to higher layer left-invariant vector fields. At last, we find a equivalent definition of quasiconformal mappings with lower integrability $dim(g^{[1]})&lt;p&lt;\nu$.</description>

      <title>Equilibria in non-Euclidean geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, extending the work of Gal'perin (Comm. Math. Phys. 154: 63-84, 1993), we investigate generalizations of the concepts of centroids and static equilibrium points of a convex body in spherical, hyperbolic and normed spaces. In addition, we examine the minimum number of equilibrium points a $2$- or $3$-dimensional convex body can have in these spaces. In particular, we show that every plane convex body in any of these spaces has at least four equilibrium points, and that there are mono-monostatic convex bodies in $3$-dimensional spherical, hyperbolic, and certain normed spaces. Our results are generalizations of results of Domokos, Papadopoulos and Ruina (J. Elasticity 36: 59-66, 1994), and V\'arkonyi and Domokos (J. Nonlinear Sci. 16: 255-281, 2006) for convex bodies in Euclidean space.</description>

      <title>Grassmannian spines, projection closure operators, and diametric sweeps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For positive integers $r&lt;d&lt;n$ equip the powerset $2^{\mathbb{G}(r,V)}$ of the $r$-plane Grassmannian of an $n$-dimensional Hilbert space with the closure operator attaching to a set of $r$-planes the smallest superset which along with two $r$-planes also contains all $r$-dimensional orthogonal projections of one onto any $d$-plane containing the other. In the regime $2r\le d$ the classification of closed subsets of $\mathbb{G}(r,V)$ rigidifies, these being precisely the sets of $r$-planes containing a fixed $(\le r)$-plane. The result generalizes its $(r,d,n)=(1,2,3)$ instance, of use in recent geometric-rigidity results motivated by matrix preserver problems.
  An auxiliary result classifies the balls centered at $p_0\in \mathbb{R^d}$ as the compact fixed points of the dynamical system transforming $K\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ into its $p_0$-based diametric sweep: the union of all diameter-$p_0p$ balls for $p\in K$.</description>

      <title>On Saxe's theorems about the complexity of the Distance Geometry Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1979, James B.~Saxe published an extended summary on the complexity of the Distance Geometry Problem in the proceedings of the 17th Allerton Conference. Many of the proofs in his paper are sketches, and even the whole proofs do not have all the details. In this paper we provide a commentary to Saxe's results and hopefully more understandable versions thereof.</description>

      <title>Topological Residual Asymmetry for Bivariate Causal Direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inferring causal direction from purely observational bivariate data is fragile: many methods commit to a direction even in ambiguous or near non-identifiable regimes. We propose Topological Residual Asymmetry (TRA), a geometry-based criterion for additive-noise models. TRA compares the shapes of two cross-fitted regressor-residual clouds after rank-based copula standardization: in the correct direction, residuals are approximately independent, producing a two-dimensional bulk, while in the reverse direction -- especially under low noise -- the cloud concentrates near a one-dimensional tube. We quantify this bulk-tube contrast using a 0D persistent-homology functional, computed efficiently from Euclidean MST edge-length profiles. We prove consistency in a triangular-array small-noise regime, extend the method to fixed noise via a binned variant (TRA-s), and introduce TRA-C, a confounding-aware abstention rule calibrated by a Gaussian-copula plug-in bootstrap. Extensive experiments across many challenging synthetic and real-data scenarios demonstrate the method's superiority.</description>

      <title>Curvature Preserving Fractal Interpolation Functions: A Hybrid Geometric Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractal interpolation functions (FIFs) generated using iterated function systems (IFS) provide a powerful framework for modeling self-similar and irregular data, yet traditional constructions often neglect geometric fidelity such as curvature. In this paper, we introduce a curvature-preserving variant of FIFs built upon a classical cubic spline interpolant. We define a curvature-aware iterated function system (IFS) with parameters optimized via a penalty-based approach to minimize deviation from the curvature of the classical spline. Theoretical conditions for interpolation and curvature approximation are derived. We compare the curvature of the proposed FIF with that of the classical cubic spline and discrete data curvature across multiple examples. Our method achieves both data interpolation and shape fidelity, preserving curvature more accurately than standard splines. The approach has potential applications in geometric modeling, computer graphics, and scientific data interpolation.</description>

      <title>Gromov hyperbolic domains in Minkowski space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate domains in Minkowski space that are Gromov hyperbolic with respect to a Kobayashi-like metric introduced by Markowitz in the 1980s. For convex, future complete domains, Gromov hyperbolicity is shown to be equivalent to the stable acausality of the boundary. An analogous characterization is obtained for bounded, convex, causally convex domains in terms of the stable acausality of their Geroch--Kronheimer--Penrose causal boundaries. Our approach is based on explicit comparisons between the Markowitz metric, the Sormani--Vega null distance and the quasi-hyperbolic metric. We also make use of dynamical arguments similar to those of Benoist and Zimmer in projective and complex geometry. Finally, we compare the Markowitz metric to the Hilbert metric.</description>

Abstract: Let us consider the set $\Omega (\triangle ABC)$ of all tetrahedra $ABCD$ with a given non-degenerate base $ABC$ in $\mathbb{E}^3$ and $D$ lying outside the plane $ABC$. Let us denote by $\Sigma(\triangle ABC)$ the set $\left\{\Bigl(\cos \overline{\alpha},\cos \overline{\beta},\cos \overline{\gamma} \Bigr)\in \mathbb{R}^3\,|\, ABCD \in \Omega (\triangle ABC)\right\}$, where $\overline{\alpha}=\angle BDC$, $\overline{\beta}=\angle ADC$, and $\overline{\gamma}=\angle ADB$. The paper is devoted to the problem of determining of the closure of $\Sigma(\triangle ABC)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and its boundary.</description>

      <title>Semicontinuity of capacity under pointed intrinsic flat convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.09732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of the capacity of a compact set in $\mathbb R^n$ generalizes readily to noncompact Riemannian manifolds and, with more substantial work, to metric spaces (where multiple natural definitions of capacity are possible). Motivated by analytic and geometric considerations, and in particular Jauregui's definition of capacity-volume mass and Jauregui and Lee's results on the lower semicontinuity of the ADM mass and Huisken's isoperimetric mass, we investigate how the capacity functional behaves when the background spaces vary. Specifically, we allow the background spaces to consist of a sequence of local integral current spaces converging in the pointed Sormani--Wenger intrinsic flat sense. For the case of volume-preserving ($\mathcal{VF}$) convergence, we prove two theorems that demonstrate an upper semicontinuity phenomenon for the capacity: one version is for balls of a fixed radius centered about converging points; the other is for Lipschitz sublevel sets. Our approach is motivated by Portegies' investigation of the semicontinuity of eigenvalues under $\mathcal{VF}$ convergence. We include examples to show the semicontinuity may be strict, and that the volume-preserving hypothesis is necessary. Finally, there is a discussion on how capacity and our results may be used towards understanding the general relativistic total mass in non-smooth settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.17150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We say that a subset $M$ of $\mathbb R^n$ is exponentially Ramsey if there are $\epsilon&gt;0$ and $n_0$ such that $\chi(\mathbb R^n,M)\ge(1+\epsilon)^n$ for any $n&gt;n_0$, where $\chi(\mathbb R^n,M)$ stands for the minimum number of colors in a coloring of $\mathbb R^n$ such that no copy of $M$ is monochromatic. One important result in Euclidean Ramsey theory is due to Frankl and R\"odl, and states the following (under some mild extra conditions): if both $N_1$ and $N_2$ are exponentially Ramsey then so is $N_1\times N_2$. Applied several times to two-point sets, this result implies that any subset of a `hyperrectangle' is exponentially Ramsey.
  However, generally, such `embeddings' result in very inefficient bounds on the aforementioned $\epsilon$. In this paper, we present another way of combining exponentially Ramsey sets, which gives much better estimates in some important cases. In particular, we show that the chromatic number of $\mathbb R^n$ with a forbidden equilateral triangle satisfies $\chi(\mathbb R^n,\triangle)\ge\big(1.0742...+o(1)\big)^n$, greatly improving upon the previous constant $1.0144$. We also obtain similar strong results for regular simplices of larger dimensions, as well as for related geometric Ramsey-type questions in Manhattan norm.
  We then show that the same technique implies several interesting corollaries in other combinatorial problems. In particular, we give an explicit upper bound on the size of a family $\mathcal F\subset2^{[n]}$ that contains no weak $k$-sunflowers, i.e. no collection of $k$ sets with pairwise intersections of the same size. This bound improves upon previously known results for all $k\ge4$. Finally, we also present a simple deduction of the (other) celebrated Frankl--R\"odl theorem from an earlier result of Frankl and Wilson. It gives probably the shortest known proof of Frankl and R\"odl result with the most efficient bounds.</description>

      <title>Continuity of the solution map for hyperbolic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperbolic polynomials are monic real-rooted polynomials. By Bronshtein's theorem, the increasingly ordered roots of a hyperbolic polynomial of degree $d$ with $C^{d-1,1}$ coefficients are locally Lipschitz and the solution map "coefficients-to-roots" is bounded. We prove continuity of this solution map from hyperbolic polynomials of degree $d$ with $C^d$ coefficients to their increasingly ordered roots with respect to the $C^d$ structure on the source space and the Sobolev $W^{1,q}$ structure, for all $1 \le q&lt;\infty$, on the target space. Continuity fails for $q=\infty$. As a consequence, we obtain continuity of the local surface area of the roots as well as local lower semicontinuity of the area of the zero sets of hyperbolic polynomials. We also discuss applications for the eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices and singular values.</description>

      <title>A refinement of the Sylvester problem: Probabilities of combinatorial types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X_1,\ldots, X_{d+2}$ be random points in $\mathbb R^d$. The classical Sylvester problem asks to determine the probability that the convex hull of these points, denoted by $P:= [X_1,\ldots, X_{d+2}]$, is a simplex. In the present paper, we study a refined version of this problem which asks to determine the probability that $P$ has a given combinatorial type. It is known that there are $\lfloor d/2\rfloor+1$ possible combinatorial types of simplicial $d$-dimensional polytopes with at most $d+2$ vertices. These types are denoted by $T_0^d, T_1^d, \ldots, T_{\lfloor d/2 \rfloor}^d$, where $T_0^d$ is a simplex with $d+1$ vertices, while the remaining types have exactly $d+2$ vertices. Our aim is thus to compute the probability $$ p_{d,m} := \mathbb P[P \text{ is of type } T_{m}^d], \qquad m\in \{0,1,\ldots, \lfloor d/2 \rfloor\}. $$ The classical Sylvester problem corresponds to the case $m=0$. We shall compute $p_{d,m}$ for all $m$ in the following cases: (a) $X_1,\ldots, X_{d+2}$ are i.i.d. normal; (b) $X_1,\ldots, X_{d+2}$ follow a $d$-dimensional beta or beta prime distribution, which includes the uniform distribution on the ball or on the sphere as special cases; (c) $X_1,\ldots, X_{d+2}$ form a random walk with exchangeable increments. As a by-product of case (a) we recover a recent solution to Youden's demon problem which asks to determine the probability that, in a one-dimensional i.i.d. normal sample $\xi_1,\ldots, \xi_n$, the empirical mean $\frac 1n (\xi_1 + \ldots + \xi_n)$ lies between the $k$-th and the $(k+1)$-st order statistics. We also consider the conic (or spherical) version of the refined Sylvester problem and solve it in several special cases.</description>

      <title>Regular triangle unions with maximal number of sides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22584v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an integer n&gt;=1. Suppose, a simple polygon is a union of n triangles so that vertices along the common boundary are arranged cyclically. What is the maximal number of sides such union - call it regular - can have? This is a sequence A375986, a recent entry into the OEIS. In this paper we prove that the sequence starts as 3, 12, 22, 33, 45, 56, 67, 80, 91, and satisfies simple linear lower and upper bounds. The latter is not only a bound, but in fact is realizable combinatorially. The questions whether it can be realized in pseudoline geometry, and, if so, whether such constructions are stretchable, are the next natural ones to pose. The paper is mostly expository and written in an informal style. However, it adds a new tool in investigating unions of objects; namely, triangulation shifts.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for orthogonal partitioning into four parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The famous pancake theorem states that for every finite set $X$ in the plane, there exist two orthogonal lines that divide $X$ into four equal parts. We propose an algorithm whose running time is linear in the number of points in $X$ and prove that this complexity is optimal. We also consider generalizations of the pancake theorem and show that orthogonal hyperplanes can be found in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Urysohn width and macroscopic scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the macroscopic version of Gromov's Urysohn width conjecture for scalar curvature is false in dimensions four and above. This is based on (1) a novel estimate on the codimension two Urysohn width of circle bundles over manifolds with large hypersphericity radius, and (2) a notion of ruling for Riemannian manifolds that yields circle bundles with total spaces admitting metrics of positive macroscopic scalar curvature. Along the way, we also show that Urysohn width is not continuous under Cheeger-Gromov collapsing limits. This article is a continuation of our study of metric invariants and scalar curvature for circle bundles over large Riemannian manifolds initiated in [KS25].</description>
