      <title>Entropy-driven decision-making dynamics sheds light on the emergence of the "paradox of choice"</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision making is the cognitive process of selecting a course of action among multiple alternatives. As the decision maker belongs to a complex microenvironment (which contains multiple decision makers), has to make a decision where multiple options are present which often leads to a phenomenon known as the "paradox of choices". The latter refers to the case where too many options can lead to negative outcomes, such as increased uncertainty, decision paralysis, and frustration. Here, we employ an entropy driven mechanism within a statistical physics framework to explain the premises of the paradox. In turn, we focus on the emergence of a collective "paradox of choice", in the case of interacting decision-making agents, quantified as the decision synchronization time. Our findings reveal a trade-off between synchronization time and the sensing radius, indicating the optimal conditions for information transfer among group members, which significantly depends the individual sensitivity parameters. Interestingly, when agents sense their microenvironment in a biased way or their decisions are influenced by their past choices, then the collective "paradox of choice" does not occur. In a nutshell, our theory offers a low-dimensional and unified statistical explanation of the "paradox of choice" at the individual and at the collective level.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Noise in V-Shape Linear Well Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium noise is characterized as noise realizations where external agitations disrupt the harmonic equilibrium of Brownian motion. Excitations in a particle's random walk into a so-called L\'evy flight changes the distribution of the noise from Gaussian to the fat-tailed L\'evy distribution. Generalization between Gaussian and L\'evy distributions is the $\alpha$-stability distribution, where $1&lt;\alpha\leq2$. In this study, the $\alpha$-stability distributed noise is subjugated into the Langevin and fractional Fokker--Planck equations that correspond to a V-shaped linear potential well $V(x)=F|x|$. From these equations, an Euler scheme for computational simulation via iterations is presented, and a probability density function that is normalizable under any $\alpha\in(1,2]$ is obtained. This study is focused more on the theoretical framework of non-equilibrium noise in V-shaped linear well profiles, which is intended to be applied to systems known to exhibit self-organized criticality.</description>

      <title>Using mathematics to study how people influence each other's opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01915v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: People sometimes change their opinions when they discuss things with other people. Researchers study mathematical models of opinions to explore how people influence each other through their social interactions. In today's digital world, these models can help us learn how to promote accurate information and reduce unwanted influence. In this article, we discuss a simple mathematical model that looks at opinion changes from social interactions. We briefly describe what opinion models can tell us and how researchers try to make them more realistic.</description>

      <title>Mechanical memories in solids, from disorder to design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solids are rigid, which means that when left undisturbed, their structures are nearly static. It follows that these structures depend on history -- but it is surprising that they hold readable memories of past events. Here we review the research that has recently flourished around mechanical memory formation, beginning with amorphous solids' various memories of deformation and mesoscopic models based on particle rearrangements. We describe how these concepts apply to a much wider range of solids and glassy matter -- and how they are a bridge to memory and physical computing in mechanical metamaterials. An understanding of memory in all these solids can potentially be the basis for designing or training functionality into materials. Just as important is memory's value for understanding matter whenever it is complex, frustrated, and out of equilibrium.</description>
