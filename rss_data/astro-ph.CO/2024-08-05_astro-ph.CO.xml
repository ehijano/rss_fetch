      <title>3D-Radial galaxy correlation function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tests of cosmological models via measurements of galaxy correlations will require increasing modeling accuracy, given the high precision of measurements promised by forthcoming galaxy surveys. In this work we investigate the biases introduced in parameter estimation when using different approximations in the modeling of the galaxy two point correlation function. We study this for two example surveys, with different binning strategies, for measurements of the Primordial non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ and the growth rate of structures $\gamma$. We then investigate the same issue for the nDGP model, to see if results will change for a different cosmological model. Our results show that failing to properly account for radial and angular separation between galaxies will induce a considerable shift in parameters best fit estimates, the bias being larger for thicker redshift bins. When accounting for radial evolution within the bins by integrating over z, such shifts are reduced but still present. We then introduce a new hybrid model, which we call 3D radial, where we neglect the purely wide angle terms, but include a proper 3D modeling of the system by including radial modes. Using this model, we show that biases are greatly reduced, making it an accurate formalism to be safely used for forthcoming galaxy surveys. This moreover confirms other recent findings on the importance of including radial modes to accurately model the galaxy correlation function.</description>

      <title>Discriminating among cosmological models by data-driven methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explores the Pantheon+SH0ES dataset to identify patterns that can discriminate between different cosmological models. We focus on determining whether the behaviour of dark energy is consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model or suggests novel cosmological features. The central goal is to evaluate the robustness of the $\Lambda$CDM model compared with other dark energy models, and to investigate whether there are deviations that might indicate new cosmological insights. The study takes into account a data-driven approach, using both traditional statistical methods and machine learning techniques. Initially, we evaluate six different dark energy models using traditional statistical methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Static and Dynamic Nested Sampling to infer the cosmological parameters. Subsequently, we adopt a machine learning approach, developing a regression model to compute the distance modulus of each supernova, expanding the feature set to 74 statistical features. Traditional statistical analysis confirms that the $\Lambda$CDM model is robust, yielding expected parameter values. Other models show deviations, with the Generalised and Modified Chaplygin Gas models performing poorly. In the machine learning analysis, feature selection techniques, particularly Boruta, significantly improve model performance. In particular, models initially considered weak (Generalised/Modified Chaplygin Gas) show significant improvement after feature selection. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of a data-driven approach to cosmological model evaluation. The $\Lambda$CDM model remains robust, while machine learning techniques, in particular feature selection, reveal potential improvements in alternative models which could be relevant for new observational campaigns like the recent DESI survey.</description>

      <title>Cosmological perturbations in the energy-momentum squared gravity theory: constraints from gravitational wave standard sirens and redshift space distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the linear cosmological perturbations in the context of the so-called energy-momentum squared gravity (EMSG) theory. Recent researches show that the EMSG theory can reproduce viable background cosmological evolution comparable to $\Lambda$CDM, while the matter-dominated era exhibits slight distinctions. In this paper, we mainly focus on the power-law EMSG models and derive the equations for the linear cosmological perturbations. We explore the propagation of the gravitational wave (GW) and the growth of matter density perturbation at the first order, and estimate the model parameters from the simulated GW data and the observed redshift space distortion data. Our analysis reveals that the model parameters should be small and positive in $1\sigma$ confidence interval, which indicates that the theory is in good agreement with the observational data and can be regarded as an alternative for the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Dynamics in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity Using New Slow-Roll Approximations considering Generalised Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations results reported by {\it Planck} satellite suggest a plateau characteristic in the flat potential of the inflaton field is favored to drive the Universe's early acceleration. On that note, Power Law Plateau (PLP) potential has gained a lot of attention. In this study, we demonstrate that implementing this inflationary model in an Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet(EGB) gravity background makes the model compatible with observations while avoiding late-stage thermal inflation which is otherwise unavoidable in a standard scenario. More importantly, we have taken the PLP model as a case study to check the new slow-roll approximations method proposed in \cite{Pozdeeva:2024ihc}. Then we take one step further to check the consequence of generalized reheating in this scenario. Thus opening a new promising window to study inflationary dynamics in EGB gravity.</description>

      <title>Detecting ionized bubbles around luminous sources during the reionization era using HI 21-cm signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the properties of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and sources during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is of immense importance. We explore the prospects of probing the IGM and sources through redshifted 21-cm observations of individual ionized bubbles surrounding known luminous sources during the EoR. Accordingly, we simulate HI 21-cm maps, foreground contaminants and system noise which are specific to the uGMRT and SKA1-Low observations. Following the subtraction of the foreground from the total visibility, we employ a visibility-based matched filter technique to optimally combine the desired HI 21-cm signal while minimizing the system noise. Our analysis suggests that these ionized bubbles can be detected with more than $5 \sigma$ significance using approximately $\sim 2000$ and $\sim 3000$ hours of observation time with the uGMRT at redshift $7.1$ and $8.3$ respectively. The SKA1-Low should be able to detect these with more than $8 \sigma$ significance using just $\sim 100$ hrs of observations. Further, we investigate the impact of the foreground subtraction on the detectability and find the signal-to-noise ratio decreases when smaller bandwidth is used. More importantly, we show that the matched filtering method can measure ionized bubble radius and constrain HI-neutral fraction reasonably well, helping deeper insights into source properties and the intergalactic medium.</description>

      <title>Reproduction of NGC1052-DF4 by self-interacting dark matter: dark matter deficiency and tidal features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of the velocity dispersion indicate a severe dark matter (DM) deficit in the ultra-diffuse galaxy, NGC1052-DF4 (DF4). The ultra-deep images obtained with the Gemini telescope, which has the deepest imaging data till now, confirm the presence of tidal tails in DF4, suggesting its tidal formation. To enhance tidal effects, we consider the self-interaction among DM particles. Using an N-body simulation in the scenario of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), we reproduce a DM-deficient galaxy that is consistent with all observational data of DF4. Specifically, our simulation result yields an extremely low DM-to-star mass ratio and a radial surface brightness profile very similar to that from deep images, showing accurate tidal features. By performing simulations with similar tidal effects and various cross-sections of SIDM, we show a significant impact of SIDM on the DM-to-star mass ratio in the central region of the galaxy. Our work confirms the tidal formation of DF4 in theory.</description>

      <title>Chromo-natural inflation supported by enhanced friction from Horndeski gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the extension of the chromo-natural inflation model by incorporating nonminimal coupling between the axion field and gravity. Nonminimal coupling is introduced so that it enhances friction in the axion's equation of motion and thus supports slow-roll inflation. This enhanced friction effectively delays the activation of the gauge field, thereby preventing the overproduction of gravitational waves in the CMB scale. We extend previous results by describing the nonminimal coupling in a general and unifying way utilizing Horndeski gravity. This allows us to explore systematically and comprehensively possible enhanced friction models of chromo-natural inflation consistent with observations. We find a novel enhanced friction model that shows better agreement (within 1$\sigma$) with CMB measurements than the previous nonminimally coupled chromo-natural inflation model. The gravitational-wave spectrum starts to rise at some wavenumber due to retarded activation of the gauge field in the late stage of inflation. We show how one can identify the wavenumber at which this occurs based on the background evolution and present a universal analytic formula for the gravitational-wave spectrum that can be used for any enhanced friction model of chromo-natural inflation.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field amplification and decay in cosmic string wakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We do a detailed study on vortex formation in a magnetized plasma within the spacetime of a moving cosmic string using analytical and numerical methods. The conical spacetime around the cosmic string causes the frozen-in magnetic field to deform due to the fluid flow. We find that the overdensity in the wake region amplifies the magnetic field. This amplification depends on the direction and the lengthscale of the magnetic perturbations. Alfvens theorem of flux conservation explains this result. However, our study also shows that the magnetic field can decay depending on the perturbation lengthscale, due to the breakdown of Alfvens theorem at a certain lengthscale. This lengthscale is the gyroradius of the charged particles in the plasma. Our findings are significant for understanding magnetic reconnection in cosmic string wakes.</description>

      <title>Introduction to the number of $e$-folds in slow-roll inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this review, a pedagogical introduction to the concepts of slow-roll inflationary Universe and number of $e$-folds is provided. In particular, the differences between the basic notion of number of $e$-folds ($N_e$), total number of $e$-folds ($N_T$) and number of $e$-folds before the end of inflation ($N$), are outlined. The proper application of the number of $e$-folds before the end of inflation is discussed both as a time-like variable for the scalar field evolution and as a key parameter for computing inflationary predictions.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Astrophysical Uncertainties in 21-cm Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The light of the first astrophysical objects is expected to leave an imprint on the global 21-cm signal as it heats, excites, and ionizes neutral hydrogen. This dependence on early astrophysics introduces significant uncertainties in modeling the 21-cm signal during Cosmic Dawn (CD). Here we show that a combination of observables including high-redshift UV luminosity functions, the cosmic X-ray background, the optical depth to reionization, and hydrogen absorption lines in quasar spectra, can be used to mitigate the astrophysical uncertainties assuming minimal modeling. Beyond its implications to standard astrophysics, we demonstrate how applying this procedure can improve sensitivity to new physics signatures in the global 21-cm signal. Taking the scenario of fractional millicharged dark matter (DM) as an example, we address astrophysical systematics to produce interesting predictions for upcoming experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With several examples and in an analysis of the Pantheon+ supernova sample we discuss the properties of the marginal posterior distribution versus the profiled posterior distribution -- the profile likelihood in a Bayesian disguise. We investigate whether maximisation, as used for the profiling, or integration, as used for the marginalisation, is more appropriate. To report results we recommend the marginal posterior distribution.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Emission from Cosmic String Loops, II: Local Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using lattice field simulations of the Abelian-Higgs model, we characterize the simultaneous emission of (scalar and gauge) particles and gravitational waves (GWs) by local string loops. We use {\it network} loops created in a phase transition, and {\it artificial} loops formed by either crossing straight-boosted or curved-static infinite strings. Loops decay via both particle and GW emission, on time scales $\Delta t_{\rm dec} \propto L^p$, where $L$ is the loop length. For particle production, we find $p \simeq 2$ for artificial loops and $p \lesssim 1$ for network loops, whilst for GW emission, we find $p \simeq 1$ for all loops. We find that below a critical length, artificial loops decay primarily through particle production, whilst for larger loops GW emission dominates. However, for network loops, which represent more realistic configurations, particle emission always dominates, as supported by our data with length-to-core ratios up to $L/r_\text{c} \lesssim 3500$. Our results indicate that the GW background from a local string network should be greatly suppressed compared to estimations that ignore particle emission.</description>

      <title>Non-parametric late-time expansion history reconstruction and implications for the Hubble tension in light of DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We non-parametrically reconstruct the late-time expansion history in light of the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI combined with various Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) catalogs, using interpolation through piece-wise natural cubic splines, and a reconstruction procedure based on Gaussian Processes (GPs). Applied to DESI BAO and PantheonPlus SNeIa data, both methods indicate that deviations from a reference $\Lambda$CDM model in the $z \lesssim 2$ unnormalized expansion rate $E(z)$ are constrained to be $\lesssim 10\%$, but also consistently identify two features in $E(z)$: a bump at $z \sim 0.5$, and a depression at $z \sim 0.9$, which cannot be simultaneously captured by a $w_0w_a$CDM fit. These features, which are stable against assumptions regarding spatial curvature, interpolation knots, and GP kernel, disappear if one adopts the older SDSS BAO measurements in place of DESI, and decrease in significance when replacing the PantheonPlus catalog with the Union3 and DESY5 ones. We infer $c/(r_dH_0)=29.90 \pm 0.33$ (with $r_d$ the sound horizon at baryon drag), which slightly reduces the Hubble tension and makes room for a more important role of late-time new physics in this context, albeit still remaining a sub-dominant part of the solution. If substantiated in forthcoming data releases, our results tentatively point to oscillatory/non-monotonic features in the shape of the expansion rate at $z \lesssim 2$, of potential interest for dark energy model-building.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints from calibrated $E_p-E_{iso}$ gamma-ray burst correlation by using DESI 2024 data release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent outcomes by the DESI Collaboration have shed light on a possible slightly evolving dark energy, challenging the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. To better understand dark energy nature, high-redshift observations like gamma-ray burst data become essential for mapping the universe expansion history, provided they are calibrated with other probes. To this aim, we calibrate the $E_p-E_{iso}$ (or Amati) correlation through model-independent B\'ezier interpolations of the updated Hubble rate and the novel DESI data sets. More precisely, we provide two B\'ezier calibrations: i) handling the entire DESI sample, and ii) excluding the point at $z_{eff}=0.51$, criticized by the recent literature. In both the two options, we let the comoving sound horizon at the drag epoch, $r_d$, vary in the range $r_d \in [138, 156]$ Mpc. The Planck value is also explored for comparison. By means of the so-calibrated gamma-ray bursts, we thus constrain three dark energy frameworks, namely the standard $\Lambda$CDM, the $\omega_0$CDM and the $\omega_0\omega_1$CDM models, in both spatially flat and non-flat universes. To do so, we worked out Monte Carlo Markov chain analyses, making use of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Further, we adopt model selection criteria to check the statistically preferred cosmological model finding a preference towards the concordance paradigm only whether the spatial curvature is zero. Conversely, and quite interestingly, the flat $\omega_0$CDM and both the cases, flat/non-flat, $\omega_0\omega_1$CDM model, leave evidently open the chance that dark energy evolves at higher redshifts.</description>

      <title>The effect of quantum decoherence on inflationary gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of inflation provides a mechanism to explain the structures we observe today in the Universe, starting from quantum-mechanically generated fluctuations. However, this leaves the question of: how did the quantum-to-classical transition, occur? During inflation, tensor perturbations interact (at least gravitationally) with other fields, meaning that we need to view these perturbations as an open system that interacts with an environment. In this paper, the evolution of the system is described using a Lindblad equation, which describes the quantum decoherence of the system. This is a possible mechanism for explaining the quantum-to-classical transition. We show that this quantum decoherence leads to a scale-dependent increase of the gravitational wave power spectrum, depending on the strength and time dependence of the interaction between the system and the environment. By using current upper bounds on the gravitational wave power spectrum from inflation, obtained from CMB and the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA constraints, we find an upper bound on the interaction strength. Furthermore, we compute the decoherence criterion, which indicates the minimal interaction strength needed for a specific scale to have successfully decohered by the end of inflation. Assuming that the CMB modes have completely decohered, we indicate a lower bound on the interaction strength. In addition, this decoherence criterion allows us to look at which scales might not have fully decohered and could still show some relic quantum signatures. Lastly, we use sensitivity forecasts to study how future gravitational-wave detectors, such as LISA and ET, could constrain the decoherence parameter space. Due to the scale-dependence of the power spectrum, LISA could only have a very small impact. However, ET will be able to significantly improve our current constraints for specific decoherence scenarios.</description>

      <title>EDEN: Exploring Disks Embedded in N-body simulations of Milky-Way-mass halos from Symphony</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of galactic disks on the tidal stripping of cold dark matter subhalos within Milky Way (MW)-mass halos ($M_{\rm vir}\sim 10^{12}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) using a new simulation suite, EDEN. By re-simulating 45 MW-mass zoom-in halos from the N-body Symphony compilation with embedded disk potentials, which evolve according to star formation histories predicted by the UniverseMachine model, we self-consistently tie disk growth to halo accretion rate and significantly expand the range of disk masses and formation histories studied. We use the particle-tracking-based subhalo finder Symfind to enhance the robustness of subhalo tracking. We find that disks near the median disk-to-halo mass ratio of our sample ($M_{\ast, \rm Disk}/M_{\rm vir, host} = 2\%$) reduce subhalo peak mass functions within 100 kpc by about $10\%$ for peak masses above $ 10^8\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. Heavier, MW/M31-like disks ($M_{\ast, \rm Disk}/M_{\rm vir, host} \gtrsim 5\%$) lead to a reduction of more than $40\%$. Subhalo abundance suppression is more pronounced near halo centers, with particularly enhanced stripping for subhalos accreted over 8 Gyr ago on orbits with pericenters &lt; 100 kpc. Suppression is further amplified when disk mass is increased within fixed halo and disk assembly histories. In all cases, the suppression we measure should be interpreted as stripping below the mass resolution limit rather than complete subhalo disruption. This study reshapes our understanding of the MW's impact on its satellites, suggesting it strips subhalos more efficiently than typical MW-mass galaxies due to its larger disk-to-halo mass ratio and earlier disk formation.</description>

      <title>Physical time for the beginning universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that physical time is based on counting the oscillations of wave functions. The discrete counting of the ticks of these clocks does not depend on the metric frame. It remains well defined for the beginning epochs of the universe. The photon clock counts the oscillations of electromagnetic plane waves in the cosmic reference frame. It can be gauged with clocks for other massless or massive particles. These equivalent clocks form a clock system which defines a common universal continuous physical time. For the photon clock this physical time coincides with conformal time. The universe is eternal towards the past for typical models of inflationary cosmology -- the photon clock ticks an infinite number of times. We compare the photon clock system to geodesic physical time, which is a frame invariant generalization of proper time.</description>

      <title>A new probe of dark matter-baryon interactions in compact stellar systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the astrophysical consequences of an attractive long-range interaction between dark matter and baryonic matter. Our study highlights the role of this interaction in inducing dynamical friction between dark matter and stars, which can significantly influence the evolution of compact stellar systems. Using the star cluster in Eridanus II as a case study, we derive a new stringent upper bound on the interaction strength $\tilde{\alpha}\leq 333.7$ for the interaction range $\lambda = 1$ pc. This constraint is independent of the dark matter mass and can improve the existing model-independent limits on $\tilde{\alpha}$ by a few orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we observe that the constraint is insensitive to the mass of the stellar system and the dark matter density in the stellar system as long as the system is dark matter dominated. This new approach can be applied to many other stellar systems, and we obtain comparable constraints from compact stellar halos observed in ultrafaint dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>SuperBIT Superpressure Flight Instrument Overview and Performance: Near diffraction-limited Astronomical Imaging from the Stratosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SuperBIT was a 0.5-meter near-ultraviolet to near-infrared wide-field telescope that launched on a NASA superpressure balloon into the stratosphere from New Zealand for a 45-night flight. SuperBIT acquired multi-band images of galaxy clusters to study the properties of dark matter using weak gravitational lensing. We provide an overview of the instrument and its various subsystems. We then present the instrument performance from the flight, including the telescope and image stabilization system, the optical system, the power system, and the thermal system. SuperBIT successfully met the instrument's technical requirements, achieving a telescope pointing stability of 0.34 +/- 0.10 arcseconds, a focal plane image stability of 0.055 +/- 0.027 arcseconds, and a PSF FWHM of ~ 0.35 arcseconds over 5-minute exposures throughout the 45-night flight. The telescope achieved a near-diffraction limited point-spread function in all three science bands (u, b, and g). SuperBIT served as a pathfinder to the GigaBIT observatory, which will be a 1.34-meter near-ultraviolet to near-infrared balloon-borne telescope.</description>

      <title>Increase in the Brightness of the Cosmic Radio Background toward Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of detecting the excess of the cosmic radio background (CRB) toward galaxy clusters due to its Compton scattering by electrons of the hot intergalactic gas. When mapping the background fluctuations at frequencies &lt; 800 MHz, this effect gives rise to a radio source at the cluster location. At higher frequencies, where the microwave (CMB or relic) radiation dominates in the background, a 'negative' source is observed at this location due to the transfer of some of the relic photons upward along the frequency axis (into the range &gt; 217 GHz) upon their scattering. We have computed the spectra of the expected CRB distortions for various clusters and show that in many cases in the range 30 MHz - 3 GHz their measurement will be hindered by the thermal bremsstrahlung from the intergalactic gas and the scattered radio emission from cluster galaxies associated with their past activity (and the synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons). Below 20 MHz the scattering effect always dominates over the thermal gas radiation due to the general increase in the CRB intensity. We have found the frequency ranges that are optimal for searching for the Compton CRB excess and show that hot (kTe &gt; 8 keV) clusters at high (z &gt; 0.5) redshifts are most promising for its observation. Because of the strong concentration of the bremsstrahlung to the cluster center, the peripheral observations of this excess must be more preferable than the central ones. The transition from the 'negative' source on the map of background fluctuations to the 'positive' one must occur not gradually but through the stage of a 'hybrid source' (a bright spot surrounded by a dark ring). This shape of the source in projection is explained by its unusual three-dimensional shape (a narrow bremsstrahlung peak rising from the center of a wide deep hole associated with the Compton scattering of the CMB).</description>

      <title>Cosmology and Astrophysics of CP-Violating Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmology and astrophysics of axion-like particles (ALPs) with CP-violating Yukawa couplings to nucleons. At finite nucleon density, the ALP's dynamics is governed by an effective potential which is the sum of the bare periodic potential and a linear potential whose strength depends on the nucleon density. We identify a critical nucleon density $\rho_c$ controlling the dynamics. At densities smaller than $\rho_c$ the effective potential is a tilted sinusoidal curve and the field is displaced from its zero-density minimum. At densities larger than $\rho_c$ the minima (and maxima) are absent, and the ALP is destabilized. Astrophysically, this implies that neutron stars can source a radial ALP field, providing a complementary probe to equivalence principle tests. Cosmologically, the ALP may have been destabilized in the early Universe and could have made large field excursions. We discuss model-building applications of our results for such early universe scenarios.</description>

      <title>How cosmological expansion affects communication between distant quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum communication protocol between harmonic oscillator detectors, interacting with a quantum field, is developed in a cosmological expanding background. The aim is to see if the quantum effects arising in an expanding universe, such as the cosmological particle production, could facilitate the communication between two distant parts or if they provide an additive noisy effect. By considering a perfect cosmic fluid, the resulting expansion turns out to increase the classical capacity of the protocol. This increasing occurs for all the cosmological expansions unless the latter is sharpened just before the receiver's detector interacts with the field. Moreover, the classical capacity turns out to be sensible to the barotropic parameter $w$ of the perfect fluid and to the coupling between the field and the scalar curvature $\xi$. As a consequence, by performing this protocol, one can achieve information about the cosmological dynamics and its coupling with a background quantum field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of adding an interaction in the $G_3$ term of Horndeski theory, where the propagation of gravitational waves are not modified. We derive the background and perturbation equations of motion from the action. We also derive the no-ghost and Laplacian instability conditions for tensor modes and scalar mode propagation. Then we study the evolution of the matter perturbation in the quasi-static approximation. We find that the gravitational couplings to the baryonic and cold dark matter over density are modified in this theory. We introduce a concrete model of the free function in the theory and study the background and linear perturbation dynamics. We then use the genetic algorithm to test the model. We compare the $H(z)$ function of the model and the $H(z)$ curve predicted by the genetic algorithm, using the $H(z)$ data. For the perturbation sector we compute the $f\sigma_{8}$ observable for the model and compare it with the predicted function from the genetic algorithm from the $f\sigma_{8}$ data.</description>

      <title>AC Currents from Gravitational Waves in Plasma Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that gravitational waves can induce electromagnetic perturbations in magnetised plasmas, with production occurring via the direct coupling of gravitational waves to the background magnetic field: this is the so-called Gertsenshtein effect. In this short work, we consider the direct gravitational perturbations of charge carriers via their minimal coupling to gravity in a collisionless plasma. We find that for isotropic plasmas, no secondary plasma perturbations are generated. However, when an anisotropy is introduced in the form of a background plasma current, we find that gravitational waves can induce a secondary current. For a constant DC background current, the secondary current inherits the AC frequency of the gravitational waves. It will certainly be interesting to investigate this effect in astrophysical plasmas in future work as well as its wider phenomenological consequences.</description>

      <title>Generating variable $\hbar$ and $c$ via Fujii-Wetterich model in curved spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the Fujii-Wetterich model [Phys.Rev.D 26, 2580 (1982) and Nucl.Phys.B 302, 645 (1988)] which allows the Higgs doublet to couple with a "cosmon" scalar $\chi$ of the background spacetime as $\chi^2\,\Phi^2$. Upon the SSB of the $SU(2)$ gauge, the VEV of the Higgs doublet is proportional to the field $\chi$. Fujii and Wetterich employed this linkage to make particle masses dependent on $\chi$. We shall present an $\textit alternative$ mechanism: at a given point $x^*$, the prevailing Higgs VEV will be used to $\textit construct$ a quantum of action $\hbar_*$ and a speed of light $c_*$ in association with $\chi(x^*)$. Specifically, each open set vicinity of a given point $x^*$ on the manifold is equipped with a replica of the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam action operating with its own effective values of $\hbar_*$ and $c_*$, whereas particle masses induced via Higgs SSB remain independent of $\chi(x^*)$. Our mechanism unambiguously generates the dependencies $\hbar_*\propto\chi^{-1/2}(x^*)$ and $c_*\propto\chi^{1/2}(x^*)$, causing these "fundamental constants" to vary along with the dynamical field $\chi$ across the manifold. For late-time cosmology, a varying $c$ along the trajectory of light waves from distant supernovae towards Earth renders the classic Lema\^itre redshift formula $1+z=a^{-1}$ inapplicable. Using the dependency $c_*\propto\chi^{1/2}(x^*)$, we derive the new (variable-$c$) Lema\^itre redshift relation and apply it to analyze the Pantheon Catalog of SneIa $\textit without$ invoking the dark energy hypothesis. Key consequences are: (1) Accounting for the Pantheon Catalog with a fit exceeding the quality of the $\Lambda$CDM model; (2) Explaining the late-time cosmic acceleration based on variable $c$, eliminating the need for dark energy; (3) Revitalizing Blanchard-Douspis-Rowan-Robinson-Sarkar's CMB power spectrum analysis that bypassed dark energy [A&amp;A 412, 35 (2003)].</description>

      <title>A Targeted Search for Variable Gravitationally Lensed Quasars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a pipeline to identify photometric variability within strong gravitationally lensing candidates, in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. In our first paper (Sheu et al. 2023), we laid out our pipeline and presented seven new gravitationally lensed supernovae candidates in a retrospective search. In this companion paper, we apply a modified version of that pipeline to search for gravitationally lensed quasars. From a sample of 5807 strong lenses, we have identified 13 new gravitationally lensed quasar candidates (three of them quadruply-lensed). We note that our methodology differs from most lensed quasar search algorithms that solely rely on the morphology, location, and color of the candidate systems. By also taking into account the temporal photometric variability of the posited lensed images in our search via difference imaging, we have discovered new lensed quasar candidates. While variability searches using difference imaging algorithms have been done in the past, they are typically preformed over vast swathes of sky, whereas we specifically target strong gravitationally lensed candidates. We also have applied our pipeline to 655 known gravitationally lensed quasar candidates from past lensed quasar searches, of which we identify 13 that display significant variability (one of them quadruply-lensed). This pipeline demonstrates a promising search strategy to discover gravitationally lensed quasars in other existing and upcoming surveys.</description>

      <title>Impact of astrophysical scatter on the Epoch of Reionization [H I]$_{\rm 21cm}$ bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is believed that the first star-forming galaxies are the main drivers of cosmic reionization. It is usually assumed that there is a one-to-one relationship between the star formation rate (SFR) inside a galaxy and the host halo mass in semi-analytical/numerical modeling of large-scale reionization. However, more accurate simulations and observations suggest that the SFR and ionizing luminosity in galaxies may vary considerably even if the host halo mass is the same. This astrophysical scatter can introduce an additional non-Gaussianity in the HI 21-cm signal, which the power spectrum might not capture adequately. In this work, we have studied the impact of the scatter on the HI 21-cm bispectrum using semi-numerical simulations. Although the fractional change in the HI 21-cm bispectra due to the scatter is found to be more than a factor of $10$ at large scales ($k_1 \lesssim 1\, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$) for $z=7.4$, it is found to be statistically insignificant. However, at small scales ($k_1\sim2.55$~Mpc$^{-1}$), we have found the impact due to the scatter to be high in magnitude ($|\langle \Delta B \rangle/B_{\text{no-scatter}}| \sim 1$) and statistically significant ($|\langle\Delta B\rangle/\sigma_{\Delta B}| \gtrsim 5$) at neutral fraction, $\overline{x}_{\rm HI}\sim 0.8$ for $z=7.4$. The impact due to scatter is found to be even more prominent ($|\langle \Delta B \rangle/B_{\text{no-scatter}}| \gtrsim 10$) at small scales for $z=10$ and $\overline{x}_{\rm HI}\sim 0.8$, but with reduced statistical significance ($|\langle\Delta B\rangle/\sigma_{\Delta B}| \sim 3$), compared to $z=7.4$ at the same neutral fraction. In the most optimistic scenario, SKA1-Low might be able to detect these signatures of astrophysical scatter, at $\sim 3\sigma$ and $\sim 5\sigma$ detection significance for $\overline{x}_{\rm HI} \sim$ 0.8 and 0.9 respectively, for the equilateral HI 21-cm bispectrum at $z=7.4$.</description>

      <title>Weighing neutrinos with Lyman-$\alpha$ observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18499v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of massive neutrinos has still not been revealed by the cosmological data. We consider a novel method based on the two-point line-of-sight correlation function of high-resolution Lyman-$\alpha$ data to achieve this end in the paper. We adopt semi-analytic models of Lyman-$\alpha$ clouds for the study. We employ Fisher matrix technique to show that it is possible to achieve a scenario in which the covariance of the two-point function nearly vanishes for both the spectroscopic noise and the signal. We analyze this near 'zero noise' outcome in detail to argue it might be possible to detect neutrinos of mass range $m_\nu \simeq 0.05 \hbox{--}0.1 \, \rm eV$ with signal-to-noise of unity with a single QSO line of sight. We show that this estimate can be improved to SNR $\simeq 3\hbox{--}6$ with data along multiple line of sights within the redshift range $z \simeq 2 \hbox{--} 2.5$. Such data sets already exist in the literature. We further carry out principal component analysis of the Fisher matrix to study the degeneracies of the neutrino mass with other parameters. We show that Planck priors lift the degeneracies between the neutrino mass and other cosmological parameters. However, the prospects of the detection of neutrino mass are driven by the poorly-determined parameters characterizing the ionization and thermal state of Lyman-$\alpha$ clouds. We have also mentioned the possible limitations and observational challenges posed in measuring the neutrino mass using our method.</description>

      <title>Galaxy-galaxy lensing data: $f(T)$ gravity challenges General Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17053v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use galaxy-galaxy lensing data to test General Relativity and $f(T)$ gravity at galaxies scales. We consider an exact spherically symmetric solution of $f(T)$ theory which is obtained from an approximate quadratic correction, and thus it is expected to hold for every realistic deviation from General Relativity. Quantifying the deviation by a single parameter $Q$, and following the post-Newtonian approximation, we obtain the corresponding deviation in the gravitational potential, shear component, and effective excess surface density profile. We used five stellar mass samples and divided them into blue and red to test the model dependence on galaxy color, and we modeled the excess surface density (ESD) profiles using the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profiles. Based on the group catalog from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7) we finally extract $Q=-2.138^{+0.952}_{-0.516}\times 10^{-5}\,$Mpc$^{-2}$ at $1\sigma$ confidence. This result indicates that $f(T)$ corrections on top of General Relativity are favored. Finally, we apply information criteria, such as the AIC and BIC ones, and although the dependence of $f(T)$ gravity on the off-center effect implies that its optimality needs to be carefully studied, our analysis shows that $f(T)$ gravity is more efficient in fitting the data comparing to General Relativity and $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, and thus it offers a challenge to the latter.</description>

      <title>The boundary of cosmic filaments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For decades, the boundary of cosmic filaments have been a subject of debate. In this work, we determine the physically-motivated radii of filaments by constructing stacked galaxy number density profiles around the filament spines. We find that the slope of the profile changes with distance to the filament spine, reaching its minimum at approximately 1 Mpc at z = 0 in both state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations and observational data. This can be taken as the average value of the filament radius. Furthermore, we note that the average filament radius rapidly decreases from z = 4 to z = 1, and then slightly increases. Moreover, we find that the filament radius depends on the filament length, the distance from connected clusters, and the masses of the clusters. These results suggest a two-phase formation scenario of cosmic filaments. The filaments experience rapid contraction before z = 1, but their density distribution has remained roughly stable since then. The subsequent mass transport along the filaments to the connected clusters is likely to have contributed to the formation of the clusters themselves.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Curvature Perturbation and Primordial Black Hole Formation in Two-stage Inflation with a break</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02492v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a model of $R^2$-gravity with a non-minimally coupled scalar field that gives rise to two-stage inflation with a break, that is, with an intermediate stage where inflation momentarily halts. We find that the power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation is significantly enhanced at the break scale, which can account for the primordial black hole (PBH) formation, without affecting the CMB constraint on large scales. The behavior of the curvature perturbation is carefully analyzed and we find a few notable new features in the spectrum. In particular, we find that the $k^3$ growth of the spectrum of toward the end of the first stage of inflation. We argue that this is a universal feature common to all two-stage models where the field dominating the second stage is heavy during the first stage. By appropriately tuning the model parameters, we find that our model can realize the scenario of PBHs as the cold dark matter of the Universe. We also find that we can choose the parameters so that the spectrum of the induced gravitational waves from the enhanced curvature perturbation fits the NANOGrav-15yr data of pulsar timing array observation.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes and curvature perturbations from false vacuum islands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06506v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, much attention has been focused on the false vacuum islands that are flooded by an expanding ocean of true-vacuum bubbles slightly later than most of the other parts of the world. These delayed decay regions will accumulate locally larger vacuum energy density by staying in the false vacuum longer than those already transited into the true vacuum. A false vacuum island with thus acquired density contrast of a super-horizon size will evolve locally from radiation dominance to vacuum dominance, creating a local baby Universe that can be regarded effectively as a local closed Universe. If such density contrasts of super-horizon sizes can ever grow large enough to exceed the threshold of gravitational collapse, primordial black holes will form similar to those collapsing curvature perturbations on super-horizon scales induced by small-scale enhancements during inflation. If not, such density contrasts can still induce curvature perturbations potentially observable today. In this paper, we revisit and elaborate on the generations of primordial black holes and curvature perturbations from delayed-decayed false vacuum islands during asynchronous first-order phase transitions with fitting formulas convenient for future model-independent studies.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity-Improved Polarization Maps at 40 GHz with CLASS and WMAP data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Improved polarization measurements at frequencies below 70 GHz with degree-level angular resolution are crucial for advancing our understanding of the Galactic synchrotron radiation and the potential polarized anomalous microwave emission and ultimately benefiting the detection of primordial $B$ modes. In this study, we present sensitivity-improved 40 GHz polarization maps obtained by combining the CLASS 40 GHz and WMAP $Q$-band data through a weighted average in the harmonic domain. The decision to include WMAP $Q$-band data stems from similarities in the bandpasses. Leveraging the accurate large-scale measurements from WMAP $Q$ band and the high-sensitivity information from CLASS 40 GHz band at intermediate scales, the noise level at $\ell\in[30, 100]$ is reduced by a factor of $2-3$ in the map space. A pixel domain analysis of the polarized synchrotron spectral index ($\beta_s$) using WMAP $K$ band and the combined maps (mean and 16/84th percentile across the $\beta_s$ map: $-3.08_{-0.20}^{+0.20}$) reveals a stronger preference for spatial variation (PTE for a uniform $\beta_s$ hypothesis smaller than 0.001) than the results obtained using WMAP $K$ and $Ka$ bands ($-3.08_{-0.14}^{+0.14}$). The cross-power spectra of the combined maps follow the same trend as other low-frequency data, and validation through simulations indicates negligible bias introduced by the combination method (sub-percent level in the power spectra). The products of this work are publicly available on $\mathtt{LAMBDA}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Broad absorption line quasars (BALs) exhibit blueshifted absorption relative to a number of their prominent broad emission features. These absorption features can contribute to quasar redshift errors and add absorption to the Lyman-alpha (LyA) forest that is unrelated to large-scale structure. We present a detailed analysis of the impact of BALs on the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) results with the LyA forest from the first year of data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). The baseline strategy for the first year analysis is to mask all pixels associated with all BAL absorption features that fall within the wavelength region used to measure the forest. We explore a range of alternate masking strategies and demonstrate that these changes have minimal impact on the BAO measurements with both DESI data and synthetic data. This includes when we mask the BAL features associated with emission lines outside of the forest region to minimize their contribution to redshift errors. We identify differences in the properties of BALs in the synthetic datasets relative to the observational data, as well as use the synthetic observations to characterize the completeness of the BAL identification algorithm, and demonstrate that incompleteness and differences in the BALs between real and synthetic data also do not impact the BAO results for the LyA forest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard cosmological model, with its six independent parameters, successfully describes our observable Universe. One of these parameters, the optical depth to reionization $\tau_\mathrm{reio}$, represents the scatterings that Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons will experience after decoupling from the primordial plasma as the intergalactic medium transitions from neutral to ionized. $\tau_\mathrm{reio}$ depends on the neutral hydrogen fraction $x_\mathrm{HI}$, which, in turn, should theoretically depend on cosmology. We present a novel method to establish the missing link between cosmology and reionization timeline using symbolic regression. We discover the timeline has a universal shape well described by the Gompertz mortality law, applicable to any cosmology within our simulated data. Unlike the conventional tanh prescription, our model is asymmetric in time and a good fit to astrophysical constraints on $x_\mathrm{HI}$. By combining CMB with astrophysical data and marginalizing over astrophysics, we treat $\tau_\mathrm{reio}$ as a derived parameter, tightening its constraint to $&lt;3\%$. This approach reduces the error on the amplitude of the primordial fluctuations by a factor of 2.3 compared to Planck's PR3 constraint and provides a commanding constraint on the ionization efficiency $\zeta_\mathrm{UV} = 26.9^{+2.1}_{-2.5}$. We expect further improvements in the near term as reionization constraints increase and our understanding of reionization advances.</description>

      <title>The clustering of Lyman Alpha Emitting galaxies at z=2-3</title>

Abstract: We measure the clustering of Lyman Alpha Emitting galaxies (LAEs) selected from the One-hundred-square-degree DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey, with spectroscopic follow-up from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We use DESI spectroscopy to optimize our selection and to constrain the interloper fraction and redshift distribution of our narrow-band selected sources. We select samples of 4000 LAEs at z=2.45 and 3.1 in 9 sq.deg. centered on the COSMOS field with median LyA fluxes of 10^{-16}erg/s/cm2. Covariances and cosmological inferences are obtained from a series of mock catalogs built upon high-resolution N-body simulations that match the footprint, number density, redshift distribution and observed clustering of the sample. We find that both samples have a correlation length of r_0=(3.0\pm 0.2)Mpc/h. Within our fiducial cosmology these correspond to 3D number densities of 10^{-3} h^3/Mpc^3 and, from our mock catalogs, biases of 1.7 and 2.0 at z=2.45 and 3.1, respectively. We discuss the implications of these measurements for the use of LAEs as large-scale structure tracers for high-redshift cosmology.</description>

      <title>Attenuation from the optical to the extreme ultraviolet by dust associated with broad absorption line quasars: the driving force for outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03733</link>
      <description>arXiv:1611.03733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a mean attenuation curve out to the rest-frame extreme ultraviolet (EUV) for 'BAL dust' - the dust causing the additional extinction of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with broad absorption lines (BALQSOs). In contrast to the normal, relatively flat, mean AGN attenuation curve, BAL dust is well fit by a steeply rising, SMC-like curve. We confirm the shape of the theoretical Weingartner &amp; Draine SMC curve out to 700 Angstroms but the drop in attenuation at still shorter wavelengths is less than predicted. The similar SMC-like attenuation curve for low-ionization BALQSOs (LoBALs) does not support the idea that they are an early phase in the life of an AGN when it is breaking out of a cocoon of star-forming dust. Although the attenuation is only E(B - V) ~ 0.03 - 0.05 in the optical, it rises to one magnitude in the EUV, which is an optimum value for radiative acceleration of dusty gas. Because the spectral energy distribution of AGNs peaks in the EUV, the force on the dust dominates the acceleration of BAL gas. Although the shape of the attenuation curve for LoBALs is similar to the shape for HiBALs, the LoBALs on average show negative attenuation in the optical. This is naturally explained if there is more light scattered into our line of sight in LoBALs compared with non-BALQSOs. We suggest that this and partial covering are causes when attenuation curves appear to be steeper in the UV than an SMC curve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.04552v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate both the null energy condition (NEC) violating scenario and the $c_T$-diminishing scenario for generating enhanced power spectrum of primordial gravitational waves (GWs) during inflation, where $c_T$ is the propagating speed of primordial GWs. Both of these two scenarios can be realized stably with theories beyond Horndeski, hence can be uniformly implemented within the framework of the effective field theory. We calculate the power spectrum of primordial GWs by assuming that the inflationary Universe undergoes three phases, where the violation of NEC or the diminishment of $c_T$ occurs in the intermediate phase. A template of the spectrum is given for the NEC-violating scenario. We also discuss the underlying relation and discrepancy between these two scenarios with a disformal transformation.</description>

The robustness of singularity resolutions due to the quantum effects is explicitly verified in the context of two quantization schemes typically used in the literature. We present an exploration of the effects of quantum geometry on the background dynamics, which is also illustrated through some explicit numerical examples and showing the absence of the singularity.</description>

      <title>Quantum loop corrections in the modified gravity model of Starobinsky inflation with primordial black hole production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02934v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A modified gravity model of Starobinsky inflation and primordial black hole production was proposed in good (within $1\sigma$) agreement with current measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation. The model is an extension of the singularity-free Appleby-Battye-Starobinsky model by the $R^4$-term with different values of the parameters whose fine-tuning leads to efficient production of primordial black holes on smaller scales with the asteroid-size masses between $10^{16}$ g and $10^{20}$ g. Those primordial black holes may be part (or the whole) of the current dark matter, while the proposed model can be confirmed or falsified by detection or absence of the induced gravitational waves with the frequencies about $10^{-2}$ Hz. The main purpose of this paper was to estimate the size of quantum (loop) corrections in the model. It was found their relative contribution to the power spectrum of scalar perturbations is about $10^{-3}$ or less, so that the model is not ruled out by the quantum corrections.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a Past Merger of the Galactic Center Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06416v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) residing in the centers of most galaxies remains a mystery. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) provided direct imaging of the SMBH Sgr A* at the Milky Way's center, indicating it likely spins rapidly with its spin axis significantly misaligned relative to the Galactic plane's angular momentum. Through investigating various SMBH growth models, here we show that the inferred spin properties of Sgr A* provide evidence of a past SMBH merger. Inspired by the merger between the Milky Way and Gaia-Enceladus, which has a 4:1 mass ratio as inferred from Gaia data, we have discovered that a 4:1 major merger of SMBH with a binary angular momentum inclination angle of 145-180 degrees with respect to the line of sight (LOS), can successfully replicate the measured spin properties of Sgr A*. This merger event in our galaxy provides potential observational support for the theory of hierarchical BH mergers in the formation and growth of SMBHs. The inferred merger rate, consistent with theoretical predictions, suggests a promising detection rate of SMBH mergers for space-borne gravitational wave detectors expected to operate in 2030s.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Primordial Black Hole Capture by Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08057v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A sub-solar mass primordial black hole (PBH) passing through a neutron star, can lose enough energy through interactions with the dense stellar medium to become gravitationally bound to the star. Once captured, the PBH would sink to the core of the neutron star, and completely consume it from the inside. In this paper, we improve previous energy-loss calculations by considering a realistic solution for the neutron star interior, and refine the treatment of the interaction dynamics and collapse likelihood. We then consider the effect of a sub-solar PBH population on neutron stars near the Galactic center. We find that it is not possible to explain the lack of observed pulsars near the galactic center through dynamical capture of PBHs, as the velocity dispersion is too high. We then show that future observations of old neutron stars close to Sgr A* could set stringent constraints on the PBHs abundance. These cannot however be extended in the currently unconstrained asteroid-mass range, since PBHs of smaller mass would lose less energy in their interaction with the neutron star and end up in orbits that are too loosely bound and likely to be disrupted by other stars in the Galactic center.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Model for Dark Energy -- Dark Matter Interaction: Scenario for the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze a model for Dark Energy - Dark Matter interaction, based on a decaying process of the former into the latter. The dynamical equations are constructed following a kinetic formulation, which separates the interacting fluctuations from an equilibrium distribution of both species. The emerging dynamical picture consists of coupled equations, which are specialized in the case of a Dark Energy equation of state parameter; we deal with a modified Lambda Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, which is investigated versus a possible interpretation of the Hubble tension. Using an optimized set of the model's free parameters, it can be shown that the obtained Hubble parameter can, in principle, address the tension. We then use the most recent datasets from late Universe sources and compressed information from the Cosmic Microwave Background data to constrain the free parameters and compare the addressed scenario to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. The study outlines how our proposal is preferred by the data in all cases, based on fit quality, while also alleviating the tension.</description>

      <title>Galaxy groups in the presence of Cosmological Constant: Increasing the Masses of Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The boundaries of galaxy groups and clusters are defined by the interplay between the Newtonian attractive force and the decoupling from the local expansion of the Universe. This work extends the definition of a zero radial acceleration surface (ZRAS) and the turnaround surface (TS) for a general distribution of the masses in an expanding background, governed by the cosmological constant. We apply these definitions to different galaxy groups in the local Universe, mapping these groups up to ten megaparsec distances. We discuss the dipole and the quadrupole rate for the Local Group of Galaxies and the implementations on the Hubble diagram correction and galaxy groups virialization. With these definitions, we present the surfaces showing the interplay between the local expansion vs the local Newtonian attraction for galaxy groups in the local Universe. Further, we estimate the masses of different galaxy groups and show that the Cosmological Constant requires these masses to be higher. For the groups with enough tracers close to the TS, the contribution of the Cosmological Constant makes the masses to be even higher. The results show the importance of including the local cosmic expansion in analyzing the Cosmic Flow of the local Universe.</description>

      <title>High-Redshift Merger Model for Low-Frequency Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2023, the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) Collaborations announced the discovery of a gravitational wave background (GWB), predominantly attributed to supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) mergers. However, the detected GWB is several times stronger than the default value expected from galactic observations at low and moderate redshifts. Recent findings by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have unveiled a substantial number of massive, high-redshift galaxies, suggesting more massive SMBHB mergers at these early epochs. Motivated by these findings, we propose an "early merger" model that complements the standard merger statistics by incorporating these early, massive galaxies. We compare the early and standard "late merger" models, which assume peak merger rates in the local Universe, and match both merger models to the currently detected GWB. Our analysis shows that the early merger model has a significantly lower detection probability for single binaries and predicts a ~30% likelihood that the first detectable single source will be highly redshifted and remarkably massive with rapid frequency evolution. In contrast, the late merger model predicts a nearly monochromatic first source at low redshift. The future confirmation of an enhanced population of massive high-redshift galaxies and the detection of fast-evolving binaries would strongly support the early merger model, offering significant insights into the evolution of galaxies and SMBHs.</description>

      <title>Tying knots in particle physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lord Kelvin's pioneering hypothesis that the identity of atoms is knots of vortices of the aether had a profound impact on the fields of mathematics and physics despite being subsequently refuted by experiments. While knot-like excitations emerge in various systems of condensed matter physics, the fundamental constituents of matter have been revealed to be elementary particles such as electrons and quarks, seemingly leaving no room for the appearance of knots in particle physics. Here, we show that knots indeed appear as meta-stable solitons in a realistic extension of the standard model of particle physics that provides the QCD axion and right-handed neutrinos. This result suggests that during the early Universe, a "knot dominated era" may have existed, where knots were a dominant component of the Universe, and this scenario can be tested through gravitational wave observations. Furthermore, we propose that the end of this era involves the collapse of the knots via quantum tunneling, leading to the generation of matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. Our findings exhibit the significant role of knots in particle physics and represent a modern version of Kelvin's hypothesis.</description>

      <title>The Radio Galaxy Environment Reference Survey (RAGERS): a submillimetre study of the environments of massive radio-quiet galaxies at $z = 1{\rm -}3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring the environments of massive galaxies at high redshift is crucial to understanding galaxy evolution and the conditions that gave rise to the distribution of matter we see in the Universe today. While high-$z$ radio galaxies (H$z$RGs) and quasars tend to reside in protocluster-like systems, the environments of their radio-quiet counterparts are relatively unexplored, particularly in the submillimetre, which traces dust-obscured star formation. In this study we search for 850 $\mu$m-selected submillimetre galaxies in the environments of massive ($M_{\star} &gt; 10^{11} M_{\odot}$), radio-quiet ($L_{500 {\rm MHz}} \lesssim 10^{25}$ W Hz$^{-1}$) galaxies at $z \sim 1\text{--}3$ using S2COSMOS data. By constructing number counts in circular regions of radius 1--6 arcmin and comparing with blank-field measurements, we find no significant overdensities of SMGs around massive radio-quiet galaxies at any of these scales, despite being sensitive down to overdensities of $\delta \sim 0.4$. To probe deeper than the catalogue we also examine the distribution of peaks in the SCUBA-2 SNR map, which reveals only tentative signs of any difference in the SMG densities of the radio-quiet galaxy environments compared to the blank field, and only on smaller scales (1$^{\prime}$ radii, corresponding to $\sim0.5$ Mpc) and higher SNR thresholds. We conclude that massive, radio-quiet galaxies at cosmic noon are typically in environments with $\delta\lesssim0.4$, which are either consistent with the blank field or contain only weak overdensities spanning sub-Mpc scales. The contrast between our results and studies of H$z$RGs with similar stellar masses and redshifts implies an intrinsic link between the wide-field environment and radio AGN luminosity at high redshift.</description>
