      <title>Sliding Mode Control for Uncertain Systems with Time-Varying Delays via Predictor Feedback and Super-Twisting Observer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel stabilization control strategy for linear time-invariant systems affected by known time-varying measurement delays and matched unknown nonlinear disturbances, which may encompass actuator faults. It is considered that part of the state vector is not available for real-time measurement. To address this, the proposed approach combines an open-loop predictor with a state observer designed using the Super-Twisting Algorithm, aiming to compensate for the delays and estimate the unmeasured state components. Specifically, the nonlinear observer-based framework enables the reconstruction of unmodeled fault signals without assuming that they originate from a known exogenous system, offering robustness against parametric uncertainties. Meanwhile, the predictor forwards the delayed output in time. Subsequently, a sliding mode control law is formulated to enforce an ideal sliding mode and ensure global stabilization, even under a broader class of perturbations, unmodeled disturbances, parametric uncertainties, and delays, owing to the integration of the Super-Twisting observer. Numerical simulations illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Optimal Impulsive Control of Cislunar Relative Motion using Reachable Set Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the first application of the state-of-the-art Koenig-D'Amico reachable set theory solver to cislunar, chaotic relative motion in the Circular-Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP). The relative motion dynamics of two spacecraft, a chief and a deputy, in the CR3BP are formulated as a Linear Time-Variant (LTV) system, allowing the solver to find an optimal impulsive control maneuver plan. This methodology demonstrates robust and accurate control performance for both small and large reconfigurations over different CR3BP orbits and control windows. These capabilities are enhanced by a Model Predictive Control (MPC) architecture to reject all sources of control, navigation, and dynamic error. The performance of the proposed approach is validated by unit testing, Monte Carlo simulations, and comparisons to baseline models for spacecraft relative motion. Overall, this work demonstrates an optimal control methodology with the computational efficiency to be used on-board spacecraft, enabling the safe, effective, and efficient operation of Distributed Space Systems in cislunar space.</description>

      <title>A Bi-Objective Mathematical Model for the Multi-Skilled Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem Considering Reliability: An AUGMECON2VIKOR Hybrid Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, resources with multiple skills have received attention as an extension of the resource-constrained project scheduling problem known as MSRCPSP. Although the disruption rate is well-estimated in today's manufacturing projects, its impact on project makespan and cost need further investigation. Hence, this study presents a novel mathematical model for the MSRCPSP considering reliability, namely MSRCPSPR. The model proposes both objectives of minimizing project makespan and project cost. The MSRCPSP is an NP-hard problem, and including reliability constraints, as proposed in this paper, makes solving the problem more intractable. To cope with the computational challenges of solving the problem, a combination of an enhanced version of the epsilon-constraint method as well as an augmented version of the VIKOR algorithm, namely AUGMECON2VIKOR, is employed to solve benchmark instances j10 and j20 from the PSPLIB. A comparative analysis demonstrates the performance of the proposed method, and the sensitivity analysis represents the effects of positive reliable constraints on the objective functions. Employing the proposed method, the project makespan and cost are reduced by nearly 2.55% and 2.80% in j10 on average. CPU time is also decreased by about 543 seconds in comparison to the epsilon-constraint method.</description>

      <title>Second-order sequential optimality conditions for nonlinear semidefinite optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential optimality conditions play an important role in constrained optimization since they provide necessary conditions without requiring constraint qualifications (CQs). This paper introduces a second-order extension of the Approximate Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (AKKT) conditions, referred to as AKKT2, for nonlinear semidefinite optimization problems (NSDP). In particular, we provide a formal definition of AKKT2, as well as its stronger variant, called Complementary AKKT2 (CAKKT2), and prove that these conditions are necessary for local minima without any assumption. Moreover, under Robinson's CQ and the weak constant rank property, we show that AKKT2 implies the so-called weak second-order necessary condition. Finally, we propose a penalty-based algorithm that generates sequences whose accumulation points satisfy the AKKT2 and the CAKKT2 conditions.</description>

      <title>On Policy Stochasticity in Mutual Information Optimal Control of Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, mutual information optimal control has been proposed as an extension of maximum entropy optimal control. Both approaches introduce regularization terms to render the policy stochastic, and it is important to theoretically clarify the relationship between the temperature parameter (i.e., the coefficient of the regularization term) and the stochasticity of the policy. Unlike in maximum entropy optimal control, this relationship remains unexplored in mutual information optimal control. In this paper, we investigate this relationship for a mutual information optimal control problem (MIOCP) of discrete-time linear systems. After extending the result of a previous study of the MIOCP, we establish the existence of an optimal policy of the MIOCP, and then derive the respective conditions on the temperature parameter under which the optimal policy becomes stochastic and deterministic. Furthermore, we also derive the respective conditions on the temperature parameter under which the policy obtained by an alternating optimization algorithm becomes stochastic and deterministic. The validity of the theoretical results is demonstrated through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Modeling of Vehicular Maneuvers and Interactions at Urban Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling and evaluation of automated vehicles (AVs) in mixed-autonomy traffic is essential prior to their safe and efficient deployment. This is especially important at urban junctions where complex multi-agent interactions occur. Current approaches for modeling vehicular maneuvers and interactions at urban junctions have limitations in formulating non-cooperative interactions and vehicle dynamics within a unified mathematical framework. Previous studies either assume predefined paths or rely on cooperation and central controllability, limiting their realism and applicability in mixed-autonomy traffic. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a modeling framework for trajectory planning and decentralized vehicular control at urban junctions. The framework employs a bi-level structure where the upper level generates kinematically feasible reference trajectories using an efficient graph search algorithm with a custom heuristic function, while the lower level employs a predictive controller for trajectory tracking and optimization. Unlike existing approaches, our framework does not require central controllability or knowledge sharing among vehicles. The vehicle kinematics are explicitly incorporated at both levels, and acceleration and steering angle are used as control variables. This intuitive formulation facilitates analysis of traffic efficiency, environmental impacts, and motion comfort. The framework's decentralized structure accommodates operational and stochastic elements, such as vehicles' detection range, perception uncertainties, and reaction delay, making the model suitable for safety analysis. Numerical and simulation experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate the framework's capability in modeling accurate and realistic vehicular maneuvers and interactions at various urban junctions, including unsignalized intersections and roundabouts.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Shape and Topology Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article aims to introduce the paradigm of distributional robustness from the field of convex optimization to tackle optimal design problems under uncertainty. We consider realistic situations where the physical model, and thereby the cost function of the design to be minimized depend on uncertain parameters. The probability distribution of the latter is itself known imperfectly, through a nominal law, reconstructed from a few observed samples. The distributionally robust optimal design problem is an intricate bilevel program which consists in minimizing the worst value of a statistical quantity of the cost function (typically, its expectation) when the law of the uncertain parameters belongs to a certain ``ambiguity set''. We address three classes of such problems: firstly, this ambiguity set is made of the probability laws whose Wasserstein distance to the nominal law is less than a given threshold; secondly, the ambiguity set is based on the first- and second-order moments of the actual and nominal probability laws. Eventually, a statistical quantity of the cost other than its expectation is made robust with respect to the law of the parameters, namely its conditional value at risk. Using techniques from convex duality, we derive tractable, single-level reformulations of these problems, framed over augmented sets of variables. Our methods are essentially agnostic of the optimal design framework; they are described in a unifying abstract framework, before being applied to multiple situations in density-based topology optimization and in geometric shape optimization. Several numerical examples are discussed in two and three space dimensions to appraise the features of the proposed techniques.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of stochastic homogenous systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a new class of homogeneous stochastic control problems with cone control constraints, extending the classical homogeneous stochastic linear-quadratic (LQ) framework to encompass nonlinear system dynamics and non-quadratic cost functionals. We demonstrate that, analogous to the LQ case, the optimal controls and value functions for these generalized problems are intimately connected to a novel class of highly nonlinear backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs). We establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to these BSDEs under three distinct sets of conditions, employing techniques such as truncation functions and logarithmic transformations. Furthermore, we derive explicit feedback representations for the optimal controls and value functions in terms of the solutions to these BSDEs, supported by rigorous verification arguments. Our general solvability conditions allow us to recover many known results for homogeneous LQ problems, including both standard and singular cases, as special instances of our framework.</description>

      <title>Cost allocations in interval inventory situations: the SOC and Shapley approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty in demand and supply conditions poses critical challenges to effective inventory management, especially in collaborative environments. Traditional inventory models, such as those based on the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ), often rely on fixed parameters and deterministic assumptions, limiting their ability to capture the complexity of real-world scenarios. This paper focuses on interval inventory situations, an extension of classical models in which demand is represented as intervals to account for uncertainty. This framework allows for a more flexible and realistic analysis of inventory decisions and cost-sharing among cooperating agents. We examine two interval-based allocation rules, the interval SOC-rule and the interval Shapley rule, designed to distribute joint ordering costs fairly and efficiently under uncertain demand. Their theoretical properties are analyzed, and their practical applicability is demonstrated through a case study involving the coordination of perfume inventories across seven Spanish airports, based on 2023 passenger traffic data provided by AENA. The findings highlight the potential of interval-based models to enable a robust and equitable allocation of inventory costs in the face of operational uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Benders decomposition and enhanced SDDP for multistage stochastic programs with block-separable multistage recourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an algorithm to efficiently solve multistage stochastic programs with block separable recourse where each recourse problem is a multistage stochastic program with stage-wise independent uncertainty. The algorithm first decomposes the full problem into a reduced master problem and subproblems using Adaptive Benders decomposition. The subproblems are then solved by an enhanced SDDP. The enhancement includes (1) valid bounds at each iteration, (2) a path exploration rule, (3) cut sharing among subproblems, and (4) guaranteed {\delta}-optimal convergence. The cuts for the subproblems are then shared by calling adaptive oracles. The key contribution of the paper is the first algorithm for solving this class of problems. The algorithm is demonstrated on a power system investment planning problem with multi-timescale uncertainty. The case study results show that (1) the proposed algorithm can efficiently solve this type of problem, (2) deterministic wind modelling underestimate the objective function, and (3) stochastic modelling of wind leads to different investment decisions.</description>

      <title>Guaranteeing Line-of-Sight Wireless Connectivity in Stochastic Environments with Random Obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in high-frequency communication technologies using millimeter waves (mmWave), Tera- Hertz (THz), and optical wireless frequency bands are key for extending wireless connectivity beyond 5G. These technologies offer a broader spectrum than the one available on low- and mid-bands, enabling ultra-high-speed data rates, higher device density, enhanced security, and improved positioning accuracy. However, their performance relies heavily on clear Line-of-Sight (LoS) conditions, as Non-LoS components are significantly weaker, making blockages a major challenge to ensure suitable received signal power. This paper addresses this limitation by identifying the minimum number and optimal placement of access points (APs) needed to ensure LoS connectivity in stochastic/dynamic environments with random obstacle locations. To achieve this, the stochastic environment is carefully modeled as a graph, where the nodes represent sub-polygons of layout realizations, and the edges capture the visibility overlaps between them. By employing maximal clique clustering and maximum clique packing methods over this graph, the proposed approach determines the AP placement locations that guarantee either full LoS coverage or controlled LoS gaps, while seamlessly adapting to the stochastic variability in obstacle locations. Simulations results in a representative stochastic environment demonstrate a 25% reduction in the required number of APs, achieving a tolerable 5% coverage gap compared to AP deployment optimized for full LoS coverage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tree tensor networks (TTNs) are widely used in low-rank approximation and quantum many-body simulation. In this work, we present a formal analysis of the differential geometry underlying TTNs. Building on this foundation, we develop efficient first- and second-order optimization algorithms that exploit the intrinsic quotient structure of TTNs. Additionally, we devise a backpropagation algorithm for training TTNs in a kernel learning setting. We validate our methods through numerical experiments on a representative machine learning task.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient Algorithms for Distributed Nonconvex Minimax Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stochastic nonconvex Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz minimax problems and propose algorithms that are both communication- and sample-efficient. The proposed methods are developed under three setups: decentralized/distributed, federated/centralized, and single-agent. By exploiting second-order Lipschitz continuity and integrating communication-efficient strategies, we develop a new decentralized normalized accelerated momentum method with local updates and establish its convergence to an $\varepsilon$-game stationary point. Compared to existing decentralized minimax algorithms,
  our proposed algorithm is the first to achieve a state-of-the-art communication complexity of order $\mathcal{O}\Big(
  \frac{ \kappa^3\varepsilon^{-3}}{NK(1-\lambda)^{3/2}}\Big)$, demonstrating linear speedup with respect to both the number of agents $K$ and the number of local updates $N$, as well as the best known dependence on the level of accuracy of the solution $\varepsilon$. In addition to improved complexity, our algorithm offers several practical advantages: it relaxes the strict two-time-scale step size ratio required by many existing algorithms, simplifies the stability conditions for step size selection, and eliminates the need for large batch sizes to attain the optimal sample complexity.
  Moreover, we propose more efficient variants tailored to federated/centralized and single-agent setups, and show that all variants achieve best-known results while effectively addressing some key issues. Experiments on robust logistic regression and fair neural network classifier using real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods over existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Linear Energy System Optimization: A Systematic Review on Parallelization Strategies via Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As renewable energy integration, sector coupling, and spatiotemporal detail increase, energy system optimization models grow in size and complexity, often pushing solvers to their performance limits. This systematic review explores parallelization strategies that can address these challenges. We first propose a classification scheme for linear energy system optimization models, covering their analytical focus, mathematical structure, and scope. We then review parallel decomposition methods, finding that while many offer performance benefits, no single approach is universally superior. The lack of standardized benchmark suites further complicates comparison. To address this, we recommend essential criteria for future benchmarks and minimum reporting standards. We also survey available software tools for parallel decomposition, including modular frameworks and algorithmic abstractions. Though centered on energy system models, our insights extend to the broader operations research field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore how warm-starting strategies can be integrated into scalarization-based approaches for multi-objective optimization in (mixed) integer linear programming. Scalarization methods remain widely used classical techniques to compute Pareto-optimal solutions in applied settings. They are favored due to their algorithmic simplicity and broad applicability across continuous and integer programs with an arbitrary number of objectives. While warm-starting has been applied in this context before, a systematic methodology and analysis remain lacking. We address this gap by providing a theoretical characterization of warm-starting within scalarization methods, focusing on the sequencing of subproblems. However, optimizing the order of subproblems to maximize warm-start efficiency may conflict with alternative criteria, such as early identification of infeasible regions. We quantify these trade-offs through an extensive computational study.</description>

      <title>Stable formulations for the Capacitated Facility Location Problem with Customer Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Simple Plant Location Problem with Order (SPLPO), the aim is to open a subset of plants to assign every customer taking into account their preferences. Customers rank the plants in strict order and are assigned to their favorite open plant, and the objective is to minimize the location plus allocation costs. Here, we study a generalization of the SPLPO named the Capacitated Facility Location Problem with Customer Preferences (CFLCP) where a limited number of customers can be allocated to each facility. We consider the global preference maximization setting, where the customers preferences are globally maximized. For this setting, we define three new types of stable allocations, namely customer stable, pairwise stable and cyclic-coalition stable allocations, and we provide two mixed-integer linear formulations for each setting. In particular, our cyclic-coalition stable formulations are Pareto optimal in a global-preference maximization setting, in the sense that no customer can improve their allocation without making another one worse off. We provide extensive computational experiments and compare the quality of our allocations with previous ones defined in the literature. As an additional result, we present a novel formulation that provides Pareto optimal matchings in the Capacitated House Allocation problem of maximum cardinality.</description>

      <title>Assessment of Quantitative Cyber-Physical Reliability of SCADA Systems in Autonomous Vehicle to Grid (V2G) Capable Smart Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into power grids via Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) system technology is increasing day by day, but these phenomena present both advantages and disadvantages. V2G can increase grid reliability by providing distributed energy storage and ancillary services. However, on the other hand, it has a scope that encompasses the cyber-physical attack surface of the national power grid, introducing new vulnerabilities in monitoring and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. This paper investigates the maliciousness caused by Autonomous Vehicle to Grid (AV2G) communication infrastructures and assesses their impacts on SCADA system reliability. This paper presents a quantitative reliability assessment using Bayesian attack graph combined with probabilistic capacity outage modeling based on IEEE RTS-79 system data. This work presents how AV2G-based attacks degrade system performance by using Monte Carlo simulations method, highlighting the need for cybersecurity-hardening strategies in smart grid design.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Control of Stochastic Oscillators via Periodic and Feedback Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of steering the phase distribution of oscillators all receiving the same control input to a given target distribution. In a large population limit, the distribution of oscillators can be described by a probability density. Then, our problem can be seen as that of ensemble control with a constraint on the steady-state density. In particular, we consider the case where oscillators are subject to stochastic noise, for which the theoretical understanding is still lacking. First, we characterize the reachability of the phase distribution under periodic feedforward control via the Fourier coefficients of the target density and the phase sensitivity function of oscillators. This enables us to design a periodic input that makes the stationary distribution of oscillators closest to the target by solving a convex optimization problem. Next, we devise an ensemble control method combining periodic and feedback control, where the feedback component is designed to accelerate the convergence of the distribution of oscillators. We exhibit some convergence results for the proposed method, including a result that holds even under measurement errors in the phase distribution. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Solving a real-world modular logistic scheduling problem with a quantum-classical metaheuristics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of a quantum-classical metaheuristic and a traditional classical mathematical programming solver, applied to two mathematical optimization models for an industry-relevant scheduling problem with autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs). The two models are: (1) a time-indexed mixed-integer linear program, and (2) a novel binary optimization problem with linear and quadratic constraints and a linear objective. Our experiments indicate that optimization methods are very susceptible to modeling techniques and different solvers require dedicated methods. We show in this work that quantum-classical metaheuristics can benefit from a new way of modeling mathematical optimization problems. Additionally, we present a detailed performance comparison of the two solution methods for each optimization model.</description>

      <title>Structure-Informed Deep Reinforcement Learning for Inventory Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to classical inventory management problems, with a focus on practical implementation considerations. We apply a DRL algorithm based on DirectBackprop to several fundamental inventory management scenarios including multi-period systems with lost sales (with and without lead times), perishable inventory management, dual sourcing, and joint inventory procurement and removal. The DRL approach learns policies across products using only historical information that would be available in practice, avoiding unrealistic assumptions about demand distributions or access to distribution parameters. We demonstrate that our generic DRL implementation performs competitively against or outperforms established benchmarks and heuristics across these diverse settings, while requiring minimal parameter tuning. Through examination of the learned policies, we show that the DRL approach naturally captures many known structural properties of optimal policies derived from traditional operations research methods. To further improve policy performance and interpretability, we propose a Structure-Informed Policy Network technique that explicitly incorporates analytically-derived characteristics of optimal policies into the learning process. This approach can help interpretability and add robustness to the policy in out-of-sample performance, as we demonstrate in an example with realistic demand data. Finally, we provide an illustrative application of DRL in a non-stationary setting. Our work bridges the gap between data-driven learning and analytical insights in inventory management while maintaining practical applicability.</description>

      <title>A Nonlinear MPC Framework for Loco-Manipulation of Quadrupedal Robots with Non-Negligible Manipulator Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) combined with reduced-order template models has emerged as a powerful tool for trajectory optimization in dynamic legged locomotion. However, loco-manipulation tasks performed by legged robots introduce additional complexity, necessitating computationally efficient MPC algorithms capable of handling high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) models. This letter presents a computationally efficient nonlinear MPC (NMPC) framework tailored for loco-manipulation tasks of quadrupedal robots equipped with robotic manipulators whose dynamics are non-negligible relative to those of the quadruped. The proposed framework adopts a decomposition strategy that couples locomotion template models -- such as the single rigid body (SRB) model -- with a full-order dynamic model of the robotic manipulator for torque-level control. This decomposition enables efficient real-time solution of the NMPC problem in a receding horizon fashion at 60 Hz. The optimal state and input trajectories generated by the NMPC for locomotion are tracked by a low-level nonlinear whole-body controller (WBC) running at 500 Hz, while the optimal torque commands for the manipulator are directly applied. The layered control architecture is validated through extensive numerical simulations and hardware experiments on a 15-kg Unitree Go2 quadrupedal robot augmented with a 4.4-kg 4-DoF Kinova arm. Given that the Kinova arm dynamics are non-negligible relative to the Go2 base, the proposed NMPC framework demonstrates robust stability in performing diverse loco-manipulation tasks, effectively handling external disturbances, payload variations, and uneven terrain.</description>

      <title>Weight-Parameterization in Continuous Time Deep Neural Networks for Surrogate Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous-time deep learning models, such as neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs), offer a promising framework for surrogate modeling of complex physical systems. A central challenge in training these models lies in learning expressive yet stable time-varying weights, particularly under computational constraints. This work investigates weight parameterization strategies that constrain the temporal evolution of weights to a low-dimensional subspace spanned by polynomial basis functions. We evaluate both monomial and Legendre polynomial bases within neural ODE and residual network (ResNet) architectures under discretize-then-optimize and optimize-then-discretize training paradigms. Experimental results across three high-dimensional benchmark problems show that Legendre parameterizations yield more stable training dynamics, reduce computational cost, and achieve accuracy comparable to or better than both monomial parameterizations and unconstrained weight models. These findings elucidate the role of basis choice in time-dependent weight parameterization and demonstrate that using orthogonal polynomial bases offers a favorable tradeoff between model expressivity and training efficiency.</description>

      <title>Majorization-minimization Bregman proximal gradient algorithms for NMF with the Kullback--Leibler divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11185v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a popular method in machine learning and signal processing to decompose a given nonnegative matrix into two nonnegative matrices. In this paper, we propose new algorithms, called majorization-minimization Bregman proximal gradient algorithm (MMBPG) and MMBPG with extrapolation (MMBPGe) to solve NMF. These iterative algorithms minimize the objective function and its potential function monotonically. Assuming the Kurdyka--\L{}ojasiewicz property, we establish that a sequence generated by MMBPG(e) globally converges to a stationary point. We apply MMBPG and MMBPGe to the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence-based NMF. While most existing KL-based NMF methods update two blocks or each variable alternately, our algorithms update all variables simultaneously. MMBPG and MMBPGe for KL-based NMF are equipped with a separable Bregman distance that satisfies the smooth adaptable property and that makes its subproblem solvable in closed form. Using this fact, we guarantee that a sequence generated by MMBPG(e) globally converges to a Karush--Kuhn--Tucker (KKT) point of KL-based NMF. In numerical experiments, we compare proposed algorithms with existing algorithms on synthetic data and real-world data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17491v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topology optimization problems usually feature multiple local minimizers. To guarantee convergence to local minimizers that perform best globally or to find local solutions that are desirable for practical applications due to easy manufacturability or aesthetic designs, it is important to compute multiple local minimizers of topology optimization problems. In this paper, we introduce a novel deflation approach to systematically find multiple local minimizers of general topology optimization problems. The approach is based on a penalization of previously found local solutions in the objective. We validate our approach on the so-called two-pipes five-holes example. Finally, we introduce a model for the topology optimization of bipolar plates of hydrogen electrolysis cells and demonstrate that our deflation approach enables the discovery of novel designs for such plates.</description>

      <title>A Riemannian approach for PDE constrained shape optimization over the diffeomorphism group using outer metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the use of outer metrics, in particular Sobolev-type metrics on the diffeomorphism group in the context of PDE-constrained shape optimization. Leveraging the structure of the diffeomorphism group we analyze the connection between the push-forward of a smooth function defined on the diffeomorphism group and the classical shape derivative as an Eulerian semi-derivative. We consider in particular, two predominant examples on PDE-constrained shape optimization. An electric impedance tomography inspired problem, and the optimization of a two-dimensional bridge. These problems are numerically solved using the Riemannian steepest descent method where the descent directions are taken to be the Riemannian gradients associated to various outer metrics. For comparison reasons, we also solve the problem using other previously proposed Riemannian metrics in particular the Steklov-Poincar\'e metric.</description>

      <title>Robust Capacity Expansion Modelling for Renewable Energy Systems under Weather Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future greenhouse gas neutral energy systems will be dominated by renewable energy technologies whose energy output is subject to uncertain weather conditions. This work proposes an algorithm to do capacity expansion planning (CAPEX) under weather uncertainty. When faced with multiple possible weather years, the quality of a CAPEX solution derived on a single year's data is evaluated across all years, and the CAPEX optimisation problem is iteratively modified whenever supply gaps are detected. These modifications lead to solutions with sufficient back--up capacity to overcome periods of (cold) dark lulls, and sufficient total annual energy supply across all years. A computational study on an energy system model of Germany shows that the iterative algorithm finds solutions that guarantee security of supply for all considered weather years for an increase of 1.6-2.9% in total annual cost compared to initial solutions. Results also underline the importance of assessing the feasibility of energy system models using atypical time--series, including dark lull and cold period effects.</description>

      <title>A Practical Guide to Optimizing Industrial Thermal Spraying through Comparative Multi-Objective Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving both high quality and cost-efficiency are two critical yet often conflicting objectives in manufacturing and maintenance processes. Quality standards vary depending on the specific application, while cost-effectiveness remains a constant priority. These competing objectives lead to multi-objective optimization problems, where algorithms are employed to identify Pareto-optimal solutions - compromise points which provide decision-makers with feasible parameter settings. The successful application of such optimization algorithms relies on the ability to model the underlying physical system, which is typically complex, through either physical or data-driven approaches, and to represent it mathematically. This paper applies three multi-objective optimization algorithms to determine optimal process parameters for high-velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) thermal spraying. Their ability to enhance coating performance while maintaining process efficiency is systematically evaluated, considering practical constraints and industrial feasibility. Practical validation trials are conducted to verify the approximate theoretical solutions generated by the algorithms, ensuring their applicability and reliability in real-world scenarios. By exploring the performance of these diverse algorithms in an industrial setting, this study offers insights into their practical applicability, guiding both researchers and practitioners in enhancing process efficiency and product quality in the coating industry.</description>

      <title>Nonconvex Optimization Framework for Group-Sparse Feedback Linear-Quadratic Optimal Control. I: Penalty Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a unified nonconvex optimization framework for the design of group-sparse feedback controllers in infinite-horizon linear-quadratic (LQ) problems. We address two prominent extensions of the classical LQ problem: the distributed LQ problem with fixed communication topology (DFT-LQ) and the sparse feedback LQ problem (SF-LQ), both of which are motivated by the need for scalable and structure-aware control in large-scale systems. Unlike existing approaches that rely on convex relaxations or are limited to block-diagonal structures, we directly formulate the controller synthesis as a finite-dimensional nonconvex optimization problem with group $\ell_0$-norm regularization, capturing general sparsity patterns. We establish a connection between DFT-LQ and SF-LQ problems, showing that both can be addressed within our unified framework. Furthermore, we propose a penalty-based proximal alternating linearized minimization (PALM) algorithm and provide a rigorous convergence analysis under mild assumptions, overcoming the lack of coercivity in the objective function. The proposed method admits efficient solvers for all subproblems and guarantees global convergence to critical points. Our results fill a key gap in the literature by enabling the direct design of group-sparse feedback gains with theoretical guarantees, without resorting to convex surrogates or restrictive structural assumptions.</description>

      <title>Two-Person Additively-Separable Sum Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a subclass of bimatrix games which we refer to as two person additively separable sum games, where the sum of the payoffs of the two players is additively separable. The payoff to the row player at each pair of pure strategies, is the sum of two numbers, the first of which may be dependent on the pure strategy chosen by the column player and the second being independent of the pure strategy chosen by the column player. The payoff to the column player at each pair of pure strategies, is also the sum of two numbers, the first of which may be dependent on the pure strategy chosen by the row player and the second being independent of the pure strategy chosen by the row player. The sum of the interdependent components of the payoffs of the two players is assumed to be zero. We show that a randomized or mixed strategy pair is an equilibrium of the game if and only if there exist two other real numbers such that the three together solve a certain linear programming problem. In order to prove this result, we need to appeal to the existence of an equilibrium for the two person additively separable sum game. Before proving the desired result concerning the equivalence of the two sets, we provide a simple proof of the existence of equilibrium for two person additively separable sum games, using the strong duality theorem and the complementary slackness theorem of linear programming.</description>

Abstract: It is well known that solving a (non-convex) quadratic program is NP-hard. We show that the problem remains hard even if we are only looking for a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point, instead of a global optimum. Namely, we prove that computing a KKT point of a quadratic polynomial over the domain $[0,1]^n$ is complete for the class CLS = PPAD$\cap$PLS.</description>

      <title>Kernel Modelling of Fading Memory Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11945v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper is a follow-up of the recently introduced kernel-based framework to identify nonlinear input-output systems regularized by desirable input-output incremental properties. Assuming that the system has fading memory, we propose to learn the functional that maps the past input to the present output rather than the operator mapping input trajectories to output trajectories. While retaining the benefits of the previously proposed framework, this modification simplifies the selection of the kernel, enforces causality, and enables temporal simulation.</description>

      <title>Randomized Kaczmarz Methods with Beyond-Krylov Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomized Kaczmarz methods form a family of linear system solvers which converge by repeatedly projecting their iterates onto randomly sampled equations. While effective in some contexts, such as highly over-determined least squares, Kaczmarz methods are traditionally deemed secondary to Krylov subspace methods, since this latter family of solvers can exploit outliers in the input's singular value distribution to attain fast convergence on ill-conditioned systems.
  In this paper, we introduce Kaczmarz++, an accelerated randomized block Kaczmarz algorithm that exploits outlying singular values in the input to attain a fast Krylov-style convergence. Moreover, we show that Kaczmarz++ captures large outlying singular values provably faster than popular Krylov methods, for both over- and under-determined systems. We also develop an optimized variant for positive semidefinite systems, called CD++, demonstrating empirically that it is competitive in arithmetic operations with both CG and GMRES on a collection of benchmark problems. To attain these results, we introduce several novel algorithmic improvements to the Kaczmarz framework, including adaptive momentum acceleration, Tikhonov-regularized projections, and a memoization scheme for reusing information from previously sampled equation blocks.</description>

      <title>The Performance Of The Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm Without Smoothness Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03458v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the problem of sampling from distributions whose densities are not necessarily smooth nor logconcave. We propose a simple Langevin-based algorithm that does not rely on popular but computationally challenging techniques, such as the Moreau-Yosida envelope or Gaussian smoothing, and show consequently that the performance of samplers like ULA does not necessarily degenerate arbitrarily with low regularity. In particular, we show that the Lipschitz or H\"older continuity assumption can be replaced by a geometric one-sided Lipschitz condition that allows even for discontinuous log-gradients. We derive non-asymptotic guarantees for the convergence of the algorithm to the target distribution in Wasserstein distances. Non-asymptotic bounds are also provided for the performance of the algorithm as an optimizer, specifically for the solution of associated excess risk optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Position: Adopt Constraints Over Penalties in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20628v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent efforts to develop trustworthy AI systems with accountability guarantees have led to widespread use of machine learning formulations incorporating external requirements, or constraints. These requirements are often enforced via penalization--adding fixed-weight terms to the task loss. We argue this approach is fundamentally ill-suited since there may be no penalty coefficient that simultaneously ensures constraint satisfaction and optimal constrained performance, i.e., that truly solves the constrained problem. Moreover, tuning these coefficients requires costly trial-and-error, incurring significant time and computational overhead. We, therefore, advocate for broader adoption of tailored constrained optimization methods--such as the Lagrangian approach, which jointly optimizes the penalization "coefficients" (the Lagrange multipliers) and the model parameters. Such methods (i) truly solve the constrained problem and do so accountably, by clearly defining feasibility and verifying when it is achieved, (ii) eliminate the need for extensive penalty tuning, and (iii) integrate seamlessly with modern deep learning pipelines.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Large Portfolio Optimization for Variance Minimization with Neural Networks through Covariance Cleaning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a rotation-invariant neural network that provides the global minimum-variance portfolio by jointly learning how to lag-transform historical returns and how to regularise both the eigenvalues and the marginal volatilities of large equity covariance matrices. This explicit mathematical mapping offers clear interpretability of each module's role, so the model cannot be regarded as a pure black-box. The architecture mirrors the analytical form of the global minimum-variance solution yet remains agnostic to dimension, so a single model can be calibrated on panels of a few hundred stocks and applied, without retraining, to one thousand US equities-a cross-sectional jump that demonstrates robust out-of-sample generalisation. The loss function is the future realized minimum portfolio variance and is optimized end-to-end on real daily returns. In out-of-sample tests from January 2000 to December 2024 the estimator delivers systematically lower realised volatility, smaller maximum drawdowns, and higher Sharpe ratios than the best analytical competitors, including state-of-the-art non-linear shrinkage. Furthermore, although the model is trained end-to-end to produce an unconstrained (long-short) minimum-variance portfolio, we show that its learned covariance representation can be used in general optimizers under long-only constraints with virtually no loss in its performance advantage over competing estimators. These gains persist when the strategy is executed under a highly realistic implementation framework that models market orders at the auctions, empirical slippage, exchange fees, and financing charges for leverage, and they remain stable during episodes of acute market stress.</description>

      <title>Prediction accuracy versus rescheduling flexibility in elective surgery management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The availability of downstream resources plays is critical in planning the admission of elective surgery patients. The most crucial one is inpatient beds. To ensure bed availability, hospitals may use machine learning (ML) models to predict patients' length-of-stay (LOS) in the admission planning stage. However, the real value of the LOS for each patient may differ from the predicted one, potentially making the schedule infeasible. To address such infeasibilities, it is possible to implement rescheduling strategies that take advantage of operational flexibility. For example, planners may postpone admission dates, relocate patients to different wards, or even transfer patients who are already admitted among wards. A straightforward assumption is that better LOS predictions can help reduce the impact of rescheduling. However, the training process of ML models that can make such accurate predictions can be very costly. Building on previous work that proposed simulated ML for evaluating data-driven approaches, this paper explores the relationship between LOS prediction accuracy and rescheduling flexibility across various corrective policies. Specifically, we examine the most effective patient rescheduling strategies under LOS prediction errors to prevent bed overflows while optimizing resource utilization</description>
