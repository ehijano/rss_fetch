      <title>Realizing pairs of multicurves as cylinders on translation surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any pair of intersecting cylinders on a translation surface is "coherent," in that the geometric and algebraic intersection numbers of their core curves are equal (up to sign). In this paper, we investigate when a pair of multicurves can be simultaneously realized as the core curves of cylinders on some translation surface. Our main tools are surface topology and the "flat grafting" deformation introduced by Ser-Wei Fu.</description>

      <title>On the homotopy type of the space of fiberings of $S^1 \times S^2$ by simple closed curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For most aspherical Seifert-fibered 3-manifolds $M$, the space of Seifert fiberings $SF(M)$ is known to have contractible components. It is also known that the space of Hopf fiberings of the three-sphere is noncontractible. We provide the second example of a non-aspherical 3-manifold $M$ such that $SF(M)$ has noncontractible components. In particular, we show that certain components of $SF(S^1 \times S^2)$ are homotopy equivalent to a subspace homeomorphic to the identity-based loop space $\Omega SO(3)$, and we exhibit second homology generators for both connected components of $SF(S^1 \times S^2)$.</description>

      <title>Involutive Khovanov homology and equivariant knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define an involutive version of Khovanov homology and a pair of integer-valued invariants $(\underline{s}, \bar{s})$ for strongly invertible knots, which is an equivariant version of the Rasmussen invariant $s$. Using these invariants, we show that there is an infinite family of knots $J_n$ admitting exotic pairs of slice disks. Our construction is intended to give a Khovanov-theoretic analogue of the formalism given by Dai, Mallick and Stoffregen in knot Floer theory.</description>

      <title>Symplectic mapping class relations from pencil pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe symplectic mapping class relations between products of positive Dehn twists along Lagrangian spheres in Weinstein $4$-manifolds, all of which are affine $\mathbb{C}$ varieties. The relations are obtained by applying classification results for Fano $3$-folds and polarized $K_{3}$ surfaces of small genus to a general methodology -- finding pencil pairs.</description>

      <title>Finite quotients of 3-manifold groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.01140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $G$ and $H_1,\dots, H_n$ finite groups, does there exist a $3$-manifold group with $G$ as a quotient but no $H_i$ as a quotient? We answer all such questions in terms of the group cohomology of finite groups. We prove non-existence with topological results generalizing the theory of semicharacteristics. To prove existence of 3-manifolds with certain finite quotients but not others, we use a probabilistic method, by first proving a formula for the distribution of the (profinite completion of) the fundamental group of a random 3-manifold in the Dunfield-Thurston model of random Heegaard splittings as the genus goes to infinity. We believe this is the first construction of a new distribution of random groups from its moments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.01973v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study crystallographic sphere packings and Kleinian sphere packings, introduced first by Kontorovich and Nakamura in 2017 and then studied further by Kapovich and Kontorovich in 2021. In particular, we solve the problem of existence of crystallographic sphere packings in certain higher dimensions posed by Kontorovich and Nakamura. In addition, we present a geometric doubling procedure allowing to obtain sphere packings from some Coxeter polyhedra without isolated roots, and study "properly integral" packings (that is, ones which are integral but not superintegral). Our techniques rely extensively on computations with Lorentzian quadratic forms, their orthogonal groups, and associated higher-dimensional hyperbolic polyhedra.</description>

      <title>Notions of Anosov representation of relatively hyperbolic groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that divergent, extended geometrically finite (in the sense of Weisman arXiv:2205.07183) representations can be interpreted as restricted Anosov (in the sense of Tholozan--Wang arXiv:2307.02934) representations over certain flow spaces. We also show that the representations of this type are stable under small type preserving deformations. As an example, we show that a representation induced from a geometrically finite one through a Galois covering, constructed in Tholozan--Wang arXiv:2307.02934, is divergent and extended geometrically finite with a non-homeomorphic boundary extension.</description>

      <title>Torsion in Kauffman bracket skein module of a $4$-strand Montesinos knot exterior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an oriented $3$-manifold $M$, let $\mathcal{S}(M)$ denote its Kauffman bracket skein module. Problem 1.92 (G) (i) in the Kirby's list asks whether $\mathcal{S}(M)$ is free when $M$ is irreducible and has no incompressible non-parallel to the boundary torus. We answer this negatively by showing that $\mathcal{S}(M)$ admits infinitely many torsion elements when $M$ is the complement of a $4$-strand Montesinos knot in $S^3$.</description>

      <title>Monopoles and transverse knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a framework for studying transverse knots and symplectic surfaces utilizing the Seiberg-Witten monopole equation. Our primary approach involves investigating an equivariant Seiberg-Witten theory introduced by Baraglia-Hekmati on branched covers, incorporating invariant contact/symplectic structures.
  Within this framework, we introduce a novel slice-torus invariant denoted as $q_M(K)$. This invariant can be viewed as the Seiberg-Witten analog of Hendricks-Lipshitz-Sarker's $q_\tau$ invariant, with a signature correction term. One property of the invariant $q_M(K)$ is an adjunction equality for properly embedded connected symplectic surfaces in the symplectic filling $D^4\# m \overline{\mathbb{C}P}^2$. The proof of this equality utilizes the equivariant version of the homotopical contact invariant introduced by the authors, leading to a transverse knot invariant. Another ingredient of the proof involves constructing invariant symplectic structures on branched covering spaces branched along properly embedded symplectic surfaces in symplectic fillings. As an application of the invariant $q_M(K)$, we determine the value of any slice-torus invariant within a permissible deviation of $2$ for squeezed knots concordant to certain Montesinos knots. Additionally, we provide an obstruction to realizing second homology classes of $D^4 \#m \overline{\mathbb{C}P}^2$ as connected embedded symplectic surfaces with transverse knot boundary or connected embedded Lagrangian surfaces with collarable Legendrian knot boundary. Moreover, we introduce a new obstruction to certain Montesinos knots being quasipositive, which is described only in terms of slice genera and their signatures.</description>

      <title>An unoriented analogue of slice-torus invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A slice-torus invariant is an $\mathbb{R}$-valued homomorphism on the knot concordance group whose value gives a lower bound for the 4-genus such that the equality holds for any positive torus knot. Such invariants have been discovered in many of knot homology theories, while it is known that any slice-torus invariant does not factor through the topological concordance group. In this paper, we introduce the notion of "unoriented slice-torus invariant", which can be regarded as the same as slice-torus invariant except for the condition about the orientability of surfaces. Then we show that the Ozsv\'ath-Stipsicz-Szab\'o $\upsilon$-invariant, the Ballinger $t$-invariant and the Daemi-Scaduto $h_{\mathbb{Z}}$-invariant (shifted by a half of the knot signature) are unoriented slice-torus invariants. As an application, we give a new method for computing the above invariants, which is analogous to Livingston's method for computing slice-torus invariants. Moreover, we use the method to prove that any unoriented slice-torus invariant does not factor through the topological concordance group.</description>
