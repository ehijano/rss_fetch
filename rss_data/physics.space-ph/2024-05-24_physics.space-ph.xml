      <title>MHD modeling of a geoeffective interplanetary CME with the magnetic topology informed by in-situ observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variations of the magnetic field within solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the heliosphere depend on the CME`s magnetic structure as it leaves the solar corona and its subsequent evolution through interplanetary space. To account for this evolution, we developed a new numerical model of the inner heliosphere that simulates the propagation of a CME through a realistic background solar wind and allows various CME magnetic topologies. To this end, we incorporate the Gibson-Low CME model within our global MHD model of the inner heliosphere, GAMERA-Helio. We apply the model to study the propagation of the geoeffective CME that erupted on 3 April, 2010 with the aim to reproduce the temporal variations of the magnetic field vector during the CME passage by Earth. Parameters of the Gibson-Low CME are informed by STEREO white-light observations near the Sun. The magnetic topology for this CME - the tethered flux rope - is informed by in-situ magnetic field observations near Earth. We performed two simulations testing different CME propagation directions. For an in-ecliptic direction, the simulation shows a rotation of all three magnetic field components within the CME, as seen at Earth, similar to that observed. With a southward propagation direction, suggested by coronal imaging observations, the modeled By and Bz components are consistent with the ACE data, but the Bx component lacks the observed change from negative to positive. In both cases, the model favors the East-West orientation of the CME flux rope, consistent with the orientation previously inferred from the STEREO/HI heliospheric images.</description>

      <title>Turbulent Thermal Equilibration of Collisionless Magnetospheric Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How thermal equilibrium is determined in a weakly collisional plasma is a fundamental question in plasma physics. This letter shows that the turbulence driven by the magnetic curvature and density gradient tends to equilibrate the temperature between species without collisions in a magnetospheric plasma. The classical stability analysis in terms of energetic consideration reveals the interchangeable roles of electrons and ions for destabilization depending on their temperatures. Nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations confirm that the higher-temperature destabilizing species gives free energy to heat the other species to achieve the equal temperature state.</description>

      <title>Multi-instrument analysis of L-band amplitude scintillation observed over the Eastern Arabian Peninsula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the spatial and temporal characteristics of L1 amplitude scintillation-causing ionospheric irregularities over the Eastern Arabian Peninsula during the ascending phase of solar cycle 25 (years 2020--2023). The temporal occurrences of weak and strong scintillation were separated by sunset, with weak scintillation observed predominantly pre-sunset during the winter solstice and strong scintillation observed mainly post-sunset during the autumnal equinox. Strong scintillation was much more pronounced in 2023 compared to the other three years, indicating a strong influence of solar activity. Spatially, weak-scintillation-causing irregularities exhibited a wide distribution in azimuth and elevation, while strong-scintillation-causing irregularities were concentrated southwards. The combined analysis of S4 and rate of total electron content index (ROTI) suggested that small-scale ionospheric irregularities were present in both pre- and post-sunset periods, while large-scale irregularities were only seen during the post-sunset period. Furthermore, the presence of southward traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) during the 2023 autumnal equinox was confirmed with the total electron content anomaly ($\Delta\text{TEC}$), while the Ionospheric Bubble Index (IBI) provided by the Swarm mission was unable to confirm the presence of equatorial plasma bubbles during the same period. Observations from the FORMOSAT-7/COSMIC-2 mission indicated that strong-scintillation-causing irregularities were more prevalent under the F2-layer peak, while the weak-scintillation-causing irregularities were mostly observed at the E-layer, F2-layer, and above the F2-layer.</description>

      <title>Comparative simulations of Kelvin-Helmholtz induced magnetic reconnection at the Earth's magnetospheric flanks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents three-dimensional (3D) resistive Hall-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) dynamics at Earth's magnetospheric flanks during northward interplanetary magnetic field periods. By comparing two simulations with and without initial magnetic shear, we analyze the impact of distinct magnetic field orientations on plasma dynamics and magnetic reconnection events taking into account 3D mechanisms, such as KHI high latitude stabilization. The identical nature of the simulations, except for the presence/absence of an initial magnetic shear, enables, for the first time, a complete and coherent comparative analysis of the latitudinal distribution of KH vortices, current sheets, reconnection events, and the evolution of the mixing layer. In one configuration, a uniform magnetic field leads to double mid-latitude reconnection (MLR), while in the other, magnetic shear induces both type I vortex-induced reconnection (VIR) and MLR. Notably, the type I VIR observed in this second scenario results from the combined action of line advection and vortex-induced current sheet pinching (the classic mechanism driving two-dimensional type I VIR). Of particular importance is our quantification of newly closed field lines that experienced double reconnection, ultimately becoming embedded in solar wind plasma at low latitudes while remaining connected to magnetospheric plasma at high latitudes. The varying abundance of such lines in the two simulations holds implications for plasma transport at the magnetopause.</description>
