      <title>The Effects of Linear Matter Power Spectrum Enhancement on Dark Matter Substructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present cosmological dark matter (DM)--only zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way (MW) analog originating from enhanced linear matter power spectra $P(k)$ relative to the standard cold, collisionless DM (CDM) cosmology. We consider a Gaussian power excess in $P(k)$ followed by a cutoff in select cases; this behavior could arise from early-universe physics that alters the primordial matter power spectrum or DM physics in the radiation-dominated epoch. We find that enhanced initial conditions (ICs) lead to qualitative differences in substructure relative to CDM. In particular, the subhalo mass function (SHMF) resulting from ICs with both an enhancement and cutoff is amplified at high masses and suppressed at low masses, indicating that DM substructure is sensitive to features in $P(k)$. Critically, the amplitude and shape of the SHMF enhancement depend on the wave number of the $P(k)$ excess and the presence or absence of a cutoff on smaller scales. These alterations to the SHMF are mainly imprinted at infall rather than during tidal evolution. Additionally, subhalos are found systematically closer to the host center and their concentrations are increased in scenarios with $P(k)$ enhancement. Thus, nonlinear mode coupling must be captured to enable $P(k)$ reconstruction using DM substructure.</description>

      <title>Strong scale-dependence does not enhance the kinematic boosting of gravitational wave backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing expressions in the literature appear to indicate that Doppler boosting, due to our proper motion with respect to the isotropic frame of the universe, can amplify stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds whose energy spectra exhibit strong scale dependence, for example, those generated by large scalar perturbations in models of primordial black holes or by astrophysical populations with broken power-law behaviour. It has been suggested that this enhancement could increase the signal-to-noise ratio of such backgrounds in pulsar timing measurements, as well as in ground- and space-based observatories. We show that the reported enhancement is an artefact of a Taylor expansion of the boosted signal, typically performed in the literature under the assumption of a small boosting parameter. This approximation fails to reproduce the correct result for signals with strong scale dependence. When Doppler boosting is treated exactly, the apparent amplification disappears. Using representative spectra, we demonstrate that Doppler motion induces only blue- and red-shifting by the expected amount; it does not lead to additional amplification or introduce new spectral features. The exact expression for the kinematic boost can and should be easily applied in analysing such backgrounds.</description>

      <title>A unified spin-harmonic framework for correlating pulsar timing, astrometric deflection, and shimmering gravitational wave observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified spin-weighted harmonic framework that delivers analytic, diagonal expressions for the overlap (correlation) functions of three low frequency gravitational wave observables-pulsar timing redshifts, astrometric deflections, and time-dependent image distortions (``shimmering''). Writing each response in spin-$s$ spherical harmonics and rotating to a basis in which the wave tensor has definite helicity, we obtain compact closed-form series for every auto- and cross-correlation, recovering the Hellings-Downs curve as the $s=0$ limit and deriving its astrometric ($s=\pm 1$) and shimmering ($s=\pm 2$) analogues. The formalism naturally extends to non-standard scalar-breathing, longitudinal, and vector polarisation modes, clarifying when higher-spin observables are (and are not) sourced and providing a complete set of harmonic spectra $C_\ell$ ready for parameter estimation pipelines. These results supply the common theoretical language needed to combine upcoming pulsar timing, Gaia-class astrometric, and high resolution imaging data sets, enabling coherent, multi probe searches for stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds, tests of general relativity and its alternatives across the nano- to micro-hertz gravitational wave band.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Masses of the Two Most Distant Gravitational Lensing Clusters at the Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations over the past decade have shown that galaxy clusters undergo the most transformative changes during the $z = 1.5 - 2$ epoch. However, challenges such as low lensing efficiency, high shape measurement uncertainty, and a scarcity of background galaxies have prevented us from characterizing their masses with weak gravitational lensing (WL) beyond the redshift $z\sim1.75$. In this paper, we report the successful WL detection of JKCS 041 and XLSSC 122 at $z=1.80$ and $z=1.98$, respectively, utilizing deep infrared imaging data from the Hubble Space Telescope with careful removal of instrumental effects. These are the most distant clusters ever measured through WL. The mass peaks of JKCS 041 and XLSSC 122, which coincide with the X-ray peak positions of the respective clusters, are detected at the $\sim3.7\sigma$ and $\sim3.2\sigma$ levels, respectively. Assuming a single spherical Navarro-Frenk-White profile, we estimate that JKCS 041 has a virial mass of $M_{200c} = (5.4\pm1.6) \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$ while the mass of XLSSC 122 is determined to be $M_{200c} = (3.3\pm1.8) \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$. These WL masses are consistent with the estimates inferred from their X-ray observations. We conclude that although the probability of finding such massive clusters at their redshifts is certainly low, their masses can still be accommodated within the current $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.</description>

      <title>Tidal adaptive softening and artificial fragmentation in cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional N-body methods introduce localised perturbations in the gravitational forces governing their evolution. These perturbations lead to an artificial fragmentation in the filamentary network of the Large Scale Structure, often referred to as "beads-on-a-string." This issue is particularly apparent in cosmologies with a suppression of the matter power spectrum at small spatial scales, such as warm dark matter models, where the perturbations induced by the N-body discretisation dominate the cosmological power at the suppressed scales. Initial conditions based on third-order Lagrangian perturbation theory, which allow for a late-starting redshift, have been shown to minimise numerical errors contributing to such artefacts. In this work, we investigate whether the additional use of a spatially adaptive softening for dark matter particles, based on the gravitational tidal field, can reduce the severity of artificial fragmentation. Tidal adaptive softening significantly improves force accuracy in idealised filamentary collapse simulations over a fixed softening approach. However, it does not substantially reduce spurious haloes in cosmological simulations when paired with such optimised initial conditions. Nevertheless, tidal adaptive softening induces a shift in halo formation times in warm dark matter simulations compared to a fixed softening counterpart, an effect not seen in cold dark matter simulations. Furthermore, initialising the initial conditions at an earlier redshift generally results in z=0 haloes forming from Lagrangian volumes with lower average sphericity. This sphericity difference could impact post-processing algorithms identifying spurious objects based on Lagrangian volume morphology. We propose potential strategies for reducing spurious haloes without abandoning current N-body methods.</description>

      <title>Bye binormal: analysing the joint PDF of galaxy density and weak lensing convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At any given scale, 3$\times$2-point statistics extract only three numbers from the joint distribution of the cosmic matter density and galaxy density fluctuations: their variances and their covariance. It is well known that the full shape of the PDF of those fluctuations contains significantly more information than can be accessed through these three numbers. But the study of the PDF of cosmic density fluctuations in real observational data is still in its infancy. Here we present \verb|CosMomentum|, a public software toolkit for calculating theoretical predictions for the full shape of the joint distribution of a line-of-sight projected tracer density and the gravitational lensing convergence. We demonstrate that an analysis of this full shape of the PDF can indeed disentangle complicated tracer bias and stochasticity relations from signatures of cosmic structure growth. Our paper also provides back-drop for an upcoming follow-up study, which prepares PDF analyses for application to observational data by incorporating the impact of realistic weak lensing systematics.</description>

      <title>Monodromic Dark Energy and DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration have renewed interest in dynamical dark energy models, particularly those that cross the "phantom divide" ($w_{\rm DE} = -1$). We present the first observational constraints on monodromic k-essence, a physically motivated scalar field dark energy scenario capable of realizing rapid oscillations about the phantom divide. Using cosmic microwave background (CMB) information, DESI DR2 BAO measurements, and Type Ia supernovae observations, we constrain the amplitude, frequency, phase, and power-law index describing the monodromic k-essence scenario at the background level. We find that the monodromic dark energy scenario can fit these datasets with a $\chi^2$ that is comparable to the phenomenological $w_0$-$w_a$ parametrization. While the CMB and BAO data alone are consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, the inclusion of DESY5 supernovae shows a preference for a non-zero amplitude, $A=0.44^{+0.16}_{-0.12}$ (fully marginalized 68% C.L.). Conversely, inclusion of the Pantheon-Plus supernovae provides no evidence for monodromic k-essence, with $A&lt;0.43$ (95% C.L.). We show that constraints on both monodromic dark energy and $w_0$-$w_a$ models are sensitive to the DESI DR2 LRG2 BAO distance, especially in the absence of supernovae data.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Impact of 2D and 3D BAO Measurements on the Cosmic Distance Duality Relation with HII Galaxy observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) is a fundamental and practical condition in observational cosmology that connects the luminosity distance and angular diameter distance. Testing its validity offers a powerful tool to probe new physics beyond the standard cosmological model. In this work, for the first time, we present a novel consistency test of CDDR by combining HII galaxy data with a comprehensive set of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements. The BAO measurements include two-dimensional (2D) BAO and three-dimensional (3D) BAO, as well as the latest 3D BAO data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2). We adopt four different parameterizations of the CDDR parameter, $\eta(z)$, to investigate possible deviations and their evolution with cosmic time. To ensure accurate redshift matching across datasets, we reconstruct the distance measures through a model-independent Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach. Our analysis uniquely examines two distinct approaches: $i)$ marginalization over the BAO sound horizon $r_d$, and $ii)$ fixing $r_d$ to specific values. We find no significant deviation from the CDDR (less than 68% confidence level) in either the marginalized $r_d$ or the $r_d=147.05$ Mpc scenario. However, a slight deviation at the 68% confidence level is found when applying 2D-BAO data with $r_d=139.5$ Mpc. Furthermore, our analysis shows that all BAO data considered in this work support the validity of the CDDR, where 3D-DESI BAO provides the tightest constraints. We find no tension between 2D and 3D BAO measurements, which confirms their mutual consistency. In addition, the treatment of the sound horizon $r_d$ significantly impacts $\eta(z)$ constraints, which proves its importance in CDDR tests. Finally, the consistency of our results supports the standard CDDR and demonstrates the robustness of our analytical approach.</description>

      <title>Tightening constraints on primordial oscillations with latest ACT and SPT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The oscillation in primordial power spectrum (PPS), a fingerprint of not only a wide class of models of inflation but new physics, is of significant theoretical interest, and can be imprinted on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In this work, we present constraints on periodic oscillations in the PPS using the latest ACT DR6 and SPT-3G D1 CMB data with the precise measurements at high multipoles beyond the Planck angular resolution and sensitivity. It is found that the combination of SPT and ACT with Planck CMB dataset significantly tightens the upper bound to $A_\mathrm{log,lin}\lesssim 0.029$ at 95\% C.L., showing no hint for primordial oscillations, where $A_\mathrm{log,lin}$ are the amplitudes of logarithmic and linear oscillation in the PPS, respectively. Our work presents state-of-the-art CMB constraints on primordial oscillations, highlighting the power of the ground-based CMB experiments in constraining physics beyond the simplest slow-roll models.</description>

      <title>Prospects for searching for sterile neutrinos in dynamical dark energy cosmologies using joint observations of gravitational waves and $\gamma$-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, GW standard siren observations from binary neutron star mergers provide a powerful tool for probing the expansion history of the universe. Since sterile neutrinos can influence cosmic evolution by modifying the radiation content and suppressing structure formation, GW standard sirens offer promising prospects for constraining sterile neutrino properties within a cosmological framework. Building on this, we investigate the prospects for detecting sterile neutrinos in dynamical dark energy (DE) models using joint observations from 3G GW detectors and a future short gamma-ray burst detector, such as a THESEUS-like telescope. We consider three DE models: the $w$CDM, holographic DE (HDE), and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) models. Our results show that the properties of DE can influence the constraints on sterile neutrino parameters. Moreover, the inclusion of GW data significantly improves constraints on both sterile neutrino parameters and other cosmological parameters across all three models, compared to the current limits derived from CMB+BAO+SN (CBS) observations. When GW data are included into the CBS dataset, a preference for $\Delta N_{\rm eff} &gt; 0$ emerges at approximately the $1\sigma$ level in the $w$CDM and CPL models, and reaches about $3\sigma$ in the HDE model. Moreover, the upper limits on $m_{\nu,{\rm sterile}}^{\rm eff}$ are reduced by approximately 13%, 75%, and 3% in the $w$CDM, HDE, and CPL models, respectively.</description>

      <title>CMB constraints on $U(1)$ axion warm inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a model of warm inflation driven by axion-like particles interacting with $U(1)$ gauge fields, with implications for the early universe's thermal evolution. By extending traditional warm inflation models, we introduce a dissipation mechanism through the thermal fluctuations of electromagnetic fields, leading to a non-trivial backreaction on the inflaton's dynamics. Our results are consistent with CMB observations, even for a natural sub-Plankian axion decay constant $f&lt;M_{\rm Pl}$. We present precise constraints on the model's free parameters, using CAMB and CosmoMC codes. These findings offer new insights into the thermal history of the universe and the nature of inflationary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Fossils Beyond Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we provide the missing link between two approaches aimed at characterizing the effect of long perturbation modes in Inflation. We consider the Inflationary Fossils' approach (arXiv:1203.0302 and related works) that characterizes the power-spectrum of the inflaton field in presence of other long and non dynamical fossil fields, and a technique, appeared in arXiv:2103.09244, that computes, beyond perturbation theory, the power-spectrum of a scalar field in presence of a large fluctuation of a second field. We clarify a few points on the applicability of the non-perturbative technique. We prove in five distinct cases that the non-perturbative approach, once expanded to first order in the coupling, matches the perturbative result following the Fossils' approach. We believe that this non-perturbative technique extends to all orders the Fossils' approach, resumming infinitely many diagrams of standard in-in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Estimating the baryon fraction in the IGM from well-localized FRBs and DESI data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey (DESI DR2), when combined with data from Type Ia supernovae (SNe), challenge the observational viability of the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, motivating combinations of independent datasets to estimate cosmological quantities. In a previous communication, we presented a cosmological independent method to constrain the baryon fraction in the IGM ($f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$), where we derived relevant expressions for the dispersion measure ($\mathrm{DM}$) in terms of luminosity distance, allowing us to estimate $f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$ combining directly measurements of 17 well-localized FRBs and 1048 SNe from the Pantheon catalog. Here we revisit this method to constrain $f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$, considering two parameterizations for the $f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$: constant and time-dependent. We expand our sample by combining 107 well-localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) with BAO measurements from DESI DR2 and SNe observations from DESY5, and the Pantheon+ catalog. We find through a Bayesian model selection analysis that a conclusive answer about the evolution of $f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$ cannot be achieved from the current FRBs observational data. In particular, our results show weak evidence in favor of the constant case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a standard minimally-coupled scalar-field inflationary scenario, which is based on a new potential, with suitably generalized plateau features, that leads to extra small tensor-to-scalar ratios. In particular, we consider a specific three-parameter potential, which has a flatter plateau and a steeper well compared to the Starobinsky potential in the Einstein frame. We study the inflationary realization and we show that it guarantees a prolonged period of slow-roll inflation and a successful exit. Additionally, the steeper minimum leads to significantly suppressed tensor perturbations, and thus to an extra-small tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and we show that we are able to obtain $r$ values less than $10^{-5}$. Moreover, we calculate the reheating temperature showing that in order to be in agreement with observations one of the potential parameters should remain within specific bounds. Finally, performing an inverse conformal transformation to the Jordan frame we show that the considered potential corresponds to higher-order corrections to Starobinsky potential in the Einstein frame, and these corrections are the reason for the improved behavior of the tensor-to-scalar ratio.</description>

      <title>A first measurement of baryonic feedback with Fast Radio Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baryonic feedback fundamentally alters the total matter distribution on small to intermediate cosmological scales, posing a significant challenge for contemporary cosmological analyses. Direct tracers of the baryon distribution are therefore key for unearthing cosmological information buried under astrophysical effects. Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as a novel and direct probe of baryons, tracing the integrated ionised electron density along the line-of-sight, quantified by the dispersion measure (DM). The scatter of the DM as a function of redshift provides insight into the lumpiness of the electron distribution and, consequently, baryonic feedback processes. Using a model calibrated to the \texttt{BAHAMAS} hydrodynamical simulation suite, we forward-model the statistical properties of the DM with redshift. Applying this model to approximately 100 localised FRBs, we constrain the governing feedback parameter, $\log T_\mathrm{AGN}$. Our findings represent the first measurement of baryonic feedback using FRBs, demonstrating a strong rejection of no-feedback scenarios at greater than $99.7\,\%$ confidence ($3\sigma$), depending on the FRB sample. We find that FRBs prefer fairly strong feedback, similar to other measurements of the baryon distribution, via the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. The results are robust against sightline correlations and modelling assumptions. We emphasise the importance of accurate calibration of the host galaxy and Milky Way contributions to the DM. Furthermore, we discuss implications for future FRB surveys and necessary improvements to current models to ensure accurate fitting of upcoming data, particularly that from low-redshift FRBs.</description>

      <title>Direct correlation of line intensity mapping and CMB lensing from lightcone evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Line intensity mapping (LIM) promises to probe previously inaccessible corners of the faint and high-redshift universe. However, confusion with bright foregrounds is a major challenge for current-era pathfinder LIM experiments. Cross-correlation with cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing is a promising avenue to enable the first LIM detections at high redshifts, a pristine probe of fundamental physics but sparsely populated by faint galaxies, and to further probe the connection between matter and spectral line emission, expanding our understanding of galaxies and the IGM. Previous works have suggested that this direct correlation between LIM and CMB lensing is effectively impossible because smoothly varying modes in the intensity map are lost to bright foregrounds. In this work, we analytically revisit the direct correlation of foreground-filtered line intensity mapping with CMB lensing, highlighting lightcone evolution's previously neglected yet unavoidable and crucial effects. Indeed, the growth of structure and evolution of line emission along the lightcone breaks statistical translational invariance and thus induces mode coupling, even in linear theory, which enables the recovery of the smoothly varying modes lost to bright foregrounds. We compute the effects of these lightcone evolution-induced mode couplings on the LIMxCMB lensing cross-spectrum detectability, predicting that future wider-sky versions of COMAP, CCAT, and HETDEX will be able to precisely measure this cross-correlation. Although we focus on the direct correlation of LIM with CMB lensing in this paper, our arguments generalize to the direct correlation of LIM with any projected field.</description>

      <title>Fast and Fewrious: Stochastic binary perturbations from fast compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive compact objects soften binaries. This process has been used for decades to constrain the population of such objects, particularly as a component of dark matter (DM). The effects of light compact objects, such as those in the unconstrained asteroid-mass range, have generally been neglected. In principle, low-energy perturbers can harden binaries instead of softening them, but the standard lore is that this effect vanishes when the perturber velocities are large compared to the binary's orbital velocity, as is typical for DM constituents. Here, we revisit the computation of the hardening rate induced by light perturbers. We show that although the perturbations average to zero over many encounters, many scenarios of interest for DM constraints are in the regime where the variance cannot be neglected. We show that a few fast-moving perturbers can leave stochastic perturbations in systems that are measured with great precision, and we use this framework to revisit the constraint potential of systems such as binary pulsars and the Solar System. This opens a new class of dynamical probes with potential applications to asteroid-mass DM candidates.</description>

      <title>ALMA survey of a massive node of the Cosmic Web at $z\sim 3$. II. A dynamically cold and massive disk galaxy in the proximity of a hyperluminous quasar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancing our understanding of the formation and evolution of early massive galaxies and black holes requires detailed studies of dense structures in the high-redshift Universe. In this work, we present high-angular resolution ($\simeq0.3''$) ALMA observations targeting the CO(4--3) line and the underlying 3-mm dust continuum toward the Cosmic Web node MQN01, a region identified through deep multiwavelength surveys as one of the densest concentrations of galaxies and AGN at cosmic noon. At the center of this structure, we identify a massive, rotationally supported disk galaxy located approximately at $\sim10\,{\rm kpc}$ projected-distance and $\sim-300\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ from a hyperluminous quasar at $z=3.2510$. By accurately modeling the cold gas kinematics, we determine a galaxy dynamical mass of $2.5\times10^{11}\,{M_{\odot}}$ within the inner $\simeq 4\,{\rm kpc}$, and a high degree of rotational support of $V_{\rm rot}/\sigma \approx 11$. This makes it the first quasar companion galaxy confirmed as a massive, dynamically cold rotating disk at such an early cosmic epoch. Despite the small projected separation from the quasar host, we find no clear evidence of strong tidal interactions affecting the galaxy disk. This might suggest that the quasar is a satellite galaxy in the early stages of a merger. Furthermore, our spectroscopic analysis reveals a broad, blueshifted component in the CO(4--3) line profile of the quasar host, which may trace a powerful molecular outflow or kinematic disturbances induced by its interaction with the massive companion galaxy. Our findings show that rotationally supported cold disks are able to survive even in high-density environments of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Connecting Early Dark Energy to Late Dark Energy by the Diluting Matter Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study a scale invariant gravity theory containing two scalar fields, dust particles and a measure defined from degrees of freedom independent of the metric. The integration of the degrees of freedom that define the measure spontaneously break the scale symmetry, leaving us in the Einstein frame with an effective potential that is dependent on the density of the particles. The potential contains three flat regions, one for inflation, another for early dark energy and the third for late dark energy. At a certain point, as the matter dilutes, tunneling from the early dark energy to the late dark energy can start efficiently. This mechanism naturally alleviated the observed Hubble tension by modifying the sound horizon prior to recombination while preserving late-time cosmology. Moreover, the model predictions are consistent with observations from the reduced CMB, BAO, and local measurement of $H_0$, providing a coherent and unified description of the universe. In this context, the Bayesian analysis of these datasets confirms the viability of our scenario, with the best-fit parameters indicating an early dark energy fraction of approximately 30$\%$ at a redshift of $z'=5000$.</description>

      <title>GW231123: a product of successive mergers from $\sim 10 $ stellar-mass black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GW231123 is an exceptionally massive binary black hole (BBH) merger with unusually high component spins. Such extreme properties challenge conventional stellar evolution models predicting a black hole mass gap due to pair-instability supernovae. We analyze GW231123 using population-informed priors on BH mass and spin distributions to test possible formation scenarios: first-generation stellar collapse, hierarchical (multi-generation) mergers, and primordial origin. Our analysis strongly prefers scenarios where at least one component is a higher-generation BH. Both components are favored to have high spins, which rules out scenarios in which they are both first-generation (low spin) or primordial (nearly non-spin). We conclude that GW231123 is a hierarchical merger, with components plausibly originate from the successive mergers of $\sim 6$ and $\sim 4$ first-generation BHs, respectively. This suggests that repeated mergers can be frequent and even more massive intermediate-mass black holes may be produced. Thus mechanisms that can efficiently harden the BBHs' orbits are required, e.g., gas dynamical fraction in the disks of active galactic nucleus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the poltergeist mechanism the enhancement of induced gravitational waves (GWs) occurs due to a sudden transition from an early matter-dominated era to the radiation-dominated era. In this work, we calculate the bispectrum of induced GWs from the poltergeist mechanism by adopting the sudden transition approximation. We find that the tensor bispectrum peaks either in the equilateral or squeezed configurations, depending on scales. Such a characteristic behavior enables us to distinguish it from that from other GW generation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Accelerated cosmological expansion from pseudo-Hermiticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a well-studied pseudo-Hermitian field theory composed of two complex scalar fields can generate accelerated cosmological expansion through a novel mechanism. The dynamics is unique to the pseudo-Hermitian field theory, and it arises in the regime of broken antilinear symmetry, wherein a growth instability from the resulting complex eigenspectrum competes with the Hubble damping. The azimuthal components of the complex scalar fields asymptote to a constant rate of rolling at late times, reminiscent of motion around the infinite staircase of M.C. Escher's lithograph "Ascending and Descending". The resulting centripetal acceleration drives the radial components of the field away from the minimum of the potential, and the system generates a self-sustaining and constant Hubble rate at late times, even when tuning the minimum of the potential such that the classical vacuum energy is vanishing. This result evidences the potential to generate novel and physically relevant dynamics that are unique to pseudo-Hermitian field theories, and that their regimes of broken antilinear symmetry can be physically relevant in dynamical spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Dot: an LRD-like nucleus at the Heart of an IR-Bright Galaxy and its implications for high-redshift LRDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Little Red Dots (LRDs) are compact, red sources discovered by JWST at high redshift ($z \gtrsim 4$), marked by distinctive "V-shaped" spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and often interpreted as rapidly accreting AGNs. Their evolution remains unclear, as identifying counterparts at lower redshifts is challenging. We present WISEA J123635.56+621424.2 (here dubbed {\it the Saguaro}), a $z=2.0145$ galaxy in GOODS-North, as a possible analog of high-redshift LRDs and a potential missing link in their evolutionary path toward lower-redshift systems. It features a compact LRD-like nucleus surrounded by a face-on spiral host. Its connection to LRDs includes that: (1) its nuclear spectrum shows a clear "V-shaped" SED; and (2) when redshifted to $z=7$, surface brightness dimming makes the host undetectable, thus mimicking an LRD. This suggests that high-redshift LRDs may be embedded in extended hosts. To test this, we stack rest-frame UV images of 99 photometrically selected LRDs, revealing faint, diffuse emission. Stacking in redshift bins reveals mild radial growth, consistent with the expected galaxy size evolution. A simple analytic model confirms that surface brightness dimming alone can explain their compact appearance. Lastly, we show that {\it the Saguaro} is not unique by describing similar objects from the literature at $z\lesssim3.5$. Taken together, our results support a scenario in which LRDs may not be a distinct population, but could be the visible nuclei of galaxies undergoing a short-lived, AGN-dominated evolutionary phase, with their compact, red appearance driven largely by observational biases.</description>

      <title>A model-independent measurement of the expansion and growth rates from BOSS using the FreePower method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15347v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we provide a data analysis of the BOSS galaxy clustering data with the recently proposed FreePower method, which adopts as parameters the power spectrum band-powers, the expansion rate, and the growth rate instead of specific cosmological parametrizations. It relies on the Alcock-Paczy\'nski effect and redshift-space distortions, and makes use of one-loop perturbation theory for biased tracers. In this way, we obtain for the first time constraints on the linear growth rate, on the Hubble parameter, as well as on the dimensionless distance $H_0 D_A$ and various bias functions, that are independent of a model for the power spectrum shape and thus of both the early and late-time cosmological modelling. Using weakly-informative priors, requiring basically that $\sigma_8 \in [0.67, 1.07]$ at 95% CI, we find at $z_{\rm eff}=0.38$, $f=0.67^{+0.20}_{-0.19}$, $H/H_0=1.033^{+0.13}_{-0.081}$, $H_0 D_A = 0.264^{+0.026}_{-0.039}$ and at $z_{\rm eff}=0.61$, $f=0.82^{+0.25}_{-0.20}$, $H/H_0=1.085^{+0.16}_{-0.067}$, $H_0 D_A = 0.390^{+0.036}_{-0.046}$. We find lower $H/H_0$ results than expected from Planck 2018 $\Lambda$CDM results at a confidence level of 1.7$\sigma$ ($2.1\sigma$) for low-$z$ (high-$z$). These results form a proof-of-principle of the FreePower method. We also get constraints on the bias parameters which are in agreement with constraints from previous BOSS analyses, which serves as a cross-check of our pipeline.</description>

      <title>Constraining the dispersion measure redshift relation with simulation-based inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the dispersion measure (DM) of localised Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) to constrain cosmological and host galaxy parameters using simulation-based inference (SBI) for the first time. By simulating the large-scale structure of the electron density with the Generator for Large-Scale Structure (GLASS), we generate log-normal realisations of the free electron density field, accurately capturing the correlations between different FRBs. For the host galaxy contribution, we rigorously test various models, including log-normal, truncated Gaussian and Gamma distributions, while modelling the Milky Way component using pulsar data. Through these simulations, we employ the truncated sequential neural posterior estimation method to obtain the posterior. Using current observational data, we successfully recover the amplitude of the DM-redshift relation, consistent with Planck, while also fitting both the mean host contribution and its shape. Notably, we find no clear preference for a specific model of the host galaxy contribution. Although SBI may not yet be strictly necessary for FRB inference, this work lays the groundwork for the future, as the increasing volume of FRB data will demand precise modelling of both the host and large-scale structure components. Our modular simulation pipeline offers flexibility, allowing for easy integration of improved models as they become available, ensuring scalability and adaptability for upcoming analyses using FRBs. The pipeline is made publicly available under https://github.com/koustav-konar/FastNeuralBurst.</description>

      <title>Constraining neutrino mass with the CSST galaxy clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02752v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advent of next-generation surveys, constraints on cosmological parameters are anticipated to become more stringent, particularly for the total neutrino mass. This study forecasts such constraints utilizing galaxy clusters from the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST). Employing Fisher matrix techniques, we derive the constraint $\sigma(M_\nu)$ from cluster number counts, cluster power spectrum, and their combination. The investigation covers both the standard cosmological model with massive neutrinos $\nu\Lambda$CDM and the inclusion of dynamic dark energy in the $\nu w_0 w_a$CDM model, revealing a minor impact of dark energy on neutrino mass constraints. We examine the largest source of systematic arising from the mass-observable relation uncertainties and find that, with perfect knowledge of the scaling relation parameters, CSST clusters have the potential to enhance precision, tightening constraints to $\sim0.03$ eV. We also study the effects of the maximum redshift $z_{max}$ and other uncertainties, including those in redshift, halo mass function, and bias. Furthermore, we emphasize the significance of accounting for the growth-induced scale-dependent bias (GISDB) effect, which we find can tighten the final constraint by a factor of $1.2$ - $2.2$.</description>

Abstract: The preference for dynamical dark energy over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model has gained attention in recent cosmological studies, particularly with results from the DESI experiment. We investigate this claim by analysing tracker scalar field models, which can alleviate the cosmic coincidence problem and transition to a cosmological constant-like behaviour at late times. Focusing on the inverse axionlike and inverse steep exponential potentials, we study their background evolution and perturbations, finding a mild suppression in the matter power spectrum compared to $\Lambda$CDM but no distinguishing features in the bispectrum. Using combined datasets of ${\rm CMB}+{\rm BAO\; (DESI~DR1\; \&amp;\; DR2)}+{\rm Pantheon~Plus}+{\rm Hubble\; parameter}+{\rm RSD}$, we perform a statistical comparison based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Our results indicate that standard $\Lambda$CDM model remains the most favoured model. While the inverse axionlike model is preferred over the inverse steep exponential model in terms of statistical evidence, neither provides compelling support for dynamical dark energy over the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.</description>

      <title>Improved null tests of $\Lambda$CDM and FLRW in light of DESI DR2</title>

Abstract: The DESI DR2 BAO data, in combination with CMB and different SNIa datasets, exclude the flat $\Lambda$CDM model at more than 2.5$\sigma$ when analyzed through the $w_0w_a$CDM parametrization for evolving dark energy. This simple parametrization may not accurately capture the behavior of the entire redshift range at late times, which may introduce bias in the results. We use null tests that probe for deviations from flat $\Lambda$CDM at late times, independent of any specific dark energy parametrization. We provide several diagnostics for null tests and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. In particular, we derive diagnostics that improve on previous ones, such as the popular $O_{\rm m}$ diagnostic. The diagnostics are derived from both background and perturbed quantities. Using the combination of DESI DR2 BAO and supernova data, with or without CMB data, we find that deviations from flat $\Lambda$CDM are at $\sim1\sigma$ confidence level in most of the redshift range (more than 1$\sigma$ for a few small redshift intervals in a few cases). When considering SDSS BAO data instead of DESI BAO data, in combination with PantheonPlus, with or without CMB data, we find even smaller deviations. Since spatial curvature can potentially modify the results, we also test for curvature in the general $\Lambda$CDM model and the general FLRW model. While there is slight evidence for nonzero cosmic curvature at lower redshifts in a general $\Lambda$CDM model, there is no statistically significant evidence in a general FLRW model.</description>

      <title>Learning Correlated Astrophysical Foregrounds with Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extragalactic foregrounds -- most notably the Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) and the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect -- exhibit complex, non-Gaussian structure and correlations that can bias analyses of small-scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropies. These foregrounds can introduce mode coupling at small-scales (multipoles $\ell \geq 3000$) that mimic true lensing signals, thereby complicating analyses such as CMB lensing reconstruction. We present a novel approach to learn their full joint distribution using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) trained on paired CIB-tSZ patches at 150 GHz, from the Agora suite of extragalactic sky simulations. While simulations like Agora, which are based on N-body calculations, can take thousands of CPU hours, DDPM can synthesize realistic CIB-tSZ patches that faithfully reproduce both auto- and cross-spectral statistics of the 2-point, 3-point, and 4-point correlation functions, in a matter of seconds. We further demonstrate matching pixel-value histograms and Minkowski functionals, confirming that conventional non-Gaussian benchmarks are also satisfied. This framework provides a powerful generative tool for forward-modeling correlated extragalactic foregrounds in current and future CMB analyses. Although we mainly demonstrate the joint modeling of tSZ and CIB at a single frequency, we also include examples of its extension to multiple frequencies, showing that the framework can learn the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) across different bands. While establishing DDPMs as a promising tool for addressing foreground contamination in next-generation CMB surveys, we also outline remaining challenges to their practical deployment in analysis pipelines, such as scaling to larger sky areas and reliance on the underlying cosmological and astrophysical assumptions in the simulations used for training.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots from Small-Scale Primordial Black Hole Clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have identified a class of compact galaxies at high redshifts ($4 \lesssim z \lesssim 11$), dubbed "little red dots" (LRDs). The supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of $10^{5-8}{\rm\,M}_{\odot}$ in LRDs favor a heavy-seed origin. We propose a mechanism for their formation: Clusters of primordial black holes, formed through long-short mode coupling on small scales in the early Universe, undergo sequential mergers over extended timescales. This mechanism can evade cosmic microwave background distortions and result in heavy-seed SMBHs via runaway mergers. We employ Monte Carlo simulations to solve the Smoluchowski coagulation equation and determine the runaway merging timescale. The resulting stochastic gravitational wave background offers a distinct signature of this process, and the forming SMBHs can be highly spinning at their formation due to the spin residual of the cluster from tidal fields. This mechanism may explain the rapidly spinning SMBHs in LRDs under the assumption of obscured active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Braneworld Dark Energy in light of DESI DR2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observational results from the DESI collaboration reveal tensions with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and favour a scenario in which dark energy (DE) decays over time. The DESI DR2 data also suggest that the DE equation of state (EoS) may have been phantom-like ($w &lt; - 1$) in the past, evolving to $w &gt; - 1$ at present, implying a recent crossing of the phantom divide at $w = - 1$. Scalar field models of DE naturally emerge in ultraviolet-complete theories such as string theory, which is typically formulated in higher dimensions. In this work, we investigate a broad class of $thawing~scalar~field~models$, including the simple quadratic, quartic, exponential, symmetry-breaking and axion potentials, propagating on a (4+1)-dimensional ghost-free phantom braneworld, and demonstrate that their effective EoS exhibits a phantom-divide crossing. Alongside the Hubble parameter and EoS of DE, we also analyse the evolution of the $Om$ diagnostic, and demonstrate that the time dependence of these quantities is in excellent agreement with the DESI DR2 observations. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, and find that the $\chi^2$ values for all our models are remarkably close to that of the widely used CPL parametrisation, indicating that our models fit the data very well.</description>

      <title>Constraining $\sigma_8$ with Lensing Statistics in Low and High Density Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lensing studies are typically carried out around high density regions, such as groups and clusters, where the lensing signals are significant and indicative of rich density structures. However, a more comprehensive test of the cosmological model should also include the lensing effect in low density regions. In this work, we incorporate the stacked weak lensing signals around the low density positions, alongside galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy-galaxy two point correlation function to perform a joint cosmological analysis on $\sigma_8$. The low density positions are constructed from the DR9 data release of the DESI legacy imaging survey, using galaxies with r-band absolute magnitude cut M$&lt;$-21.5 and in the redshift range of 0.18$&lt;$z$&lt;$0.28. In doing so, we simultaneously parameterize photometric redshift errors and halo mass uncertainties while building mock catalogs from simulations using the method of SubHalo Abundance Matching (SHAM). For the weak lensing measurements, we use the shear estimators derived from the DECaLS DR8 imaging data, processed by the Fourier_Quad pipeline. The survey boundaries and masks are fully taken into account. Our analysis achieves a total significance of $31.1\sigma$ detection for lensing in the low density positions, which significantly improve the $\sigma_8$ constraint compared to galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy-galaxy two point correlation function by 14$\%$. For flat $\Lambda$CDM model, we constrain $\sigma_8$ =$0.824^{+0.015}_{-0.015}$, which shows a good agreement with the PLANCK result. Additionally, the halo mass uncertainty $\sigma_{\lg M}$ and photometric redshift error $\sigma_z$ are constrained to be $0.565^{+0.086}_{-0.070}$ and $0.004^{+0.004}_{-0.003}$ respectively, which are somewhat different from our expectations due to the significant degeneracy of the two parameters.</description>

      <title>AMICO galaxy clusters in KiDS-1000: cosmological sample</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Galaxy clusters provide key insights into cosmic structure formation, galaxy formation and are essential for cosmological studies. Aims. We present a catalog of galaxy clusters detected in the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-DR4) optimized for cosmological analyses and investigations of cluster properties. Each detection includes probabilistic membership assignments for the KiDS-DR4 galaxies within the magnitude range $15&lt;r'&lt;24$. Methods. Using the Adaptive Matched Identifier of Clustered Objects (AMICO) algorithm, we identified 23965 clusters over an effective area of about 839 deg2 in the redshift range $0.1\le z \le0.9$, with a signal-to-noise ratio $S/N&gt;3.5$. The sample is highly homogeneous across the entire survey thanks to the restrictive galaxy selection criteria we adopted. Spectroscopic data from the GAMA survey were used to calibrate the clusters photometric redshift and assess their uncertainties. We introduced algorithmic enhancements to AMICO to mitigate border effects among neighbor tiles. Quality flags are also provided for each cluster detection. The sample purity and completeness assessments have been estimated using the SinFoniA data driven approach, thus avoiding strong assumptions embedded in numerical simulations. We introduced a blinding scheme of the selection function meant to support the cosmological analyses. Results. Our cluster sample includes 321 cross-matches with the X-ray eRASS1 "primary" sample and 235 matches with the ACT-DR5 cluster sample. We derived a mass-proxy scaling relation based on intrinsic richness, $\lambda_*$, using masses from the eRASS1 catalog. Conclusions. The KiDS-DR4 cluster catalog provides a valuable data set for investigating galaxy cluster properties and contributes to cosmological studies by offering a large, well-characterized cluster sample.</description>

      <title>Testing gravitational physics by combining DESI DR1 and weak lensing datasets using the E_G estimator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The action of gravitational physics across space-time creates observable signatures in the behaviour of light and matter. We perform combined-probe studies using data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument survey Data Release 1 (DESI-DR1), in combination with three existing weak lensing surveys, to test and constrain General Relativity (GR) in the context of the standard model of cosmology (LCDM). We focus on measuring the gravitational estimator statistic, E_G, which describes the relative amplitudes of weak gravitational lensing and galaxy velocities induced by a common set of overdensities. By comparing our amplitude measurements with their predicted scale- and redshift-dependence within the GR+LCDM model, we demonstrate that our results are consistent with the predictions of the Planck cosmology. The redshift span of the DESI dataset allows us to perform these E_G measurements at the highest redshifts achieved to date, z ~ 1.</description>

      <title>Millicharged particles from proton bremsstrahlung in the atmosphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light millicharged particles can be copiously produced from meson decays in cosmic ray collisions with the atmosphere, leading to detectable signals in large underground neutrino detectors. In this paper we study a new channel for generating atmospheric millicharged particles, the proton bremsstrahlung process. We find that the proton bremsstrahlung process leads to a significantly higher flux of millicharged particles compared to meson decays and, for certain masses, results in a one-order-of-magnitude improvement in the flux. Consequently, Super-K constraints on $\varepsilon^2$ for sub-GeV MCPs are improved by half order of magnitude. We further note that the study on the proton bremsstrahlung process can be extended to a variety of new physics particle searches in atmospheric collisions and in low energy proton accelerators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05936v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on a recently proposed reinterpretation of gravitational wave memory that builds up on the definition of gravitational waves pioneered by Isaacson, we provide a unifying framework to derive both ordinary and null memory from a single well-defined equation at leading order in the asymptotic expansion. This allows us to formulate a memory equation that is valid for any unbound asymptotic energy-flux that preserves local Lorentz invariance. Using Horndeski gravity as a concrete example metric theory with an additional potentially massive scalar degree of freedom in the gravitational sector, the general memory formula is put into practice by presenting the first account of the memory correction sourced by the emission of massive field waves. Throughout the work, physical degrees of freedom are identified by constructing manifestly gauge invariant perturbation variables within an SVT decomposition on top of the asymptotic Minkowski background, which will in particular prove useful in future studies of gravitational wave memory within vector tensor theories.</description>

      <title>Optimised neural network predictions of galaxy formation histories using semi-stochastic corrections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16548v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel methodology to improve predictions of galaxy formation histories by incorporating semi-stochastic corrections to account for short-timescale variability. Our paper addresses limitations in existing models that capture broad trends in galaxy evolution, but fail to reproduce the bursty nature of star formation and chemical enrichment, resulting in inaccurate predictions of key observables such as stellar masses, optical spectra, and colour distributions. We introduce a simple technique to add a stochastic components by utilizing the power spectra of galaxy formation histories. We justify our stochastic approach by studying the correlation between the phases of the halo mass assembly and star-formation histories in the IllustrisTNG simulation, and we find that they are correlated only on timescales longer than 6 Gyr, with a strong dependence on galaxy type. We demonstrate our approach by applying our methodology to the predictions on a neural network trained on hydrodynamical simulations, which failed to recover the high-frequency components of star-formation and chemical enrichment histories. Our methodology successfully recovers realistic variability in galaxy properties at short timescales. It significantly improves the accuracy of predicted stellar masses, metallicities, spectra, and colour distributions and provides a practical framework for generating large, realistic mock galaxy catalogs, while also enhancing our understanding of the complex interplay between galaxy evolution and dark matter halo assembly.</description>

      <title>Kinematics of the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal core: A 5D Analysis for a 6D Methodology with Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using Gaia DR3 data, we examine the kinematics of the central core of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy using data which includes proper motions and line-of-sight velocities for member stars in addition to their projected positions. We extract a sample of bright stars that are high-probability members of Sgr. We model the distances to these stars, which is the only missing phase-space component measurement from our 5D sample, highlighting how their corresponding uncertainties propagate to affect the kinematics. Using line-of-sight velocity data only, which are not affected by the distance uncertainties, and assuming a jeans-based equilibrium analysis, we obtain a velocity anisotropy of $\beta_a = -2.24 \pm 1.99$, which implies a system with tangentially-biased orbits. With the full 5D data, we project that the data will significantly improve upon measurements of the log-slope of the dark matter density profile and the stellar velocity anisotropy. Tests with mock distance data show an improvement of anisotropy errors of approximately an order of magnitude, and log slope at the half light radius of approximately half an order of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06783v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that it is possible to simulate realistic inhomogeneities during cosmological inflation with high precision using {Numerical Relativity}. Stochastic initial conditions are set in line with the Bunch-Davies {vacuum} and satisfy the Hamiltonian and Momentum constraints of General Relativity to leading order in perturbation theory. The subsequent fully non-linear dynamical evolution is formulated within a family of geodesic gauges but can in principle be adapted to any choice of coordinates. We present 3 examples of inflationary dynamics: a simple quadratic potential, a potential with an inflection point and a strong resonance model. When perturbations are small, we recover standard predictions of cosmological perturbation theory, and we quantify strongly non-linear inhomogeneities when non-perturbative configurations emerge, such as in the strong resonance model. Our results pave the way towards the first realistic non-perturbative, and fully non-linear Numerical Relativity simulations of the early inflationary universe.</description>

Abstract: A recent baryogenesis scenario [Phys. Rev. D 110, 023520 (2024)], rooted in a two-brane Universe model, proposed a solution to the matter-antimatter asymmetry through the dynamics of a new pseudo-scalar field. In the present paper, one investigates the phenomenological consequences of this proposal. One shows that the associated boson could persist as a relic from the early Universe, forming a subdominant component of dark matter. While its overall cosmological density is small ($\approx 0.2\%$), one demonstrates that a one-loop process facilitates an ultra-weak coupling to photons, leading to a distinctive scattering signature. One argues that this effect could produce a faint, glowing halo around massive, hot stars, characterized by a unique spectral decay. Detecting or constraining this elusive light with current and future instruments like the JWST would provide a powerful and direct observational test of the underlying braneworld dynamics and its connection to baryogenesis.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Winds Drive Cold Gas Outflows on Kiloparsec Scales in Reionization-Era Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02305v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are thought to influence the evolution of their host galaxies through multi-phase feedback driven by powerful nuclear outflows. Although this mechanism is central to theoretical models of SMBH-galaxy co-evolution across cosmic time, direct observational evidence connecting nuclear winds to large-scale cold gas outflows remains limited, especially in the early universe. Here we report statistical evidence for such a connection in a sample of luminous quasars at $z \sim 5.5$. We compare stacked [C\,{\sc ii}] 158 $\mu$m emission profiles from ALMA observations, which trace galactic-scale neutral gas, for quasars with and without broad absorption lines (BALs) that indicate powerful nuclear winds on sub-kiloparsec scales. The BAL quasar stack exhibits a significant (S/N = 4.45) blueshifted broad component in the [C\,{\sc ii}] line profile, with a velocity offset of $\Delta v_{\rm b} = -2.1 \times 10^2\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$ and a full width at half maximum of $1.18 \times 10^3\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$, whereas the non-BAL stack shows no such feature. We estimate that a few percent to one-quarter of the nuclear wind energy may be transferred to cold neutral gas on kiloparsec scales. These results suggest that BAL winds can couple to the host galaxy's interstellar medium, providing empirical support for models of multi-phase AGN feedback. This mechanism may also contribute to the observed divers ity in $M_{\rm BH}/M_*$ among luminous quasars recently identified by JWST.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Evolutions in Globular Clusters and Dwarf Galaxies: Conduction Fluid Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new two-fluid conduction scheme to simulate the evolution of an isolated, self-gravitating, equilibrium cluster of stars and collisionless dark matter on secular (gravothermal) timescales. We integrate the equations in Lagrangian coordinates via a second-order, semi-implicit algorithm, which is unconditionally stable when the mass of the lighter species is much less than that of the heavier species. The method can be straightforwardly generalized to handle a multi-species system with a population of stars or components beyond collisionless dark matter and stars. We apply the method to simulate the dynamical evolution of stellar-dark matter systems, exploring the consequences of mass segregation and gravothermal core collapse, and assessing those effects for observed globular clusters and dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume.</description>

      <title>Probability of the Initial Conditions for Inflation and Slow Contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22763v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some recent studies based on numerical relativity simulations claim that slow contraction/ekpyrosis is strongly preferred over inflation as the smoothing mechanism that brought the universe into the homogeneous, isotropic and flat state we observe today on large scales. In this paper, we evaluate the likelihood of the initial conditions employed in the aforementioned simulations by estimating the probability that a free scalar field dominating the universe at the beginning of inflation or ekpyrosis will be sufficiently homogeneous on scales comparable to the Hubble radius at that time. We explore the space of parameters that characterize the initial power spectrum of the scalar field, finding that either can be more likely than the other for a fixed choice of parameters. On the other hand, when we extremize over these parameters, we find that the maximal probability for inflation is much higher than that of ekpyrosis.</description>
