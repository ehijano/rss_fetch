      <title>Topological phases of non-interacting systems: A general approach based on states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we provide a classification scheme for topological phases of certain systems whose observable algebra is described by a trivial $C^*$-bundles. The classification is based on the study of the homotopy classes of \emph{configurations}, which are maps from a \emph{quantum parameter space} to the space of pure states of a reference \emph{fiber} $C^*$-algebra. Both the quantum parameter space and the fiber algebra are naturally associated with the observable algebra. A list of various examples described in the last section shows that the common classification scheme of non-interacting topological insulators of type A is recovered inside this new formalism.</description>

      <title>The Feynman-Kac formula in deformation quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Feynman-Kac formula within the deformation quantization program. Constructing on previous work it is shown that, upon a Wick rotation, the ground state energy of any prescribed physical system can be obtained from the asymptotic limit of the phase space integration of the star exponential of the Hamiltonian operator. Some examples of this correspondence are provided showing a novel and efficient way of computing the ground state energy for some physical models.</description>

Abstract: A GL$(n)$ quantum integrable system generalizing the asymmetric five vertex spin chain is shown to encode the ring relations of the equivariant quantum cohomology and quantum K-theory ring of flag varieties. We also show that the Bethe ansatz states of this system generate the double $\beta$-Grothendieck polynomials.</description>

      <title>Algebras behind the bispectrality of the Wilson rational functions and their ${}_4\phi_3$ limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of the Wilson rational functions ${}_{10}\phi_9$ with three different normalizations are described. For one normalization, it satisfies an $R_{II}$ recurrence relation, whereas for the two other ones, they satisfy a generalized eigenvalue problem. The so-called Wilson rational algebra is introduced, which encodes algebraically the spectral properties of these special functions. Finally, different limits are considered, leading up to functions proportional to ${}_{4}\phi_3$. For one of these, the spectral algebra simplifies to yield the meta $q$-Racah algebra.</description>

      <title>From noncommutative Yang-Mills to noncommutative gravity through a classical double copy map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the first nontrivial noncommutative correction to the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian, which arises from the double copy of noncommutative Yang-Mills theory (ncYM). We start by considering linear and quadratic $\theta$-corrections up to cubic order in fields in ncYM theory and in arbitrary $D$ dimensions. We compute the first nontrivial corrections to the three-points vertex operators and use them to construct a double copy theory of the form ncYM $\times$ ncYM. The resulting theory is given by a double geometrical formalism which includes noncommutative corrections to the perturbative cubic double field theory (DFT) formulation, where the star product of the theory is doubled in agreement with the doubling of the physical coordinates of the theory. Upon solving the level matching condition the noncommutative products are identified and they produced $\theta^2$-corrections to the cubic DFT action. We analyze the pure gravitational limit of this formulation considering $D=4$ and imposing the transverse-traceless gauge.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the fluctuation field $\{M_t(x)\}_{x\in\mathbb{R}}$ of stationary Hastings-Levitov$(0)$ exhibits logarithmic spatial correlations. Moreover, by studying the infinitesimal generator of the imaginary part of $M_t(0)$, we show that for some $\beta&gt;0$, $\max_{x\in[0,t]}\text{Im} M_t(x)&lt;\beta\log t$ with high probability, as $t\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Landauer principle: Thermodynamic criteria of transmitting classical information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transmitting energy and information are two essential aspects of nature. Recent findings suggest they are closely related, while a quantitative equivalence between them is still unknown. This thus motivates us to ask: Can information transmission tasks equal certain energy transmission tasks? We answer this question positively by bounding various one-shot classical capacities via different energy transmission tasks. Such bounds provide the physical implication that, in the one-shot regime, transmitting $n$ bits of classical information is equivalent to $n\times k_BT\ln2$ transmitted energy. Unexpectedly, these bounds further uncover a dynamical version of Landauer's principle, showing the strong link between "transmitting" (rather than "erasing") information and energy. Finally, in the asymptotic regime, our findings further provide thermodynamic meanings for Holevo-Schumacher-Westmoreland Theorem and a series of strong converse properties as well as no-go theorems.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Aspects of Periodic Graph Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A periodic linear graph operator acts on states (functions) defined on the vertices of a graph equipped with a free translation action. Fourier transform with respect to the translation group reveals the central spectral objects, Bloch and Fermi varieties. These encode the relation between the eigenvalues of the translation group and the eigenvalues of the operator. As they are algebraic varieties, algebraic methods may be used to study the spectrum of the operator. We establish a framework in which commutative algebra directly comes to bear on the spectral theory of periodic operators, helping to distinguish their algebraic and analytic aspects. We also discuss reducibility of the Fermi variety and non-degeneracy of spectral band edges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show the global existence and uniqueness of classical solutions of the Maxwell-Chern-Simmons-Higgs system coupled to a neutral scalar with nontrivial scalar potential on (2+1) dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Our methods rely only on classical existence theorems, including energy estimates, the Sobolev inequality, and the choice of the Coulomb gauge condition. The equations are well-posed for finite initial data and the solution preserves any additional $H^{s}$ regularity for $s&gt;0$ in the data.</description>

      <title>Multisymplectic structure of nonintegrable Henon-Heiles system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-symplectic integrators are typically regarded as a discretization of the Hamiltonian partial differential equations. This is due to the fact that, for generic finite-dimensional Hamiltonian systems, there exists only one independent symplectic structure. In this note, the second invariant symplectic form is presented for the nonintegrable Henon-Heiles system, Kepler problem, integrable and non-integrable Toda type systems. This approach facilitates the construction of a multi-symplectic integrator, which effectively preserves both symplectic forms for these benchmark problems.</description>

Abstract: We have revisited the gradient-flow in information geometry from the perspective of Weyl symmetry. The gradient-flow equations are derived from the proposed action which is invariant under the Weyl's gauge transformations. In Weyl integrable geometry, we have related Amari's $\alpha$-connections in IG to the Weyl invariant connection on the Riemannian manifold equipped with the scaled metric.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Cross Approximation with a Geometrical Pivot Choice: ACA-GP Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Adaptive Cross Approximation (ACA) method is widely used to approximate admissible blocks of hierarchical matrices, or H-matrices, from discretized operators in the boundary integral method. These matrices are fully populated, making their storage and manipulation resource-intensive. ACA constructs a low-rank approximation by evaluating only a few rows and columns of the original operator, significantly reducing computational costs. A key aspect of ACA's effectiveness is the selection of pivots, which are entries common to the evaluated row and column of the original matrix. This paper proposes combining the classical, purely algebraic ACA method with a geometrical pivot selection based on the central subsets and extreme property subsets. The method is named ACA-GP, GP stands for Geometrical Pivots. The superiority of the ACA-GP compared to the classical ACA is demonstrated using a classical Green operator for two clouds of interacting points.</description>

      <title>A new perspective on the equivalence between Weak and Strong Spatial Mixing in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak mixing in lattice models is informally the property that ``information does not propagate inside a system''. Strong mixing is the property that ``information does not propagate inside and on the boundary of a system''. In dimension two, the boundary of reasonable systems is one dimensional, so information should not be able to propagate there. This led to the conjecture that in 2D, weak mixing implies strong mixing. The question was investigated in several previous works, and proof of this conjecture is available in the case of finite range Gibbsian specifications, and in the case of nearest-neighbour FK percolation (under some restrictions). The present work gives a new proof of these results, extends the family of models for which the implication holds, and, most interestingly, provides a ``percolative picture'' of the information propagation.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous transition in 2D Potts: I. Order-Disorder Interface convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that the planar q-state Potts model undergoes a discontinuous phase transition when q &gt; 4 and there are exactly q + 1 extremal Gibbs measures at the transition point: q ordered (monochromatic) measures and one disordered (free). We focus on the Potts model under the Dobrushin order-disorder boundary conditions on a finite $N\times N$ part of the square grid. Our main result is that this interface is a well defined object, has $\sqrt{N}$ fluctuations, and converges to a Brownian bridge under diffusive scaling. The same holds also for the corresponding FK-percolation model for all q &gt; 4. Our proofs rely on a coupling between FK-percolation, the six-vertex model, and the random-cluster representation of an Ashkin-Teller model (ATRC), and on a detailed study of the latter. The coupling relates the interface in FK-percolation to a long subcritical cluster in the ATRC model. For this cluster, we develop a ``renewal picture'' \`a la Ornstein-Zernike. This is based on fine mixing properties of the ATRC model that we establish using the link to the six-vertex model and its height function. Along the way, we derive various properties of the Ashkin-Teller model, such as Ornstein-Zernike asymptotics for its two-point function. In a companion work, we provide a detailed study of the Potts model under order-order Dobrushin conditions. We show emergence of a free layer of width $\sqrt{N}$ between the two ordered phases (wetting) and establish convergence of its boundaries to two Brownian bridges conditioned not to intersect.</description>

      <title>Octagonal tilings with three prototiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by theoretically and experimentally observed structural phases with octagonal symmetry, we introduce a family of octagonal tilings which are composed of three prototiles. We define our tilings with respect to two non-negative integers, $m$ and $n$, so that the inflation factor of a given tiling is $\delta_{(m,n)}=m+n (1+\sqrt{2})$. As such, we show that our family consists of an infinite series of tilings which can be delineated into separate `cases' which are determined by the relationship between $m$ and $n$. Similarly, we present the primitive substitution rules or decomposition of our prototiles, along with the statistical properties of each case, demonstrating their dependence on these integers.</description>

      <title>Leading and beyond leading-order spectral form factor in chaotic quantum many-body systems across all Dyson symmetry classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show the emergence of random matrix theory (RMT) spectral correlations in the chaotic phase of generic periodically kicked interacting quantum many-body systems by analytically calculating spectral form factor (SFF), $K(t)$, up to two leading orders in time, $t$. We explicitly consider the presence or absence of time reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) symmetry to investigate all three Dyson's symmetry classes. Our derivation only assumes random phase approximation to enable ensemble average. For $\mathcal{T}$-invariant systems with $\mathcal{T}^2=1$, we show that beyond the Thouless time $t^*$, the SFF takes the form $K(t)\simeq 2t-2t^2/\mathcal{N}$ up to second order in time, where $\mathcal{N}$ is the Hilbert space dimension. This is identical to the result from circular orthogonal ensemble of RMT. In the absence of $\mathcal{T}$-symmetry, we show that $K(t)\simeq t$ beyond $t^*$, and there is no universal term in the second order, unlike the $\mathcal{T}^2=1$ case, in agreement with the result of circular unitary ensemble. For $\mathcal{T}$-invariant systems with $\mathcal{T}^2=-1$, we show that $K(t)\simeq 2t+2t^2/\mathcal{N}$ up to two orders in time beyond $t^*$, in agreement with the result of circular symplectic ensemble. In all three cases, the system-size, $L$, scaling of $t^*$ is determined by eigenvalues of a doubly stochastic matrix $\mathcal{M}$. For strongly interacting fermionic chains, $\mathcal{M}$ is $SU(2)$ invariant in all three cases, leading to $t^*\propto L^2$ in the presence of $U(1)$ symmetry. In the absence of $U(1)$ symmetry, we find $t^*\propto L^0$, due to gapped non-degenerate second-largest eigenvalue of $\mathcal{M}$ or $t^*\propto \ln(L)$ due to gapped second-largest eigenvalue with degeneracy $\propto L^\zeta$. Our calculation of SFF is plausible in higher space dimensions as well, where similar system-size scalings of $t^*$ can be obtained.</description>

      <title>General theory of slow non-Hermitian evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems are widespread in both classical and quantum physics. The dynamics of such systems has recently become a focal point of research, showcasing surprising behaviors that include apparent violation of the adiabatic theorem and chiral topological conversion related to encircling exceptional points (EPs). These have both fundamental interest and potential practical applications. Yet the current literature features a number of apparently irreconcilable results. Here we develop a general theory for slow evolution of non-Hermitian systems and resolve these contradictions. We prove an analog of the adiabatic theorem for non-Hermitian systems and generalize it in the presence of uncontrolled environmental fluctuations (noise). The effect of noise turns out to be crucial due to inherent exponential instabilities present in non-Hermitian systems. Disproving common wisdom, the end state of the system is determined by the final Hamiltonian only, and is insensitive to other details of the evolution trajectory in parameter space. Our quantitative theory, leading to transparent physical intuition, is amenable to experimental tests. It provides efficient tools to predict the outcome of the system's evolution, avoiding the need to follow costly time-evolution simulations. Our approach may be useful for designing devices based on non-Hermitian physics and may stimulate analyses of classical and quantum non-Hermitian-Hamiltonian dynamics, as well as that of quantum Lindbladian and hybrid-Liouvillian systems.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Evaporation in Loop Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conference \emph{Black Holes Inside and Out} marked the 50th anniversary of Hawking's seminal paper on black hole radiance. It was clear already from Hawking's analysis that a proper quantum gravity theory would be essential for a more complete understanding of the evaporation process. This task was undertaken in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) two decades ago and by now the literature on the subject is quite rich. The goal of this contribution is to summarize a mainstream perspective that has emerged. The intended audience is the broader gravitational physics community, rather than quantum gravity experts. Therefore, the emphasis is on conceptual issues, especially on the key features that distinguish the LQG approach, and on concrete results that underlie the paradigm that has emerged. This is \emph{not} meant to be an exhaustive review. Rather, it is a broad-brush stroke portrait of the present status. Further details can be found in the references listed.</description>

      <title>Probability Bracket Notation for Probability Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the Dirac Notation in Quantum Mechanics (QM), we propose the Bracket Notation (PBN) by defining a probability-bra (P-bra), P-ket, P-bracket, P-identity, etc. Using the PBN, many formulae, such as normalizations and expectations in systems of one or more random variables, can now be written in abstract basis-independent expressions, which are easy to expand by inserting a proper P-identity. The time evolution of homogeneous Markov processes can also be formatted in such a way. Our system P-kets are identified with probability vectors, and our system P-bra is comparable to the Doi state function or the Peliti standard bra. In the Heisenberg picture of the PBN, a random variable becomes a stochastic process, and the Chapman-Kolmogorov equations are obtained by inserting a time-dependent P-identity. Also, some QM expressions in the Dirac notation are naturally transformed into probability expressions in PBN by a special Wick rotation. Potential applications show the usefulness of the PBN beyond the constrained domain and range of Hermitian operators on Hilbert Spaces in QM all the way to IT.</description>

      <title>Mutual Multilinearity of Nonequilibrium Network Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous-time Markov chains have been successful in modelling systems across numerous fields, with currents being fundamental entities that describe the flows of energy, particles, individuals, chemical species, information, or other quantities. They apply to systems described by agents transitioning between vertices along the edges of a network (at some rate in each direction). It has recently been shown by the authors that, at stationarity, a hidden linearity exists between currents that flow along edges: if one controls the current of a specific "input" edge (by tuning transition rates along it), any other current is a linear-affine function of the input current [PRL 133, 047401 (2024)]. In this paper, we extend this result to the situation where one controls the currents of several edges, and prove that other currents are in linear-affine relation with the input ones. Two proofs with distinct insights are provided: the first relies on Kirchhoff's current law and reduces the input set inductively through graph analysis, while the second utilizes the resolvent approach via a Laplace transform in time. We obtain explicit expressions for the current-to-current susceptibilities, which allow one to map current dependencies through the network. We also verify from our expression that Kirchhoff's current law is recovered as a limiting case of our mutual linearity. Last, we uncover that susceptibilities can be obtained from fluctuations when the reference system is originally at equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Connection formulae for the radial Toda equations I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16550v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is the first in a forthcoming series of works where the authors study the global asymptotic behavior of the radial solutions of the 2D periodic Toda equation of type $A_n$. The principal issue is the connection formulae between the asymptotic parameters describing the behavior of the general solution at zero and infinity. To reach this goal we are using a fusion of the PDE analysis and the Riemann-Hilbert nonlinear steepest descent method of Deift and Zhou which is applicable to 2D Toda in view of its Lax integrability. A principal technical challenge is the extension of the nonlinear steepest descent analysis to Riemann-Hilbert problems of matrix rank greater than $2$. In this paper, we meet this challenge for the case $n=2$ (the rank $3$ case) and it already captures the principal features of the general $n$ case.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the resonance problem for the cubic nonlinear Helmholtz equation in the subwavelength regime. We derive a discrete model for approximating the subwavelength resonances of finite systems of high-contrast resonators with Kerr-type nonlinearities. Our discrete formulation is valid in both weak and strong nonlinear regimes. Compared to the linear formulation, it characterizes the soliton-like extra eigenmodes that have recently been experimentally observed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global internal symmetries act unitarily on local observables or states of a quantum system. In this note, we aim to generalise this statement to extended observables by considering unitary actions of finite global 2-group symmetries $\mathcal{G}$ on line operators. We propose that the latter transform in unitary 2-representations of $\mathcal{G}$, which we classify up to unitary equivalence. Our results recover the known classification of ordinary 2-representations of finite 2-groups, but provide additional data interpreted as a type of reflection anomaly for $\mathcal{G}$.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Landauer Principle: Quantifying Information Transmission by Thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.12110v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy transfer and information transmission are two fundamental aspects of nature. They are seemingly unrelated, while recent findings suggest that a deep connection between them is to be discovered. This amounts to asking: Can we phrase the processes of transmitting classical bits equivalently as specific energy-transmitting tasks, thereby uncovering foundational links between them? We answer this question positively by showing that, for a broad class of classical communication tasks, a quantum dynamics' ability to transmit $n$ bits of classical information is equivalent to its ability to transmit $n$ units of energy in a thermodynamic task. This finding not only provides an analytical correspondence between information transmission and energy extraction tasks, but also quantifies classical communication by thermodynamics. Furthermore, our findings uncover the dynamical version of Landauer's principle, showing the strong link between transmitting information and energy. In the asymptotic regime, our results further provide thermodynamic meanings for the well-known Holevo-Schumacher-Westmoreland Theorem in quantum communication theory.</description>

Abstract: The parametric representation has been used since a long time for the evaluation of Feynman diagrams. As a dimension independent intermediate representation, it allows a clear description of singularities. Recently, it has become a choice tool for the investigation of the type of transcendent numbersappearing in the evaluation of Feynman diagrams. The inclusion of numerators has however stagnated since the ground work of Nakanishi. I here show howto greatly simplify the formulas through the use of Dodgson identities. In the massless case in particular, reduction to the completion to a vacuum graph allows for a strong reduction of the maximal power of the Symanzik polynomial in the denominator.</description>

Abstract: We study the large-time behavior of global energy class ($H^1$) solutions of the one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a general localized potential term and a defocusing nonlinear term. By using a new type of interaction Morawetz estimate localized to an exterior region, we prove that these solutions decompose into a free wave and a weakly localized part which is asymptotically orthogonal to any fixed free wave. We further show that the $L^2$ norm of this weakly localized part is concentrated in the region $|x| \leq t^{1/2+}$, and that the energy ($\dot{H}^1$) norm is concentrated in $|x| \leq t^{1/3+}$. Our results hold for solutions with arbitrarily large initial data.</description>

      <title>Thermal Area Law in Long-Range Interacting Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The area law of the bipartite information measure characterizes one of the most fundamental aspects of quantum many-body physics. In thermal equilibrium, the area law for the mutual information universally holds at arbitrary temperatures as long as the systems have short-range interactions. In systems with power-law decaying interactions, $r^{-\alpha}$ ($r$: distance), conditions for the thermal area law are elusive. In this work, we aim to clarify the optimal condition $\alpha&gt; \alpha_c$ such that the thermal area law universally holds. A standard approach to considering the conditions is to focus on the magnitude of the boundary interaction between two subsystems. However, we find here that the thermal area law is more robust than this conventional argument suggests. We show the optimal threshold for the thermal area law by $\alpha_c= (D+1)/2$ ($D$: the spatial dimension of the lattice), assuming a power-law decay of the clustering for the bipartite correlations. Remarkably, this condition encompasses even the thermodynamically unstable regimes $\alpha &lt; D$. We verify this condition numerically, finding that it is qualitatively accurate for both integrable and non-integrable systems. Unconditional proof of the thermal area law is possible by developing the power-law clustering theorem for $\alpha &gt; D$ above a threshold temperature. Furthermore, the numerical calculation for the logarithmic negativity shows that the same criterion $\alpha &gt; (D+1)/2$ applies to the thermal area law for quantum entanglement.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute exactly the scalar determinants $\det(\Delta+M^{2})$ on the two-dimensional round disks of constant curvature $R=0$, $\mp 2$, for any finite boundary length $\ell$ and mass $M$, with Dirichlet boundary conditions, using the $\zeta$-function prescription. When $M^{2}=\pm q(q+1)$, $q\in\mathbb N$, a simple expression involving only elementary functions and the Euler $\Gamma$ function is found. Applications to two-dimensional Liouville and Jackiw-Teitelboim quantum gravity are presented in a separate paper.</description>

      <title>Local Properties of the Rapidity Distribution in the Lieb-Liniger Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the rapidity distribution in the Lieb-Liniger model and derive exact relations for its derivatives at the Fermi level. The latter enables us to treat analytically the free energy of the system at low temperatures and arbitrary interactions. We calculated the leading-order correction to the well-known result obtained using conformal field theory. In contrast to the leading-order term controlled by the sound velocity or the Luttinger liquid parameter, the new term is controlled by an additional dimensionless parameter. We calculated its series expansions in the limiting cases of weak and strong interactions. Our results are generalized to other Galilean-invariant integrable systems.</description>

      <title>Construction of an invertible mapping to boundary conforming coordinates for arbitrarily shaped toroidal domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boundary conforming coordinates are commonly used in plasma physics to describe the geometry of toroidal domains, for example, in three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium solvers. The magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium configuration can be approximated with an inverse map, defining nested surfaces of constant magnetic flux. For equilibrium solvers that solve for this inverse map iteratively, the initial guess for the inverse map must be well defined and invertible. Even if magnetic islands are to be included in the representation, boundary conforming coordinates can still be useful, for example to parametrize the interface surfaces in multi-region, relaxed magnetohydrodynamics or as a general-purpose, field-agnostic coordinate system in strongly shaped domains. Given a fixed boundary shape, finding a valid boundary conforming mapping can be challenging, especially for the non-convex boundaries from recent developments in stellarator optimization. In this work, we propose a new algorithm to construct such a mapping, by solving two Dirichlet-Laplace problems via a boundary integral method. We can prove that the generated harmonic map is always smooth and has a smooth inverse. Furthermore, we can find a discrete approximation of the mapping that preserves this property.</description>

      <title>Entanglement witnesses and separability criteria based on generalized equiangular tight frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use operators from generalized equiangular measurements to construct positive maps. Their positivity follows from the inequality for indices of coincidence corresponding to few equiangular tight frames. These maps give rise to entanglement witnesses, which include as special cases many important classes considered in the literature. Additionally, we introduce separability criteria based on the correlation matrix and analyze them for various types of measurements.</description>

      <title>Delocalization of One-Dimensional Random Band Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01718v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider an $ N \times N$ Hermitian one-dimensional random band matrix with band width $W &gt; N^{1 / 2 + \varepsilon} $ for any $ \varepsilon &gt; 0$. In the bulk of the spectrum and in the large $ N $ limit, we obtain the following results: (i) The semicircle law holds up to the scale $ N^{-1 + \varepsilon} $ for any $ \varepsilon &gt; 0 $. (ii) All $ L^2 $- normalized eigenvectors are delocalized, meaning their $ L^\infty$ norms are simultaneously bounded by $ N^{-\frac{1}{2} + \varepsilon} $ with overwhelming probability, for any $ \varepsilon &gt; 0 $. (iii) Quantum unique ergodicity holds in the sense that the local $ L^2 $ mass of eigenvectors becomes equidistributed with high probability. (iv) Universality of eigenvalue statistics, i.e., the local eigenvalue statistics of these band matrices are given by those of Gaussian unitary ensembles.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of Lugiato-Lefever equation for Kerr combs generation in Fabry-Perot resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lugiato-Lefever equation (LLE) is a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with damping, detuning and driving terms, introduced as a model for Kerr combs generation in ring-shape resonators and more recently, in the form of a variant, in Fabry-Perot (FP) resonators. The aim of this paper is to present some numerical methods that complement each other to solve the LLE in its general form both in the dynamic and in the steady state regimes. We also provide some mathematical properties of the LLE likely to help the understanding and interpretation of the numerical simulation results.</description>
