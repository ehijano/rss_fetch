      <title>Invariant measure for the contact process with modified border in the non-attractive region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a modified one-dimensional contact process with varying infection rates. Specifically, the infection spreads at rate $\lambda_e$ along the boundaries of the infected region and at rate $\lambda_i$ elsewhere. We establish the existence of an invariant measure when $\lambda_i = \lambda_c$ and $\lambda_e &gt; \lambda_c$, where $\lambda_c$ is the critical parameter of the standard contact process. Moreover, we show that, when viewed from the rightmost infected site, the process converges weakly to this invariant measure. Finally, we prove that along the critical curve within the attractive region of the phase space, the infection almost surely dies out.</description>

      <title>Frog model on $\mathbb{Z}$ with random survival parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the frog model on \( \mathbb{Z} \) with geometric lifetimes, introducing a random survival parameter. Active and inactive particles are placed at the vertices of \( \mathbb{Z} \). The lifetime of each active particle follows a geometric random variable with parameter \( 1-p \), where \( p \) is randomly sampled from a distribution \( \pi \). Each active particle performs a simple random walk on \( \mathbb{Z} \) until it dies, activating any inactive particles it encounters along its path. In contrast to the usual case where \( p \) is fixed, we show that there exist non-trivial distributions \( \pi \) for which the model survives with positive probability. More specifically, for $\pi\sim Beta(\alpha,\beta)$, we establish the existence of a critical value \( \beta=0.5 \), that separates almost sure extinction from survival with positive probability. Furthermore, we show that the model is recurrent whenever it survives with positive probability.</description>

      <title>On the contraction properties of Sinkhorn semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a novel semigroup contraction analysis based on Lyapunov techniques to prove the exponential convergence of Sinkhorn equations on weighted Banach spaces. This operator-theoretic framework yields exponential decays of Sinkhorn iterates towards Schr\"odinger bridges with respect to general classes of $\phi$-divergences as well as in weighted Banach spaces. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results of this type in the literature on entropic transport and the Sinkhorn algorithm. We also illustrate the impact of these results in the context of multivariate linear Gaussian models as well as statistical finite mixture models including Gaussian-kernel density estimation of complex data distributions arising in generative models.</description>

      <title>A random polymer approach to the weak disorder phase of the vertex reinforced jump process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the transient phase of the Vertex Reinforced Jump Process (VRJP) in dimension $d\geq 3$. In Sabot, Zeng (2019), the authors introduce a positive martingale and show that the VRJP is recurrent if and only if that martingale converges to $0$. On $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\ge 3$, with constant conductances $W$, it can be shown that there is a critical value $0&lt;W_c(\mathbb{Z}^d)&lt;\infty$, such that the martingale converges to $0$ if $W&lt;W_c(\mathbb{Z}^d)$ or to a positive limit if $W&gt;W_c(\mathbb{Z}^d)$. On the other hand, the VRJP martingale can be interpreted as the partition function of a non-directed polymer with a very specific $1$-dependent random potential. In this paper, we focus on the question of the $L^p$ integrability of the VRJP martingale, which is related to the (diffusive) behavior of the VRJP. First, taking inspiration from the work of Junk (2022) for directed polymers in $\mathbb{Z}^{1+d}$, we prove that on the half-space $\mathbb{H}_d$ of $\mathbb{Z}^d$, for all $W&gt;W_c(\mathbb{H}_d)$ there is some $\delta&gt;0$ such that the VRJP martingale is in $L^{1+\delta}$. Second, we prove that, in dimension $d\geq 4$, the VRJP martingale is in $L^{p}$ for all $p&gt;1$ above the ``slab critical point'' $W_c^{\mathrm{slab}} (\mathbb{Z}^d) = \lim_{m\to\infty} W_c(\mathbb{Z}^{d-1} \times \{-m,\ldots,m\})$. We also propose some related conjectures.</description>

      <title>Free Perpetuities I: Existence, Subordination and Tail Asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the free analogue of the classical affine fixed-point (or perpetuity) equation
  \[
  \mathbb{X} \stackrel{d}{=} \mathbb{A}^{1/2}\mathbb{X}\,\mathbb{A}^{1/2} + \mathbb{B},
  \] where $\mathbb{X}$ is assumed to be $*$-free from the pair $(\mathbb{A},\mathbb{B})$, with $\mathbb{A}\ge 0$ and $\mathbb{B}=\mathbb{B}^*$. Our analysis covers both the subcritical regime, where $\tau(\mathbb{A})&lt;1$, and the critical case $\tau(\mathbb{A})=1$, in which the solution $\mathbb{X}$ is necessarily unbounded. When $\tau(\mathbb{A})=1$, we prove that the series defining $\mathbb{X}$ converges bilaterally almost uniformly (and almost uniformly under additional tail assumptions), while the perpetuity fails to have higher moments even if all moments of $\mathbb{A}$ and $\mathbb{B}$ exist.
  Our approach relies on a detailed study of the asymptotic behavior of moments under free multiplicative convolution, which reveals a markedly different behavior from the classical setting. By employing subordination techniques for non-commutative random variables, we derive precise asymptotic estimates for the tail of the distributions of $\mathbb{X}$ in both one-sided and symmetric cases. Interestingly, in the critical case, the free perpetuity exhibits a power-law tail behavior that mirrors the phenomenon observed in the celebrated Kesten's theorem.</description>

      <title>The Second Phase Transition of the Contact Process on a Random Regular Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The regular tree corresponds to the random regular graph as its local limit. For this reason the famous double phase transition of the contact process on regular tree has been seen to correspond to a phase transition on the large random regular graph, at least at the first critical value. In this article, we find a phase transition on that large finite graph at the second critical value: between linear reinfections and reinfections following a long healthy period.</description>

      <title>A large multi-agent system with noise both in position and control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a multi-population system where the dynamics of each agent evolve according to a system of stochastic differential equations in a general functional setup, determined by the global state of the system. Each agent is associated with a probability measure, that assigns the label accounting for the population to which the agent belongs. We do not assume any prior knowledge of the label of a single agent, and we allow that it can change as a consequence of the interaction among the agents. Furthermore, the system is affected by noise both in the agent's position and labels. First, we study the well-posedness of such a system and then a mean-field limit, as the number of agents diverges, is investigated together with the analysis of the properties of the limit distribution both with Eulerian and Lagrangian perspectives. As an application, we consider a large network of interacting neurons with random synaptic weights, introducing resets in the dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the Injective Norm of Sums of Random Tensors and the Moments of Gaussian Chaoses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an upper bound on the expected $\ell_p$ injective norm of sums of subgaussian random tensors. Our proof is simple and does not rely on any explicit geometric or chaining arguments. Instead, it follows from a simple application of the PAC-Bayesian lemma, a tool that has proven effective at controlling the suprema of certain ``smooth'' empirical processes in recent years. Our bound strictly improves a very recent result of Bandeira, Gopi, Jiang, Lucca, and Rothvoss. In the Euclidean case ($p=2$), our bound sharpens a result of Lata{\l}a that was central to proving his estimates on the moments of Gaussian chaoses. As a consequence, we obtain an elementary proof of this fundamental result.</description>

      <title>Achieving constant regret for dynamic matching via state-independent policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a centralized discrete-time dynamic two-way matching model with finitely many agent types. Agents arrive stochastically over time and join their type-dedicated queues waiting to be matched. We focus on state-independent greedy policies that achieve constant regret at all times by making matching decisions based solely on agent availability across types, rather than requiring complete queue-length information. Such policies are particularly appealing for life-saving applications such as kidney exchange, as they require less information and provide more transparency compared to state-dependent policies.
  First, for acyclic matching networks, we analyze a deterministic priority policy proposed by Kerimov et al. [2023] that follows a static priority order over matches. We derive the first explicit regret bound in terms of the general position gap (GPG) parameter $\epsilon$, which measures the distance of the fluid relaxation from degeneracy. Second, for general two-way matching networks, we design a randomized state-independent greedy policy that achieves constant regret with optimal scaling $O(\epsilon^{-1})$, matching the existing lower bound established by Kerimov et al. [2024].</description>

      <title>Singularity of compound stationary measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the product or convex combination of two Markov operators with equivalent stationary measures need not have a stationary measure from the same measure class. More specifically, we exhibit examples of a hitherto undescribed phenomenon: maximal entropy random walks for which the resulting compound random walks no longer have maximal entropy. The underlying group in these examples is $PSL(2,\mathbb Z)\cong{{\mathbb Z}_2}*{{\mathbb Z}_3}$, and the associated harmonic measures belong to the canonical Minkowski and Denjoy measure classes on the boundary. These examples also demonstrate that a number of other natural families of random walks are not closed under convolutions or convex combinations of step distributions.</description>

      <title>First and Second Moments and Fractional Anisotropy of General von Mises-Fisher and Peanut Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spherical distributions, in particular, the von Mises-Fisher distribution, are often used for problems using or modelling directional data. Since expectation and variance-covariance matrices follow from the first and second moments of the spherical distribution, the moments often need to be approximated numerically by computing trigonometric integrals. Here, we derive the explicit forms of the first and second moments for an n-dimensional von Mises-Fisher and peanut distributions by making use of the divergence theorem in the calculations. The derived formulas can be easily used in simulations, significantly decreasing the computation time. Moreover, we compute the fractional anisotropy formulas for the diffusion tensors derived from the bimodal von Mises-Fisher and peanut distributions, and show that the peanut distribution is limited in the amount of anisotropy it permits, making the von Mises-Fisher distribution a better choice when modelling anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Mitigation of Cascading Failures Using a Stochastic Interaction Graph with Eigen-analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In studies on complex network systems using graph theory, eigen-analysis is typically performed on an undirected graph model of the network. However, when analyzing cascading failures in a power system, the interactions among failures suggest the need for a directed graph beyond the topology of the power system to model directions of failure propagation. To accurately quantify failure interactions for effective mitigation strategies, this paper proposes a stochastic interaction graph model and associated eigen-analysis. Different types of modes on failure propagations are defined and characterized by the eigenvalues of a stochastic interaction matrix, whose absolute values are unity, zero, or in between. Finding and interpreting these modes helps identify the probable patterns of failure propagation, either local or widespread, and the participating components based on eigenvectors. Then, by lowering the failure probabilities of critical components highly participating in a mode of widespread failures, cascading can be mitigated. The validity of the proposed stochastic interaction graph model, eigen-analysis and the resulting mitigation strategies is demonstrated using simulated cascading failure data on an NPCC 140-bus system.</description>

      <title>Triangle-free graphs with the fewest independent sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given $d&gt;0$ and a positive integer $n$, let $G$ be a triangle-free graph on $n$ vertices with average degree $d$. With an elegant induction, Shearer (1983) tightened a seminal result of Ajtai, Koml\'os and Szemer\'edi (1980/1981) by proving that $G$ contains an independent set of size at least $(1+o(1))\frac{\log d}{d}n$ as $d\to\infty$.
  By a generalisation of Shearer's method, we prove that the number of independent sets in $G$ must be at least $\exp\left((1+o(1))\frac{(\log d)^2}{2d}n\right)$ as $d\to\infty$. This improves upon results of Cooper and Mubayi (2014) and Davies, Jenssen, Perkins, and Roberts (2018). Our method also provides good lower bounds on the independence polynomial of $G$, one of which implies Shearer's result itself. As certified by a classic probabilistic construction, our bound on the number of independent sets is sharp to several leading terms as $d\to\infty$.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we will establish that the Langevin Monte-Carlo algorithm can learn depth-2 neural nets of any size and for any data and we give non-asymptotic convergence rates for it. We achieve this via showing that under Total Variation distance and q-Renyi divergence, the iterates of Langevin Monte Carlo converge to the Gibbs distribution of Frobenius norm regularized losses for any of these nets, when using smooth activations and in both classification and regression settings. Most critically, the amount of regularization needed for our results is independent of the size of the net. The key observation of ours is that two layer neural loss functions can always be regularized by a constant amount such that they satisfy the Villani conditions, and thus their Gibbs measures satisfy a Poincare inequality.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative chaos measure for multiplicative functions: the $L^1$-regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\alpha$ be a Steinhaus random multiplicative function. For a wide class of multiplicative functions $f$ we construct a multiplicative chaos measure arising from the Dirichlet series of $\alpha f$, in the whole $L^1$-regime. Our method does not rely on the thick point approach or Gaussian approximation, and uses a modified second moment method with the help of an approximate Girsanov theorem. We also employ the idea of weak convergence in $L^r$ to show that the limiting measure is independent of the choice of the approximation schemes, and this may be seen as a non-Gaussian analogue of Shamov's characterisation of multiplicative chaos.
  Our class of $f$-s consists of those for which the mean value of $|f(p)|^2$ lies in $(0,1)$. In particular, it includes the indicator of sums of two squares. As an application of our construction, we establish a generalised central limit theorem for the (normalised) sums of $\alpha f$, with random variance determined by the total mass of our measure.</description>

      <title>Representation Theorems for Convex Expectations and Semigroups on Path Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective of this paper is to investigate the connection between penalty functions from stochastic optimal control, convex semigroups from analysis and convex expectations from probability theory. Our main result provides a one-to-one relation between these objects. As an application, we use the representation via penality functions and duality arguments to show that convex expectations are determined by their finite dimensional distributions. To illustrate this structural result, we show that Hu and Peng's axiomatic description of $G$-L\'evy processes in terms of finite dimensional distributions extends uniquely to the control approach introduced by Neufeld and Nutz. Finally, we show that convex expectations with a Markovian structure are fully determined by their one-dimensional distributions, which give rise to a classical semigroup on the state space.</description>

      <title>Velocity trapping in the lifted TASEP and the true self-avoiding random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss non-reversible Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithms that, for particle systems, rigorously sample the positional Boltzmann distribution and that have faster than physical dynamics. These algorithms all feature a non-thermal velocity distribution. They are exemplified by the lifted TASEP (totally asymmetric simple exclusion process), a one-dimensional lattice reduction of event-chain Monte Carlo. We analyze its dynamics in terms of a velocity trapping that arises from correlations between the local density and the particle velocities. This allows us to formulate a conjecture for its out-of-equilibrium mixing time scale, and to rationalize its equilibrium superdiffusive time scale. Both scales are faster than for the (unlifted) TASEP. They are further justified by our analysis of the lifted TASEP in terms of many-particle realizations of true self-avoiding random walks. We discuss velocity trapping beyond the case of one-dimensional lattice models and in more than one physical dimensions. Possible applications beyond physics are pointed out.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic correlation inequalities for finite times and transients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a thermodynamic bound on correlation times was formulated in [A. Dechant, J. Garnier-Brun, S.-i. Sasa, Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 167101 (2023)], showing how the decay of correlations in Langevin dynamics is bounded by short-time fluctuations and dissipation. Whereas these original results only address very long observation times in steady-state dynamics, we here generalize the respective inequalities to finite observations and general initial conditions. We utilize the connection between correlations and the fluctuations of time-integrated density functionals and generalize the direct stochastic calculus approach from [C. Dieball and A. Godec, Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 087101 (2023)] which paves the way for further generalizations. We address the connection between short and long time scales, as well as the saturation of the bounds via complementary spectral-theoretic arguments. Motivated by the spectral insight, we formulate all results also for complex-valued observables.</description>

      <title>Characterization of geodesic completeness for landmark space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a full characterization of geodesic completeness for spaces of configurations of landmarks with smooth Riemannian metrics that satisfy a rotational and translation invariance and which are induced from metrics on subgroups of the diffeomorphism group for the shape domain. These spaces are widely used for applications in shape analysis, for example, for measuring shape changes in medical imaging and morphometrics in biology. For statistics of such data to be well-defined, it is imperative to know if geodesics exist for all times. We extend previously known sufficient conditions for geodesic completeness based on the regularity of the metric to give a full characterization for smooth Riemannian metrics with a rotational and translation invariance by means of an integrability criterion that involves only the behavior of the cometric kernel as landmarks approach collision. We further use the integrability criterion for geodesic completeness and previous work on stochastic completeness to construct a family of Riemannian landmark manifolds that are geodesically complete but stochastically incomplete.</description>

Abstract: We consider interacting urns on a finite directed network, where both sampling and reinforcement processes depend on the nodes of the network. This extends previous research by incorporating node-dependent sampling and reinforcement. We classify the sampling and reinforcement schemes, as well as the networks on which the proportion of balls of either colour in each urn converges almost surely to a deterministic limit. We also investigate conditions for achieving synchronisation of the colour proportions across the urns and analyse fluctuations under specific conditions on the reinforcement scheme and network structure.</description>

Abstract: We study the existence of strong solutions for mean-field forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) with measurable coefficients and their implication on the Nash equilibrium of a multi-population mean-field game. More specifically, we allow the coefficients to be discontinuous in the forward process and non-Lipschitz continuous concerning their time-sectional distribution. Using the Pontryagin stochastic maximum principle and the martingale approach, we apply our existence result to a multi-population mean-field game (MPMFG) model where the interacting agents in the system are grouped into multiple populations. Each population shares the same objective function, and we take changes in population sizes into consideration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a unified method for establishing the distributional convergence of linear eigenvalue statistics (LES) for generalized patterned random matrices. We prove that for an $N \times N$ generalized patterned random matrix with independent subexponential entries and even degree monomial test functions of degree $p_n=o(\log N/\log \log N)$, the LES converges to standard Gaussian distribution. This generalizes the CLT results on Gaussian patterned random matrices in Chatterjee(2009), Adhikari and Saha(2017). As an application, new results on LES of Toeplitz, Hankel, circulant-type matrices and block patterned random matrices for varying test functions are derived. For odd degree monomial test functions, we derive the limiting moments of LES and show that it may not converge to a Gaussian distribution.</description>

      <title>Optimal Riemannian metric for Poincar\'e inequalities and how to ideally precondition Langevin dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Poincar\'e inequality is a fundamental property that rises naturally in different branches of mathematics. The associated Poincar\'e constant plays a central role in many applications since it governs the convergence of various practical algorithms. For instance, the convergence rate of the Langevin dynamics is exactly given by the Poincar\'e constant. This paper investigates a Riemannian version of Poincar\'e inequality where a positive definite weighting matrix field (\emph{i.e.} a Riemannian metric) is introduced to improve the Poincar\'e constant, and therefore the performances of the associated algorithm. Assuming the underlying measure is a \emph{moment measure}, we show that an optimal metric exists and the resulting Poincar\'e constant is 1. We demonstrate that such optimal metric is necessarily a \emph{Stein kernel}, offering a novel perspective on these complex but central mathematical objects that are hard to obtain in practice. We further discuss how to numerically obtain the optimal metric by deriving an implementable optimization algorithm. The resulting method is illustrated in a few simple but nontrivial examples, where solutions are revealed to be rather sophisticated. We also demonstrate how to design efficient Langevin-based sampling schemes by utilizing the precomputed optimal metric as a preconditioner.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general black box theorem that ensures convergence of a sequence of stationary Markov processes, provided a few assumptions are satisfied. This theorem relies on a control of the resolvents of the sequence of Markov processes, and on a suitable characterization of the resolvents of the limit. One major advantage of this approach is that it circumvents the use of the Boltzmann-Gibbs principle: for instance, we deduce in a rather simple way that the stationary fluctuations of the one-dimensional zero-range process converge to the stochastic heat equation. More importantly, it allows to establish results that were probably out of reach of existing methods: using the black box result, we are able to prove that the stationary fluctuations of a discrete model of ordered interfaces, that was considered previously in the statistical physics literature, converge to a system of reflected stochastic PDEs.</description>

Abstract: We prove non asymptotic total variation estimates for the kinetic Langevin algorithm in high dimension when the target measure satisfies a Poincar\'e inequality and has gradient Lipschitz potential. The main point is that the estimate improves significantly upon the corresponding bound for the non kinetic version of the algorithm, due to Dalalyan. In particular the dimension dependence drops from $O(n)$ to $O(\sqrt n)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has long been posited that there is a connection between the dynamical equations describing evolutionary processes in biology and sequential Bayesian learning methods. This manuscript describes new research in which this precise connection is rigorously established in the continuous time setting. Here we focus on a partial differential equation known as the Kushner-Stratonovich equation describing the evolution of the posterior density in time. Of particular importance is a piecewise smooth approximation of the observation path from which the discrete time filtering equations, which are shown to converge to a Stratonovich interpretation of the Kushner-Stratonovich equation. This smooth formulation will then be used to draw precise connections between nonlinear stochastic filtering and replicator-mutator dynamics. Additionally, gradient flow formulations will be investigated as well as a form of replicator-mutator dynamics which is shown to be beneficial for the misspecified model filtering problem. It is hoped this work will spur further research into exchanges between sequential learning and evolutionary biology and to inspire new algorithms in filtering and sampling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a dynamic model for forward curves within the Heath-Jarrow-Morton framework under the Musiela parametrization. The forward curves take values in a function space H, and their dynamics follows a stochastic partial differential equation with state-dependent coefficients. In particular, the coefficients are defined through point-wise operating maps on H, resulting in a locally state-dependent structure. We first explore conditions under which these point-wise operators are well defined on H. Next, we determine conditions to ensure that the resulting coefficient functions satisfy local growth and Lipschitz properties, so to guarantee the existence and uniqueness of mild solutions. The proposed model captures the behavior of the entire forward curve through a single equation, yet retains remarkable simplicity. Notably, we demonstrate that certain one-dimensional projections of the model are Markovian and satisfy a one-dimensional stochastic differential equation. This connects our Hilbert-space approach to well established models for forward contracts with fixed delivery times, for which existing formulas and numerical techniques can be applied. This link allows us to examine also conditions for maintaining positivity of the solutions. As concrete examples, we analyze Hilbert-space valued variants of an exponential model and of a constant elasticity of variance model.</description>

Abstract: A fixed number of passengers independently board one of several buses uniformly at random. The lonely passenger problem is to prove that the probability of at least one passenger being the only one in their bus is increasing in the number of buses. It was solved in a strong form by Imre P\'eter T\'oth, who proved stochastic dominance of the number of such passengers as the number of buses increases, but observed that, surprisingly, no short proof was known ``despite the efforts of several experts''. We give a very short proof of the weaker result. The proof of the strong form, using the same idea, is more involved but still relatively short.</description>

      <title>Entropy Gain and Information Loss by Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:1908.10364v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When the quantum entropy (QE) of a system increases due to measurements, it leads to the loss of certain information, part of which may be recoverable. We define Information Loss (IL) as a function of the density matrix through quantum entropy to effectively represent this relationship between gain and loss. For example, if the quantum entropy of a system increases from zero to 2ln2, its information loss rises from zero to 75 percent. We demonstrate that when a pure, unbiased m-qubit state collapses into a maximally mixed state, it acquires the highest possible gain in entropy and the maximal loss of information. We analyze the QE and IL of single qubits, entangled photon pairs in Bell tests, multi-qubit systems such as in quantum teleportation, GHZ and W states, as well as the two-qubit Werner mixed states, focusing on their dependence on parameters like polarization bias. We notice that the data exchange between the two observers in Bell tests can recover some of the lost quantum information even years later, indicating that the associated quantum entropy can be removed years later, which implies a possible explanation linked to quantum non-locality. We show that measuring the Bell, GHZ, and marginally entangled Werner state yields the same minimal entropy gain (ln2) and an equal minimal information loss (50 percent).</description>

      <title>Robust SGLD algorithm for solving non-convex distributionally robust optimisation problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) algorithm tailored for solving a certain class of non-convex distributionally robust optimisation (DRO) problems. By deriving non-asymptotic convergence bounds, we build an algorithm which for any prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon&gt;0$ outputs an estimator whose expected excess risk is at most $\varepsilon$. As a concrete application, we consider the problem of identifying the best non-linear estimator of a given regression model involving a neural network using adversarially corrupted samples. We formulate this problem as a DRO problem and demonstrate both theoretically and numerically the applicability of the proposed robust SGLD algorithm. Moreover, numerical experiments show that the robust SGLD estimator outperforms the estimator obtained using vanilla SGLD in terms of test accuracy, which highlights the advantage of incorporating model uncertainty when optimising with perturbed samples.</description>

      <title>Score matching for bridges without learning time-reversals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15455v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new algorithm for learning bridged diffusion processes using score-matching methods. Our method relies on reversing the dynamics of the forward process and using this to learn a score function, which, via Doob's $h$-transform, yields a bridged diffusion process; that is, a process conditioned on an endpoint. In contrast to prior methods, we learn the score term $\nabla_x \log p(t, x; T, y)$ directly, for given $t, y$, completely avoiding first learning a time-reversal. We compare the performance of our algorithm with existing methods and see that it outperforms using the (learned) time-reversals to learn the score term. The code can be found at https://github.com/libbylbaker/forward_bridge.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic spectrum of weighted sample covariance: another proof of spectrum convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose another proof of the high dimensional spectrum convergence of the weighted sample covariance, more concise and self-sufficient but with stronger, but reasonable assumptions. We explain and illustrates this theorem for different weight distributions and show how the spectrum behaves in finite samples with heavy tails. The general purpose is to provide a detailed introduction to the high dimensional spectrum of weighted sample covariance.</description>

      <title>Rigorous enclosure of Lyapunov exponents of stochastic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a powerful and general method to provide rigorous and accurate upper and lower bounds for Lyapunov exponents of stochastic flows. Our approach is based on computer-assisted tools, the adjoint method and established results on the ergodicity of diffusion processes. We do not require any structural assumptions on the stochastic system, work under mild hypoellipticity conditions and outside of perturbative regimes. Therefore, our method allows for the treatment of systems that were so far out of reach from existing mathematical tools. We demonstrate our method to exhibit the chaotic nature of three different systems. Finally, we show the robustness of our approach by combining it with continuation methods to produce bounds on Lyapunov exponents over large parameter regions.</description>

      <title>Multi-indexed Orthogonal Polynomials of a Discrete Variable and Exactly Solvable Birth and Death Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the case-(1) multi-indexed orthogonal polynomials of a discrete variable for 8 types ((dual)($q$-)Hahn, three kinds of $q$-Krawtchouk and $q$-Meixner). Based on them and the case-(1) multi-indexed orthogonal polynomials of Racah, $q$-Racah, Meixner, little $q$-Jacobi and little $q$-Laguerre types, exactly solvable continuous time birth and death processes are obtained. Their discrete time versions (Markov chains) are also obtained for finite types.</description>

      <title>Quadratic variation and local times of the horizontal component of the Peano curve (square filling curve)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07966v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the horizontal component of the Peano curve has quadratic variation equal the limit of quadratic variations along the Lebesgue partitions for grids of the form $3^{-n}p\mathbb{Z}+3^{-n}r$, $n=1,2,\ldots$, where $p$ is a rational number, while $r$ is irrational number, but the value of such quadratic variation depends on $p$.
  This also yields that the horizontal component of the Peano curve is an example of a deterministic function possessing local time (density of the occupation measure) with respect to the Lebesgue measure, whose local time can be expressed as the limit of normalized numbers of interval crossings by this function but the normalization is not a smooth function of the width of the intervals.
  These two features distinct the horizontal component of the Peano curve from the trajectories of the Wiener process, which is widely used in financial models.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of blowup time in a simple model of a super-Malthusian catastrophe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the paradigm of a super-Maltusian population catastrophe, we study a simple stochastic population model which exhibits a finite-time blowup of the population size and is strongly affected by intrinsic noise. We focus on the fluctuations of the blowup time $T$ in the asexual binary reproduction model $2A \to 3A$, where two identical individuals give birth to a third one. We determine exactly the average blowup time as well as the probability distribution $\mathcal{P}(T)$ of the blowup time and its moments. In particular, we show that the long-time tail $\mathcal{P}(T\to \infty)$ is purely exponential. The short-time tail $\mathcal{P}(T\to 0)$ exhibits an essential singularity at $T=0$, and it is dominated by a single (the most likely) population trajectory which we determine analytically.</description>
