      <title>The Impact of Shared Telecom Infrastructure on Digital Connectivity and Inclusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearly half the world remains offline, and capital scarcity stalls new network buildouts. Sharing existing mobile towers could accelerate connectivity. We assemble data on 107 tower-sharing deals in 28 low-income countries (2008-20) and estimate staggered difference-in-differences effects. Two years after a transaction covering over 1,000 towers, the PPP-adjusted mobile-price index falls USD 1.60 (s.e. 1.10) from a baseline of USD 3.16, while data prices drop USD 1.00 (0.29), baseline USD 3.41 per GB. The number of mobile connections increases. Rural internet access increases by 4.7 pp and female-headed households by 3.6 pp. Tower-sharing agreements increase product market competition as measured by Herfindahl-Hirschman Index.</description>

      <title>AIs Structural Impact on Indias Knowledge Intensive Startup Ecosystem: A Natural Experiment in Firm Efficiency and Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the structural and performance impacts of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption on Indias knowledge intensive startups, spanning information technology, financial technology, health technology, and educational technology, founded between 2016 and 2025. Using a natural experiment framework with the founding year as an exogenous treatment proxy, it examines firm size, revenue productivity, valuation efficiency, and capital utilization across pre AI and AI era cohorts. Findings reveal larger structures and lower efficiency in AI era firms, supported by a dataset of 914 cleaned firms. The study offers insights into AIs transformative role, suggesting that while AI era firms attract higher funding and achieve higher absolute valuations, their per employee productivity and efficiency ratios are lower, potentially indicating earlystage investments in technology that have yet to yield proportional returns. This informs global entrepreneurial strategies while highlighting the need for longitudinal research on sustainability.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Spatial Distribution Dynamics: A Comprehensive Theoretical and Empirical Framework for Analyzing Productivity Agglomeration Effects in Japan's Aging Society</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops the first comprehensive theoretical and empirical framework for analyzing AI-driven spatial distribution dynamics in metropolitan areas undergoing demographic transition. We extend New Economic Geography by formalizing five novel AI-specific mechanisms: algorithmic learning spillovers, digital infrastructure returns, virtual agglomeration effects, AI-human complementarity, and network externalities. Using Tokyo as our empirical laboratory, we implement rigorous causal identification through five complementary econometric strategies and develop machine learning predictions across 27 future scenarios spanning 2024-2050. Our theoretical framework generates six testable hypotheses, all receiving strong empirical support. The causal analysis reveals that AI implementation increases agglomeration concentration by 4.2-5.2 percentage points, with heterogeneous effects across industries: high AI-readiness sectors experience 8.4 percentage point increases, while low AI-readiness sectors show 1.2 percentage point gains. Machine learning predictions demonstrate that aggressive AI adoption can offset 60-80\% of aging-related productivity declines. We provide a strategic three-phase policy framework for managing AI-driven spatial transformation while promoting inclusive development. The integrated approach establishes a new paradigm for analyzing technology-driven spatial change with global applications for aging societies.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Sensitivities of Input-Output Methods for Natural Hazard-Induced Power Outage Macroeconomic Impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is estimated that over one-fourth of US households experienced a power outage in 2023, costing on average US $\$150$ Bn annually, with $87\%$ of outages caused by natural hazards. Indeed, numerous studies have examined the macroeconomic impact of power network interruptions, employing a wide variety of modeling methods and data parameterization techniques, which warrants further investigation. In this paper, we quantify the macroeconomic effects of three significant natural hazard-induced US power outages: Hurricane Ian (2022), the 2021 Texas Blackouts, and Tropical Storm Isaias (2020). Our analysis evaluates the sensitivity of three commonly used data parameterization techniques (household interruptions, kWh lost, and satellite luminosity), along with three static models (Leontief and Ghosh, critical input, and inoperability Input-Output). We find the mean domestic loss estimates to be US $\$3.13$ Bn, US $\$4.18$ Bn, and US $\$2.93$ Bn, respectively. Additionally, data parameterization techniques can alter estimated losses by up to $23.1\%$ and $50.5\%$. Consistent with the wide range of outputs, we find that the GDP losses are highly sensitive to model architecture, data parameterization, and analyst assumptions. Results sensitivity is not uniform across models and arises from important a priori analyst decisions, demonstrated by data parameterization techniques yielding $11\%$ and $45\%$ differences within a model. We find that the numerical value output is more sensitive than intersectoral linkages and other macroeconomic insights. To our knowledge, we contribute to literature the first systematic comparison of multiple IO models and parameterizations across several natural hazard-induced long-duration power outages, providing guidance and insights for analysts.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Macroeconomic and Financial Stability of Bangladesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study constructs an Aggregate Financial Stability Index (AFSI) for Bangladesh to evaluate the systemic health and resilience of the countrys financial system during the period from 2016 to 2024. The index incorporates 19 macrofinancial indicators across four key sectors Real Sector, Financial and Monetary Sector, Fiscal Sector and External Sector. Using a normalized scoring approach and equal weighting scheme, sub-indices were aggregated to form a comprehensive measure of financial stability. The findings indicate that while the Real and Fiscal sectors demonstrated modest improvements in FY2024, overall financial stability deteriorated, largely due to poor performance in the Financial and Monetary Sector and continued weakness in the External Sector. Key stress indicators include rising non-performing loans, declining capital adequacy ratios, weak capital market performance, growing external debt, and shrinking foreign exchange reserves. The study highlights the interconnectedness of macro-financial sectors and the urgent need for structural reforms, stronger regulatory oversight, and enhanced macroprudential policy coordination. The AFSI framework developed in this paper offers an early warning tool for policymakers and contributes to the literature on financial stability measurement in emerging economies.</description>

      <title>Beyond pay: AI skills reward more job benefits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the non-monetary rewards associated with artificial intelligence (AI) skills in the U.S. labour market. Using a dataset of approximately ten million online job vacancies from 2018 to 2024, we identify AI roles-positions requiring at least one AI-related skill-and examine the extent to which these roles offer non-monetary benefits such as tuition assistance, paid leave, health and well-being perks, parental leave, workplace culture enhancements, and remote work options. While previous research has documented substantial wage premiums for AI-related roles due to growing demand and limited talent supply, our study asks whether this demand also translates into enhanced non-monetary compensation. We find that AI roles are significantly more likely to offer such perks, even after controlling for education requirements, industry, and occupation type. It is twice as likely for an AI role to offer parental leave and almost three times more likely to provide remote working options. Moreover, the highest-paying AI roles tend to bundle these benefits, suggesting a compound premium where salary increases coincide with expanded non-monetary rewards. AI roles offering parental leave or health benefits show salaries that are, on average, 12% to 20% higher than AI roles without this benefit. This pattern is particularly pronounced in years and occupations experiencing the highest AI-related demand, pointing to a demand-driven dynamic. Our findings underscore the strong pull of AI talent in the labor market and challenge narratives of technological displacement, highlighting instead how employers compete for scarce talent through both financial and non-financial incentives.</description>

      <title>Aligning Large Language Model Agents with Rational and Moral Preferences: A Supervised Fine-Tuning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how large language model (LLM) agents behave in strategic interactions is essential as these systems increasingly participate autonomously in economically and morally consequential decisions. We evaluate LLM preferences using canonical economic games, finding substantial deviations from human behavior. Models like GPT-4o show excessive cooperation and limited incentive sensitivity, while reasoning models, such as o3-mini, align more consistently with payoff-maximizing strategies. We propose a supervised fine-tuning pipeline that uses synthetic datasets derived from economic reasoning to align LLM agents with economic preferences, focusing on two stylized preference structures. In the first, utility depends only on individual payoffs (homo economicus), while utility also depends on a notion of Kantian universalizability in the second preference structure (homo moralis). We find that fine-tuning based on small datasets shifts LLM agent behavior toward the corresponding economic agent. We further assess the fine-tuned agents' behavior in two applications: Moral dilemmas involving autonomous vehicles and algorithmic pricing in competitive markets. These examples illustrate how different normative objectives embedded via realizations from structured preference structures can influence market and moral outcomes. This work contributes a replicable, cost-efficient, and economically grounded pipeline to align AI preferences using moral-economic principles.</description>

      <title>Does AI and Human Advice Mitigate Punishment for Selfish Behavior? An Experiment on AI ethics From a Psychological Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: People increasingly rely on AI-advice when making decisions. At times, such advice can promote selfish behavior. When individuals abide by selfishness-promoting AI advice, how are they perceived and punished? To study this question, we build on theories from social psychology and combine machine-behavior and behavioral economic approaches. In a pre-registered, financially-incentivized experiment, evaluators could punish real decision-makers who (i) received AI, human, or no advice. The advice (ii) encouraged selfish or prosocial behavior, and decision-makers (iii) behaved selfishly or, in a control condition, behaved prosocially. Evaluators further assigned responsibility to decision-makers and their advisors. Results revealed that (i) prosocial behavior was punished very little, whereas selfish behavior was punished much more. Focusing on selfish behavior, (ii) compared to receiving no advice, selfish behavior was penalized more harshly after prosocial advice and more leniently after selfish advice. Lastly, (iii) whereas selfish decision-makers were seen as more responsible when they followed AI compared to human advice, punishment between the two advice sources did not vary. Overall, behavior and advice content shape punishment, whereas the advice source does not.</description>

      <title>Retail prices, environmental footprints, and nutritional profiles of commonly sold retail food items in 181 countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Transitions towards healthier, more environmentally sustainable diets would require large shifts in consumption patterns. Cost and affordability can be barriers to consuming healthy, sustainable diets.
  Objective: This study provides the first worldwide test of how retail food prices relate to empirically estimated environmental footprints and nutritional profile scores between and within food groups.
  Methods: We use 48,316 prices for 860 retail food items commonly sold in 181 countries during 2011 and 2017, matched to estimated carbon and water footprints and nutritional profiles, to test whether healthier and more sustainable foods are more expensive between and within food groups.
  Results: Prices, environmental footprints, and nutritional profiles differ between food groups. Within almost all groups, more expensive items have significantly larger carbon and water footprints. Associations are strongest for animal source foods, where each 10% increment in price is associated with 21 grams higher carbon footprint and 5 liters higher water footprint per 100kcal of food. There is no such gradient for price and nutritional profile, as more expensive items are sometimes healthier and sometimes less healthy depending on the food group, price range, and nutritional attribute of interest.
  Conclusions: Our finding that higher-priced items have larger environmental footprints is contrary to expectations that a more sustainable diet would be more expensive. Instead, we find that within each food group, meeting dietary needs with lower environmental footprints is possible by choosing items with a lower unit price. These findings are consistent with prior observations that higher-priced items typically use more resources, including energy and water, but may or may not be healthful as measured by nutrient profile scores.</description>

      <title>An AI Capability Threshold for Rent-Funded Universal Basic Income in an AI-Automated Economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the first closed-form condition under which artificial intelligence (AI) capital profits could sustainably finance a universal basic income (UBI) without additional taxes or new job creation. In a Solow-Zeira economy characterized by a continuum of automatable tasks, a constant net saving rate $s$, and task-elasticity $\sigma &lt; 1$, we analyze how the AI capability threshold--defined as the productivity level of AI relative to pre-AI automation--varies under different economic scenarios. At present economic parameters, we find that AI systems must achieve only approximately 5-6 times existing automation productivity to finance an 11%-of-GDP UBI, in the worst case situation where *no* new jobs or tasks are created.
  Our analysis also reveals some specific policy levers: raising public revenue share (e.g. profit taxation) of AI capital from the current 15% to about 33% halves the required AI capability threshold to attain UBI to 3 times existing automotion productivity, but gains diminish beyond 50% public revenue share, especially if regulatory costs increase. Market structure also strongly affects outcomes: monopolistic or concentrated oligopolistic markets reduce the threshold by increasing economic rents, whereas heightened competition significantly raises it.
  Overall, these results suggest a couple policy recommendations: maximizing public revenue share up to a point so that operating costs are minimized, and strategically managing market competition can ensure AI's growing capabilities translate into meaningful social benefits within realistic technological progress scenarios.</description>

      <title>Quotas for scholarship recipients: an efficient race-neutral alternative to affirmative action?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since 2018, France's centralized higher education platform, Parcoursup, has implemented quotas for scholarship recipients, with program-specific thresholds based on the applicant's composition. Using difference-in-differences methods, I find these quotas enabled scholarship students to access more selective programs, though intention-to-treat effects remain modest (maximum 0.10 SD). Matching methods reveal that the policy improved the scholarship students' waiting list positions relative to those of comparable non-scholarship peers. However, I detect no robust or lasting effects on the extensive margin of higher education access. Despite high policy salience, quotas did not affect the application behavior or pre-college investment of scholarship students, even among high achievers. These findings align with research on affirmative action bans, suggesting that such policies primarily benefit disadvantaged students who access selective institutions, rather than expanding total enrollment. Nevertheless, scholarship quotas demonstrate that race-neutral alternatives can effectively promote socioeconomic diversity in prestigious programs.</description>
