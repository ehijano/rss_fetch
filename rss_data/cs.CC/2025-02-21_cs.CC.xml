      <title>Eliminating Majority Illusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An opinion illusion refers to a phenomenon in social networks where agents may witness distributions of opinions among their neighbours that do not accurately reflect the true distribution of opinions in the population as a whole. A specific case of this occurs when there are only two possible choices, such as whether to receive the COVID-19 vaccine or vote on EU membership, which is commonly referred to as a majority illusion. In this work, we study the topological properties of social networks that lead to opinion illusions and focus on minimizing the number of agents that need to be influenced to eliminate these illusions. To do so, we propose an initial, but systematic study of the algorithmic behaviour of this problem.
  We show that the problem is NP-hard even for underlying topologies that are rather restrictive, being planar and of bounded diameter. We then look for exact algorithms that scale well as the input grows (FPT). We argue the in-existence of such algorithms even when the number of vertices that must be influenced is bounded, or when the social network is arranged in a ``path-like'' fashion (has bounded pathwidth). On the positive side, we present an FPT algorithm for networks with ``star-like'' structure (bounded vertex cover number). Finally, we construct an FPT algorithm for ``tree-like'' networks (bounded treewidth) when the number of vertices that must be influenced is bounded. This algorithm is then used to provide a PTAS for planar graphs.</description>

      <title>An exposition of recent list-size bounds of FRS Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last year, there have been some remarkable improvements in the combinatorial list-size bounds of Folded Reed Solomon codes and multiplicity codes. Starting from the work on Kopparty, Ron-Zewi, Saraf and Wootters (SIAM J. Comput. 2023) (and subsequent simplifications due to Tamo (IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory 2024), we have had dramatic improvements in the list-size bounds of FRS codes due to Srivastava (SODA 2025) and Chen &amp; Zhang (STOC 2025). In this note, we give a short exposition of these three results (Tamo, Srivastava and Chen-Zhang).</description>

      <title>Structural Parameterizations for Induced and Acyclic Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the (structurally) parameterized complexity of Induced Matching and Acyclic Matching, two problems where we seek to find a maximum independent set of edges whose endpoints induce, respectively, a matching and a forest. Chaudhary and Zehavi~[WG '23] recently studied these problems parameterized by treewidth, denoted by $\mathrm{tw}$. We resolve several of the problems left open in their work and extend their results as follows: (i) for Acyclic Matching, Chaudhary and Zehavi gave an algorithm of running time $6^{\mathrm{tw}}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ and a lower bound of $(3-\varepsilon)^{\mathrm{tw}}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ (under the SETH); we close this gap by, on the one hand giving a more careful analysis of their algorithm showing that its complexity is actually $5^{\mathrm{tw}} n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$, and on the other giving a pw-SETH-based lower bound showing that this running time cannot be improved (even for pathwidth), (ii) for Induced Matching we show that their $3^{\mathrm{tw}} n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ algorithm is optimal under the pw-SETH (in fact improving over this for pathwidth is \emph{equivalent} to falsifying the pw-SETH) by adapting a recent reduction for \textsc{Bounded Degree Vertex Deletion}, (iii) for both problems we give FPT algorithms with single-exponential dependence when parameterized by clique-width and in particular for \textsc{Induced Matching} our algorithm has running time $3^{\mathrm{cw}} n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$, which is optimal under the pw-SETH from our previous result.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Local Stoquastic Hamiltonians on 2D Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show the 2-Local Stoquastic Hamiltonian problem on a 2D square lattice is StoqMA-complete. We achieve this by extending the spatially sparse circuit construction of Oliveira and Terhal, as well as the perturbative gadgets of Bravyi, DiVincenzo, Oliveira, and Terhal. Our main contributions demonstrate StoqMA circuits can be made spatially sparse and that geometrical, stoquastic-preserving, perturbative gadgets can be constructed.</description>

      <title>Sharp Phase Transitions in Estimation with Low-Degree Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional planted problems, such as finding a hidden dense subgraph within a random graph, often exhibit a gap between statistical and computational feasibility. While recovering the hidden structure may be statistically possible, it is conjectured to be computationally intractable in certain parameter regimes. A powerful approach to understanding this hardness involves proving lower bounds on the efficacy of low-degree polynomial algorithms. We introduce new techniques for establishing such lower bounds, leading to novel results across diverse settings: planted submatrix, planted dense subgraph, the spiked Wigner model, and the stochastic block model. Notably, our results address the estimation task -- whereas most prior work is limited to hypothesis testing -- and capture sharp phase transitions such as the "BBP" transition in the spiked Wigner model (named for Baik, Ben Arous, and P\'{e}ch\'{e}) and the Kesten-Stigum threshold in the stochastic block model. Existing work on estimation either falls short of achieving these sharp thresholds or is limited to polynomials of very low (constant or logarithmic) degree. In contrast, our results rule out estimation with polynomials of degree $n^{\delta}$ where $n$ is the dimension and $\delta &gt; 0$ is a constant, and in some cases we pin down the optimal constant $\delta$. Our work resolves open problems posed by Hopkins &amp; Steurer (2017) and Schramm &amp; Wein (2022), and provides rigorous support within the low-degree framework for conjectures by Abbe &amp; Sandon (2018) and Lelarge &amp; Miolane (2019).</description>

      <title>The Computational Limits of State-Space Models and Mamba via the Lens of Circuit Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the computational limitations of Mamba and State-space Models (SSMs) by using the circuit complexity framework. Despite Mamba's stateful design and recent attention as a strong candidate to outperform Transformers, we have demonstrated that both Mamba and SSMs with $\mathrm{poly}(n)$-precision and constant-depth layers reside within the $\mathsf{DLOGTIME}$-uniform $\mathsf{TC}^0$ complexity class. This result indicates Mamba has the same computational capabilities as Transformer theoretically, and it cannot solve problems like arithmetic formula problems, boolean formula value problems, and permutation composition problems if $\mathsf{TC}^0 \neq \mathsf{NC}^1$. Therefore, it challenges the assumption Mamba is more computationally expressive than Transformers. Our contributions include rigorous proofs showing that Selective SSM and Mamba architectures can be simulated by $\mathsf{DLOGTIME}$-uniform $\mathsf{TC}^0$ circuits, and they cannot solve problems outside $\mathsf{TC}^0$.</description>

      <title>Boolean Functions with Minimal Spectral Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show examples of total Boolean functions that depend on $n$ variables and have spectral sensitivity $\Theta(\sqrt{\log n})$, which is asymptotically minimal. Our main new function combines the Hamming code with the Boolean address function and has $\lambda(f) = \sqrt{(1+o(1)) \log_2 n}$, which is optimal even up to a constant factor. By combining this function with itself in a specific way, we also obtain a family of functions with $\text{s}_0(f) = (c+o(1)) \log_2 n$ and $\text{s}_0(f) = (1-c+o(1)) \log_2 n$ for any $c \in [0,1]$. This is an optimal tradeoff for Boolean functions with low sensitivity, as the lower bound on sensitivity by Simon generalizes to \[\text{s}_0(f)+\text{s}_1(f)\geq\log_2 n - \log_2 \log_2 n + 2.\] As a corollary, this gives a new example of a function with minimal possible sensitivity (up to a constant factor), $\text{s}(f) = (\frac{1}{2}+o(1)) \log_2 n$.</description>

      <title>Non-crossing $H$-graphs: a generalization of proper interval graphs admitting FPT algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove new parameterized complexity results for the FO Model Checking problem and in particular for Independent Set, for two recently introduced subclasses of $H$-graphs, namely proper $H$-graphs and non-crossing $H$-graphs. It is known that proper $H$-graphs, and thus $H$-graphs, may have unbounded twin-width. However, we prove that for every connected multigraph $H$ with no self-loops, non-crossing $H$-graphs have bounded proper mixed-thinness, and thus bounded twin-width. Consequently, we can apply a well-known result of Bonnet, Kim, Thomass\'e, and Watrigant (2021) to find that the FO Model Checking problem is in $\mathsf{FPT}$ for non-crossing $H$-graphs when parameterized by $\Vert H \Vert+\ell$, where $\Vert H \Vert$ is the size of $H$ and $\ell$ is the size of a formula. In particular, this implies that Independent Set is in $\mathsf{FPT}$ on non-crossing $H$-graphs when parameterized by $\Vert H \Vert+k$, where $k$ is the solution size. In contrast, Independent Set for general $H$-graphs is $\mathsf{W[1]}$-hard when parameterized by $\Vert H \Vert +k$. We strengthen the latter result by proving thatIndependent Set is $\mathsf{W[1]}$-hard even on proper $H$-graphs when parameterized by $\Vert H \Vert+k$. In this way, we solve, subject to $\mathsf{W[1]}\neq \mathsf{FPT}$, an open problem of Chaplick (2023), who asked whether there exist problems that can be solved faster for non-crossing $H$-graphs than for proper $H$-graphs.</description>

      <title>Finding Maximum Common Contractions Between Phylogenetic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16713v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we lay the groundwork on the comparison of phylogenetic networks based on edge contractions and expansions as edit operations, as originally proposed by Robinson and Foulds to compare trees. We prove that these operations connect the space of all phylogenetic networks on the same set of leaves, even if we forbid contractions that create cycles. This allows to define an operational distance on this space, as the minimum number of contractions and expansions required to transform one network into another. We highlight the difference between this distance and the computation of the maximum common contraction between two networks. Given its ability to outline a common structure between them, which can provide valuable biological insights, we study the algorithmic aspects of the latter. We first prove that computing a maximum common contraction between two networks is NP-hard, even when the maximum degree, the size of the common contraction, or the number of leaves is bounded. We also provide lower bounds to the problem based on the Exponential-Time Hypothesis. Nonetheless, we do provide a polynomial-time algorithm for weakly-galled trees, a generalization of galled trees.</description>

      <title>Looped ReLU MLPs May Be All You Need as Practical Programmable Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous work has demonstrated that attention mechanisms are Turing complete. More recently, it has been shown that a looped 9-layer Transformer can function as a universal programmable computer. In contrast, the multi-layer perceptrons with $\mathsf{ReLU}$ activation ($\mathsf{ReLU}$-$\mathsf{MLP}$), one of the most fundamental components of neural networks, is known to be expressive; specifically, a two-layer neural network is a universal approximator given an exponentially large number of hidden neurons. However, it remains unclear whether a $\mathsf{ReLU}$-$\mathsf{MLP}$ can be made into a universal programmable computer using a practical number of weights. In this work, we provide an affirmative answer that a looped 23-layer $\mathsf{ReLU}$-$\mathsf{MLP}$ is capable of performing the basic necessary operations, more efficiently and effectively functioning as a programmable computer than a looped Transformer. This indicates simple modules have stronger expressive power than previously expected and have not been fully explored. Our work provides insights into the mechanisms of neural networks and demonstrates that complex tasks, such as functioning as a programmable computer, do not necessarily require advanced architectures like Transformers.</description>

      <title>Vanishing of Schubert Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schubert coefficients are nonnegative integers $c^w_{u,v}$ that arise in Algebraic Geometry and play a central role in Algebraic Combinatorics. It is a major open problem whether they have a combinatorial interpretation, i.e, whether $c^w_{u,v} \in \#{\sf P}$. We study the closely related vanishing problem of Schubert coefficients: $\{c^w_{u,v}=^? 0\}$. Until this work it was open whether this problem is in the polynomial hierarchy ${\sf PH}$. We prove that $\{c^w_{u,v}=^? 0\}$ in ${\sf coAM}$ assuming the GRH. In particular, the vanishing problem is in ${\Sigma_2^{{\text{p}}}}$. Our approach is based on constructions lifted formulations, which give polynomial systems of equations for the problem. The result follows from a reduction to Parametric Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, recently studied in arXiv:2408.13027. We extend our results to all classical types. Type $D$ is resolved in the appendix (joint with David Speyer).</description>
