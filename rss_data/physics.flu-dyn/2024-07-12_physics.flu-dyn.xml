      <title>Practical deviational particle method for variance reduction in polyatomic gas DSMC simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method is a widely used stochastic particle approach to solving the Boltzmann equation. However, its computational cost remains a major drawback, which can be attributed to statistical errors when handling flows with low Mach numbers. Thus, many studies have focused on variance reduction to reduce the computational cost. One approach is the deviational particle (DP) method, which focuses solely on modeling deviations from the equilibrium state. The DP method has been implemented in the low-variance deviational simulation Monte Carlo (LVDSMC) method, which has proven effective for monatomic gas simulations but faces limitations when extended to polyatomic gases. In this study, we present a practical DP method for polyatomic gas simulations that combines the LVDSMC method with the Larsen-Borgnakke (LB) model, which introduces a group reduction algorithm for the inelastic collision process. Numerical experiments demonstrated that the proposed method efficiently and accurately simulates flows across a relatively broad range of non-equilibrium values. Remarkably, the variance was reduced to about 5% that of the DSMC method.</description>

      <title>Optimal Sparsity in Nonlinear Non-Parametric Reduced Order Models for Transonic Aeroelastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms typically require large amount of data for training. This means that for nonlinear aeroelastic applications, where small training budgets are driven by the high computational burden associated with generating data, usability of such methods has been limited to highly simplified aeroelastic systems. This paper presents a novel approach for the identification of optimized sparse higher-order polynomial-based aeroelastic reduced order models (ROM) to significantly reduce the amount of training data needed without sacrificing fidelity. Several sparsity promoting algorithms are considered, including; rigid sparsity, LASSO regression, and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). The study demonstrates that through OMP, it is possible to efficiently identify optimized s-sparse nonlinear aerodynamic ROMs using only aerodynamic response information. This approach is exemplified in a three-dimensional aeroelastic stabilator model experiencing high amplitude freeplay-induced limit cycles. The comparison shows excellent agreement between the ROM and the full-order aeroelastic response, including the ability to generalize to new freeplay and velocity index values, with online computational savings of several orders of magnitude. The development of an Optimally Sparse ROM (OS-ROM) extends previous higher-order polynomial-based ROM approaches for feasible application to complex three-dimensional nonlinear aeroelastic problems, without incurring significant computational burdens or loss of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Force-dependence of the rigid-body motion for an arbitrarily shaped particle in a forced, incompressible Stokes flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a particle moves in a Newtonian flow at low Reynolds number, inertia is irrelevant and a linear relationship exists between velocities and forces. For incompressible flows, any force distribution $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{r})$ acting in the fluid bulk induces flow and motion only through its solenoidal component. For force distributions that are spatially localized (i.e., vanish sufficiently fast at infinity), we derive the representation of the rigid body motion as an explicit linear functional of $\nabla\times\mathbf{f}$, which complements the usual representation in terms of $\mathbf{f}$. We illustrate the utility of this alternative representation, which has the advantage of having the incompressibility constraint built-in, in avoiding certain ambiguities that arise, e.g., when implementing approximations for swimmers.</description>

      <title>Many wrong models approach to localize an odor source in turbulence: introducing the weighted Bayesian update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of locating an odor source in turbulent environments is central to key applications such as environmental monitoring and disaster response. We address this challenge by designing an algorithm based on Bayesian inference, which uses odor measurements from an ensemble of static sensors to estimate the source position through a stochastic model of the environment. Given the practical impossibility of achieving a fully consistent turbulent model and guaranteeing convergence to the correct solution, we propose a method to rank 'many wrong models' and to blend their predictions. We evaluate our weighted Bayesian update algorithm by its ability to estimate the source location with predefined accuracy and/or within a specified time frame, and compare it to standard Monte Carlo sampling methods. To demonstrate the robustness and potential applications of both approaches under realistic environmental conditions, we use high-quality direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations to mimic the transport of odors in the atmospheric boundary layer. Despite minimal prior information about the source and environmental conditions, our proposed approach consistently proves to be more accurate, reliable, and robust than Monte Carlo methods, thus showing promise as a new tool for addressing the odor source localization problem in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Modeling Hydraulic Fracture Entering Stress Barrier: Theory and Practical Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical modeling of hydraulic fracturing is complicated when a fracture reaches a stress barrier. For high barriers, it may require changing of a computational scheme. Despite there are examples of modeling propagation through barriers, there is no general theory clarifying when and why conventional schemes may become inefficient, and how to overcome computational difficulties. The paper presents the theory and practical recommendations following from it. We start from the definition of the barrier intensity, which exposes that the barrier strength may change from zero for contrast-free propagation to infinity for channelized propagation. The analysis reveals two types of computational difficulties caused by spatial discretization: (i) general arising for fine grids and aggravated by a barrier; and (ii) specific, caused entirely by a strong barrier. The asymptotic approach which avoids spatial discretization is suggested. It is illustrated by solving bench-mark problems for barriers of arbitrary intensity. The analysis distinguishes three typical stages of the fracture penetration into a barrier, and provides theoretical values of the Nolte-Smith slope parameter and arrest time as functions of the barrier intensity. Special analysis establishes the accuracy and bounds of the asymptotic approach. It appears that the approach provides physically significant and accurate results for fracture penetration into high, intermediate and even weak stress barriers. On this basis, simple practical recommendations are given for modeling hydraulic fractures in rocks with stress barriers. The recommendations may be promptly implemented in any program using spatial discretization to model fracture propagation.</description>

      <title>Flame spread over thin circular PMMA rods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a series of opposed flow flame spread experiments, conducted using cast cylindrical PMMA (acrylic) rods, 80 mm long and of diameters 1 mm and 0.5 mm, in normal gravity and microgravity environments. The experiments are primarily conducted for molar oxygen levels of 21%, 23% and 40% at 1 atmosphere pressure and opposed flow speed ranging from 0 cm/s to 25 cm/s. Experiments are also conducted in normal gravity for oxygen levels 21% to 60% to study the effect of oxygen level. At near ambient oxygen levels, the flame shape in microgravity resembles a mushroom and there are fluctuations at the leading edge due to sporadic fuel jets emanating from bursting bubbles at the fuel surface. The flame spreads faster in microgravity, which is determined to be due to increased preheat length. Preheat length is measured for flame spreading over 1 mm diameter fuel rod under no flow condition using fine thermocouples and is found to be 0.98 cm in microgravity and 0.34 cm in normal gravity. It is found that for scaling analysis, including Stefan flow velocity in the definition of reference velocity results in a reasonable estimate of the preheat length of a flame spreading in quiescent microgravity environment. At high oxygen levels (&gt; 35%) the flame becomes turbulent and spreads at nearly the same rate in normal gravity and microgravity environments and the flame spread rates are not affected by external flow speed.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic model hierarchy for fiber melt spinning of semi-crystalline polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the fiber melt spinning of semi-crystalline polymers, the degree of crystallization can be non-homogeneous over the cross-section of the fiber, affecting the properties of the end product. For simulation-based process design, the question arises as to which fiber quantities and hence model equations must be resolved in radial direction to capture all practically relevant effects and at the same time imply a model that can be computed with reasonable effort. In this paper, we present a hierarchy of viscoelastic two-phase fiber models ranging from a complex, fully resolved and highly expensive three-dimensional description to a cross-sectionally averaged, cheap-to-evaluate one-dimensional model. In particular, we propose a novel stress-averaged one-two-dimensional fiber model, which circumvents additional assumptions on the inlet profiles needed in the established stress-resolved fiber model by Doufas et al.\ (2001). Simulation results demonstrate the performance and application regime of the dimensionally reduced models. The novel stress-averaged variant provides fast and reliable results, especially in the regime of low flow-enhanced crystallization.</description>

      <title>All-optical method to directly measure the pressure-volume-temperature equation of state of fluids in the diamond anvil cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a new all-optical method to directly measure the pressure-volume (PVT) equation of state (EOS) of fluids and transparent solids in the diamond anvil high pressure cell, by measuring the changes in refractive index and sample volume upon pressure increase. Furthermore, we combine this with a new analysis method which exploits the mutual dependence of sample density and refractive index: Experimentally, the refractive index determines the measured sample chamber thickness (and therefore sample volume/density), yet the sample density is by far the dominant factor in determining the variation in refractive index with pressure. Our analysis method allows us to obtain a set of values for the density and refractive index which are mutually consistent, and agree with the experimental data within error. We have conducted proof-of-concept experiments on a variety of samples (H$_{2}$O, CH$_{4}$, C$_{2}$H$_{6}$, C$_{3}$H$_{8}$, KCl and NaCl) at ambient temperature, and at high temperatures up to just above 500 K. Our proof-of-concept data demonstrate that our method is able to reproduce known fluid and solid EOS within error. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method allows us to directly and routinely measure the PVT EOS of simple fluids at GPa pressures up to, at least, 514 K (the highest temperature reached in our study). A reasonable estimation of the known sources of error in our volume determinations indicates that the error is currently $\pm$ 2.7% at high temperature, and that it is feasible to reduce it to ca. $\pm$ 1% in future work.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium states of a liquid bridge between flexible sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study equilibrium states of a drop between flexible sheets clamped on both ends. Revisiting first the case of parallel sheets, we find multiple equilibria which we classify in a parameter space. In solution branching diagrams we identify hysteresis cycles and folds indicating abrupt transitions, yet not necessarily leading to channel collapse. Between nonparallel sheets, a drop can stay in equilibrium away from the ends even when the liquid is totally wetting, which is impossible between nonparallel rigid plates. We also show that nonparallel sheets can delay or prevent collapse in comparison to straight channels, suggesting thus a mechanism that protects slender structures inside micro-devices from damage by surface tension.</description>

      <title>Dissolution of variable-in-shape drug particles via the level-set method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we deal with a mathematical model describing the dissolution process of irregularly shaped particles. In particular, we consider a complete dissolution model accounting for both surface kinetics and convective diffusion, for three drugs with different solubility and wettability: theophylline, griseofulvin, and nimesulide. The possible subsequent recrystallization process in the bulk fluid is also considered. The governing differential equations are revisited in the context of the level-set method and Hamilton-Jacobi equations, then they are solved numerically. This choice allows us to deal with the simultaneous dissolution of hundreds of different polydisperse particles. We show the results of many computer simulations which investigate the impact of the particle size, shape, area/volume ratio, and the dependence of the interfacial mass transport coefficient on the surface curvature.</description>

      <title>Modeling straight and circle swimmers via immersed boundary methods: from single swimmer to collective motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a minimal model of microswimmer based on immersed boundary methods. We describe a swimmer (either pusher or puller) as a distribution of point forces, representing the swimmer's flagellum and body, with only the latter subjected to no-slip boundary conditions with respect to the surrounding fluid. In particular, our model swimmer consists of only three beads (two for the body and one for the flagellum) connected by inextensible and rigid links. When the beads are collinear, standard straight swimming is realized and, in the absence of propulsion, we demonstrate that the swimmer's body behaves as an infinitely thin rod. Conversely, by imposing an angle between body and flagellum the swimmer moves on circular orbits. We then discuss how two swimmers, in collinear or non-collinear geometry, scatter upon encounter. Finally, we explore the dynamics of a large number of swimmers reacting to one another only via hydrodynamic interactions, and exemplify their complex collective dynamics in both straight and circular swimmers.</description>

      <title>An Equation of State for Turbulence in the Gross-Pitaevskii model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the numerical observation of a far-from-equilibrium equation of state (EoS) in the Gross-Pitaevskii model. This universal dimensionless EoS is constructed by relating the turbulent cascade's scale-free spectrum amplitude to the energy flux of the steady state that emerges from the large-length-scale driving of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Remarkably, this EoS defies the generic predictions of wave-turbulent kinetic theory, even though the cascade spectra are quantitatively well understood within that theory. Finally, we find that the concept of quasi-static thermodynamic processes between equilibrium states extends to far-from-equilibrium steady states.</description>

      <title>Using theory and experiments of spheres moving near boundaries to optimize the method of images for regularized Stokeslets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16214v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The general system of images for regularized Stokeslets (GSIRS) developed by Cortez and Varela (2015) is used extensively to model Stokes flow phenomena such as microorganisms swimming near a boundary. Our collaborative team uses dynamically similar scaled macroscopic experiments to test theories for forces and torques on spheres moving near a boundary and use these data and the method of regularized Stokeslets (MRS) created by Cortez et al. (2015) to calibrate the GSIRS. We find excellent agreement between theory and experiments, which provides the first experimental validation of such series solutions for spheres moving near an infinite plane boundary. We test two surface discretization methods commonly used in the literature: the six-patch method and the spherical centroidal Voronoi tessellation (SCVT) method. Our data show that the SCVT method provides the most accurate results when the motional symmetry is broken by the presence of a boundary. We use theory and the MRS to find optimal values for the regularization parameter in free space and show that the optimal regularization parameter values can be fit with simple formulae when using the SCVT method, so that other researchers have an easy reference. We also present a regularization function with higher order accuracy when compared with the regularization function previously introduced by Cortez et al. (2005). The simulated force and torque values compare very well with experiments and theory for a wide range of boundary distances. But, we find the simulations lose accuracy when the gap between the edge of the sphere and the wall is smaller than the average distance between grid points using the SCVT method. Our computational parameters and MATLAB and PYTHON implementations of the Lee and Leal (1980) theory provide researchers with important resources to optimize the numerical simulations of spheres moving near boundaries.</description>

      <title>Data-driven transient lift attenuation for extreme vortex gust-airfoil interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a data-driven feedforward control to attenuate large transient lift experienced by an airfoil disturbed by an extreme level of discrete vortex gust. The current analysis uses a nonlinear machine-learning technique to compress the high-dimensional flow dynamics onto a low-dimensional manifold. While the interaction dynamics between the airfoil and extreme vortex gust are parameterized by its size, gust ratio, and position, the wake responses are well-captured on this simple manifold. The effect of extreme vortex disturbance about the undisturbed baseline flows can be extracted in a physically-interpretable manner. Furthermore, we call on phase-amplitude reduction to model and control the complex nonlinear extreme aerodynamic flows. The present phase-amplitude reduction model reveals the sensitivity of the dynamical system in terms of the phase shift and amplitude change induced by external forcing with respect to the baseline periodic orbit. By performing the phase-amplitude analysis for a latent dynamical model identified by sparse regression, the sensitivity functions of low-dimensionalized aerodynamic flows for both phase and amplitude are derived. With the phase and amplitude sensitivity functions, optimal forcing can be determined to quickly suppress the effect of extreme vortex gusts towards the undisturbed states in a low-order space. The present optimal flow modification built upon the machine-learned low-dimensional subspace quickly alleviates the impact of transient vortex gusts for a variety of extreme aerodynamic scenarios, providing a potential foundation for flight of small-scale air vehicles in adverse atmospheric conditions.</description>

      <title>On the Preprocessing of Physics-informed Neural Networks: How to Better Utilize Data in Fluid Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) serve as a flexible alternative for tackling forward and inverse problems in differential equations, displaying impressive advancements in diverse areas of applied mathematics. Despite integrating both data and underlying physics to enrich the neural network's understanding, concerns regarding the effectiveness and practicality of PINNs persist. Over the past few years, extensive efforts in the current literature have been made to enhance this evolving method, by drawing inspiration from both machine learning algorithms and numerical methods. Despite notable progressions in PINNs algorithms, the important and fundamental field of data preprocessing remain unexplored, limiting the applications of PINNs especially in solving inverse problems. Therefore in this paper, a concise yet potent data preprocessing method focusing on data normalization was proposed. By applying a linear transformation to both the data and corresponding equations concurrently, the normalized PINNs approach was evaluated on the task of reconstructing flow fields in three turbulent cases. The results illustrate that by adhering to the data preprocessing procedure, PINNs can robustly achieve higher prediction accuracy for all flow quantities under different hyperparameter setups, without incurring extra computational cost, distinctly improving the utilization of limited training data. Though only verified in Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, this method holds potential for application to various other equations.</description>

Abstract: Single flagellated bacteria are ubiquitous in nature. They exhibit various swimming modes using their flagella to explore complex surroundings such as soil and porous polymer networks. Some single-flagellated bacteria swim with two distinct modes, one with its flagellum extended away from its body and another with its flagellum wrapped around it. The wrapped mode has been observed when bacteria swim under tight confinements or in highly viscous polymeric melts. In this study we investigate the hydrodynamics of these two modes inside a circular pipe. We find that the wrapped mode is slower than the extended mode in bulk but more efficient under strong confinement due to a hydrodynamic increase of its flagellum translation-rotation coupling and an Archimedes' screw-like configuration that helps to move the fluid along the pipe.</description>

      <title>New limiter regions for multidimensional flows</title>

Abstract: Accurate transport algorithms are crucial for computational fluid dynamics and more accurate and efficient schemes are always in development. One dimensional limiting is commonly employed to suppress nonphysical oscillations. However, the application of such limiters can reduce accuracy. It is important to identify the weakest set of sufficient conditions required on the limiter as to allow the development of successful numerical algorithms.
  The main goal of this paper is to identify new less restrictive sufficient conditions for flux form in-compressible advection to remain monotonic. We identify additional necessary conditions for incompressible flux form advection to be monotonic, demonstrating that the Spekreijse limiter region is not sufficient for incompressible flux form advection to remain monotonic. Then a convex combination argument is used to derive new sufficient conditions that are less restrictive than the Sweby region for a discrete maximum principle. This allows the introduction of two new more general limiter regions suitable for flux form incompressible advection.</description>
