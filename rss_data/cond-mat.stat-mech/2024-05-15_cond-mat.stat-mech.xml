      <title>Tensor networks for $p$-spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a tensor network algorithm for the solution of $p$-spin models. We show that bond compression through rank-revealing decompositions performed during the tensor network contraction resolves logical redundancies in the system exactly and is thus lossless, yet leads to qualitative changes in runtime scaling in different regimes of the model. First, we find that bond compression emulates the so-called leaf-removal algorithm, solving the problem efficiently in the "easy" phase. Past a dynamical phase transition, we observe superpolynomial runtimes, reflecting the appearance of a core component. We then develop a graphical method to study the scaling of contraction for a minimal ensemble of core-only instances, for which leaf removal is ineffective. We find subexponential scaling, improving on the exponential scaling that occurs without compression. Our results suggest that our tensor network algorithm subsumes the classical leaf removal algorithm and simplifies redundancies in the $p$-spin model through lossless compression, all without explicit knowledge of the problem's structure.</description>

      <title>Exploring Dynamical Phase Transitions in the XY Chain through Linear Quench: Early and Long-term Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics induced by a finite-time linear quench in the XY chain. Initially, we examine the dynamical quantum phase transition, characterized by the nonanalytic behavior of the Loschmidt amplitude. We find distinct behaviors of DQPTs during and following the ramp. Following the ramp, the ramp crossing the critical point $h_{c}$ is the sufficient condition for the occurrence of DQPT, but it is not during the ramp. Through AIA approximation analysis, we establish that adequate distancing from the critical point is crucial for DQPT manifestation during the ramp, elucidating the absence of DQPT as the ramp gets faster. Additionally, we explore another type of dynamical phase transition, describing the long-term relaxation behavior of the order parameter. Our finding indicates that the asymptotic behavior of the time-dependent part induced by the linear quench is equivalent to that following a sudden quench, i.e., time-dependent part exhibits power-law decays of $\sim t^{-3/2}$ and $\sim t^{-1/2}$ for the ramp to the commensurate and incommensurate phases, respectively. Moreover, we also delve into the steady part, which showcases nonanalytic singularities at the critical point.</description>

      <title>The Flux Hypothesis for Odd Transport Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Onsager's regression hypothesis makes a fundamental connection between macroscopic transport phenomena and the average relaxation of spontaneous microscopic fluctuations. This relaxation, however, is agnostic to odd transport phenomena, in which fluxes run orthogonal to the gradients driving them. To account for odd transport, we generalize the regression hypothesis, postulating that macroscopic linear constitutive laws are, on average, obeyed by microscopic fluctuations, whether they contribute to relaxation or not. From this "flux hypothesis," Green-Kubo and reciprocal relations follow, elucidating the separate roles of broken time-reversal and parity symmetries underlying various odd transport coefficients. As an application, we derive and verify the Green-Kubo relation for odd collective diffusion in chiral active matter, first in an analytically-tractable model and subsequently through molecular dynamics simulations of concentrated active spinners.</description>

      <title>Mutual information and the encoding of contingency tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mutual information is commonly used as a measure of similarity between competing labelings of a given set of objects, for example to quantify performance in classification and community detection tasks. As argued recently, however, the mutual information as conventionally defined can return biased results because it neglects the information cost of the so-called contingency table, a crucial component of the similarity calculation. In principle the bias can be rectified by subtracting the appropriate information cost, leading to the modified measure known as the reduced mutual information, but in practice one can only ever compute an upper bound on this information cost, and the value of the reduced mutual information depends crucially on how good a bound is established. In this paper we describe an improved method for encoding contingency tables that gives a substantially better bound in typical use cases, and approaches the ideal value in the common case where the labelings are closely similar, as we demonstrate with extensive numerical results.</description>

      <title>Doppler sensitivity and resonant tuning of Rydberg atom-based antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio frequency antennas based on Rydberg atom vapor cells can in principle reach sensitivities beyond those of any wire antenna, especially at lower frequencies where long wires are needed to accommodate a growing wavelength. They also have other desirable features such as nonmetallic, lower profile, elements. This paper presents a detailed theoretical investigation of Rydberg antenna sensitivity, elucidating parameter regimes that could cumulatively lead to 2--3 orders of magnitude sensitivity increase beyond that of currently tested configurations. The key insight is to optimally combine the advantages of two well-studied approaches: (i) three laser ``2D star configuration'' setups that, enhanced also with increased laser power, help compensate for atom motion-induced Doppler broadening, and (ii) resonant coupling between a pair of near-degenerate Rydberg levels, tuned via a local oscillator to the incident signal. The advantage of the star setup is subtle because it only restores overall sensitivity to the expected Doppler-limited value, compensating for additional off-resonance reductions where differently moving atom populations destructively interfere with each other in the net signal. The additional unique advantage of the local oscillator tuning is that it leads to vastly narrower line widths, as low as ~10 kHz set by the intrinsic Rydberg state lifetimes, rather than the typical ~10 MHz set by the core state lifetimes. Intuitively, with this setup the two Rydberg states may be tuned to act as an independent high-q cavity, a point of view supported through a study of the frequency-dependence of the antenna resonant response. There are a number of practical experimental advances, especially larger ~1 cm laser beam widths, required to suppress various extrinsic line broadening effects and to fully exploit this cavity response.</description>

      <title>An Area Law for Entanglement Entropy in Particle Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scattering cross section is the effective area of collision when two particles collide. Quantum mechanically, it is a measure of the probability for a specific process to take place. Employing wave packets to describe the scattering process, we compute the entanglement entropy in 2-to-2 scattering of particles in a general setting using the $S$-matrix formalism. Applying the optical theorem, we show that the linear entropy $\mathcal{E}_2$ is given by the elastic cross section $\sigma_{\text{el}}$ in unit of the transverse size $L^2$ of the wave packet, $\mathcal{E}_2 \sim \sigma_{\text{el}}/L^2$, when the initial states are not entangled. The result allows for dual interpretations of the entanglement entropy as an area and as a probability. Since $\sigma_{\text{el}}$ is generally believed, and observed experimentally, to grow with the collision energy $\sqrt{s}$ in the high energy regime, the result suggests a "second law" of entanglement entropy for high energy collisions. Furthermore, the Froissart bound places an upper limit on the entropy growth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of quenched disorder in the critical $O(2)$ vector model. We first review, in the modern language of Conformal Perturbation Theory, the random temperature perturbation in $4-\epsilon$. Then, we present a direct computation in $3d$. The pure CFT is now strongly interacting, and its CFT data are determined in recent numerical bootstrap studies. We then explore the anisotropic disorder associated with the lowest-dimension charge-$2$ scalar, which is relevant in $3d$. This perturbation breaks locally $O(2)$. However, the symmetry is restored in the IR in a weakly coupled new fixed point.</description>

      <title>From the Quantum Breakdown Model to the Lattice Gauge Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The one-dimensional quantum breakdown model, which features spatially asymmetric fermionic interactions simulating the electrical breakdown phenomenon, exhibits an exponential U(1) symmetry and a variety of dynamical phases including many-body localization and quantum chaos with quantum scar states. We investigate the minimal quantum breakdown model with the minimal number of on-site fermion orbitals required for the interaction, and identify a large number of local conserved charges in the model. We then reveal a mapping between the minimal quantum breakdown model in certain charge sectors and a quantum link model which simulates the $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory, and show that the local conserved charges map to the gauge symmetry generators. A special charge sector of the model further maps to the PXP model, which shows quantum many-body scars. This mapping unveils the rich dynamics in different Krylov subspaces characterized by different gauge configurations in the quantum breakdown model.</description>

      <title>Plaquette Models, Cellular Automata, and Measurement-induced Criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a class of two-dimensional randomized plaquette models, where the multi-spin interaction term, referred to as the plaquette term, is replaced by a single-site spin term with a probability of $1-p$. By varying $p$, we observe a ground state phase transition, or equivalently, a phase transition of the symmetry operator. We find that as we vary $p$, the symmetry operator changes from being extensive to being localized in space. These models can be equivalently understood as 1+1D randomized cellular automaton dynamics, allowing the 2D transition to be interpreted as a 1+1D dynamical absorbing phase transition. In this paper, our primary focus is on the plaquette term with three or five-body interactions, where we explore the universality classes of the transitions. Specifically, for the model with five-body interaction, we demonstrate that it belongs to the same universality class as the measurement-induced entanglement phase transition observed in 1+1D Clifford dynamics, as well as the boundary entanglement transition of the 2D cluster state induced by random bulk Pauli measurements. This work establishes a connection between transitions in classical spin models, cellular automata, and hybrid random circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for precision measurement utilizing an ensemble of probabilistic bits (p-bits). This method leverages the inherent fluctuations of p-bits to achieve high sensitivity in various applications, including magnetic field sensing, temperature monitoring and timekeeping. The sensitivity scales proportionally to the square root of the total number of p-bits, enabling unprecedented accuracy with large ensembles. Furthermore, the robustness of this method against device imperfections and non-uniformity enhances its practicality and scalability. This work paves the way for a new paradigm in precision measurement, offering a cost-effective and versatile alternative to traditional methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems with a complex dynamics like glasses or models of biological evolution are often pictured in terms of complex landscapes, with a large number of possible collective states. We show on the example of a stochastic spin model with non-reciprocal and heterogeneous interactions how the complex landscape notion can be generalized far from equilibrium, where collective states may exhibit spontaneous oscillations, often hidden by the presence of disorder. We identify relevant observables, like the density of entropy production, to unveil the presence of oscillations, and we characterize the complex landscape of our model in terms of a configurational entropy, that counts the number of nonequilibrium collective states with a given entropy production density.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the formation of ionic defects to study the ice Ih/XI transition with molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.09308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ice Ih, the common form of ice in the biosphere, contains proton disorder. Its proton-ordered counterpart, ice XI, is thermodynamically stable below 72 K. However, even below this temperature the formation of ice XI is kinetically hindered and experimentally it is obtained by doping ice with KOH. Doping creates ionic defects that promote the migration of protons and the associated change in proton configuration. In this article, we mimic the effect of doping in molecular dynamics simulations using a bias potential that enhances the formation of ionic defects. The recombination of the ions thus formed proceeds through fast migration of the hydroxide and results in the jump of protons along a hydrogen bond loop. This provides a physical and expedite way to change the proton configuration, and to accelerate diffusion in proton configuration space. A key ingredient of this approach is a machine learning potential trained with density functional theory data and capable of modeling molecular dissociation. We exemplify the usefulness of this idea by studying the order-disorder transition using an appropriate order parameter to distinguish the proton environments in ice Ih and XI. We calculate the changes in free energy, enthalpy, and entropy associated with the transition. Our estimated entropy agrees with experiment within the error bars of our calculation.</description>

      <title>Disconnected entanglement entropy as a marker of edge modes in a periodically driven Kitaev chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.16353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the disconnected entanglement entropy (DEE) of a Kitaev chain in which the chemical potential is periodically modulated with $\delta$-function pulses within the framework of Floquet theory. For this driving protocol, the DEE of a sufficiently large system with open boundary conditions turns out to be integer-quantized, with the integer being equal to the number of Majorana edge modes localized at each edge of the chain generated by the periodic driving, thereby establishing the DEE as a marker for detecting Floquet Majorana edge modes. Analysing the DEE, we further show that these Majorana edge modes are robust against weak spatial disorder and temporal noise. Interestingly, we find that the DEE may, in some cases, also detect the anomalous edge modes which can be generated by periodic driving of the nearest-neighbor hopping, even though such modes have no topological significance and not robust against spatial disorder. We also probe the behaviour of the DEE for a kicked Ising chain in the presence of an integrability breaking interaction which has been experimentally realized.</description>

      <title>Anomalous dynamic scaling of Ising interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.00914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Until very recently, the asymptotic occurrence of intrinsic anomalous scaling has been expected to require concomitant effects for kinetically rough interfaces, like quenched disorder or morphological instabilities. However, counterexamples have been recently reported for simpler situations dominated by time-dependent noise, as in the discrete growth system associated with an Ising model proposed by H.\ Dashti-Naserabadi {\em et al.}\ [Phys.\ Rev.\ E {\bf 100}, 060101(R) (2019)], who assessed the equilibrium behavior of the model. Here we revisit this system to characterize its time-dependent behavior in two and three dimensions (one-and two-dimensional interfaces, respectively). While the 3D case seems dominated by a fast evolution beyond critical dynamics, in the 2D case numerical simulations of an associated time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation retrieve the same static (roughness) exponents and the same intrinsic anomalous scaling Ansatz as in the equilibrium case, throughout the full time evolution. However, the dynamic exponent is seen to cross over between two different values, none of which enables identification with previously known universality classes of kinetic roughening. Simulations for larger system sizes moreover suggest breakdown of scaling behavior at the largest scales, suggesting that the previously reported scaling behavior may be effective and restricted to relatively small systems.</description>

      <title>A unified perspective on exponential tilt and bridge algorithms for rare trajectories of discrete Markov processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article analyzes and compares two general techniques of rare event simulation for generating paths of Markov processes over fixed time horizons: exponential tilting and stochastic bridge. These two methods allow to accurately compute the probability that a Markov process ends within a rare region, which is unlikely to be attained. Exponential tilting is a general technique for obtaining an alternative or tilted sampling probability measure, under which the Markov process becomes likely to hit the rare region at terminal time. The stochastic bridge technique involves conditioning paths towards two endpoints: the terminal point and the initial one. The terminal point is generated from some appropriately chosen probability distribution that covers well the rare region. We show that both methods belong to the class of importance sampling procedures, by providing a common mathematical framework of these two conceptually different methods of sampling rare trajectories. We also conduct a numerical comparison of these two methods, revealing distinct areas of application for each Monte Carlo method, where they exhibit superior efficiency. Detailed simulation algorithms are provided.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Hamiltonian of a nonrelativistic Fermi gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the entanglement Hamiltonian for a spherical domain in the ground state of a nonrelativistic free-fermion gas in arbitrary dimensions. Decomposed into a set of radial entanglement Hamiltonians, we show that the entanglement spectrum in each sector is identical to that of a hopping chain in a linear potential, with the angular momentum playing the role of the subsystem boundary. Furthermore, the eigenfunctions follow from a commuting differential operator that has exactly the form predicted by conformal field theory. Rescaled by the radial Fermi velocity, this operator gives a perfect approximation of the entanglement Hamiltonian, except for large angular momenta that belong to the edge regime in the analogous gradient chain. One thus finds that the conformal field theory result becomes asymptotically exact only in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the overlap distribution in driven mean-field spin models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a statistical physics context, inverse problems consist in determining microscopic interactions such that a system reaches a predefined collective state. A complex collective state may be prescribed by specifying the overlap distribution between microscopic configurations, a notion originally introduced in the context of disordered systems like spin-glasses. We show that in spite of the absence of disorder, nonequilibrium spin models exhibiting spontaneous magnetization oscillations provide a benchmark to prescribe a non-trivial overlap distribution with continuous support, qualitatively analogous to the ones found in disordered systems with full replica symmetry breaking. The overlap distribution can be explicitly tailored to take a broad range of predefined shapes by monitoring the spin dynamics. The presence of a non-trivial overlap distribution is traced back to an average over infinitely many pure states, a feature shared with spin-glasses, although the structure of pure states is here much simpler.</description>

      <title>On the universal properties of stochastic processes under optimally tuned Poisson restart</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Poisson restart assumes that a stochastic process is interrupted and starts again at random time moments. A number of studies have demonstrated that this strategy may minimize the expected completion time in some classes of random search tasks. What is more, it turned out that under optimally tuned restart rate, any stochastic process, regardless of its nature and statistical details, satisfies a number of universal relations for the statistical moments of completion time. In this paper, we describe several new universal properties of optimally restarted processes. Also we obtain a universal inequality for the quadratic statistical moments of completion time in the optimization problem where stochastic process has several possible completion scenarios.</description>

      <title>Casimir force within Ising chain with competing interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive exact results for the critical Casimir force (CCF) within the one-dimensional Ising model with periodic boundary conditions (PBC's) and long-range equivalent-neighbor ferromagnetic interactions of strength $J_{l}/N&gt;0$ superimposed on the nearest-neighbor interactions of strength $J_{s}$ which could be either ferromagnetic ($J_{s}&gt;0$) or antiferromagnetic ($J_{s}&lt;0$). In the infinite system limit the model, also known as the Nagle-Kardar model, exhibits in the plane $(K_s=\beta J_s,K_l=\beta J_l)$ a critical line $2 K_l=\exp{\left(-2 K_s\right)}, K_s&gt;-\ln3/4$, which ends at a tricritical point $(K_l=-\sqrt{3}/2, K_s=-\ln3/4)$. The critical Casimir amplitudes are: $\Delta_{\rm Cas}^{\rm (cr)}=1/4$ at the critical line, and $\Delta_{\rm Cas}^{\rm (tr)}=1/3$ at the tricritical point. Quite unexpectedly, with the imposed PBC's the CCF exhibits very unusual behavior as a function of temperature and magnetic field. It is repulsive near the critical line and tricritical point, decaying rapidly with separation from those two singular regimes fast away from them and becoming attractive, displaying in which the maximum amplitude of the attraction exceeds the maximum amplitude of repulsion. This represents a violation of the widely-accepted "boundary condition rule", which holds that the CCF is attractive for equivalent BC's and repulsive for conflicting BC's independently of the actual bulk universality class of the phase transition under investigation.</description>

      <title>Current fluctuations in open quantum systems: Bridging the gap between quantum continuous measurements and full counting statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04270v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuously measured quantum systems are characterized by an output current, in the form of a stochastic and correlated time series which conveys crucial information about the underlying quantum system. The many tools used to describe current fluctuations are scattered across different communities: quantum opticians often use stochastic master equations, while a prevalent approach in condensed matter physics is provided by full counting statistics. These, however, are simply different sides of the same coin. Our goal with this tutorial is to provide a unified toolbox for describing current fluctuations. This not only provides novel insights, by bringing together different fields in physics, but also yields various analytical and numerical tools for computing quantities of interest. We illustrate our results with various pedagogical examples, and connect them with topical fields of research, such as waiting-time statistics, quantum metrology, thermodynamic uncertainty relations, quantum point contacts and Maxwell's demons.</description>

      <title>Biased versus unbiased numerical methods for stochastic simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximate numerical methods are one of the most used strategies to extract information from many-interacting-agents systems. In particular, numerical approximations are of extended use to deal with epidemic, ecological and biological models, since unbiased methods like the Gillespie algorithm can become unpractical due to high CPU time usage required. However, the use of approximations has been debated and there is no clear consensus about whether unbiased methods or biased approach is the best option. In this work, we derive scaling relations for the errors in approximations based on binomial extractions. This finding allows us to build rules to compute the optimal values of both the discretization time and number of realizations needed to compute averages with the biased method with a target precision and minimum CPU-time usage. Furthermore, we also present another rule to discern whether the unbiased method or biased approach is more efficient. Ultimately, we will show that the choice of the method should depend on the desired precision for the estimation of averages.</description>

      <title>Yielding transition of amorphous solids in the presence of aspherical impurities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanical properties of amorphous solids is a crucial area of research due to the fascinating phenomena they exhibit under external deformations and their importance in industrial applications. Although these solids have higher yield strength compared to crystalline solids of similar composition, they often fail catastrophically through shear band formation. Tuning their mechanical behavior is vital for material design. Engineers have long been seeking ways to improve the ability of amorphous solids to withstand external deformations, with micro-alloying being a popular method. By adding small amounts of different materials to pure samples, microalloying can enhance yield strain, although the microscopic mechanisms behind this process remain poorly understood. We conducted a study with extensive molecular dynamics simulations on model amorphous solids to investigate the effect of asphericity of the impurity particles on their yielding behaviour. Our results indicate that aspherical impurities free to rotate can significantly increase the yield threshold. Conversely, when impurities are unable to rotate, they can lead to the formationof extremely brittle, ultrastable-like systems. The rotational degrees of freedom are controlled bychanging the aspect ratio of the impurity,and they play a crucial role in influencing shear bandformation. Additionally, we found that including larger impurities enhances the structural stabilityof the parent glass matrix.</description>

      <title>Magic of quantum hypergraph states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magic, or nonstabilizerness, characterizes the deviation of a quantum state from the set of stabilizer states and plays a fundamental role from quantum state complexity to universal fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, analytical or even numerical characterizations of magic are very challenging, especially in the multi-qubit system, even with a moderate qubit number. Here we systemically and analytically investigate the magic resource of archetypal multipartite quantum states -- quantum hypergraph states, which can be generated by multi-qubit Controlled-phase gates encoded by hypergraphs. We first give the magic formula in terms of the stabilizer R$\mathrm{\acute{e}}$nyi-$\alpha$ entropies for general quantum hypergraph states and prove the magic can not reach the maximal value, if the average degree of the corresponding hypergraph is constant. Then we investigate the statistical behaviors of random hypergraph states and prove the concentration result that typically random hypergraph states can reach the maximal magic. This also suggests an efficient way to generate maximal magic states with random diagonal circuits. Finally, we study some highly symmetric hypergraph states with permutation-symmetry, such as the one whose associated hypergraph is $3$-complete, i.e., any three vertices are connected by a hyperedge. Counterintuitively, such states can only possess constant or even exponentially small magic for $\alpha\geq 2$. Our study advances the understanding of multipartite quantum magic and could lead to applications in quantum computing and quantum many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Sum rule for the pseudo-R\'enyi entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By generalizing the density matrix to a transition matrix between two states, represented as $|\phi\rangle$ and $|\psi\rangle$, one can define the pseudoentropy analogous to the entanglement entropy. In this paper, we establish an operator sum rule that pertains to the reduced transition matrix and reduced density matrices corresponding to the superposition states of $|\phi\rangle$ and $|\psi\rangle$. It is demonstrated that the off-diagonal elements of operators can be correlated with the expectation value in the superposition state. Furthermore, we illustrate the connection between the pseudo-R\'enyi entropy and the R\'enyi entropy of the superposition states. We provide proof of the operator sum rule and verify its validity in both finite-dimensional systems and quantum field theory. We additionally demonstrate the significance of these sum rules in gaining insights into the physical implications of transition matrices, pseudoentropy, and their gravity dual.</description>

      <title>Toward a classification of PT-symmetric quantum systems: From dissipative dynamics to topology and wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studies of many-body non-Hermitian parity-time (PT)-symmetric quantum systems are attracting a lot of interest due to their relevance in research areas ranging from quantum optics and continuously monitored dynamics to Euclidean wormholes in quantum gravity and dissipative quantum chaos. While a symmetry classification of non-Hermitian systems leads to 38 universality classes, we show that, under certain conditions, PT-symmetric systems are grouped into 24 universality classes. We identify 14 of them in a coupled two-site Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and confirm the classification by spectral analysis using exact diagonalization techniques. Intriguingly, in 4 of these 14 universality classes, AIII$_\nu$, BDI$^\dagger_\nu$, BDI$_{++\nu}$, and CI$_{--\nu}$, we identify a basis in which the SYK Hamiltonian has a block structure in which some blocks are rectangular, with $\nu \in \mathbb{N}$ the difference between the number of rows and columns. We show analytically that this feature leads to the existence of $\nu$ robust purely \emph{real} eigenvalues, whose level statistics follow the predictions of Hermitian random matrix theory for classes A, AI, BDI, and CI, respectively. We have recently found that this $\nu$ is a topological invariant, so these classes are topological. By contrast, nontopological real eigenvalues display a crossover between Hermitian and non-Hermitian level statistics. Similarly to the case of Lindbladian dynamics, the reduction of universality classes leads to unexpected results, such as the absence of Kramers degeneracy in a given sector of the theory. Another novel feature of the classification scheme is that different sectors of the PT-symmetric Hamiltonian may have different symmetries.</description>

      <title>Irreversibility of stochastic state transitions in Langevin systems with odd elasticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active microscopic objects, e.g., an enzyme molecule, are modeled by the Langevin system with the odd elasticity, in which energy injection from the substrate to the enzyme is described by the antisymmetric part of the elastic matrix. By applying the Onsager--Machlup integral and large deviation theory to the Langevin system with odd elasticity, we can calculate the cumulant generating function of the irreversibility of the state transition. For an $N$-component system, we obtain a formal expression of the cumulant generating function and demonstrate that the oddness $\lambda$, which quantifies the antisymmetric part of the elastic matrix, leads to higher-order cumulants that do not appear in a passive elastic system. To demonstrate the effect of the oddness under the concrete parameter, we analyze the simplest two-component system and obtain the optimal transition path and cumulant generating function. The cumulants obtained from expansion of the cumulant generating function increase monotonically with the oddness. This implies that the oddness causes the uncertainty of stochastic state transitions.</description>

      <title>Waiting time statistics for a double quantum dot coupled with an optical cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A double quantum dot coupled to an optical cavity is a prototypical example of a non-trivial open quantum system. Recent experimental and theoretical studies show that this system is a candidate for single-photon detection in the microwave domain. This motivates studies that go beyond just the average current, and also take into account the full counting statistics of photon and electron detections. With this in mind, here we provide a detailed analysis of the waiting time statistics of this system within the quantum jump unravelling, which allows us to extract analytical expressions for the success and failure probabilities, as well as for the inter detection times. Furthermore, by comparing single and multi-photon scenarios, we infer a hierarchy of occurrence probabilities for the different events, highlighting the role of photon interference events in the detection probabilities. Our results therefore provide a direct illustration of how waiting time statistics can be used to optimize a timely and relevant metrological task.</description>

      <title>Entropic signature of resonant thermal transport: Ordered form of heat conduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal transport in crystals is influenced by chemistry, boundaries, and nanostructure. The phonon band structure extracted from molecular-dynamics simulations provides an illuminating view of both the type and extent of prevalence of wavelike mechanisms underlying the transport, yet falls short of elucidating the nature of thermal evolution for different phonon regimes. Here we present an analysis framework for the characterization of the entropic signature of the mechanisms induced by the existence of boundaries and nanostructure, using both equilibrium and nonequilibrium atomistic simulations. Specifically, we examine the effects of phonon confinement, Bragg scattering, and local resonances on the configurational phase space in room-temperature nanostructured silicon, and quantify how each modifies the rate of entropy production and thermal relaxation. We reveal that the presence of phonon local resonances spanning the full spectrum enables a highly ordered regime of heat conduction, where irreversible evolution and entropy maximization are severely hindered by extensive mode hybridizations caused by the resonances. This unique regime of transport paves the way for ultra-precise phonon control for a wide range of applications in condensed matter physics.</description>
