      <title>Habitable from the start: How initial planetary formation conditions may create habitable worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The breadth of topics that encompass the search for life has expanded and evolved significantly since the emergence of the field of astrobiology. Initial astrobiology centered investigations focused on detecting biosignatures in the Martian soil with the Viking lander. The field now encompasses identification of biosignatures throughout the galaxy and habitable worlds, planets with sufficient liquid water and prebiotic chemistry to support life. This evolution mirrors the improvement in our understanding of environments that may harbor life. The bulk planetary chemistry governs the habitability of a planet, which is in turn set by the early solar system environment and planet formation processes. Therefore, investigations of solar and exoplanetary systems as a whole would provide insights into the factors that make a planet habitable. Bulk planetary chemistry govern planetary atmospheres, core sizes, magnetic fields, heat engines, volatile inventories, and silicate mantle compositions. We therefore advocate for investigations of formation conditions that establish planetary chemistry, and by extension, habitability.</description>

      <title>Validation of optical pathlength stability in a LISA test-bench demonstrator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) observatory is a future L3 mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) to detect gravitational waves, set to launch in 2035. The detector constellation will conduct interferometry to picometer stability over an unprecedented arm length of 2.5 million km. In this paper, we present the development and testing results for the Zerodur interferometer (ZIFO), an optical demonstrator built to validate critical technology for the test setup of the interferometric core of LISA. Optical path length stability measurements on the ZIFO demonstrate successful reduction of bench noise to maintain the 10 pm/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ specification across the 1 mHz to 1 Hz frequency band. We also identify and characterize dominant noise sources from phasemeters and correlations of beam tilt into the path length that were observed during the test campaign.</description>

      <title>CLAWDIA: A dictionary learning framework for gravitational-wave data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep-learning methods are becoming increasingly important in gravitational-wave data analysis, yet their performance often relies on large training datasets and models whose internal representations are difficult to interpret. Sparse dictionary learning (SDL) offers a complementary approach: it performs well in scarce-data regimes and yields physically interpretable representations of gravitational-wave morphology. Here we present CLAWDIA (Comprehensive Library for the Analysis of Waves via Dictionary-based Algorithms), an open-source Python framework that integrates SDL-based denoising and classification under realistic detector noise. We systematise previously isolated SDL workflows into a unified, modular environment with a consistent, user-friendly interface. The current release provides several time-domain denoising strategies based on LASSO-regularised sparse coding and a classifier based on Low-Rank Shared Dictionary Learning. A companion toolbox, GWADAMA, supports dataset construction and realistic conditioning of real and simulated interferometer data. We demonstrate CLAWDIA's performance by denoising the signal from binary neutron star event GW170817 and by classifying families of instrumental glitches from LIGO's third observing run, highlighting robustness at low signal-to-noise ratios. CLAWDIA is intended as a community-driven, interoperable library extensible to additional tasks, including detection and parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Stellar Spectral Modelling with GSPICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral data reduction pipelines deal with a wide variety of challenges including masking cosmic rays, calibrating wavelength solutions, and estimating background noise while trying to remain model-agnostic. Traditional methods rely on hardware-specific code or pre-calculated stellar model templates to solve this problem, making them model-dependent and not suitable for large datasets that may contain new classes of objects. To solve this problem, we present a flexible, data-driven method: the GausSian PIxelwise Conditional Estimator (GSPICE) that models an ensemble of spectra as a multivariate Gaussian and estimates the expected value and expected variance of each pixel in each spectrum conditional on others. GSPICE compares observed fluxes and errors to its own flux and error estimates to reveal outliers, which then can be completely masked or replaced by their estimates. We apply GSPICE to 3.9 million stellar spectra from the LAMOST survey, and show that variations of the method can directly identify and correct both individual pixel-level outliers (e.g., from cosmic ray hits) as well as extended systematic features (e.g., from incorrect wavelength calibrations), while still providing a novel characterization of the true per-pixel measurement uncertainties. We also demonstrate how GSPICE can take advantage of data partitioning with an application to diffuse interstellar bands. Implementations of GSPICE in both Python and IDL can be found here http://github.com/dfink/gspice.</description>

      <title>Lord of the (sub-)Rings : Mapping the surface reflectance and spin-axis of Ajisai</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active debris removal techniques are posed to become an important tool in maintaining the safety of the near-Earth space environment. These techniques rely on a clear understanding of the rotational motion of the debris targets, which is challenging to constrain from unresolved imaging. The Ajisai satellite provides an ideal test case for developing and demonstrating these techniques due to its simple geometry and well constrained spin behaviour. We present four observations of the Ajisai satellite taken with SuperWASP in August of 2019, where high cadence photometry was extracted from streaked images as a part of a larger survey of Low Earth Orbit. We develop an MCMC-driven method to determine the spin-state of Ajisai by comparing the alignment between a map of modelled mirror positions and a novel derived map of surface reflectivity. We generally find good agreement within the expectation and uncertainties set by empirical models and our determined spin-state solutions align the surface reflectivity map and modelled mirror location well. Our results show that streak photometry can be used to recover the spin-axis and rotation period of fast-spinning objects such as Ajisai using modest ground-based instrumentation, making it readily scalable to a wider range of targets and observatories.</description>

      <title>GSpyNetTreeS: a machine learning solution for glitch localization in time and frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data from ground-based gravitational wave detectors are often contaminated by non-Gaussian instrumental artifacts or detector noise transients. Unbiased source property estimation relies on the ability to correctly identify and characterize these artifacts and remove them if necessary. To this end, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration has implemented candidate vetting for all significant candidates to identify the presence of artifacts and assess the need for mitigation. The current candidate vetting process requires human experts to identify the frequency ranges and the time windows associated with any data quality issues present. Differences in judgment between human experts may cause inconsistency, making results difficult to reproduce across gravitational wave events. We present GSpyNetTreeS, an extension to GSpyNetTree based on the You Only Look Once algorithm, for the automatic detection, classification, and time-frequency localization of detector noise transients. As a proof of concept, we tested GSpyNetTreeS's performance on the data collected by the LIGO detectors during the third observing run for gravitational waves as well as common detector glitch classes included in GSpyNetTree: Blip, Low frequency blip, Low frequency line and Scratchy. We also demonstrated that GSpyNetTreeS is capable of accurately identifying common glitch classes and capturing the frequency and time information associated with detected detector noise transients, establishing its potential as an automatic event validation tool for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's observing runs.</description>

      <title>Fast far-sidelobe modeling for centimeter to sub-millimeter astrophysical observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation centimeter to sub-millimeter telescopes require exquisite control over instrumental far-sidelobe response to accurately measure faint signals like the Cosmic Microwave Background B modes. Because existing electromagnetic modeling methods are computationally expensive, we developed a novel, diffraction-based beam modeling method for rapid and low-cost calculations. We applied this methodology to model the BICEP3 far-sidelobes and found good qualitative agreement with in situ beam measurements. Using this validated simulated beam, we calculated the sidelobe temperature pickup for a specific observation scenario: scanning near the slopes of Cerro Toco in the Atacama Desert. This rapid, predictive framework is most valuable as a tool for optimizing instrument baffling and identifying efficient scan strategies during the conceptual design phase.</description>

      <title>A novel double-rim forebaffle design for centimeter to sub-millimeter astrophysical observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stray radiation of various origin is a major source of degradation of centimeter to sub-millimeter astronomical observations. This is particularly problematic for the detection of signals such as faint cosmic microwave background polarization B modes, or for mapping large-scale extragalactic or Galactic diffuse emission. In this paper, we propose a double-rim forebaffle design to reduce the impact of such stray radiation contamination. Using qualitative arguments and numerical simulations, we show that such a design has the potential to substantially improve the quality of future observations.</description>

      <title>Morphological Image Similarity Search on the ALMA Science Archive Query Interface Using Deep Unsupervised Contrastive Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the exponential growth of astronomical data over time, finding the needles in the haystack is becoming increasingly difficult. The next frontier for science archives is to enable searches not only on observational metadata, but also on the content of the observations themselves. As a step in this direction, we have implemented morphological image similarity search into the ALMA Science Archive (ASA). To achieve this we use self-supervised contrastive affine-transformation-independent representation learning of source morphologies with a deep neural network. For a given image on the ASA web interface, astronomers are presented with a summary view of the morphologically most similar images. Each time an astronomer selects an additional image from that view, the display is instantly updated to show the images most similar to the combination of the selected images. Each selection thus refines the similarity display according to the scientific needs of the astronomer. This is the first time image similarity search has been offered in an astronomical science archive.</description>

      <title>From Ground to Space: An Overview of the JEM-EUSO Program for the Study of UHECRs and Astrophysical Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The JEM-EUSO (Joint Exploratory Missions for Extreme Universe Space Observatory) collaboration is an international initiative studying ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and related phenomena. These particles, with energies exceeding 10$^{20}$~eV, provide insights into extreme astrophysical processes but remain challenging to detect due to their low flux. At the heart of JEM-EUSO's technology is an ultra-fast, highly sensitive UV camera capable of detecting EASs in the atmosphere with exceptional spatial and temporal resolution. A dedicated Cherenkov camera has been developed to evaluate the viability of the Earth-skimming technique from high altitudes. Fluorescence and Cherenkov detectors can be used together to create a hybrid detection surface. This innovative approach enables detailed studies of fluorescence and Cherenkov light from cosmic ray and neutrino interactions. The JEM-EUSO technology will allow for observations from space to significantly increase the exposure to these rare phenomena. The collaboration employs a multi-platform strategy with ground-based experiments like EUSO-TA calibrating detection systems and validating models, and balloon-borne missions such as EUSO-Balloon and EUSO-SPB1/SPB2 demonstrating observations from the stratosphere and testing technologies. Space-based missions, particularly Mini-EUSO on the ISS, have provided valuable data on UV backgrounds, TLEs, and meteoroids, as well as demonstrating the potential for future space-based detection. While we are developing a cross-platform methodology, we are ultimately moving towards space-based measurements. Future efforts include the POEMMA space mission, designed for stereoscopic observations of UHECRs and multi-messenger phenomena, the PBR experiment, which integrates radio detection and is scheduled to fly in 2027, and the M-EUSO satellite mission, proposed to ESA.</description>

      <title>Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO): Options for robust Deep Spectral Line Imaging in the SKA-Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The data storage requirements for deep spectral line observations with next-generation radio interferometers like the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) are extremely challenging. The default strategy is to reduce data after each daily observation and stack the resulting images. Although this approach is computationally efficient, it risks propagating systematic errors and significantly degrades the final data quality. However, storage and computation requirements for a traditional way to image the entire deep dataset together are prohibitively expensive. We present an alternative \textit{uv}-grid stacking method and compare its scientific outcomes with both the traditional approach, which processes all data jointly and serves as the best-possible result, and the default image-stacking method. Our technique involves halting the standard imaging pipeline after the daily residual visibility grids are formed. These grids are then stacked and jointly deconvolved to combine many epochs of data. Using the traditional approach as a benchmark, we show that image-stacking recovers only 92\% of the true {\HI} flux. In contrast, our \textit{uv}-grid stacking method recovers 99\%, which is in excellent agreement with the traditional method within the noise limits. Furthermore, image-stacking introduces significant non-physical artefacts, such as negative bowls around strong sources, indicating poor deconvolution and a loss of physical information. Based on these findings, we intend to apply the \textit{uv}-grid stacking to the Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO) survey on ASKAP and strongly recommend this or a similar approach for future radio astronomy facilities.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the CLEAN algorithm of radio interferometry with convex optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In radio-interferometry, we recover an image from an incompletely sampled Fourier data. The de-facto standard algorithm, the Cotton-Schwab CLEAN, is iteratively switching between computing a deconvolution (minor loop) and subtracting the model from the visibilities (major loop). The next generation of radio interferometers is expected to deal with much higher data rates, image sizes and sensitivity, making an acceleration of current data processing algorithms necessary. We aim to achieve this by evaluating the potential of various well-known acceleration techniques in convex optimization to the major loop. For the present manuscript, we limit the scope to study these techniques only in the CLEAN framework. To this end, we identify CLEAN with a Newton scheme, and use this chain of arguments backwards to express Nesterov acceleration and conjugate gradient orthogonalization in the major and minor loop framework. The resulting algorithms are simple extensions of the traditional framework, but converge multiple times faster than traditional techniques, and reduce the residual significantly deeper. These improvements achieved by accelerating the major loop are competitive to well-known improvements by replacing the minor loop with more advanced algorithms, but at lower numerical cost. The best performance is achieved by combining these two developments.CLEAN remains among the fastest and most robust algorithms for imaging in radio interferometry, and can be easily extended to an almost an order of magnitude faster convergence speed and dynamic range. The procedure outlined in this manuscript is relatively straightforward and could be easily extended.</description>

      <title>Performance Simulations for Kola: Achieving High-Resolution, Visible-Light AO Correction Over a 1 Arcminute Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present performance simulations for a proposed visible-light, multi-conjugate adaptive optics system for the 10-meter W. M. Keck I telescope that aims to deliver near diffraction-limited angular resolution at optical wavelengths. Our proposed architecture, the Keck Optical Laser Guide Star Adaptive Optics System (KOLA), combines multiple laser guide stars (LGS) and deformable mirrors to enable wide-field correction across a 60 arcsecond field of view. Simulations were conducted using the open-source Multi-Threaded Adaptive Optics Simulator (MAOS), which we validated against on-sky data for the current Keck I adaptive optics system. We evaluated KOLA performance across a range of design parameters and report key point spread function metrics, including Strehl ratio, full width at half maximum, and encircled energy radius. Example science-driven requirements include resolving black hole spheres of influence, probing crowded stellar fields, and imaging protoplanetary disks. Trade studies on actuator count and laser guide star configuration help inform future design decisions. We present a nominal KOLA design (10 LGS, 3 tip-tilt natural guide stars (TTNGS), and 3600 actuators on the adaptive secondary mirror). Performance simulations show a 15 mas angular resolution with a Strehl ratio of 34% at 652 nm on-axis. More work is needed to explore alternative LGS/TTNGS asterisms, optimize conjugation heights for high-altitude deformable mirrors, and test performance under poorer seeing conditions.</description>

Abstract: We present ViSta, a Visibility Stacking method to combine interferometric observations in the Fourier domain at radio to sub-millimeter wavelengths for galaxies. The goal of our method is to maximize the exploitation of available archival interferometric data. By stacking visibilities of galaxies with secure spectroscopic redshifts directly in the Fourier domain and transforming them into the rest-frame, we can enhance the stacked signal, suppress noise, and improve image reconstruction thanks to an extended coverage of the visibility domain. The ViSta method is highly flexible, allowing stacking of visibilities regardless of the array configuration or spectral setup. It is effective for both targeted sources and spurious detections offset from the phase center, whether unresolved or extended, within the field of view of the telescope. We validated the method using simulated interferometric datasets. For point-like sources, we can reconstruct the true emission with approximately 90% accuracy, obtaining similar results to classical image-plane stacking. In contrast, for faint and extended sources below the noise level, our method can provide a more accurate estimate of the signal compared to traditional image-based approaches. Finally, we applied ViSta to a sample of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) to detect the CO(3-2) emission line. As for the simulated case, we demonstrated that our tool performs better than image-plane stacking when the signal from individual sources is no longer easily detectable, achieving higher SNR. Finally, we outline potential future applications of this stacking approach.</description>

      <title>An Investigation of Systematic Effects from Background Priors on PSR J0740$+$6620 Radius Estimates using Synthetic NICER and XMM-Newton Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16759</link>

Abstract: Accurate and precise measurements of neutron star radii provide invaluable information about the cold, dense matter in neutron star cores. Analyses of synthetic X-ray pulse waveform data similar to the data obtained from non-accreting neutron stars using the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) have indicated that mass and radius estimates made using such data are robust against some systematic errors that may be made when modeling these data, such as errors in the assumed pattern of the thermal X-ray emission from the surface of these stars. A potentially important but so far unexplored source of systematic error is misparameterization of unmodulated background components, which can bias the inferred radius, particularly when data from different telescopes are used in the analysis. In this study, we investigate the effects of the background model on radius estimates by jointly analyzing synthetic NICER and XMM-Newton data, using the $\sim 2.1~M_\odot$ pulsar PSR~J0740$+$6620 as a prototypical example. Our analysis shows that even if the background assumed in the model underestimates the actual background by a factor of more than five, the resulting shift of the radius posterior from the true value of the radius corresponds to only $\sim1\sigma$. In all the cases we examined, the Bayesian evidence for the correct background model is greater than for the incorrect background model. These results add to the evidence that analyses of NICER-like data provide accurate measurements of neutron star radii when the statistical sampling is thorough and the model fits the data well.</description>

      <title>Distributed Acoustic Fiber Sensing for Research Campuses and Large Scientific Infrastructures -- The Hamburg WAVE proto-network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we demonstrate and investigate how Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) can be utilized on research campuses and in large scientific infrastructures to study environmental vibrations and reduce their impact on high-precision experiments. We first discuss the potential of DAS in the context of particle accelerators, gravitational wave detection experiments and research campuses. Next, we present the results of our seismic measurement campaign conducted with our proto-network, which involved the probing of over 12 km of fiber, in May 2021. This campaign was conducted by the Hamburg WAVE initiative in Science City Hamburg Bahrenfeld and included DESY, the European XFEL, PETRA III and the University of Hamburg. Our proto-network confirms the ability to observe natural, anthropogenic, and infrastructural vibrations and how and where these couple into different parts of the heterogeneously set up fiber network. We also present results on a study of noise and motion coupling aspects of DAS probing double-redundant fiber loops in a unique environment, the European XFEL. Our results show that DAS greatly benefits research campuses and large scientific infrastructures and they highlight the opportunities and challenges of implementing and operating such seismic networks.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Analysis of Ions Accelerated at Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the application of deep learning techniques to the analysis and classification of ions accelerated at collisionless shocks in hybrid (kinetic ions--fluid electrons) simulations. Ions were classified as thermal, suprathermal, or nonthermal, depending on the energy they achieved and the acceleration regime they fell under. These classifications were used to train deep learning models to predict which particles are injected into the acceleration process with high accuracy (&gt;90%), using only time series of the local magnetic field they experienced during their initial interaction with the shock. An autoencoder architecture was also tested, for which time series of various parameters were reconstructed from encoded representations. This study shows the potential of applying machine learning techniques to extract physical insights from kinetic plasma simulations and sets the groundwork for future applications, including the construction of sub-grid models in fluid approaches.</description>

      <title>Direct High-Resolution Imaging of Earth-Like Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have surveyed all conventional methods proposed or conceivable for obtaining resolved images of an Earth-like exoplanet. Generating a 10 x 10 pixel map of a 1 R_E world at 10 pc demands ~0.85 uas angular resolution and photon-collection sufficient for SNR &gt;= 5 per micro-pixel. We derived diffraction-limit and photon-budget requirements for: (1) large single-aperture space telescopes with internal coronagraphs; (2) external starshades; (3) space-based interferometry (nulling and non-nulling); (4) ground-based ELTs with extreme AO; (5) pupil-densified "hypertelescopes"; (6) indirect reconstructions (rotational light-curve inversion, eclipse mapping, intensity interferometry); (7) diffraction occultation by Solar System bodies. Even though these approaches serve their primary goals -- exoplanet discovery and initial coarse characterization -- each remains orders of magnitude away from delivering a spatially resolved image. In every case, technology readiness falls short, and fundamental barriers leave them 2-5 orders of magnitude below the angular-resolution and photon-budget thresholds to map an Earth analog even on decadal timescales. Ultimately, an in-situ platform delivered to &lt;= 0.1 AU of the target could, in principle, overcome both diffraction and photon-starvation limits -- but such a mission far exceeds current propulsion, autonomy, and communications capabilities. By contrast, the Solar Gravitational Lens -- providing on-axis gain of ~1e10 and inherent uas-scale focusing once an imaging spacecraft reaches heliocentric distances beyond &gt;= 550 AU -- is uniquely capable of simultaneously meeting both the resolution and photon-budget requirements. Once mission-specific risks (coronal calibration, focal-plane scanning, deconvolution) are retired, the SGL enables true, resolved surface images and spatially resolved spectroscopy of Earth-like exoplanets in our stellar neighborhood.</description>
