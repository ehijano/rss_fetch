      <title>Transformation of audio embeddings into interpretable, concept-based representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in audio neural networks have established state-of-the-art results on downstream audio tasks. However, the black-box structure of these models makes it difficult to interpret the information encoded in their internal audio representations. In this work, we explore the semantic interpretability of audio embeddings extracted from these neural networks by leveraging CLAP, a contrastive learning model that brings audio and text into a shared embedding space. We implement a post-hoc method to transform CLAP embeddings into concept-based, sparse representations with semantic interpretability. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that the concept-based representations outperform or match the performance of original audio embeddings on downstream tasks while providing interpretability. Additionally, we demonstrate that fine-tuning the concept-based representations can further improve their performance on downstream tasks. Lastly, we publish three audio-specific vocabularies for concept-based interpretability of audio embeddings.</description>

      <title>DiffVox: A Differentiable Model for Capturing and Analysing Professional Effects Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel and interpretable model, DiffVox, for matching vocal effects in music production. DiffVox, short for ``Differentiable Vocal Fx", integrates parametric equalisation, dynamic range control, delay, and reverb with efficient differentiable implementations to enable gradient-based optimisation for parameter estimation. Vocal presets are retrieved from two datasets, comprising 70 tracks from MedleyDB and 365 tracks from a private collection. Analysis of parameter correlations highlights strong relationships between effects and parameters, such as the high-pass and low-shelf filters often behaving together to shape the low end, and the delay time correlates with the intensity of the delayed signals. Principal component analysis reveals connections to McAdams' timbre dimensions, where the most crucial component modulates the perceived spaciousness while the secondary components influence spectral brightness. Statistical testing confirms the non-Gaussian nature of the parameter distribution, highlighting the complexity of the vocal effects space. These initial findings on the parameter distributions set the foundation for future research in vocal effects modelling and automatic mixing. Our source code and datasets are accessible at https://github.com/SonyResearch/diffvox.</description>

      <title>Aria-MIDI: A Dataset of Piano MIDI Files for Symbolic Music Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an extensive new dataset of MIDI files, created by transcribing audio recordings of piano performances into their constituent notes. The data pipeline we use is multi-stage, employing a language model to autonomously crawl and score audio recordings from the internet based on their metadata, followed by a stage of pruning and segmentation using an audio classifier. The resulting dataset contains over one million distinct MIDI files, comprising roughly 100,000 hours of transcribed audio. We provide an in-depth analysis of our techniques, offering statistical insights, and investigate the content by extracting metadata tags, which we also provide. Dataset available at https://github.com/loubbrad/aria-midi.</description>

      <title>DRAGON: Distributional Rewards Optimize Diffusion Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Distributional RewArds for Generative OptimizatioN (DRAGON), a versatile framework for fine-tuning media generation models towards a desired outcome. Compared with traditional reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) or pairwise preference approaches such as direct preference optimization (DPO), DRAGON is more flexible. It can optimize reward functions that evaluate either individual examples or distributions of them, making it compatible with a broad spectrum of instance-wise, instance-to-distribution, and distribution-to-distribution rewards. Leveraging this versatility, we construct novel reward functions by selecting an encoder and a set of reference examples to create an exemplar distribution. When cross-modality encoders such as CLAP are used, the reference examples may be of a different modality (e.g., text versus audio). Then, DRAGON gathers online and on-policy generations, scores them to construct a positive demonstration set and a negative set, and leverages the contrast between the two sets to maximize the reward. For evaluation, we fine-tune an audio-domain text-to-music diffusion model with 20 different reward functions, including a custom music aesthetics model, CLAP score, Vendi diversity, and Frechet audio distance (FAD). We further compare instance-wise (per-song) and full-dataset FAD settings while ablating multiple FAD encoders and reference sets. Over all 20 target rewards, DRAGON achieves an 81.45% average win rate. Moreover, reward functions based on exemplar sets indeed enhance generations and are comparable to model-based rewards. With an appropriate exemplar set, DRAGON achieves a 60.95% human-voted music quality win rate without training on human preference annotations. As such, DRAGON exhibits a new approach to designing and optimizing reward functions for improving human-perceived quality. Sound examples at https://ml-dragon.github.io/web.</description>

      <title>Mixer Metaphors: audio interfaces for non-musical applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The NIME conference traditionally focuses on interfaces for music and musical expression. In this paper we reverse this tradition to ask, can interfaces developed for music be successfully appropriated to non-musical applications? To help answer this question we designed and developed a new device, which uses interface metaphors borrowed from analogue synthesisers and audio mixing to physically control the intangible aspects of a Large Language Model. We compared two versions of the device, with and without the audio-inspired augmentations, with a group of artists who used each version over a one week period. Our results show that the use of audio-like controls afforded more immediate, direct and embodied control over the LLM, allowing users to creatively experiment and play with the device over its non-mixer counterpart. Our project demonstrates how cross-sensory metaphors can support creative thinking and embodied practice when designing new technological interfaces.</description>

      <title>Apollo: An Interactive Environment for Generating Symbolic Musical Phrases using Corpus-based Style Imitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the recent developments in machine intelligence and web technologies, new generative music systems are being explored for assisted composition using machine learning techniques on the web. Such systems are built for various tasks such as melodic, harmonic or rhythm generation, music interpolation, continuation and style imitation. In this paper, we introduce Apollo, an interactive music application for generating symbolic phrases of conventional western music using corpus-based style imitation techniques. In addition to enabling the construction and management of symbolic musical corpora, the system makes it possible for music artists and researchers to generate new musical phrases in the style of the proposed corpus. The system is available as a desktop application. The generated symbolic music materials, encoded in the MIDI format, can be exported or streamed for various purposes including using them as seed material for musical projects. We present the system design, implementation details, discuss and conclude with future work for the system.</description>

      <title>Calliope: An Online Generative Music System for Symbolic Multi-Track Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise of artificial intelligence in recent years, there has been a rapid increase in its application towards creative domains, including music. There exist many systems built that apply machine learning approaches to the problem of computer-assisted music composition (CAC). Calliope is a web application that assists users in performing a variety of multi-track composition tasks in the symbolic domain. The user can upload (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) MIDI files, visualize and edit MIDI tracks, and generate partial (via bar in-filling) or complete multi-track content using the Multi-Track Music Machine (MMM). Generation of new MIDI excerpts can be done in batch and can be combined with active playback listening for an enhanced assisted-composition workflow. The user can export generated MIDI materials or directly stream MIDI playback from the system to their favorite Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). We present a demonstration of the system, its features, generative parameters and describe the co-creative workflows that it affords.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Human-AI Interaction via Usability, User Experience and Acceptance Measures for MMM-C: A Creative AI System for Music Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), there has been increasing interest in human-AI co-creation in a variety of artistic domains including music as AI-driven systems are frequently able to generate human-competitive artifacts. Now, the implications of such systems for musical practice are being investigated. We report on a thorough evaluation of the user adoption of the Multi-Track Music Machine (MMM) as a co-creative AI tool for music composers. To do this, we integrate MMM into Cubase, a popular Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) by Steinberg, by producing a "1-parameter" plugin interface named MMM-Cubase (MMM-C), which enables human-AI co-composition. We contribute a methodological assemblage as a 3-part mixed method study measuring usability, user experience and technology acceptance of the system across two groups of expert-level composers: hobbyists and professionals. Results show positive usability and acceptance scores. Users report experiences of novelty, surprise and ease of use from using the system, and limitations on controllability and predictability of the interface when generating music. Findings indicate no significant difference between the two user groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report details MERL's system for room impulse response (RIR) estimation submitted to the Generative Data Augmentation Workshop at ICASSP 2025 for Augmenting RIR Data (Task 1) and Improving Speaker Distance Estimation (Task 2). We first pre-train a neural acoustic field conditioned by room geometry on an external large-scale dataset in which pairs of RIRs and the geometries are provided. The neural acoustic field is then adapted to each target room by using the enrollment data, where we leverage either the provided room geometries or geometries retrieved from the external dataset, depending on availability. Lastly, we predict the RIRs for each pair of source and receiver locations specified by Task 1, and use these RIRs to train the speaker distance estimation model in Task 2.</description>

      <title>DialogueAgents: A Hybrid Agent-Based Speech Synthesis Framework for Multi-Party Dialogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech synthesis is crucial for human-computer interaction, enabling natural and intuitive communication. However, existing datasets involve high construction costs due to manual annotation and suffer from limited character diversity, contextual scenarios, and emotional expressiveness. To address these issues, we propose DialogueAgents, a novel hybrid agent-based speech synthesis framework, which integrates three specialized agents -- a script writer, a speech synthesizer, and a dialogue critic -- to collaboratively generate dialogues. Grounded in a diverse character pool, the framework iteratively refines dialogue scripts and synthesizes speech based on speech review, boosting emotional expressiveness and paralinguistic features of the synthesized dialogues. Using DialogueAgent, we contribute MultiTalk, a bilingual, multi-party, multi-turn speech dialogue dataset covering diverse topics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and the high quality of the MultiTalk dataset. We release the dataset and code https://github.com/uirlx/DialogueAgents to facilitate future research on advanced speech synthesis models and customized data generation.</description>

      <title>Protecting Your Voice: Temporal-aware Robust Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has led to the synthesis of real-fake ambiguous voices. To erase the ambiguity, embedding watermarks into the frequency-domain features of synthesized voices has become a common routine. However, the robustness achieved by choosing the frequency domain often comes at the expense of fine-grained voice features, leading to a loss of fidelity. Maximizing the comprehensive learning of time-domain features to enhance fidelity while maintaining robustness, we pioneer a \textbf{\underline{t}}emporal-aware \textbf{\underline{r}}ob\textbf{\underline{u}}st wat\textbf{\underline{e}}rmarking (\emph{True}) method for protecting the speech and singing voice.</description>

      <title>OmniAudio: Generating Spatial Audio from 360-Degree Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional video-to-audio generation techniques primarily focus on field-of-view (FoV) video and non-spatial audio, often missing the spatial cues necessary for accurately representing sound sources in 3D environments. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel task, 360V2SA, to generate spatial audio from 360-degree videos, specifically producing First-order Ambisonics (FOA) audio - a standard format for representing 3D spatial audio that captures sound directionality and enables realistic 3D audio reproduction. We first create Sphere360, a novel dataset tailored for this task that is curated from real-world data. We also design an efficient semi-automated pipeline for collecting and cleaning paired video-audio data. To generate spatial audio from 360-degree video, we propose a novel framework OmniAudio, which leverages self-supervised pre-training using both spatial audio data (in FOA format) and large-scale non-spatial data. Furthermore, OmniAudio features a dual-branch framework that utilizes both panoramic and FoV video inputs to capture comprehensive local and global information from 360-degree videos. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance across both objective and subjective metrics on Sphere360. Code and datasets will be released at https://github.com/liuhuadai/OmniAudio. The demo page is available at https://OmniAudio-360V2SA.github.io.</description>

      <title>SOLIDO: A Robust Watermarking Method for Speech Synthesis via Low-Rank Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accelerated advancement of speech generative models has given rise to security issues, including model infringement and unauthorized abuse of content. Although existing generative watermarking techniques have proposed corresponding solutions, most methods require substantial computational overhead and training costs. In addition, some methods have limitations in robustness when handling variable-length inputs. To tackle these challenges, we propose \textsc{SOLIDO}, a novel generative watermarking method that integrates parameter-efficient fine-tuning with speech watermarking through low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for speech diffusion models. Concretely, the watermark encoder converts the watermark to align with the input of diffusion models. To achieve precise watermark extraction from variable-length inputs, the watermark decoder based on depthwise separable convolution is designed for watermark recovery. To further enhance speech generation performance and watermark extraction capability, we propose a speech-driven lightweight fine-tuning strategy, which reduces computational overhead through LoRA. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method ensures high-fidelity watermarked speech even at a large capacity of 2000 bps. Furthermore, against common individual and compound speech attacks, our SOLIDO achieves a maximum average extraction accuracy of 99.20\% and 98.43\%, respectively. It surpasses other state-of-the-art methods by nearly 23\% in resisting time-stretching attacks.</description>

      <title>Improving Sound Source Localization with Joint Slot Attention on Image and Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sound source localization (SSL) is the task of locating the source of sound within an image. Due to the lack of localization labels, the de facto standard in SSL has been to represent an image and audio as a single embedding vector each, and use them to learn SSL via contrastive learning. To this end, previous work samples one of local image features as the image embedding and aggregates all local audio features to obtain the audio embedding, which is far from optimal due to the presence of noise and background irrelevant to the actual target in the input. We present a novel SSL method that addresses this chronic issue by joint slot attention on image and audio. To be specific, two slots competitively attend image and audio features to decompose them into target and off-target representations, and only target representations of image and audio are used for contrastive learning. Also, we introduce cross-modal attention matching to further align local features of image and audio. Our method achieved the best in almost all settings on three public benchmarks for SSL, and substantially outperformed all the prior work in cross-modal retrieval.</description>

      <title>Histogram-based Parameter-efficient Tuning for Passive Sonar Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) methods adapt large artificial neural networks to downstream tasks without fine-tuning the entire model. However, existing additive methods, such as adapters, sometimes struggle to capture distributional shifts in intermediate feature embeddings. We propose a novel histogram-based parameter-efficient tuning (HPT) technique that captures the statistics of the target domain and modulates the embeddings. Experimental results on three downstream passive sonar datasets (ShipsEar, DeepShip, VTUAD) demonstrate that HPT outperforms conventional adapters. Notably, HPT achieves 91.8% vs. 89.8% accuracy on VTUAD. Furthermore, HPT trains faster and yields feature representations closer to those of fully fine-tuned models. Overall, HPT balances parameter savings and performance, providing a distribution-aware alternative to existing adapters and shows a promising direction for scalable transfer learning in resource-constrained environments. The code is publicly available: https://github.com/Advanced-Vision-and-Learning-Lab/HLAST_DeepShip_ParameterEfficient.</description>

      <title>A Holistic Evaluation of Piano Sound Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04722v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to develop a holistic evaluation method for piano sound quality to assist in purchasing decisions. Unlike previous studies that focused on the effect of piano performance techniques on sound quality, this study evaluates the inherent sound quality of different pianos. To derive quality evaluation systems, the study uses subjective questionnaires based on a piano sound quality dataset. The method selects the optimal piano classification models by comparing the fine-tuning results of different pre-training models of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). To improve the interpretability of the models, the study applies Equivalent Rectangular Bandwidth (ERB) analysis. The results reveal that musically trained individuals are better able to distinguish between the sound quality differences of different pianos. The best fine-tuned CNN pre-trained backbone achieves a high accuracy of 98.3% as the piano classifier. However, the dataset is limited, and the audio is sliced to increase its quantity, resulting in a lack of diversity and balance, so we use focal loss to reduce the impact of data imbalance. To optimize the method, the dataset will be expanded, or few-shot learning techniques will be employed in future research.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Audio-Language Models through Self-Supervised Post-Training with Text-Audio Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research on multi-modal contrastive learning strategies for audio and text has rapidly gained interest. Contrastively trained Audio-Language Models (ALMs), such as CLAP, which establish a unified representation across audio and language modalities, have enhanced the efficacy in various subsequent tasks by providing good text aligned audio encoders and vice versa. These improvements are evident in areas like zero-shot audio classification and audio retrieval, among others. However, the ability of these models to understand natural language and temporal relations is still a largely unexplored and open field for research. In this paper, we propose to equip the multi-modal ALMs with temporal understanding without loosing their inherent prior capabilities of audio-language tasks with a temporal instillation method TeminAL. We implement a two-stage training scheme TeminAL A $\&amp;$ B, where the model first learns to differentiate between multiple sounds in TeminAL A, followed by a phase that instills a sense of time, thereby enhancing its temporal understanding in TeminAL B. This approach results in an average performance gain of $5.28\%$ in temporal understanding on the ESC-50 dataset, while the model remains competitive in zero-shot retrieval and classification tasks on the AudioCap/Clotho datasets. We also note the lack of proper evaluation techniques for contrastive ALMs and propose a strategy for evaluating ALMs in zero-shot settings. The general-purpose zero-shot model evaluation strategy ZSTE, is used to evaluate various prior models. ZSTE demonstrates a general strategy to evaluate all ZS contrastive models. The model trained with TeminAL successfully outperforms current models on most downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>MoWE-Audio: Multitask AudioLLMs with Mixture of Weak Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06635v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced natural language processing capabilities, facilitating the development of AudioLLMs that process and understand speech and audio inputs alongside text. Existing AudioLLMs typically combine a pre-trained audio encoder with a pre-trained LLM, which are subsequently finetuned on specific audio tasks. However, the pre-trained audio encoder has constrained capacity to capture features for new tasks and datasets. To address this, we propose to incorporate mixtures of `weak' encoders (MoWE) into the AudioLLM framework. MoWE supplements a base encoder with a pool of relatively light weight encoders, selectively activated based on the audio input to enhance feature extraction without significantly increasing model size. Our empirical results demonstrate that MoWE effectively improves multi-task performance, broadening the applicability of AudioLLMs to more diverse audio tasks.</description>

      <title>TechSinger: Technique Controllable Multilingual Singing Voice Synthesis via Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Singing voice synthesis has made remarkable progress in generating natural and high-quality voices. However, existing methods rarely provide precise control over vocal techniques such as intensity, mixed voice, falsetto, bubble, and breathy tones, thus limiting the expressive potential of synthetic voices. We introduce TechSinger, an advanced system for controllable singing voice synthesis that supports five languages and seven vocal techniques. TechSinger leverages a flow-matching-based generative model to produce singing voices with enhanced expressive control over various techniques. To enhance the diversity of training data, we develop a technique detection model that automatically annotates datasets with phoneme-level technique labels. Additionally, our prompt-based technique prediction model enables users to specify desired vocal attributes through natural language, offering fine-grained control over the synthesized singing. Experimental results demonstrate that TechSinger significantly enhances the expressiveness and realism of synthetic singing voices, outperforming existing methods in terms of audio quality and technique-specific control.
