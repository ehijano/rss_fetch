      <title>Improving Undergraduate Astronomy Students' Skills with Research Literature via Accessible Summaries: An Exploratory Case Study with Astrobites-based Reading Assignments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05822v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Undergraduate physics and astronomy students are expected to engage with scientific literature as they begin their research careers, but reading comprehension skills are rarely explicitly taught in major courses. We seek to determine the efficacy of a reading assignment designed to improve undergraduate astronomy (or related) majors' perceived ability to engage with research literature by using accessible summaries of current research written by experts in the field. During the 2022-2023 academic year, faculty members from six institutions incorporated reading assignments using accessible summaries from Astrobites into their undergraduate astronomy major courses, surveyed their students before and after the activities, and participated in follow-up interviews with our research team. Quantitative and qualitative survey data from 52 students show that students' perceptions of their abilities with jargon and identifying main takeaways of a paper significantly improved with use of the tested assignment template. Additionally, students report increased confidence of their abilities within astronomy after exposure to these assignments, and instructors valued a ready-to-use resource to incorporate reading comprehension in their pedagogy. This exploratory case study with Astrobites-based assignments suggests that incorporating current research in the undergraduate classroom through accessible literature summaries may increase students' confidence and ability to engage with research literature, assisting in their preparation for participation in research careers.</description>

      <title>Presenting a STEM Ways of Thinking Framework for Engineering Design-based Physics Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11654v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Investigating students' thinking in classroom tasks, particularly in science and engineering, is essential for improving educational practices and advancing student learning. In this context, the notion of Ways of Thinking (WoT) has gained traction in STEM education, offering a framework to explore how students approach and solve interdisciplinary problems. Building on our earlier studies and contributing to ongoing discussions on WoT frameworks, this paper introduces a new WoT framework: Ways of Thinking in Engineering Design based Physics (WoT4EDP). WoT4EDP integrates five key elements: design, science, mathematics, metacognitive reflection, and computational thinking within an undergraduate introductory physics laboratory. This framework offers a novel perspective by emphasizing how these interconnected elements work together to foster deeper learning and holistic problem-solving in Engineering Design based projects. A key takeaway is that this framework serves as a practical tool for educators and researchers to design, implement, and analyze interdisciplinary STEM activities in physics classrooms. We describe the development of WoT4EDP, situate it within the broader landscape of undergraduate STEM education, and provide detailed characterizations of its components. Additionally, we compare WoT4EDP with two contemporary frameworks: Dalal et al. (2021) and English (2023), to glean insights that enhance its application and promote interdisciplinary thinking. This paper is the first of a two-part series. In the upcoming second part, we will demonstrate the application of the WoT4EDP framework, showcasing how it can be used to analyze student thinking in real-world, ED-based physics projects.</description>
