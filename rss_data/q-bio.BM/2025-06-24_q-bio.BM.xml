      <title>AbRank: A Benchmark Dataset and Metric-Learning Framework for Antibody-Antigen Affinity Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) binding affinity is essential for therapeutic design and vaccine development, yet the performance of current models is limited by noisy experimental labels, heterogeneous assay conditions, and poor generalization across the vast antibody and antigen sequence space. We introduce AbRank, a large-scale benchmark and evaluation framework that reframes affinity prediction as a pairwise ranking problem. AbRank aggregates over 380,000 binding assays from nine heterogeneous sources, spanning diverse antibodies, antigens, and experimental conditions, and introduces standardized data splits that systematically increase distribution shift, from local perturbations such as point mutations to broad generalization across novel antigens and antibodies. To ensure robust supervision, AbRank defines an m-confident ranking framework by filtering out comparisons with marginal affinity differences, focusing training on pairs with at least an m-fold difference in measured binding strength. As a baseline for the benchmark, we introduce WALLE-Affinity, a graph-based approach that integrates protein language model embeddings with structural information to predict pairwise binding preferences. Our benchmarks reveal significant limitations in current methods under realistic generalization settings and demonstrate that ranking-based training improves robustness and transferability. In summary, AbRank offers a robust foundation for machine learning models to generalize across the antibody-antigen space, with direct relevance for scalable, structure-aware antibody therapeutic design.</description>

      <title>OmniESI: A unified framework for enzyme-substrate interaction prediction with progressive conditional deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and modeling enzyme-substrate interactions is crucial for catalytic mechanism research, enzyme engineering, and metabolic engineering. Although a large number of predictive methods have emerged, they do not incorporate prior knowledge of enzyme catalysis to rationally modulate general protein-molecule features that are misaligned with catalytic patterns. To address this issue, we introduce a two-stage progressive framework, OmniESI, for enzyme-substrate interaction prediction through conditional deep learning. By decomposing the modeling of enzyme-substrate interactions into a two-stage progressive process, OmniESI incorporates two conditional networks that respectively emphasize enzymatic reaction specificity and crucial catalysis-related interactions, facilitating a gradual feature modulation in the latent space from general protein-molecule domain to catalysis-aware domain. On top of this unified architecture, OmniESI can adapt to a variety of downstream tasks, including enzyme kinetic parameter prediction, enzyme-substrate pairing prediction, enzyme mutational effect prediction, and enzymatic active site annotation. Under the multi-perspective performance evaluation of in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, OmniESI consistently delivered superior performance than state-of-the-art specialized methods across seven benchmarks. More importantly, the proposed conditional networks were shown to internalize the fundamental patterns of catalytic efficiency while significantly improving prediction performance, with only negligible parameter increases (0.16%), as demonstrated by ablation studies on key components. Overall, OmniESI represents a unified predictive approach for enzyme-substrate interactions, providing an effective tool for catalytic mechanism cracking and enzyme engineering with strong generalization and broad applicability.</description>

      <title>Single-Cell Proteomic Technologies: Tools in the quest for principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last decade, proteomic analysis of single cells by mass spectrometry transitioned from an uncertain possibility to a set of robust and rapidly advancing technologies supporting the accurate quantification of thousands of proteins. We review the major drivers of this progress, from establishing feasibility to powerful and increasingly scalable methods. We focus on the tradeoffs and synergies of different technological solutions within a coherent conceptual framework, which projects considerable room both for throughput scaling and for extending the analysis scope to functional protein measurements. We highlight the potential of these technologies to support the development of mechanistic biophysical models and help uncover new principles.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Discovery of Biophysical T Cell Receptor Co-specificity Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13722v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The biophysical interactions between the T cell receptor (TCR) and its ligands determine the specificity of the cellular immune response. However, the immense diversity of receptors and ligands has made it challenging to discover generalizable rules across the distinct binding affinity landscapes created by different ligands. Here, we present an optimization framework for discovering biophysical rules that predict whether TCRs share specificity to a ligand. Applying this framework to TCRs associated with a collection of SARS-CoV-2 peptides we systematically characterize how co-specificity depends on the type and position of amino-acid differences between receptors. We also demonstrate that the inferred rules generalize to ligands highly dissimilar to any seen during training. Our analysis reveals that matching of steric properties between substituted amino acids is more important for receptor co-specificity than the hydrophobic properties that prominently determine evolutionary substitutability. Our analysis also quantifies the substantial importance of positions not in direct contact with the peptide for specificity. These findings highlight the potential for data-driven approaches to uncover the molecular mechanisms underpinning the specificity of adaptive immune responses.</description>

      <title>Generative Modeling of Full-Atom Protein Conformations using Latent Diffusion on Graph Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating diverse, all-atom conformational ensembles of dynamic proteins such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is critical for understanding their function, yet most generative models simplify atomic detail or ignore conformational diversity altogether. We present latent diffusion for full protein generation (LD-FPG), a framework that constructs complete all-atom protein structures, including every side-chain heavy atom, directly from molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. LD-FPG employs a Chebyshev graph neural network (ChebNet) to obtain low-dimensional latent embeddings of protein conformations, which are processed using three pooling strategies: blind, sequential and residue-based. A diffusion model trained on these latent representations generates new samples that a decoder, optionally regularized by dihedral-angle losses, maps back to Cartesian coordinates. Using D2R-MD, a 2-microsecond MD trajectory (12 000 frames) of the human dopamine D2 receptor in a membrane environment, the sequential and residue-based pooling strategy reproduces the reference ensemble with high structural fidelity (all-atom lDDT of approximately 0.7; C-alpha-lDDT of approximately 0.8) and recovers backbone and side-chain dihedral-angle distributions with a Jensen-Shannon divergence of less than 0.03 compared to the MD data. LD-FPG thereby offers a practical route to system-specific, all-atom ensemble generation for large proteins, providing a promising tool for structure-based therapeutic design on complex, dynamic targets. The D2R-MD dataset and our implementation are freely available to facilitate further research.</description>

      <title>Static Three-Dimensional Structures Determine Fast Dynamics Between Distal Loci Pairs in Interphase Chromosomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10004v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Live-cell imaging experiments have shown that the distal dynamics between enhancers and promoters are unexpectedly rapid and incompatible with standard polymer models. The discordance between the compact static chromatin organization and dynamics is a conundrum that violates the expected structure-function relationship. We developed a theory to predict chromatin dynamics by accurately determining three-dimensional (3D) structures from static Hi-C contact maps or fixed-cell imaging data. Using the calculated 3D coordinates, the theory accurately forecasts experimentally observed two-point chromatin dynamics. It predicts rapid enhancer-promoter interactions and uncovers a scaling relationship between two-point relaxation time and genomic separation, closely matching recent measurements. The theory predicts that cohesin depletion accelerates single-locus diffusion while significantly slowing relaxation dynamics within topologically associating domains (TADs). Our results demonstrate that chromatin dynamics can be reliably inferred from static structural data, reinforcing the notion that 3D chromatin structure governs dynamic behavior. This general framework offers powerful tools for exploring chromatin dynamics across diverse biological contexts.</description>

      <title>BAnG: Bidirectional Anchored Generation for Conditional RNA Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing RNA molecules that interact with specific proteins is a critical challenge in experimental and computational biology. Existing computational approaches require a substantial amount of previously known interacting RNA sequences for each specific protein or a detailed knowledge of RNA structure, restricting their utility in practice. To address this limitation, we develop RNA-BAnG, a deep learning-based model designed to generate RNA sequences for protein interactions without these requirements. Central to our approach is a novel generative method, Bidirectional Anchored Generation (BAnG), which leverages the observation that protein-binding RNA sequences often contain functional binding motifs embedded within broader sequence contexts. We first validate our method on generic synthetic tasks involving similar localized motifs to those appearing in RNAs, demonstrating its benefits over existing generative approaches. We then evaluate our model on biological sequences, showing its effectiveness for conditional RNA sequence design given a binding protein.</description>
