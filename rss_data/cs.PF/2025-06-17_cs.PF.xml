      <title>NR Cell Identity-based Handover Decision-making Algorithm for High-speed Scenario within Dual Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dense deployment of 5G heterogeneous networks (HetNets) has improved network capacity. However, it also brings frequent and unnecessary handover challenges to high-speed mobile user equipment (UE), resulting in unstable communication and degraded quality of service. Traditional handovers ignore the type of target next-generation Node B (gNB), resulting in high-speed UEs being able to be handed over to any gNB. This paper proposes a NR cell identity (NCI)-based handover decision-making algorithm (HDMA) to address this issue. The proposed HDMA identifies the type of the target gNB (macro/small/mmWave gNB) using the gNB identity (ID) within the NCI to improve the handover decision-making strategy. The proposed HDMA aims to improve the communication stability of high-speed mobile UE by enabling high-speed UEs to identify the target gNB type during the HDMA using the gNB ID. Simulation results show that the proposed HDMA outperforms other HDMAs in enhanced connection stability.</description>

      <title>A Review of the Long Horizon Forecasting Problem in Time Series Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The long horizon forecasting (LHF) problem has come up in the time series literature for over the last 35 years or so. This review covers aspects of LHF in this period and how deep learning has incorporated variants of trend, seasonality, fourier and wavelet transforms, misspecification bias reduction and bandpass filters while contributing using convolutions, residual connections, sparsity reduction, strided convolutions, attention masks, SSMs, normalization methods, low-rank approximations and gating mechanisms. We highlight time series decomposition techniques, input data preprocessing and dataset windowing schemes that improve performance. Multi-layer perceptron models, recurrent neural network hybrids, self-attention models that improve and/or address the performances of the LHF problem are described, with an emphasis on the feature space construction. Ablation studies are conducted over the ETTm2 dataset in the multivariate and univariate high useful load (HUFL) forecasting contexts, evaluated over the last 4 months of the dataset. The heatmaps of MSE averages per time step over test set series in the horizon show that there is a steady increase in the error proportionate to its length except with xLSTM and Triformer models and motivate LHF as an error propagation problem. The trained models are available here: https://bit.ly/LHFModelZoo</description>

      <title>EvalNet: A Practical Toolchain for Generation and Analysis of Extreme-Scale Interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.12663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diversity of communication paths in a network - especially non-minimal paths - is a key enabler of performance at extreme scales. We present EvalNet, a toolchain for scalable generation and analysis over 25 important network topologies, such as Slim Fly, PolarFly, and Orthogonal Fat Trees, with a strong focus on path diversity metrics. EvalNet provides an extensive and fine-grained analysis of shortest and non-shortest paths, including their multiplicities, lengths, and interference. It supports exact measurement and visualization of bandwidth and throughput between every router pair, enabling unprecedented insight into routing potential. EvalNet also includes detailed models for construction cost and power consumption, and interfaces seamlessly with established simulators, which we tune to support large-scale evaluations on low-cost hardware. Using EvalNet, we deliver the widest and most comprehensive path diversity study to date, demonstrating how path diversity underpins throughput and scalability, and facilitating progress towards new frontiers in extreme-scale network design.</description>

      <title>ClusterKV: Manipulating LLM KV Cache in Semantic Space for Recallable Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in a variety of applications, and the context length is rapidly increasing to handle tasks such as long-document QA and complex logical reasoning. However, long context poses significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory costs of key-value (KV) cache and increased latency due to extensive memory accesses. Recent works have proposed compressing KV cache to approximate computation, but these methods either evict tokens permanently, never recalling them for later inference, or recall previous tokens at the granularity of pages divided by textual positions. Both approaches degrade the model accuracy and output quality. To achieve efficient and accurate recallable KV cache compression, we introduce ClusterKV, which recalls tokens at the granularity of semantic clusters. We design and implement efficient algorithms and systems for clustering, selection, indexing and caching. Experiment results show that ClusterKV attains negligible accuracy loss across various tasks with 32k context lengths, using only a 1k to 2k KV cache budget, and achieves up to a 2$\times$ speedup in latency and a 2.5$\times$ improvement in decoding throughput. Compared to SoTA recallable KV compression methods, ClusterKV demonstrates higher model accuracy and output quality, while maintaining or exceeding inference efficiency. Our code is available at https://github.com/sjtu-zhao-lab/ClusterKV.</description>

      <title>Performance optimization of BLAS algorithms with band matrices for RISC-V processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of RISC-V instruction set architecture presents new opportunities and challenges for software developers. Is it sufficient to simply recompile high-performance software optimized for x86-64 onto RISC-V CPUs? Are current compilers capable of effectively optimizing C and C++ codes or is it necessary to use intrinsics or assembler? Can we analyze and improve performance without well-developed profiling tools? Do standard optimization techniques work? Are there specific RISC-V features that need to be considered? These and other questions require careful consideration. In this paper, we present our experience optimizing four BLAS algorithms for band matrix operations on RISC-V processors. We demonstrate how RISC-V-optimized implementations of OpenBLAS algorithms can be significantly accelerated through improved vectorization of computationally intensive loops. Experiments on Lichee Pi 4A and Banana Pi BPI-F3 devices using RVV 0.7.1 and RVV 1.0 vector instruction sets respectively, show speedups of 1.5x to 10x depending on the operation compared to the OpenBLAS baseline. In particular, the successful use of vector register grouping with RVV can lead to significant performance improvements.</description>

      <title>PARD: Accelerating LLM Inference with Low-Cost PARallel Draft Model Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The autoregressive nature of large language models (LLMs) limits inference speed. Each forward pass generates only a single token and is often bottlenecked by memory bandwidth. Speculative decoding alleviates this issue using a draft-then-verify approach to accelerate token generation. However, the overhead introduced during the draft phase and the training cost of the draft model limit the efficiency and adaptability of speculative decoding. In this work, we introduce PARallel Draft (PARD), a novel speculative decoding method that enables low-cost adaptation of autoregressive draft models into parallel draft models. PARD enhances inference efficiency by predicting multiple future tokens in a single forward pass of the draft phase, and incorporates a conditional drop token method to accelerate training. Its target-independence property allows a single draft model to be applied to an entire family of different models, minimizing the adaptation cost. Our proposed conditional drop token method can improves draft model training efficiency by 3x. On our optimized inference framework, PARD accelerates LLaMA3.1-8B inference by 4.08x, achieving 311.5 tokens per second.</description>

      <title>EdgeProfiler: A Fast Profiling Framework for Lightweight LLMs on Edge Using Analytical Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces EdgeProfiler, a fast profiling framework designed for evaluating lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge systems. While LLMs offer remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, their high computational, memory, and power requirements often confine them to cloud environments. EdgeProfiler addresses these challenges by providing a systematic methodology for assessing LLM performance in resource-constrained edge settings. The framework profiles compact LLMs, including TinyLLaMA, Gemma3.1B, Llama3.2-1B, and DeepSeek-r1-1.5B, using aggressive quantization techniques and strict memory constraints. Analytical modeling is used to estimate latency, FLOPs, and energy consumption. The profiling reveals that 4-bit quantization reduces model memory usage by approximately 60-70%, while maintaining accuracy within 2-5% of full-precision baselines. Inference speeds are observed to improve by 2-3x compared to FP16 baselines across various edge devices. Power modeling estimates a 35-50% reduction in energy consumption for INT4 configurations, enabling practical deployment on hardware such as Raspberry Pi 4/5 and Jetson Orin Nano Super. Our findings emphasize the importance of efficient profiling tailored to lightweight LLMs in edge environments, balancing accuracy, energy efficiency, and computational feasibility.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Heuristic Framework for Resource-Efficient Querying of Scientific Experiments Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientific experiments and modern applications are generating large amounts of data every day. Most organizations utilize In-house servers or Cloud resources to manage application data and workload. The traditional database management system (DBMS) and HTAP systems spend significant time &amp; resources to load the entire dataset into DBMS before starting query execution. On the other hand, in-situ engines may reparse required data multiple times, increasing resource utilization and data processing costs. Additionally, over or under-allocation of resources also increases application running costs. This paper proposes a lightweight Resource Availability &amp;Workload aware Hybrid Framework (RAW-HF) to optimize querying raw data by utilizing existing finite resources efficiently. RAW-HF includes modules that help optimize the resources required to execute a given workload and maximize the utilization of existing resources. The impact of applying RAW-HF to real-world scientific dataset workloads like Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Linked Observation Data (LOD) presented over 90% and 85% reduction in workload execution time (WET) compared to widely used traditional DBMS PostgreSQL. The overall CPU, IO resource utilization, and WET have been reduced by 26%, 25%, and 26%, respectively, while improving memory utilization by 33%, compared to the state-of-the-art workload-aware partial loading technique (WA) proposed for hybrid systems. A comparison of MUAR technique used by RAW-HF with machine learning based resource allocation techniques like PCC is also presented.</description>
