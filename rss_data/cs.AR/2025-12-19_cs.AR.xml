      <title>Workload Characterization for Branch Predictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditional branch prediction predicts the likely direction of a conditional branch instruction to support ILP extraction. Branch prediction is a pattern recognition problem that learns mappings between a context to the branch outcome. An accurate predictor reduces the number of instructions executed on the wrong path resulting in an improvement of performance and energy consumption. In this paper, we present a workload characterization methodology for branch prediction. We propose two new workload-driven branch prediction accuracy identifiers -- branch working set size and branch predictability. These parameters are highly correlated with misprediction rates of modern branch prediction schemes (e.g. TAGE and perceptron). We define the branch working set of a trace as a group of most frequently occurring branch contexts, i.e. the 3-part tuple of branch address, and associated global and local history. We analyze the branch working set's size and predictability on a per-trace basis to study its relationship with a modern branch predictor's accuracy. We have characterized 2,451 workload traces into seven branch working set size and nine predictability categories after analyzing their branch behavior. We present further insights into the source of prediction accuracy and favored workload categories for modern branch predictors.</description>

      <title>Full System Architecture Modeling for Wearable Egocentric Contextual AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of human-oriented computing will require always-on, spatially-aware wearable devices to capture egocentric vision and functional primitives (e.g., Where am I? What am I looking at?, etc.). These devices will sense an egocentric view of the world around us to observe all human- relevant signals across space and time to construct and maintain a user's personal context. This personal context, combined with advanced generative AI, will unlock a powerful new generation of contextual AI personal assistants and applications. However, designing a wearable system to support contextual AI is a daunting task because of the system's complexity and stringent power constraints due to weight and battery restrictions. To understand how to guide design for such systems, this work provides the first complete system architecture view of one such wearable contextual AI system (Aria2), along with the lessons we have learned through the system modeling and design space exploration process. We show that an end-to-end full system model view of such systems is vitally important, as no single component or category overwhelmingly dominates system power. This means long-range design decisions and power optimizations need to be made in the full system context to avoid running into limits caused by other system bottlenecks (i.e., Amdahl's law as applied to power) or as bottlenecks change. Finally, we reflect on lessons and insights for the road ahead, which will be important toward eventually enabling all-day, wearable, contextual AI systems.</description>

      <title>Low-Latency FPGA Control System for Real-Time Neural Network Processing in CCD-Based Trapped-Ion Qubit Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and low-latency qubit state measurement is critical for trapped-ion quantum computing. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have been integrated to enhance detection fidelity, their latency performance on specific hardware platforms remains underexplored. This work benchmarks the latency of DNN-based qubit detection on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). The FPGA solution directly interfaces an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) with the subsequent data processing logic, eliminating buffering and interface overheads. As a baseline, the GPU-based system employs a high-speed PCIe image grabber for image input and I/O card for state output. We deploy Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models on hardware to evaluate measurement performance. Compared to conventional thresholding, DNNs reduce the mean measurement fidelity (MMF) error by factors of 1.8-2.5x (one-qubit case) and 4.2-7.6x (three-qubit case). FPGA-based MLP and ViT achieve nanosecond- and microsecond-scale inference latencies, while the complete single-shot measurement process achieves over 100x speedup compared to the GPU implementation. Additionally, clock-cycle-level signal analysis reveals inefficiencies in EMCCD data transmission via Cameralink, suggesting that optimizing this interface could further leverage the advantages of ultra-low-latency DNN inference, guiding the development of next-generation qubit detection systems.</description>

      <title>AIE4ML: An End-to-End Framework for Compiling Neural Networks for the Next Generation of AMD AI Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient AI inference on AMD's Versal AI Engine (AIE) is challenging due to tightly coupled VLIW execution, explicit datapaths, and local memory management. Prior work focused on first-generation AIE kernel optimizations, without tackling full neural network execution across the 2D array. In this work, we present AIE4ML, the first comprehensive framework for converting AI models automatically into optimized firmware targeting the AIE-ML generation devices, also with forward compatibility for the newer AIE-MLv2 architecture. At the single-kernel level, we attain performance close to the architectural peak. At the graph and system levels, we provide a structured parallelization method that can scale across the 2D AIE-ML fabric and exploit its dedicated memory tiles to stay entirely on-chip throughout the model execution. As a demonstration, we designed a generalized and highly efficient linear-layer implementation with intrinsic support for fused bias addition and ReLU activation. Also, as our framework necessitates the generation of multi-layer implementations, our approach systematically derives deterministic, compact, and topology-optimized placements tailored to the physical 2D grid of the device through a novel graph placement and search algorithm. Finally, the framework seamlessly accepts quantized models imported from high-level tools such as hls4ml or PyTorch while preserving bit-exactness. In layer scaling benchmarks, we achieve up to 98.6% efficiency relative to the single-kernel baseline, utilizing 296 of 304 AIE tiles (97.4%) of the device with entirely on-chip data movement. With evaluations across real-world model topologies, we demonstrate that AIE4ML delivers GPU-class throughput under microsecond latency constraints, making it a practical companion for ultra-low-latency environments such as trigger systems in particle physics experiments.</description>

      <title>HPU: High-Bandwidth Processing Unit for Scalable, Cost-effective LLM Inference via GPU Co-processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The attention layer, a core component of Transformer-based LLMs, brings out inefficiencies in current GPU systems due to its low operational intensity and the substantial memory requirements of KV caches. We propose a High-bandwidth Processing Unit (HPU), a memoryintensive co-processor that enhances GPU resource utilization during large-batched LLM inference. By offloading memory-bound operations, the HPU allows the GPU to focus on compute-intensive tasks, increasing overall efficiency. Also, the HPU, as an add-on card, scales out to accommodate surging memory demands driven by large batch sizes and extended sequence lengths. In this paper, we show the HPU prototype implemented with PCIe-based FPGA cards mounted on a GPU system. Our novel GPU-HPU heterogeneous system demonstrates up to 4.1x performance gains and 4.6x energy efficiency improvements over a GPUonly system, providing scalability without increasing the number of GPUs.</description>
