      <title>Physical Principles of Quantum Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This technical monograph provides a comprehensive overview of the field of quantum biology. It approaches quantum biology from a physical perspective with core quantum mechanical concepts presented foremost to provide a theoretical foundation for the field. An extensive body of research is covered to clarify the significance of quantum biology as a scientific field, outlining the field's long-standing importance in the historical development of quantum theory. This lays the essential groundwork to enable further advances in nanomedicine and biotechnology. Written for academics, biological science researchers, physicists, biochemists, medical technologists, and students of quantum mechanics, this text brings clarity to fundamental advances being made in the emerging science of quantum biology.</description>

      <title>PERC: a suite of software tools for the curation of cryoEM data with application to simulation, modelling and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ease of access to data, tools and models expedites scientific research. In structural biology there are now numerous open repositories of experimental and simulated datasets. Being able to easily access and utilise these is crucial for allowing researchers to make optimal use of their research effort. The tools presented here are useful for collating existing public cryoEM datasets and/or creating new synthetic cryoEM datasets to aid the development of novel data processing and interpretation algorithms. In recent years, structural biology has seen the development of a multitude of machine-learning based algorithms for aiding numerous steps in the processing and reconstruction of experimental datasets and the use of these approaches has become widespread. Developing such techniques in structural biology requires access to large datasets which can be cumbersome to curate and unwieldy to make use of. In this paper we present a suite of Python software packages which we collectively refer to as PERC (profet, EMPIARreader and CAKED). These are designed to reduce the burden which data curation places upon structural biology research. The protein structure fetcher (profet) package allows users to conveniently download and cleave sequences or structures from the Protein Data Bank or Alphafold databases. EMPIARreader allows lazy loading of Electron Microscopy Public Image Archive datasets in a machine-learning compatible structure. The Class Aggregator for Key Electron-microscopy Data (CAKED) package is designed to seamlessly facilitate the training of machine learning models on electron microscopy data, including electron-cryo-microscopy-specific data augmentation and labelling. These packages may be utilised independently or as building blocks in workflows. All are available in open source repositories and designed to be easily extensible to facilitate more advanced workflows if required.</description>

      <title>ShEPhERD: Diffusing shape, electrostatics, and pharmacophores for bioisosteric drug design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Engineering molecules to exhibit precise 3D intermolecular interactions with their environment forms the basis of chemical design. In ligand-based drug design, bioisosteric analogues of known bioactive hits are often identified by virtually screening chemical libraries with shape, electrostatic, and pharmacophore similarity scoring functions. We instead hypothesize that a generative model which learns the joint distribution over 3D molecular structures and their interaction profiles may facilitate 3D interaction-aware chemical design. We specifically design ShEPhERD, an SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model which jointly diffuses/denoises 3D molecular graphs and representations of their shapes, electrostatic potential surfaces, and (directional) pharmacophores to/from Gaussian noise. Inspired by traditional ligand discovery, we compose 3D similarity scoring functions to assess ShEPhERD's ability to conditionally generate novel molecules with desired interaction profiles. We demonstrate ShEPhERD's potential for impact via exemplary drug design tasks including natural product ligand hopping, protein-blind bioactive hit diversification, and bioisosteric fragment merging.</description>
