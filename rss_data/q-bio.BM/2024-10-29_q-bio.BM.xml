      <title>pLDDT-Predictor: High-speed Protein Screening Using Transformer and ESM2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in protein structure prediction, particularly AlphaFold2, have revolutionized structural biology by achieving near-experimental accuracy. However, the computational intensity of these models limits their application in high-throughput protein screening. Concurrently, large language models like ESM (Evolutionary Scale Modeling) have demonstrated the potential to extract rich structural information directly from protein sequences. Despite these advances, a significant gap remains in rapidly assessing protein structure quality for large-scale analyses. We introduce pLDDT-Predictor, a high-speed protein screening tool that bridges this gap by leveraging pre-trained ESM2 protein embeddings and a Transformer architecture to accurately predict AlphaFold2`s pLDDT (predicted Local Distance Difference Test) scores. Our model addresses the critical need for fast, accurate protein structure quality assessment without the computational burden of full structure prediction. By combining the evolutionary information captured in ESM2 embeddings with the sequence-wide context modeling of Transformers, pLDDT-Predictor achieves a balance between structural insight and computational efficiency. Our experimental results, conducted on a diverse dataset of 1.5 million protein sequences, demonstrate that pLDDT-Predictor can classify more than 90 percent of proteins with a pLDDT score above 70, closely matching AlphaFold2`s confidence level.</description>

      <title>E(3)-invaraint diffusion model for pocket-aware peptide generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biologists frequently desire protein inhibitors for a variety of reasons, including use as research tools for understanding biological processes and application to societal problems in agriculture, healthcare, etc. Immunotherapy, for instance, relies on immune checkpoint inhibitors to block checkpoint proteins, preventing their binding with partner proteins and boosting immune cell function against abnormal cells. Inhibitor discovery has long been a tedious process, which in recent years has been accelerated by computational approaches. Advances in artificial intelligence now provide an opportunity to make inhibitor discovery smarter than ever before. While extensive research has been conducted on computer-aided inhibitor discovery, it has mainly focused on either sequence-to-structure mapping, reverse mapping, or bio-activity prediction, making it unrealistic for biologists to utilize such tools. Instead, our work proposes a new method of computer-assisted inhibitor discovery: de novo pocket-aware peptide structure and sequence generation network. Our approach consists of two sequential diffusion models for end-to-end structure generation and sequence prediction. By leveraging angle and dihedral relationships between backbone atoms, we ensure an E(3)-invariant representation of peptide structures. Our results demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art models, highlighting its potential in pocket-aware peptide design. This work offers a new approach for precise drug discovery using receptor-specific peptide generation.</description>

      <title>Competition for binding targets results in paradoxical effects for simultaneous activator and repressor action -- Extended Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of epigenetic transformations in cancer metastasis, a puzzling effect was recently discovered, in which the elimination (knock-out) of an activating regulatory element leads to increased (rather than decreased) activity of the element being regulated. It has been postulated that this paradoxical behavior can be explained by activating and repressing transcription factors competing for binding to other possible targets. It is very difficult to prove this hypothesis in mammalian cells, due to the large number of potential players and the complexity of endogenous intracellular regulatory networks. Instead, this paper analyzes this issue through an analogous synthetic biology construct which aims to reproduce the paradoxical behavior using standard bacterial gene expression networks. The paper first reviews the motivating cancer biology work, and then describes a proposed synthetic construct. A mathematical model is formulated, and basic properties of uniqueness of steady states and convergence to equilibria are established, as well as an identification of parameter regimes which should lead to observing such paradoxical phenomena (more activator leads to less activity at steady state). A proof is also given to show that this is a steady-state property, and for initial transients the phenomenon will not be observed. This work adds to the general line of work of resource competition in synthetic circuits.</description>

      <title>Contextual Representation Anchor Network to Alleviate Selection Bias in Few-Shot Drug Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the drug discovery process, the low success rate of drug candidate screening often leads to insufficient labeled data, causing the few-shot learning problem in molecular property prediction. Existing methods for few-shot molecular property prediction overlook the sample selection bias, which arises from non-random sample selection in chemical experiments. This bias in data representativeness leads to suboptimal performance. To overcome this challenge, we present a novel method named contextual representation anchor Network (CRA), where an anchor refers to a cluster center of the representations of molecules and serves as a bridge to transfer enriched contextual knowledge into molecular representations and enhance their expressiveness. CRA introduces a dual-augmentation mechanism that includes context augmentation, which dynamically retrieves analogous unlabeled molecules and captures their task-specific contextual knowledge to enhance the anchors, and anchor augmentation, which leverages the anchors to augment the molecular representations. We evaluate our approach on the MoleculeNet and FS-Mol benchmarks, as well as in domain transfer experiments. The results demonstrate that CRA outperforms the state-of-the-art by 2.60% and 3.28% in AUC and $\Delta$AUC-PR metrics, respectively, and exhibits superior generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>EMOCPD: Efficient Attention-based Models for Computational Protein Design Using Amino Acid Microenvironment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational protein design (CPD) refers to the use of computational methods to design proteins. Traditional methods relying on energy functions and heuristic algorithms for sequence design are inefficient and do not meet the demands of the big data era in biomolecules, with their accuracy limited by the energy functions and search algorithms. Existing deep learning methods are constrained by the learning capabilities of the networks, failing to extract effective information from sparse protein structures, which limits the accuracy of protein design. To address these shortcomings, we developed an Efficient attention-based Models for Computational Protein Design using amino acid microenvironment (EMOCPD). It aims to predict the category of each amino acid in a protein by analyzing the three-dimensional atomic environment surrounding the amino acids, and optimize the protein based on the predicted high-probability potential amino acid categories. EMOCPD employs a multi-head attention mechanism to focus on important features in the sparse protein microenvironment and utilizes an inverse residual structure to optimize the network architecture. The proposed EMOCPD achieves over 80% accuracy on the training set and 68.33% and 62.32% accuracy on two independent test sets, respectively, surpassing the best comparative methods by over 10%. In protein design, the thermal stability and protein expression of the predicted mutants from EMOCPD show significant improvements compared to the wild type, effectively validating EMOCPD's potential in designing superior proteins. Furthermore, the predictions of EMOCPD are influenced positively, negatively, or have minimal impact based on the content of the 20 amino acids, categorizing amino acids as positive, negative, or neutral. Research findings indicate that EMOCPD is more suitable for designing proteins with lower contents of negative amino acids.</description>
