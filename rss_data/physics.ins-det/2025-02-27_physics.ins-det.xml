      <title>Physics Prospects with MeV Neutrino-Argon Charged Current Interactions using Enhanced Photon Detection in Future LArTPCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate MeV-scale electron neutrino charged current interactions in a liquid argon time projection chamber equipped with an enhanced photon detection system. Using simulations of deposited energy in charge and light calorimetry, we explore the potential for dual calorimetric neutrino energy reconstruction. We found energy reconstruction based on light-only calorimetry has a better resolution than combined charge and light calorimetry when hadrons are produced in these events. Meanwhile, enhanced light detection offers improved nanosecond timing resolution and broad optical coverage, enabling neutron tagging and identification of delayed low-energy gamma emissions. These advancements open new avenues in low-energy neutrino physics in next-generation LArTPCs.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Neutron Whispering Gallery States Using a Pulsed Neutron Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A neutron whispering gallery state is a quantum state localized on a material surface bound by the centrifugal force and the material potential. Precise measurements of such quantum states enable tests of quantum mechanics in non-inertial frames, characterization of the surface potential, and searches for hypothetical short-range interactions at the nanometer scale. We observed a neutron whispering gallery state on a $\mathrm{SiO}_2$ concave mirror using a pulsed cold neutron beam. The measured results agree with theoretical calculations within $1.9\%$ for the centrifugal acceleration $a \approx 7\times 10^7\,\mathrm{m/s^2}$, which is due to unmodeled deviations of the shape of the concave mirror edge from an ideal one. We found that the sensitivity itself was $1\times 10^{-4}$, which is two orders of magnitude better than the above agreement.</description>

      <title>A space-resolved visible spectrometer system using compact endoscopic optics for full vertical profile measurement of impurity line emissions in superconducting EAST tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST tokamak) with tungsten divertors and molybdenum first wall, lithiumization and boronization have been frequently carried out to improve the plasma performance, in particular, in long pulse discharges. A study on impurity behaviors of lithium, boron and tungsten atoms/ions in the edge plasma is then crucially important. For the purpose, a space-resolved visible spectrometer system has been newly developed to observe full vertical profiles over a length of 1.7m of impurity line emissions in wavelength range of 320-800nm. For the full vertical profile measurement compact endoscopic optics is employed with an optical fiber bundle for the system, which can be inserted into a 1.5m long extension tube called 'long nose', because the distance between the diagnostic port and plasma center is considerably long. Therefore, a quartz glass window mounted from the vacuum vessel side is designed to withstand the reverse pressure. A mechanical shutter is also designed to open at a large angle of 235 degree so that the viewing angle of nearby ports is not blocked. Two sets of the fiber bundle, 60-channel linear array and 11*10 channel planar array , with a length of 30m are attached to two sets of Czerny-Turner visible spectrometers for one-dimensional (1D) vertical profile measurement of core plasma and two-dimensional (2D) spectroscopy of divertor plasma, respectively. A complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) detector with 2048*2048 pixels is used for the visible spectrometers. A preliminary result on the full vertical profile is obtained for BII line emission at 703.19nm in the 1D system</description>

      <title>Demonstrating the ability of IceCube DeepCore to probe Earth's interior with atmospheric neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is an optical Cherenkov detector instrumenting one cubic kilometer of ice at the South Pole. The Cherenkov photons emitted following a neutrino interaction are detected by digital optical modules deployed along vertical strings within the ice. The densely instrumented bottom central region of the IceCube detector, known as DeepCore, is optimized to detect GeV-scale atmospheric neutrinos. As upward-going atmospheric neutrinos pass through Earth, matter effects alter their oscillation probabilities due to coherent forward scattering with ambient electrons. These matter effects depend upon the energy of neutrinos and the density distribution of electrons they encounter during their propagation. Using simulated data at the IceCube Deepcore equivalent to its 9.3 years of observation, we demonstrate that atmospheric neutrinos can be used to probe the broad features of the Preliminary Reference Earth Model. In this contribution, we present the preliminary sensitivities for establishing the Earth matter effects, validating the non-homogeneous distribution of Earth's electron density, and measuring the mass of Earth. Further, we also show the DeepCore sensitivity to perform the correlated density measurement of different layers incorporating constraints on Earth's mass and moment of inertia.</description>

      <title>Development of a high-rate capable DLC-RPC based on a current evacuation pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Resistive Plate Chamber using Diamond-Like Carbon electrodes (DLC-RPC) has been developed as a background tagging detector in the MEG$~$II experiment. The DLC-RPC is planned to be installed in a high-intensity and low-momentum muon beam. This detector is required to have a detection efficiency above 90 % with four active gaps in the muon beam due to the limitation of the material budget. In such an environment, the high current flowing through the resistive electrodes causes a voltage drop, which reduces the performance of the DLC-RPC. This voltage drop can be suppressed by implementing a current evacuation pattern, though discharges are more likely to occur near the pattern. Therefore the pattern must be covered by a protection cover made of an insulator. In this study, electrode samples with a current evacuation pattern and different widths of protection cover (0.2 mm and 0.8 mm) have been produced, and their performance and stability were measured. The detection efficiency of a single-gap chamber for $\beta$-rays from a $^{90}$Sr source was measured to be up to approximately 60 % in both electrode samples. The target efficiency can be achieved even with a drop of 100 $-$ 150 V. On the other hand, after more than a dozen hours of operation, discharges suddenly occurred and the detector was prevented from further operation. These discharges created current paths on the spacing pillars. This serious problem must be investigated and solved in the future.</description>

      <title>Table-top three-dimensional photoemission orbital tomography with a femtosecond extreme ultraviolet light source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following electronic processes in molecules and materials at the level of the quantum mechanical electron wavefunction with angstrom-level spatial resolution and with full access to its femtosecond temporal dynamics is at the heart of ultrafast condensed matter physics. A breakthrough invention allowing experimental access to electron wavefunctions was the reconstruction of molecular orbitals from angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy data in 2009, termed photoemission orbital tomography (POT). This invention puts ultrafast three-dimensional (3D) POT in reach, with many new prospects for the study of ultrafast light-matter interaction, femtochemistry and photo-induced phase transitions. Here, we develop a synergistic experimental-algorithmic approach to realize the first 3D-POT experiment using a short-pulse extreme ultraviolet light source. We combine a new variant of photoelectron spectroscopy, namely ultrafast momentum microscopy, with a table-top spectrally-tunable high-harmonic generation light source and a tailored algorithm for efficient 3D reconstruction from sparse, undersampled data. This combination dramatically speeds up the experimental data acquisition, while at the same time reducing the sampling requirements to achieve complete 3D information. We demonstrate the power of this approach by full 3D imaging of the frontier orbitals of a prototypical organic semiconductor absorbed on pristine Ag(110).</description>
