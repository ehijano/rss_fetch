      <title>Disjoint Compatibility via Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two plane drawings of graphs on the same set of points are called disjoint compatible if their union is plane and they do not have an edge in common. Let $S$ be a convex point set of $2n \geq 10$ points and let $\mathcal{H}$ be a family of plane drawings on $S$. Two plane perfect matchings $M_1$ and $M_2$ on $S$ (which do not need to be disjoint nor compatible) are \emph{disjoint $\mathcal{H}$-compatible} if there exists a drawing in $\mathcal{H}$ which is disjoint compatible to both $M_1$ and $M_2$ In this work, we consider the graph which has all plane perfect matchings as vertices and where two vertices are connected by an edge if the matchings are disjoint $\mathcal{H}$-compatible. We study the diameter of this graph when $\mathcal{H}$ is the family of all plane spanning trees, caterpillars or paths. We show that in the first two cases the graph is connected with constant and linear diameter, respectively, while in the third case it is disconnected.</description>

      <title>Detecting Spatial Dependence in Transcriptomics Data using Vectorised Persistence Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating spatial patterns in data is an integral task across various domains, including geostatistics, astronomy, and spatial tissue biology. The analysis of transcriptomics data in particular relies on methods for detecting spatially-dependent features that exhibit significant spatial patterns for both explanatory analysis and feature selection. However, given the complex and high-dimensional nature of these data, there is a need for robust, stable, and reliable descriptors of spatial dependence. We leverage the stability and multiscale properties of persistent homology to address this task. To this end, we introduce a novel framework using functional topological summaries, such as Betti curves and persistence landscapes, for identifying and describing non-random patterns in spatial data. In particular, we propose a non-parametric one-sample permutation test for spatial dependence and investigate its utility across both simulated and real spatial omics data. Our vectorised approach outperforms baseline methods at accurately detecting spatial dependence. Further, we find that our method is more robust to outliers than alternative tests using Moran's I.</description>

      <title>Boundary Labeling in a Circular Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boundary labeling is a well-known method for displaying short textual labels for a set of point features in a figure alongside the boundary of that figure. Labels and their corresponding points are connected via crossing-free leaders. We propose orbital boundary labeling as a new variant of the problem, in which (i) the figure is enclosed by a circular contour and (ii) the labels are placed as disjoint circular arcs in an annulus-shaped orbit around the contour. The algorithmic objective is to compute an orbital boundary labeling with the minimum total leader length. We identify several parameters that define the corresponding problem space: two leader types (straight or orbital-radial), label size and order, presence of candidate label positions, and constraints on where a leader attaches to its label. Our results provide polynomial-time algorithms for many variants and NP-hardness for others, using a variety of geometric and combinatorial insights.</description>

      <title>Efficient Incremental Penetration Depth Estimation between Convex Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Penetration depth (PD) is essential for robotics due to its extensive applications in dynamic simulation, motion planning, haptic rendering, etc. The Expanding Polytope Algorithm (EPA) is the de facto standard for this problem, which estimates PD by expanding an inner polyhedral approximation of an implicit set. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization-based algorithm that incrementally estimates minimum penetration depth and its direction. One major advantage of our method is that it can be warm-started by exploiting the spatial and temporal coherence, which emerges naturally in many robotic applications (e.g., the temporal coherence between adjacent simulation time knots). As a result, our algorithm achieves substantial speedup -- we demonstrate it is 5-30x faster than EPA on several benchmarks. Moreover, our approach is built upon the same implicit geometry representation as EPA, which enables easy integration and deployment into existing software stacks. We also provide an open-source implementation on: https://github.com/weigao95/mind-fcl</description>
