      <title>Direct laser writing of high aspect ratio nanochannels for nanofluidics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanochannels with high width-to-height aspect ratios are desirable for many applications, particularly those requiring optical access, but remain challenging to fabricate. In this work, the direct laser writing of such channels between diamond films and glass substrates is introduced. As previously reported, laser light can transform a portion of diamond film into a nanostrip. The strip induces delamination of the surrounding film, causing the formation of two nanochannels with triangular cross-sections. Here, it is demonstrated that nanochannels with rectangular cross-sections and width-to-height aspect ratios exceeding fifty can form between pairs of nanostrips. With atomic force microscopy, the maximum strip spacing that produces these nanochannels is investigated, and it is demonstrated that the reflectance of the channels can be measured by microspectrophotometry. The microstructure of the nanochannels, including nanostrips, and processes that occur during laser writing are inferred from transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. By fabricating a nanofluidic device and using microspectrophotometry, it is found that the nanochannels fill with water through capillary action, are resistant to clogging, and are mechanically stable against water filling. A versatile platform for producing high-aspect-ratio nanochannels that are optically accessible and fluidically functional is presented, thereby expanding opportunities for advanced applications.</description>

      <title>Broadband Continuous Frequency Tuning in Non-Hermitian Laser Arrays Enabled by Mode-Switching Boundary Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broadband and continuous frequency tuning is central to the versatility of semiconductor lasers, yet existing approaches typically rely on external moving components, limiting scalability and integration. Here we demonstrate broadband continuous frequency tuning in a non-Hermitian laser array achieved solely by controlling the pump currents. We show that in two coupled sub-lasers with frequency detuning ($\Delta\omega$) and relative loss ($\Delta\alpha$), a mode-switching boundary emerges in the ($\Delta\omega$, $\Delta\alpha$) parameter space, shaping the frequency landscape of the lower-loss supermode. The topology of this boundary comprises pseudo-symmetric (PS) and pseudo-symmetry-broken (PSB) branches connected at an exceptional point (EP). When tuning trajectories cross the PS branch, frequency tuning is discontinuous, whereas trajectories crossing the PSB branch enable continuous tuning; trajectories through the EP yield the maximum continuous tuning range. Experiments using two coupled terahertz quantum cascade lasers demonstrate continuous tuning over 10 GHz, enabled by arbitrarily many combinations of pump currents. Extending this approach to a multi-element array further expands the continuous tuning range to 163 GHz. These results establish a general route to broadband continuous tuning in moving-part-free semiconductor lasers and highlight the potential for dynamic eigenvalue engineering in non-Hermitian photonics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Burst-mode fs-laser direct writing for full-thickness oxidation of Ta thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct fs-laser (1030~nm/200~fs) write of a throughout oxide Ta$_{2}$O$_{5}$ on a 200~nm Ta film was achieved using a combined ps- and ns- burst mode (Burst-in-Burst or BiB) of fs-pulse exposure at a high 0.6~MHz repetition rate. Few micrometers-wide lines were formed at the center of 12~$\mu$m focal spot by controlled oxidation without ablation. The oxidized regions were flat and optically transparent. Wavelength-scale self-organized ripples of oxidized Ta$_{2}$O$_{5}$ sub-1~$\mu$m gratings were recorded by rastering a $1\times 1$~mm$^2$ area. The oxidized ripples with periodic pattern $\sim wavelength$ were aligned with the polarization of the writing beam. Energy deposition in the burst-mode oxidation is discussed by comparing 200~fs and 20~ps BiB-mode writing modes. The presented strategy of self-guided oxidation with heat deposition by BiB fs-laser opens an opportunity for debris-free and annealing-free oxidation on a sub-wavelength scale.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridges with enhanced posterior sampling for metasurface inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurface inverse design is challenged by the intricate relationship between structural parameters and electromagnetic responses, as well as the high dimensionality of the optimization space. Local models, while commonly employed, quickly become infeasible for complex and locally coupled structures. Conventional iterative optimization techniques, on the other hand, are computationally intensive, time-consuming, and susceptible to convergence in local minima. This study explores a versatile generative methodology based on enhanced posterior sampling within the Schr\"odinger Bridge framework. By decomposing posterior sampling into amplitude and directional contributions, we effectively integrated different kind of posterior sampling. This approach is further supported by refined training strategies to enhance performance and reduce the complexity of hyperparameter optimization. The proposed framework demonstrates exceptional accuracy and robustness, representing a significant advancement in metasurface design. Notably, it enables high-precision inverse design for large-scale configurations of up to $350 \times 350$ pillar arrays, despite being trained on significantly smaller arrays of $23 \times 23$ pillars.</description>

      <title>Universal Bright-Bright Integrated Soliton Molecule via Parametric Binding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipative Kerr solitons (DKSs) have emerged as the preferred solution for on-chip integrated optical frequency comb (OFC) generation in metrology. A multi-pumped DKS enables either all-optical trapping in the Kerr-induced synchronization regime, or a multi-component OFC with \greg{a locked repetition rate yet with constant frequency offsets between the components} in the multi-color DKS regime. The multi-color DKS regime is of particular interest since nonlinear mixing between the DKS and the secondary pumped component generates idler waves at different frequencies that are useful for spectral extension of the DKS comb. Here, we explore multi-color idler generation at frequencies in which the resonator free spectral range matches that at the DKS. We demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that without phase matching, the idler forms a bright pulse fundamentally bound to the bright DKS through parametric interaction, despite occurring in normal dispersion. Our work can enable new applications in metrology and spectroscopy of quantum systems toward visible wavelengths, as the parametric nature of our bright-bright state eliminates dependence on dispersion regime or visible wavelength pumping.</description>

      <title>Thermoelastic surface acoustic waves in low-loss silicon nitride integrated circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acousto-optic modulation in photonic integrated circuits harness the applications that include signal processing, quantum photonics and microwave photonics. However, silicon nitride ($\rm{Si_3N_4}$), as a main-stream low-loss scalable photonic platform, suffers from the lack of piezoelectric effect and therefore the hybrid co-integration with other materials is always required for acousto-optic modulation. Here, we employed thermoelastic surface acoustic waves (SAW) in a 8 dB/m propagation loss $\rm{Si_3N_4}$ integrated circuits without adding extra materials. A phase modulation efficiency enhancement of 13.6 dB is realized with a multi-pass configuration. Furthermore, a single-sideband intermodal scattering with a suppression ratio of 8 dB is measured and an intensity modulation is observed by incorporating the phase modulation into a ring resonator spectral. This thermoelastic SAW technique, as an initial step of acousto-optic modulation in low-loss $\rm{Si_3N_4}$ platform, is promising for integrated microwave photonics and programmable photonics applications.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear quadrupole topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) represent a family of topological phases that go beyond the conventional bulkboundary correspondence. d-dimensional n-th order HOTIs maintain (d - n)-dimensional gapless boundary states (in particular, zero-dimensional corner states in the case of d = n = 2). HOTIs of the Wannier type cam be extended into the nonlinear regime. Another prominent class of HOTIs, in the form of multipole insulators, was investigated only in the linear regime, due to the challenge of simultaneously achieving both negative hopping and strong nonlinearity. Here we propose the concept of nonlinear quadrupole topological insulators (NLQTIs) and report their experimental realization in an electric circuit lattice. Quench-initiated dynamics gives rise to nonlinear topological corner states and topologically trivial corner solitons, in weakly and strongly nonlinear regimes, respectively. Furthermore, we reveal the formation of two distinct types of bulk solitons, one existing in the middle finite gap under the action of weak nonlinearity, and another one found in the semi-infinite gap under strong nonlinearity. This work realizes another member of the nonlinear HOTI family, suggesting directions for exploring novel solitons across a broad range of topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Kerr Soliton Self-Balancing from Kerr-Induced Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated frequency comb sources are a key enabling technology for frequency metrology applications. Their on-chip integration promises to bring metrology capacity outside of the lab, particularly since they can operate at low continuous-wave pump laser power in the dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) regime. Yet, such small foot-print and low power comes at a cost: higher noise and overall lower comb power. In particular, this translates to highly challenging detection and locking of the carrier-envelope offset, necessary for complete stabilization of the comb. Recently, Kerr-induced synchronization (KIS) of a DKS to a reference laser has been demonstrated as a tool for passive all-optical stabilization of DKS microcombs, with fundamental modification to the DKS and microcomb properties. Here, we demonstrate that the combination of additional power from the reference laser (now part of the DKS) and the KIS phase locking that pins the repetition rate together fundamentally alter the DKS, forcing an energy redistribution to maintain its center of mass. We demonstrate this self-balancing effect theoretically, which in a pure quadratic dispersion resonator leads to reference-dependent recoil. With higher-order dispersion through which the DKS yields phase-matched dispersive waves (DWs), we demonstrate that self-balancing increases the DW radiation, experimentally showing a 22 dB increase of comb teeth at 780 nm in an octave-spanning microcomb for efficient deployable carrier-envelope offset detection.</description>

      <title>Millimeter-scale rigid diamond probe for high sensitivity endoscopic-magnetometry applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetometry based on diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers has been extensively studied for applications requiring diverse capabilities, spanning from nanometer spatial resolution to subpicotesla sensitivity. Among various applications, diamond magnetometers can demonstrate high sensitivity magnetic sensing within millimeter-scale size for endoscopic applications. However, the trade-off between sensitivity and spatial resolution of diamond magnetometry makes it difficult to achieve such a probe. In this study, we present a millimeter-scale rigid diamond magnetometer probe with enhanced sensitivity via optimizing the optical design. By coupling the frustum diamond with the miniaturized compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) lens, we enhance the fluorescence collection efficiency by 37% within 4 mm diameter, and the achieved sensitivity is 200 pT/Hz1/2 based on the sample with the resonance linewidth of ~8 MHz. With this verified structure, endoscopes with mm-size probe and picotesla sensitivity can be projected for surgical and industrial applications in the future.</description>

      <title>Theory of direct measurement of the quantum pseudo-distribution via its characteristic function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for directly measuring the quantum mechanical pseudo-distribution of observable properties via its characteristic function. Vandermonde matrices of the eigenvalues play a central role in the theory. This proposal directly finds the pseudo-distribution using weak measurements of the generator of position moments (momentum translations). While the pseudo-distribution can be extracted from the data in a theory-agnostic way, it is shown that under quantum-mechanical formalism, the predicted pseudo-distribution is identified with the Kirkwood-Dirac pseudo-distribution. We discuss the construction of both the joint pseudo-distribution and a conditional pseudo-distribution, which is closely connected to weak-value physics. By permuting position and momentum measurements, we give a prescription to directly probe the canonical commutation relation and verify it for any quantum state. This work establishes the theory of a characteristic function approach to pseudo-distributions, as well as providing a constructive approach to measuring them directly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Moon's permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) are among the coldest places in the Solar System and are expected to become key landing sites for upcoming international space agency missions. Their proximity to peaks of perpetual solar power and potential resource richness makes them prime candidates for lunar exploration and future Moon bases. Here we propose to deploy a passive, ultrastable optical resonator in these regions that will enable laser systems with unprecedented phase-coherence. The unique physical environment of lunar PSRs greatly benefits the construction of a cryogenic monolithic silicon cavity that exhibits low $10^{-18}$ thermal noise-limited stability and coherence time exceeding 1 minute, more than a decade better than the current best terrestrial system. Such a stable laser will form a basic quantum technology infrastructure in space to serve many applications, including establishing a lunar time standard, building long-baseline optical interferometry, distribution of stable optical signals across networks of satellites, testing general relativity and gravitational physics, and forming the backbone for space-based quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Joint optical-digital design strategy for adaptive optics systems: application to wavelength selection for satellite imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive optics can be used to mitigate the effects of atmospheric turbulence on imaging systems, but the correction is only partial, and deconvolution is often required to improve the resolution. This results in entire optical/digital systems, which are traditionally designed sequentially, i.e. , the adaptive optics system is optimised first, and the restoration algorithms are designed a second time. Studies on optical/digital systems have shown that jointly optimizing the whole system is a better alternative. We propose to extend these co-design strategies to the design of an adaptive optics-assisted imaging system. We derive a simple criterion that takes into account the source properties and the entire optical/ digital system performance. To illustrate its interest, we use it to optimize the wavelength distribution between the wavefront sensor and the imaging camera. In addition, we explore the potential of using multiple imaging channels operating at different wavelengths as a means of making an imaging system robust to turbulence strength and source magnitude variations. Later, any parameter of the optical/digital system, if not the entire system itself, could be optimized this way.</description>

      <title>Optically tunable nonlinear mechanical damping in an optomechanical resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate optically tunable nonlinear mechanical damping in a cavity optomechanical system utilizing a partly resolved sideband regime. Optomechanical coupling provides a delayed nonlinear backaction to the mechanical modes, resulting in nonlinear mechanical damping. This optically induced nonlinear damping is observed in the frequency and time domains, and we show using both theory and experiment that it can be tuned via laser detuning. We also observe optically mediated cross-nonlinear damping between two mechanical modes: the amplitude of one mode modulates the damping of the other. The presented results show a fully tunable scheme of nonlinear mechanical damping that will be applicable to various non-trivial systems, governed by nonlinear, nonequilibrium, and non-Hermitian phenomena.</description>

      <title>Stability, degeneracy, and scalability of a 600-site cavity array microscope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical cavities are a foundational technology for controlling light-matter interactions. While interfacing a single cavity to either an atom or ensemble has become a standard tool, the advent of single atom control in large atomic arrays has spurred interest in a new frontier of ``many-cavity QED,'' featuring many independent resonators capable of separately addressing individual quantum emitters. In this fast-evolving landscape, the cavity array microscope was recently introduced -- employing free space intra-cavity optics to engineer a two-dimensional array of tightly spaced cavity TEM$_{00}$ modes with wavelength-scale waists, ideally suited for interfacing with atom arrays. Here we realize the next-generation of this architecture, achieving hundreds of degenerate cavity modes with improved, uniform finesse, and explore the technical features of the system which will enable further scalability. In particular, we study imperfections, including optical aberrations, field of view constraints, array non-degeneracies, and losses from optical elements. We identify the sensitivity to these various vectors and exposit the control knobs and techniques necessary to align and operate the system in a stable manner. Ultimately, we lay out a pathway towards operation with tens of thousands of independent cavities while maintaining compatibility with existing atom arrays, paving the way to myriad applications including highly parallelized remote entanglement generation, fast and non-destructive mid-circuit readout, and the implementation of hybrid atom-photon Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Phase-sensitive characterization of a quantum frequency converter by spectral interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an experimental technique for complete phase-sensitive characterization of arbitrary unitary spectral-temporal transformations of optical modes. Our method recovers the complex spectral transfer function, or Green's function, of a frequency converter by analyzing spectral interference in the response to a tunable bichromatic probe. We perform a proof-of-concept experiment on a frequency conversion module based on Bragg-scattering four-wave mixing in photonic crystal fiber. Our results validate our technique by recovering useful information in the phase of the Green's function, revealing the relative positions of regions of active frequency conversion and passive dispersive propagation within the module. Our work introduces a new approach to characterizing the performance of a variety of active devices with diverse applications in emerging quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantized Hall drift in a frequency-encoded photonic Chern insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantization of transport and its resilience to backscattering are key features for leveraging topological matter in applications that demand stringent noise mitigation, such as metrology and quantum information processing. Due to the bosonic nature of light, engineering such robust, ``one-way'' channels in synthetic photonic systems imposes the implementation of topological models with broken time-reversal symmetry; this is challenging since photons possess neither an electric charge nor a magnetic moment. Here, we propose and demonstrate a novel approach to realizing photonic Chern insulators - topological insulators with broken time-reversal symmetry - by encoding a Haldane-like model in the synthetic frequency dimension of an optical fiber loop platform. The bands' topology is assessed by reconstructing the Bloch states geometry across the Brillouin zone. We further highlight its consequences by measuring a driven-dissipative analogue of the quantized transverse Hall conductivity. Our results open new avenues for harnessing topologically protected light propagation in frequency-multiplexed photonic systems, with applications ranging from precision metrology to photonic quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic dynamics of nanoparticles optically trapped in moving fringe pattern in air-filled hollow-core fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report optical trapping and transport of nanoparticles in a moving interference pattern in hollow-core photonic crystal fiber at atmospheric pressure, when competition between trapping and drag forces causes the particle velocity to oscillate as it is momentarily captured and accelerated by each passing fringe, followed by release and deceleration by viscous forces. As a result the average particle velocity is lower than the fringe velocity. We refer to this phenomenon as drag-trapping. An analytical model of the resulting motion shows excellent agreement with experiment. Additional control is possible by introducing an imbalance in the backward and forward powers. The high precision of this new technique makes it of interest for example in characterizing nanoparticles, exploring viscous drag forces in different gases and liquids, and temperature sensing.</description>

      <title>Broadband on-chip SiN lasers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Broadband active materials are pivotal for advancing emerging technologies spanning on-chip optical interconnects, artificial intelligence, quantum systems and precision metrology. Current semiconductor gain media face bandwidth limitations; and Ttitanium-doped sapphire (Ti:sapphire), the most widely used broadband light-emitting material, covering the red to short-wave near-infrared (SW-NIR) spectrum, lacking emission in the entire visible range. Here, a mechanism for generating ultra-broadband gain is revealed, which utilizes defect and band-tail states in the bandgap, and balances cavity enhanced reabsorption and radiation. By leveraging this mechanism, the gain of on-chip integrated silicon nitride (SiN) is greatly enhanced at longer wavelengths, thereby achieving broadband emission, from blue light to SW-NIR (approximately 450 nm to 1000 nm), and mode-hop-free tuning about 1.6 nm at about 738 nm and amplification at about 532.3 nm was achieved. By leveraging the maturity, cost-effectiveness, and CMOS compatibility of SiN photonics, this work transitions SiN from conventional passive photonic material to ultrawide-band active medium, establishing a disruptive foundation for next generation visible and SW-NIR integrated photonic platforms.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Evanescent Wave Interaction for Enhanced Optical NO2 Detection with Carbon Nanotube-Coated Side-Polished Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evanescent-wave gas sensors employing side-polished optical fibers (SPFs) functionalized with nanomaterial coatings represent a promising platform for compact, sensitive detection. While single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films are recognized for their gas adsorption capabilities, their integration with photonic structures often overlooks complex light-matter interactions. In this work, we report a counterintuitive polarization-dependent response in an evanescent-wave NO2 sensor, fabricated by depositing aerosol-synthesized SWCNT thin films onto SPFs. The device demonstrates high performance, including a limit of detection of 400 ppb and stable operation in humid environments. However, its sensing behavior deviates strikingly from established models: upon NO2 exposure, transmitted light intensity increases for TM polarization but decreases for TE polarization, a phenomenon not attributable solely to changes in the intrinsic absorption of the SWCNTs. We pinpoint that the dominant mechanism is a gas-induced alteration of the SWCNT film's complex refractive index, which subsequently perturbs the evanescent field mode profile of the waveguide. Numerical simulations confirm that accounting for this mode-profile redistribution is essential to accurately describe the sensor's response. Revealed mechanism provides an important design framework for advanced evanescent-field sensors based on tunable nanomaterial claddings.</description>

      <title>Self-aligned optical microcomb emerging between octave separated lasers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical frequency combs (OFCs) are frequency rulers essential for precision metrology, next generation navigation, and testing of fundamental physics. Despite intense efforts, chip-integrated OFCs remain laboratory-bound, unable to fulfill their promise of compact and cost-effective deployment. While improvement in fabrication and integration are important, a conceptual limitation has fundamentally stymied progress: on-chip OFC architectures have aimed to miniaturize their table-top counterparts and relied on cascading outward from (i.e., spectrally broadening) a single pump. In integrated platforms, this approach does not readily allow for the generation of strong and low-noise octave-spaced signals that are crucially needed for robust zero-frequency offset detection. Here, we overcome this limitation via an architectural inversion where an optical microcomb forms by filling the spectrum between two octave-separated pump lasers. The two pumps generate a parametrically driven cavity soliton (PDCS) in an integrated $\chi^{(3)}$ resonator, which robustly self-aligns to (i.e., synchronizes with) the pump lasers across multiple foundry-fabricated devices and operating configurations. This produces a single octave-spanning comb extending from telecom to visible wavelengths, whose zero-frequency offset is completely defined by the two harmonically-related pump lasers, and can therefore be reliably detected and stabilized. We showcase our platform's capabilities by executing all of the three core tasks of OFC metrology: optical frequency synthesis, low-noise millimeter-wave generation, and integrated optical clock readout, using the same self-aligned microcomb with only its input locks changed.</description>

      <title>Strongly chirped dissipative solitons in normal and anomalous dispersion regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the strongly chirped dissipative solitons of the cubic-quintic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation and identify the parameter domains that support robust stationary pulse solutions. Using algebraic solvability conditions, we map the existence regions for the two branches of the chirped solution in the three-dimensional space of control parameters and clarify how these regions transform between the normal- and anomalous-dispersion regimes. A central outcome is that the dissipative soliton resonance arises naturally on the energy-scalable branch. In the normal group-velocity dispersion region, it follows directly from the admissibility constraints, while for the anomalous group-velocity dispersion, it appears only once the resonance locus intersects an adiabatic existence window, which requires sufficiently strong quintic self-phase modulation. These results provide a pathway toward high-energy femtosecond pulse oscillators. We also outline a consistent thermodynamic perspective on the phase-space structure obtained, emphasizing analogies with phase transitions and critical behavior in dissipative nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>A physics-inspired nonlinear momentum method for gradient descent with applications to inverse photonic design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, a nonlinear momentum method is introduced to enhance the convergence performance of momentum-based gradient optimization algorithms. Classical momentum methods, such as the Heavy Ball method, can be viewed as a dynamical system with quadratic kinetic energy and linear damping. By extending this analogy to non-Newtonian dynamical systems, we construct a Hamiltonian framework for optimization problems. In this framework, nonlinear kinetic energy and nonlinear damping effects naturally emerge. It provides a more flexible and physically interpretable mechanism for optimization algorithms. Specifically, we employ an anharmonic kinetic energy function to capture the inertial effects of accumulated gradient information during the optimization process, while the nonlinear damping mechanism effectively regulates the contribution of momentum during convergence. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method achieves faster convergence compared to classical momentum algorithms, making it particularly suitable for inverse design tasks. Moreover, the Hamiltonian based algorithmic framework may offer physical insights for the development of efficient physics-inspired optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Generation of mechanical cat-like states via optomagnomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an optomagnomechanical approach for preparing a cat-like superposition state of mechanical motion. Our protocol consists of two steps and is based on the magnomechanical system where the magnetostrictively induced displacement further couples to an optical cavity mode via radiation pressure. We first prepare a squeezed mechanical state by driving the magnomechanical system with two microwave pulses. We then switch off the microwave drives and send a weak red-detuned optical pulse to the optical cavity to weakly activate the optomechanical anti-Stokes scattering. We show that $k$ phonons can be subtracted from the prepared squeezed thermal state, conditioned on the detection of $k$ anti-Stokes photons from the cavity output field, which prepares the mechanical motion in a cat-like state. The work provides a new avenue for preparing mechanical superposition states by combining opto- and magnomechanics and may find applications in the study of macroscopic quantum states and the test of collapse theories.</description>

Abstract: We develop a quantum theory for the scattering of squeezed coherent light by a dissipative dielectric slab. Using the Green-function quantization approach, we derive the transformation of the field quadratures and show how dispersion, absorption, and multiple reflections distort the incident squeezing. We find that the slab can selectively attenuate or amplify quadrature noise depending on the slab parameters and provide expressions for the output power spectra.</description>
