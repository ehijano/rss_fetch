      <title>At the Edge of Uncertainty: Decoding the Cosmological Constant value with Bose-Einstein Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that the observed value of the cosmological constant may be explained by a fundamental uncertainty in the spacetime metric, which arises when combining the principle that mass and energy curve spacetime with the quantum uncertainty associated with particle localization. Since the position of a quantum particle cannot be sharply defined, the gravitational influence of such particles leads to intrinsic ambiguity in the formation of spacetime geometry. Recent experimental studies suggest that gravitational effects persist down to length scales of approximately $10^{-5}$ m, while quantum coherence and macroscopic quantum phenomena such as Bose-Einstein condensation and superfluidity also manifest at similar scales. Motivated by these findings, we identify a length scale of spacetime uncertainty, $L_Z \sim 2.2 \times 10^{-5}$ m, which corresponds to the geometric mean of the Planck length and the radius of the observable universe. We argue that this intermediate scale may act as an effective cutoff in vacuum energy calculations. Furthermore, we explore the interpretation of dark energy as a Bose-Einstein distribution with a characteristic reduced wavelength matching this uncertainty scale. This approach provides a potential bridge between cosmological and quantum regimes and offers a phenomenologically motivated perspective on the cosmological constant problem.</description>

      <title>Finite geometry and black hole stability: Embedding discrete space into classical manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The issue of defining the volume of black holes has significant implications for quantum gravity. Drawing on concepts from quantum theory and general relativity, several motivations for introducing discreteness in geometry can be proposed. However, to seriously consider any proposal for a discrete geometry, the identification problem and the challenge of defining a distance function within such a geometry must be addressed. This paper proposes the faithful embedding of sets representing spaces in finite geometry -- a specific type of discrete geometry characterized by a finite set of points -- into Riemannian manifolds as a solution to these problems. Similar to a classical measuring apparatus that interprets and understands quantum results in classical terms, classical geometry serves as a bridge between the discreteness of the physical world and our continuous understanding of the properties of space. In this framework, the volumetric density of information contained within a black hole is established, providing a consistent volume for the Schwarzschild black hole observed by all observers. Furthermore, the study finds that the minimum volume of the Schwarzschild black hole is non-zero. This fact implies that a black hole can only evaporate until its event horizon radius reaches the Planck length, signifying that black hole remnants are stable. Consequently, the total collapse of a black hole is prevented by the finite nature of the geometry describing physical space.</description>

      <title>Dust stars in the minimal exponential measure model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the existence of horizonless compact object solutions supported by dust in the Minimal Exponential Measure (MEMe) model, a theory which modifies the couplings between gravity and matter without introducing dynamical degrees of freedom. For a perfect fluid source, the field equations for the MEMe model can be rewritten as the Einstein field equations sourced by a perfect fluid with a transformed equation of state, which can endow a sufficiently dense cloud of dust with an effective pressure. The resulting dust-supported horizonless compact objects can have masses below $\sim 10^{-11}~M_\odot$, making them suitable as MACHOs comprising a significant mass fraction for dark matter. A necessary condition for the existence of these compact object solutions is that the single free parameter in the MEMe model is positive-valued. Additionally, we find that this positive sign for the parameter can provide a mechanism for suppressing the formation of (primordial) black holes from the gravitational collapse of matter below a certain mass scale.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Regular Black Holes in Anti-de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct regular black holes with anti-de Sitter asymptotics in theories incorporating infinite towers of higher-order curvature corrections in any dimension $D \ge 5$. We find that regular black branes are generically inner-extremal, potentially evading instabilities typically associated with inner horizons. Considering minimally coupled matter, we establish general criteria for the existence of singularity-free solutions. We analyze solutions coupled to Maxwell and nonlinear (Born--Infeld and RegMax) electrodynamics, demonstrating in the latter case the first examples of fully regular gravitational and electromagnetic fields for all parameter values. Here, we find that the ratio of the gravitational mass to the electrostatic self-energy determines whether the regular core is de Sitter or anti-de Sitter. We perform a detailed analysis of the black hole thermodynamics and show that the equation of state exhibits features akin to those of fluids with a finite molecular volume induced by the regularization parameter.</description>

      <title>Null orbits and shadows in the Ernst-Wild geometry: insights for black holes immersed in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the null geodesics, in particular the stable and unstable light rings and shadows, of a Kerr-Newman black hole immersed in an asymptotically uniform magnetic field as described by the Ernst-Wild (Melvin-Kerr-Newman) spacetime. Through numerical ray tracing, we demonstrate that both the black hole rotation and the magnetized Melvin geometry impact the light rings and shadows non-trivially and in compensating ways. In addition, we use a perturbative expansion in the magnetic field B to analyze the deviation of the observable shadow relative to the Kerr result analytically, and determine connections between Lyapunov exponents for light ring instabilities and quasinormal modes in the eikonal limit.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity cannot be both consistent and complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General relativity, despite its profound successes, fails as a complete theory due to presence of singularities. While it is widely believed that quantum gravity has the potential to be a complete theory, in which spacetime consistently emerges from quantum degrees of freedom through computational algorithms, we demonstrate that this goal is fundamentally unattainable. Godel's theorems establish that no theory based on computational algorithms can be both complete and consistent, while Tarski's undefinability theorem demonstrates that even within quantum gravity, or any computational framework, a fully consistent internal determination of true propositions is impossible. Chaitin's incompleteness theorem further reinforces this conclusion, revealing intrinsic limits to any computational theory. We discuss some possible consequences for descriptions of physical systems, and note that a non-algorithmic approach is essential for any theory of everything.</description>

      <title>Coherent injection of magnetic noise and its impact on gravitational-wave searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlated noise sources, particularly magnetic noise, form a risk to future gravitational-wave searches aimed at detecting the gravitational-wave background. Potential noise contamination is investigated by making noise projections which typically rely on an accurate measurement of the coupling strength of the noise to the detector. To make these projections, we inject, for the first time, broadband, coherent magnetic noise between two gravitational-wave detectors, LIGO Hanford and LIGO Livingston, separated by several thousands of kilometers. We describe the noise injection as well as its impact on the analysis pipelines and investigate the accuracy of noise projection techniques used in the past decade. Finally, we present a proof-of-concept demonstration of noise subtraction using Wiener filtering, while also highlighting potential risks associated with this method. This unique data set with correlated noise caused by magnetic field fluctuations in two gravitational-wave detectors, as well as in an array of witness sensors, provides an excellent testing ground for additional future studies. Ultimately, this study demonstrates that Wiener filtering is effective and can be applied in the eventual detection of the gravitational-wave background by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration.</description>

      <title>ADM, BMS, and some puzzling interconnections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise connection between the ADM and BMS formalisms is still far from being fully understood. It leads superficially to some puzzles whose resolution can provide new interesting physical insights. One example concerns the claimed local-in-angle conservation of energy in a gravitational scattering process, whose physical meaning I will try to clarify in an explicit example. As my main topic, I will sketch my own understanding of how a recent saga on the definition of angular momentum, its loss, and its radiation, appears to have found its way to a happy ending by appealing to some non-trivial connections between ADM and BMS quantities in asymptotically flat and stationary spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Black holes immersed in modified Chaplygin-like dark fluid and cloud of strings: geodesics, shadows, and images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates a black hole surrounded by a cloud of strings and a cosmological dark fluid characterized by a modified Chaplygin-like equation of state (MCDF), $p=A\rho-B/\rho^{\beta}$. We analyze its geodesic structure, shadow, and optical appearance. Analysis of the effective potential and epicyclic frequencies reveals that the existence of innermost/outermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs/OSCOs) for timelike particles is controlled by the parameters of the MCDF and the cloud of strings. The behavior of orbital conserved quantities and the Keplerian frequency are also examined. By equating the influence of the MCDF on the spacetime metric at spatial infinity with that of a cosmological constant, we constrain the MCDF parameters using the observed shadow radii of Sgr A* and M87*. We investigate the effects of the cloud of strings and MCDF on the black hole's shadows and optical images, assuming various thin disk accretion profiles. Using the method developed by Wald and collaborators, light trajectories are classified by their impact parameters into direct emission, the lensing ring, and the photon ring. The presence of OSCOs can lead to the existence of outer edges in the direct emission and lensing ring images. Observed brightness primarily originates from direct emission, with a minor contribution from the lensing ring, while the photon ring's contribution is negligible due to extreme demagnification. The influence of the cloud of strings and MCDF parameters on all results is analyzed throughout the study.</description>

      <title>Geodesics and scalar perturbations of deformed AdS-Schwarzschild black hole with a global monopole surrounded by a quintessence field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive investigation of a deformed AdS-Schwarzschild black hole with a global monopole surrounded by a quintessence field. Our analysis focuses on the geodesic motion of both null and timelike particles, enabling precise determination of the photon sphere and quantification of forces acting on photon particles. We systematically examine how the deformation parameter, control parameter, global monopole parameter, and quintessence field parameter influence the energy, angular momentum, and angular velocities of test particles in circular orbits within the equatorial plane. Additionally, we derive and analyze the perturbative potentials for scalar and electromagnetic fields, demonstrating how these parameters modify their structural profiles. Through time-domain integration, we explore the evolution of scalar and electromagnetic perturbations, revealing distinct phases of transient behavior and quasinormal ringing. Finally, we investigate the emission rates of this black hole, establishing connections between its shadow radius and thermal characteristics. Our findings reveal that the global monopole parameter, deformation parameter and quintessence field enhance black hole stability by reducing emission rates, while the control parameter, which helps avoid central singularities, accelerates evaporation by increasing emission.</description>

      <title>Fingerprints of Loop Quantum Gravity Black Holes with Quintessence Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate a static, spherically symmetric black hole (BH) within the framework of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) surrounded by quintessence field. Our comprehensive analysis shows that the interplay between quantum corrections and exotic matter produces unique spacetime features, most notably a triple-horizon structure for specific parameter combinations. We derive the metric function incorporating both LQG parameters ($\alpha$, $B$) and quintessence parameters ($c$, $w$), analyzing its implications for horizon structure through embedding diagrams. We examine null and timelike geodesics, calculating photon spheres, effective potentials, and orbital dynamics. Our study demonstrates how quantum and quintessence parameters affect BH shadow size and shape, offering potential observational signatures. Through scalar perturbation analysis, we compute quasinormal modes (QNMs) frequencies, confirming the stability of these hybrid BHs while identifying distinctive spectral characteristics. Finally, using the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) theorem modified approach, we derive an analytical expression for gravitational deflection angles, showing a hierarchical structure of contributions from classical, quintessence, and quantum effects at different distance scales.</description>

      <title>The role of non-metricity on neutrino behavior in bumblebee gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the context of bumblebee gravity, this work explores how non-metricity alters the behavior and propagation of neutrinos. Our analysis is based on the black hole configuration introduced in Ref. [1], focusing on how the spacetime deformation affects some neutrino-related processes. Three primary aspects are fundamentally taken into account: the modification in the energy deposition rate stemming from neutrino-antineutrino annihilation, the alterations in the oscillation phase caused by the background geometry, and the role of lensing effects on the transition probabilities among neutrino flavors. Complementing the analytical approach, numerical evaluations of oscillation probabilities are performed within a two-flavor scenario, accounting for both inverted and normal mass ordering configurations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we analyze the gravitational deflection for a light beam in the weak and strong field regimes for the gravitational analogue geometry of an acoustic black hole (ABH) and acoustic black-bounce (ABB). Motivationally, the first spacetime arises as an exact solution of the field equations for gravitational black holes (BHs) in an Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory (EsGB) \cite{3}. In contrast, the second model arises from the combination of phantom scalar field and nonlinear electrodynamics in general relativity (GR) \cite{INTRO24}. We construct analytical expressions for the angular deflection of light in both limits and, from them, analyze the construction of the observables, which allow us to relate theoretical models to observational data. We compare these observables and show how much they differ from those obtained in the Schwarzschild solution.</description>

      <title>Measuring the cosmic dipole with golden dark sirens in the era of next-generation ground-based gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tensions between cosmological parameter measurements from the early-universe and the late-universe datasets offer an exciting opportunity to explore new physics, if not accounted for unknown systematics. Apart from the well-known Hubble tension, a tension up to $4.9 \sigma$ in the cosmic dipole has also been reported. While the cosmic dipole is mainly induced by the observer's kinetic motion, an intrinsic dipole arising from the anisotropy of the universe could also play an import role. Such an intrinsic anisotropy can be a dark energy mimicker that causes the observed accelerating expansion of the universe. As a new and powerful tool, gravitational waves can serve as an independent probe to the cosmic dipole. A useful type of events to achieve this is the "golden dark sirens", which are near-by well-localized compact binary coalescences whose host galaxies can be identified directly due to precise localization. By forecasting golden dark sirens obtained from 10-year observations using different possible detector networks in the future, we find that the standard LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors are not able to detect a meaningful amount of golden dark sirens, and hence next-generation ground-based detectors are essential to obtain a strong constraint on the cosmic dipole. In particular, we find that a three-detector network consisting of more than one next-generation detectors can yield a constraint on the cosmic dipole at an order of $10^{-3}$ when jointly measured with $H_0$. Moreover, a constraint on the cosmic dipole at an order of $10^{-4}$ can be achieved when fixing $H_0$.</description>

      <title>Classical and Quantum cosmology for two scalar field Brans-Dicke type theory: A Noether Symmetry approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper deals with a cosmological model containing two scalar fields which can be considered as an extension of the Brans-Dicke scalar field model. Due to highly coupled non linear field equations, Noether Symmetry analysis has been imposed and as a result the Lagrangian as well as the field equations become much simple in form to have the classical solutions. The relevant cosmological parameters are analyzed graphically. Finally, quantum cosmology has been studied by constructing the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and the solution of this second order partial differential equation has been done using this symmetry analysis.</description>

      <title>Stark Energy Shifts due to Quantum Gravity in RGUP Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Stark effect in the hydrogen atom under an external electric field, incorporating relativistic generalized uncertainty principle (RGUP) corrections within Minkowskian spacetime and calculate the upper bound on $\beta$ the RGUP parameter. Employing RGUP algebra and the Stetsko-Tkachuk approximation, we derive modifications to the energy spectrum for degenerate and non-degenerate states. The perturbed Hamiltonian, modified by RGUP, enfold quantum gravitational effects. Our results reveal quantum gravitational corrections to the Stark energy spectrum in the relativistic regime, with energy shifts for non-degenerate ($n=1$) and degenerate ($n \neq 1$) cases showing additional terms proportional to $\beta$. These findings reduce to standard Stark effect results and non-relativistic GUP frameworks in the limits $\beta\rightarrow 0$ and $c \rightarrow \infty $, establishing our model as a generalized framework for analyzing minimal length effects in relativistic quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian renormalisation IX. U(1)**3 quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous works in this series we focussed on Hamiltonian renormalisation of free field theories in all spacetime dimensions or interacting theories in spacetime dimensions lower than four. In this paper we address the Hamiltonian renormalisation of the U(1)**3 model for Euclidian general relativity in four spacetime dimensions which is self-interacting.
  The Hamiltonian flow needs as an input a choice of *-algebra and corresponding representation thereof or state on it at each resolution scale. If one uses as input the algebras and states that were used in the recent exact solutions of this model, then one finds that the flow is rapidly fixed pointed. </description>

      <title>Thermodynamic parameters of fluids on conformally connected spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local thermal equilibrium generally implies the absence of heat flux within a fluid. We find the relations between a set of thermodynamic variables of a fluid on a general spacetime and those defined on a conformally connected spacetime, assuming both descriptions are at thermal equilibrium. The scaling relations appear to be consistent with Dicke's heuristic argument and the previous analysis done on the basis of various restrictions. Within the present framework, it is observed that the satisfaction of Klein's law on one of the spacetimes implies its validity on the other one. Moreover, our analysis bypasses some of the imposed restrictions and thereby reveals the generality of the earlier predictions. These relations are further shown to preserve the geometric structure of thermodynamics, known as geometrothermodynamics, such that the associated metrics on two conformally connected spacetimes are themselves conformally related. This provides an alternative consistency check as well as a distinct geometric interpretation of the relations.</description>

      <title>Linear analysis of I-C-Love universal relations for neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are excellent laboratories for testing gravity theories as they are strongly self-gravitating bodies and have rich observational phenomena. However, strong-gravity effects in NS could be degenerate with their equation of state (EOS) which is largely unknown. Fortunately, there exist the so-called universal relations among the NS macroscopic quantities that are found to be insensitive to the underlying EOS. Studying the origin of these relations can lead to a better understanding of NSs and the gravitational interaction. We develop a new perspective of view to analyze the I-C and I-Love universal relations for NSs. At the linear order, we separate the deviation of the universal relations into two parts, where one is the EOS perturbation while the other only depends on the background star structures. The smallness of the second part fully determines the universality of the relation irrespective of the form of the first part. We discuss the validity of our linear approximation when considering the difference among realistic EOSs. Our study can be regarded as a new frame for quantitative representation of the universality and may provide new insights to the universal relations of NSs.</description>

      <title>Fractional Einstein field equations in $2+1$ dimensional spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new fractional derivative that modifies the conventional Riemann-Liouville operator to obtain a set of fractional Einstein field equations within a 2+1 dimensional spacetime by assuming a static and circularly symmetric metric. The main reason for introducing this new derivative stems from addressing the divergence encountered during the construction of Christoffel symbols when using the Caputo operator and the appearance of unwanted terms when using the Riemann-Liouville derivative because of the well-known fact that its action on constants does not vanish, as expected. The key innovation of the new operator ensures that the derivative of a constant is zero. As a particular application, we explore whether the Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black hole metric is a solution to fractional Einstein equations. Our results reveal that for values of the fractional parameter close to one, the effective matter sector corresponds to a charged BTZ solution with an anisotropic cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Observational Signatures of Janis-Newman-Winicour Strongly Naked Singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the unique observational signatures of accretion onto a Janis-Newman-Winicour (JNW) strongly naked singularity, particularly in the absence of a photon sphere. The surrounding spacetime of such a singularity exhibits pronounced reflective properties, causing light rays traveling in its vicinity to undergo reflection and produce paired imaging trajectories in both accretion disk and hot spot models. Our simulations reveal that this reflection effect generates additional images in the gravitational lensing patterns and significantly alters the temporal brightness profiles of the lensed images. These reflection-induced paired images, together with their inclination-dependent behavior, offer distinct observational signatures that could potentially distinguish a JNW strongly naked singularity from a black hole based on future high-resolution observations.</description>

      <title>Black Holes with Global Monopoles in 4D Noncommutative Einstein Gauss Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we construct an exact spherically symmetric black hole solution with a global monopole in the context of four-dimensional noncommutative Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We modeled the spacetime noncommutativity via a Lorentzian-smeared mass distribution. Then we study the horizon structure and find that this black hole can have two configurations: one degenerate horizon or no horizon, depending on the black hole parameters. We also analyze thermodynamics and thermal stability by computing the Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity. Our analysis reveals that the Hawking temperature and entropy acquire corrections from the noncommutative parameter $\Theta$, the energy scale of symmetry breaking $\eta$, and the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant $\alpha$. The heat capacity exhibits divergences that signal second-order phase transitions. Thereafter, we study the black hole shadow employing the null geodesics and the Hamiltonian-Jacobi equation. Our results show that the shadow decreases with increasing $\Theta$ or $\alpha$ and increases with increasing $\eta$. Finally, we analyze quasinormal modes or scalar perturbations, we compute them via the 6th-order WKB method, and compare them to the shadow radius methods in the eikonal limit.</description>

      <title>Polarization modes of gravitational waves in general symmetric teleparallel gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the polarization modes of gravitational waves within the most general symmetric teleparallel gravity theory that allows for second-order field equations We consider both scenarios where test particles either carry or do not carry a hypermomentum charge. Our findings reveal the existence of tensor, vector, and scalar modes of gravitational waves. Firstly, the theory supports the + and $\times$ tensor modes propagating at the speed of light. Secondly, in the case where particles do not carry hypermomentum, vector modes propagating at the speed of light exist only within a very specific parameter space. However, when particles do carry hypermomentum, there are two shear modes that propagate at the speed of light, while the vector-$x$ and vector-$y$ modes emerge only under very specific conditions. Thirdly, in the presence of hypermomentum, there is always a longitudinal mode propagating at the speed of light. The universal existence of the shear modes and the longitudinal mode in the presence of hypermomentum is a key feature of symmetric teleparallel gravity, distinguishing it from the Riemannian framework through gravitational wave polarization detection. We also analyze the polarization modes in two widely studied special theories: $f(Q)$ theory and quadratic non-metricity theory. Our study reveals that, within the $f(Q)$ gravity framework, it is crucial to assume that matter fields are independent of the connection, as any dependence would lead to unphysical results.</description>

      <title>The SXS Collaboration's third catalog of binary black hole simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a major update to the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) Collaboration's catalog of binary black hole simulations. Using highly efficient spectral methods implemented in the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC), we have nearly doubled the total number of binary configurations from 2,018 to 3,756. The catalog now densely covers the parameter space with precessing simulations up to mass ratio $q=8$ and dimensionless spins up to $|\vec{\chi}|\le0.8$ with near-zero eccentricity. The catalog also includes some simulations at higher mass ratios with moderate spin and more than 250 eccentric simulations. We have also deprecated and rerun some simulations from our previous catalog (e.g., simulations run with a much older version of SpEC or that had anomalously high errors in the waveform). The median waveform difference (which is similar to the mismatch) between resolutions over the simulations in the catalog is $4\times10^{-4}$. The simulations have a median of 22 orbits, while the longest simulation has 148 orbits. We have corrected each waveform in the catalog to be in the binary's center-of-mass frame and exhibit gravitational-wave memory. We estimate the total CPU cost of all simulations in the catalog to be 480,000,000 core-hours. We find that using spectral methods for binary black hole simulations is over 1,000 times more efficient than much shorter finite-difference simulations of comparable accuracy. The full catalog is publicly available through the sxs Python package and at https://data.black-holes.org .</description>

      <title>On modified Hawking radiation under quantum gravity effects in the fermion sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, after briefly discussing the Hawking radiation (HR) as a quantum tunneling, we emphasize that special care must be taken when computing temperature corrections in the presence of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV), particularly by ensuring consistency between the modified dispersion relation and the gamma matrix structure used to describe fermions that are tunneling. We present a consistent implementation of such corrections in static, spherically symmetric black hole (BH) spacetimes. Our results show that introducing terms that increase/decrease the energy in the dispersion relation--originally determined by Lorentz invariance--leads to a corresponding increase/decrease in the Hawking temperature, when the dispersion relation is uniquely determined. We also determined the changes in Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for the Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Schwarzschild BHs, including corrections from LIV scenarios.</description>

      <title>Holographic entanglement entropy and complexity for the cosmological braneworld model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent study \cite{Park:2020jio}, the time-dependent entanglement entropy of the universe undergoing expansion according to various power laws has been analyzed within the framework of the braneworld model. The results of the entanglement entropy in that paper take into account only the effects of a radiation and a matter-dominated universe. In this work, we have computed the time-dependent entanglement entropy and complexity of the FLRW universe in the presence of different matter sources (radiation, matter and some exotic matter). In contrast to the approach in \cite{Park:2020jio}, all the calculations in this paper have been carried out in a perturbative manner in the framework of braneworld model of cosmology. According to this model, our universe is situated on a brane and different matter sources appear on the brane due to the back reaction of different $p$-brane gas configurations in the bulk spacetime. By considering the bulk spacetime as a black brane geometry, we have considered different blackening factors corresponding to radiation, matter, and exotic matter and calculated entanglement entropy and complexity holographically. In the braneworld model, the universe's expansion is described by the brane's time-dependent radial position. This position is determined using the second Israel junction condition for various matter sources. The time evolution of entanglement entropy and complexity is then obtained by substituting this brane position. We have also shown the dependence of entanglement entropy and complexity on the cosmological time for all the different matter-dominated universes in the early and late time eras. Even though the calculations of holographic entanglement entropy and complexity are done perturbatively, the results remain consistent with those of \cite{Park:2020jio}.</description>

      <title>Quintessence Dark Energy from non-perturbative Higgs-Yang-Mills mass gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the possibility that dark energy arises from a strongly-coupled Higgs-Yang-Mills set of interacting fields in the non-perturbative regime. We choose the simplest $SU(2)$ representation, which is compatible with the Cosmological Principle. One of the components of the Higgs doublet act as an effective quintessence scalar field interacting with both gravity and the gauge field. We devise a multiple time scale approach to solve the equations of motion through a hierarchy of the couplings, utilizing exact solutions in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions. We observe that the time scale of variation of the Hubble constant is the slowest one, while, for the scalar field, assuming that its self-coupling is smaller than the coupling of the gauge field, represents an intermediate time scale. From the consistency of the Friedmann equations, we show how the effect of the scalar field is to give origin to dark energy with a proper equation of state corrected by a very small time-dependent term. Finally, agreement with cosmological data for the dark energy density is shown without relying on the fine-tuning of the physical constants of the model.</description>

      <title>Narrowing RIFT: Focused simulation-based-inference for interpreting exceptional GW sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Rapid Iterative FiTting (RIFT) parameter inference algorithm provides a simulation-based inference approach to efficient, highly-parallelized parameter inference for GW sources. Previous editions of RIFT have conservatively optimized for robust inference about poorly constrained observations. In this paper, we summarize algorithm enhancements and operating point choices to enable inference for more exceptional compact binaries. Using the previously-reported RIFT/asimov interface to efficiently perform analyses on events with reproducible settings consistent with past work, we demonstrate that the latest version of RIFT can efficiently analyze events with multiple costly models including the effects of precession or eccentricity.</description>

      <title>Holographic explorations of regular black holes in pure gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been recently established in \textit{Phys.Lett.B 861 (2025) 139260} that regular, asymptotically flat black holes exist in pure gravity theories in dimension greater than four. We extend this result to asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spacetimes and perform bottom-up holographic explorations: Hawking-Page phase transitions, quasinormal modes of black holes providing decay times of excitations in the finite temperature conformal field theory and U-shaped string probes leading to the quark-antiquark potential in the dual field theory. The gravitational action contains a bared, negative cosmological constant and an Einstein-Hilbert term, supplemented by an infinite series of higher-curvature terms of the family known as Quasi-topological (QT) Lagrangians, leading to a lapse function in terms of infinite series which can be resumed to an analytic function for different coupling choices. The QT terms are defined as those satisfying a Birkhoff's theorem and possessing a holographic c-function, and exist at all orders in the curvature, for arbitrary dimension greater than four. Besides presenting the general formulae, we explore the physics of three specific cases leading to Hayward, Dymnikova and Bardeen-like regular black holes. We also found the field redefinition that permits recasting the $\alpha'^3 W^4$ correction of Type IIB supergravity on $\mathcal{A}_5\times S^5$ as a series of QT terms. Before finishing, beyond holography, we also provide an extended thermodynamic setup, that via variations of the dimensionful $\alpha$ and $L$, allow obtaining the Euler relation between finite thermodynamical quantities for the black hole of the theory.</description>

      <title>Root-$T\overline{T}$ deformed CFT partition functions at large central charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the partition function of 2d CFT under root-$T\bar{T}$ deformation. We demonstrate that the deformed partition function satisfies a flow equation. At large central charge sector, the deformed partition function reduces to a redefinition of the modular parameters, which preserves modular invariance under the deformed parameters. We then derive a Cardy-like formula for the asymptotic density of states using modular bootstrap trick. In the context of AdS/CFT, it was proposed the root-$T\bar{T}$ deformed CFT corresponds to the AdS$_3$ with certain deformed boundary condition. We show the deformed BTZ black hole is a quotient of hyperbolic space. In terms of Chern-Simons formulation, we compute the root-$T\bar{T}$ deformed BTZ black hole entropy and find that it obeys a Cardy-like formula, which is consistent with the modular bootstrap result. Furthermore, employing the Wilson spool technique, we compute the one-loop partition functions for the root-$T\bar{T}$ deformed AdS$_3$ geometry. Our results reveal an exact match between one-loop gravitational partition function and the large $c$ expansion of root-$T\bar{T}$ deformed CFT partition function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comparison between translation charges for several Lagrangians for the $\kappa$-deformed complex scalar field using the canonical method. The Lagrangians are shown to be related by charge conjugation and twisted cyclicity, and these relationships are reflected in their conserved charges. The Lagrangian corresponding to the results obtained in arXiv:2011.09188 and arXiv:2201.10191 is identified, providing an explanation for the observed loss of charge conjugation symmetry under boosts.</description>

      <title>On the symmetry energy expansion and the peak value of the bulk viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The symmetry energy expansion is a useful way to parameterize the properties of dense matter near nuclear saturation density, and much work has been done to connect physical quantities like the neutron star radius and the core-crust transition density to the symmetry energy parameters. In this work, I connect the weak-interaction-driven bulk viscosity in neutron-proton-electron ($npe$) matter to the symmetry parameters by calculating the susceptibilities of dense matter in terms of the symmetry energy. I use this result to calculate the resonant-peak value of the bulk viscosity as a function of density, finding that it strongly depends on $L$, as does the minimum bulk-viscous dissipation timescale. Also resulting from this calculation is a formula for finding the conformal points of the zero-temperature equation of state. Finally, I determine for which values of the symmetry parameters the maximum r-mode stable rotation frequency of an $npe$-matter neutron star is smaller than the Kepler frequency, in the high-temperature conditions where bulk viscosity is the dominant dissipation mechanism.</description>

      <title>Holographic composite Higgs model and gravitational waves produced during first order phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The soft-wall holographic composite Higgs model assumes first-order phase transition from the dynamical inner symmetry breaking. This research focuses on the implications of the semi-analytical perturbative solution of the dual 5-dimensional theory as an effective description of the strongly coupled composite Higgs sector. We clarify the thermodynamical description and gravitational waves spectrum produced during the phase transition, which were previously numerically estimated. Besides, we investigate the limits of the applicability of our solution within the thin-wall approximation and quasiclassical approach in terms of the dual theory, that correspond to the strongly coupled regime of composite Higgs model. Our semi-analytic framework provides description of the strong first-order phase transition within the runaway scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) favor a higher value of the scalar spectral index $n_s$ compared to the Planck data, challenging many well-established inflationary models. In this work, we investigate the viability of polynomial potential inflation in light of the latest ACT data, focusing on the quadratic ($n=2$) and cubic ($n=3$) models. By exploring the parameter space and deriving constraints on the model coefficients, we find that the cubic model can provide a good fit to the data, while the quadratic model struggles to simultaneously accommodate the ACT data and the requirement of sufficient inflation. Our findings show that higher-order polynomial potentials remain viable for describing cosmic inflation, demonstrating how recent precision measurements continue to refine our understanding of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>What Price Fiber Bundle Substantivalism? On How to Avoid Holes in Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a mathematically foundational level, our most successful physical theories (gauge field theories and general-relativistic theories) are formulated in a framework based on the differential geometry of connections on principal bundles. After reviewing the essentials of this framework, we articulate the generalized hole and point-coincidence arguments, examining how they weight on a substantivalist position towards bundle spaces. This question, then, is considered in light of the Dressing Field Method, which allows a manifestly invariant reformulation of gauge field theories and general-relativistic theories, making their conceptual structure more transparent: it formally implements the point-coincidence argument and thus allows to define (dressed) fields and (dressed) bundle spaces immune to hole-type arguments.</description>

Abstract: In previous works in this series we focussed on Hamiltonian renormalisation of free field theories in all spacetime dimensions. In this paper we address the Hamiltonian renormalisation of the self-interacting scalar field in two spacetime dimensions with polynomial potential, called P(Phi,2). We consider only the finite volume case.
  The P(Phi,2) theory is one of the few interacting QFT's that can be rigorously constructed non-perturbatively. We find that our Hamiltonian renormalisation flow finds this theory indeed as a fixed point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In holographic quantum gravity, Euclidean pieces of the spacetime appear in the large N limit as representing semi-classical states of the theory. In this essay, we argue that the duals of entangled states are spacetime geometries that contain Euclidean regions in order to preserve classical connectivity. Thereby, the proposal is to extend the ER-EPR conjecture to regimes whether wormholes (Einstein-Rosen bridges) become unstable but the entangled structure of the dual state persists.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves in Palatini $f(R)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial scalar perturbations that reenter the horizon after inflation may induce a second-order Gravitational Wave spectrum with information about the primordial Universe on scales inaccessible to Cosmic Microwave Background experiments. In this work, we develop a general framework for the study of Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves in Palatini $f(R)$ gravity that was proven to successfully realise inflation and quintessence, and consider the case of the Starobinsky-like model as an example. A regime of radiation domination with a subdominant matter component is assumed, allowing for a well-motivated perturbative approach to the modified gravity corrections. We calculate the kernel function and the density spectrum numerically and find accurate analytical expressions. The spectral density, which may be tested across a wide range of frequencies by upcoming Gravitational Wave experiments, is shown to differ from the General Relativity and metric $f(R)$ gravity predictions under certain conditions. We comment on previous results in the literature regarding the metric formulation and make special emphasis on the potential of these distinctive features of the spectrum to probe the two formalisms of gravity.</description>

      <title>Wonderings on Wiggly Bispectra: Non-linear Evolution and Reconstruction of Oscillations in the Squeezed Bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oscillations in the primordial bispectrum are sourced by a range of inflationary phenomena, including features in the inflaton potential and interactions with massive fields through the Cosmological Collider scenario. These signatures offer a powerful window into early-universe physics. In this work, we study how oscillations of the form $\lim_{q\ll k}B(q,k)\propto \cos(\mu \ln(q/k))$ impact the non-linear squeezed matter bispectrum. Using a suite of $N$-body simulations with non-Gaussian initial conditions, we show that non-linear evolution significantly damps these oscillations, effectively erasing the signal on scales $k \gtrsim 0.3~h/{\rm Mpc}$ at redshift $z=0$. This damping is well-described by the Zel'dovich approximation and can be modeled deep into the non-linear regime using non-perturbative separate universe simulations. Promisingly, we show that reconstruction techniques developed for baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) analyses can largely undo this damping, improving constraints on the amplitude (phase) of oscillations in the primordial squeezed bispectrum by up to a factor of five (four) at $z=0$. We also discuss several challenges with modeling the non-linear evolution of the squeezed bispectrum in the Cosmological Collider scenario, where the bispectrum is suppressed by a factor of $(q/k)^{3/2}$ relative to the template studied here. Our findings pave the way for future searches for oscillatory bispectra using large-scale structure data.</description>

Abstract: The integrals of the motion associated with conformal Killing vectors of a curved space-time with an additional electromagnetic background are studied for massive particles. They involve a new term which might be non-local. The difficulty disappears for pp-waves, for which explicit, local conserved charges are found. Alternatively, the mass can be taken into account by "distorting" the conformal Killing vectors. The relation of these non-point symmetries to the charges is analysed both in the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approaches, as well as in the framework of Eisenhart-Duval lift.</description>

Abstract: We study the free motion of a massive particle moving in the background of a Finslerian deformation of a plane gravitational wave in Einstein's General Relativity. The deformation is a curved version of a one-parameter family of Relativistic Finsler structures introduced by Bogoslovsky, which are invariant under a certain deformation of Cohen and Glashow's Very Special Relativity group ISIM(2). The partially broken Carroll Symmetry we derive using Baldwin-Jeffery-Rosen coordinates allows us to integrate the geodesics equations. The transverse coordinates of timelike Finsler-geodesics are identical to those of the underlying plane gravitational wave for any value of the Bogoslovsky-Finsler parameter $b$. We then replace the underlying plane gravitational wave by a homogenous pp-wave solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations. We conclude by extending the theory to the Finsler-Friedmann-Lemaitre model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.09589v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent interest in the "memory effect" prompted us to revisit the relation of gravitational aves and oscillators. 50 years ago Niederer [1] found that an isotropic harmonic oscillator with a constant frequency can be mapped onto a free particle. Later Takagi [2] has shown that "time-dependent scaling" extends the oscillator versus free particle correspondence to a time-dependent frequency when the scale factor satisfies a Sturm-Liouville equation. More recently Gibbons [3] pointed out that time redefinition is conveniently studied in terms of the Schwarzian derivative. The oscillator versus free particle correspondence "Eisenhart-Duval lifts" to a conformal transformation between Bargmann spaces [4-7]. These methods are extended to spacetimes which are not conformally flat and have a time-dependent profile, and can then be applied to the geodesic motion in a plane gravitational wave.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14271v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particles at rest before the arrival of a burst of gravitational wave move, after the wave has passed, with constant velocity along diverging geodesics. As recognized by Souriau 50 years ago and then forgotten, their motion is particularly simple in Baldwin-Jeffery-Rosen (BJR) coordinates (which are however defined only in coordinate patches): they are determined when the first integrals associated with the 5-parameter isometry group (recently identified as L\'evy-Leblond's ``Carroll'' group with broken rotations) are used. A global description can be given instead in terms of Brinkmann coordinates, however it requires to solve a Sturm-Liouville equation, whereas the relation between BJR and Brinkmann requires to solve yet another Sturm-Liouville equation. The theory is illustrated by geodesic motion in a linearly polarized (approximate) ``sandwich'' wave proposed by Gibbons and Hawking for gravitational collapse, and by circularly polarized approximate sandwich waves with Gaussian envelope.</description>

Abstract: We have demonstrated that the wave functional describing the quantum nature of the spacetime inside the black hole horizon, vanishes near the singularity, using the path integral formalism. This is akin to the DeWitt criterion, applied to the interior of a Schwarzschild black hole. To achieve the same we have expressed the interior of a Schwarzschild black hole as a Kantowski-Sachs spacetime and have applied the minisuperspace formalism to determine an exact form of the propagator, and hence the wave function near the singularity, using path integral over the reduced phase space. It is to be emphasized that our result is exact and not a saddle point approximation to the path integral.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the possibility of describing the thermal system with different temperatures for a black hole with multiple horizons. The black hole with two horizons such as Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole corresponds to two thermal systems with generically different temperatures. Then, it is not suitable to describe these systems with equilibrium thermodynamics corresponding to Gibbs-Boltzmann kinetic theory. In the present work, we investigate such thermal systems by using hydrostatic equilibrium thermodynamics. Assuming that the gas between the horizons obeys the Tsallis statistical mechanics, we found that it is possible to obtain the temperature gradient for the classical gas. Interestingly, the gas behaves as classical gas near the horizon and behaves like quantum gas around flat spacetime with constant temperature. As a result, the multi-horizon black holes in hydrostatic equilibrium can be in a stable configuration with the aspect of the $q$-kinetic theory.</description>

      <title>Projective path to points at infinity in spherically symmetric spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proves that, in a four-dimensional spherically symmetric spacetime manifold, one can consider coordinate transformations expressed by fractional linear maps which give rise to isometries and are the simplest example of coordinate transformation used to bring infinity down to a finite distance. The projective boundary of spherically symmetric spacetimes here studied is the disjoint union of three points: future timelike infinity, past timelike infinity, spacelike infinity, and the three-dimensional products of half-lines with a 2-sphere. Geodesics are then studied in the projectively transformed (t',r',theta',phi') coordinates for Schwarzschild spacetime, with special interest in their way of approaching our points at infinity. Next, Nariai, de Sitter and Godel spacetimes are studied with our projective method. Since the kinds of infinity here defined depend only on the symmetry of interest in a spacetime manifold, they have a broad range of applications, which motivate the innovative analysis of Schwarzschild, Nariai, de Sitter and Godel spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02230v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A special conformal transformation which carries a vacuum gravitational wave into another vacuum one is built by using M\"obius-redefined time. It can either transform a globally defined vacuum wave into a vacuum sandwich wave, or carry the gravitational wave into itself. The first type, illustrated by linearly and circularly polarized vacuum plane gravitational waves, permutes the symmetries and the geodesics. Our pp waves with conformal O(2,1) symmetry of the second type, which seem to ahve escaped attention so far, are anisotropic generalizations of the familiar inverse-square profile. An example inspired by molecular physics, for which the particle can escape, or perform periodic motion, or fall into the singularity is studied in detail.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the gravitational lensing of a charged black hole (spherically symmetric) within the context of Lorentz violation triggered by an antisymmetric tensor field. Our calculations consider two different scenarios: the weak and strong deflection limits. For the weak deflection limit, we employ the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to obtain our results. In the strong deflection limit, we utilize the Tsukamoto methodology, which provides measurable outcomes such as relativistic image positions and magnifications. Applying the latter methodology, we analyze the gravitational lensing by Sagittarius $A^{*}$ and derive the related observables, which are expressed as functions of the Lorentz violation parameter. Finally, the time delay is addressed as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine a loop quantum gravity (LQG) inspired rotating black hole, treating it as a central supermassive black hole (SMBH) in an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) system, where an inspiralling object exhibits eccentric motion around the SMBH. With the orbital dynamics, we derive analytical expressions for the rate of change of orbital energy and angular momentum, as well as orbital evolution, and subsequently generate the gravitational waveforms. To evaluate the difference between EMRI waveforms emitted from the Kerr black hole and a spinning black hole in LQG, we compute the dephasing and mismatch using the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) observation. Our result indicates that LISA can distinguish the modified effect of LQG with a parameter as small as $2\times10^{-6}$. The constraint on a parameter in LQG using the Fisher information matrix can be obtained within a fraction error of $10^{-6}$.</description>

      <title>Geometrical-optics analysis of the interaction between light and gravitational waves from binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09024v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a situation in which light emitted from the neighborhood of a binary interacts with gravitational waves from the binary (e.g., a supermassive black hole binary in a quasar, a binary pulsar, etc.). The effect is cumulative over the long path lengths of light propagation and might be appreciable if the interaction initially takes place close to the source of gravitational waves, where the strain amplitude can be large. This situation can be modeled effectively using spherical gravitational waves (i.e., transverse-traceless radially propagating waves), with the strain amplitude varying with the distance from the source to a field point where the two wavefronts of light and gravitational waves meet each other. Our analysis employs geometrical-optics methods in curved spacetime, where the curvature is due to gravitational waves propagating in a flat spacetime background. We place a particular focus on the effect of gravitational Faraday rotation (or Skrotskii/Rytov effect) resulting from the interaction between light and gravitational waves from binaries.</description>

      <title>Mass inflation and strong cosmic censorship conjecture in the covariant quantum black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, two types of solutions to the long-standing issue of general covariance in canonical quantum gravity have been proposed. From the above, a fundamental question arises: which solution is superior? Considering one type of solution with a Cauchy horizon, in the present letter, we explore whether it exhibits properties similar to those of the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole. Due to its geometric similarity, application of the generalized Dray-'t Hooft-Redmond relation reveals evidence of mass inflation, indicating that the Cauchy horizon is unstable. While this is consistent with the Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture, it suggests that it does not represent a regular black hole. Furthermore, we extend the metric to include a cosmological constant and study the validity of the Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture for the quantum black hole in de Sitter spacetime. After taking into account the reasonable ranges of parameters for the quantum black hole, we find that the Strong Cosmic Censorship Conjecture holds.</description>

      <title>On the uplift of 4D wormholes in Braneworld models and their 5D structure</title>

Abstract: Recent developments for the consistent embedding of general 4D static and spherically-symmetric spacetimes in arbitrary single-brane braneworld models in the form of the General Embedding Algorithm (GEA) [Phys.Rev.D 109 (2024) 4, L041501], initiated the program of studying the bulk structure of braneworld wormholes. In this article, adopting a completely generic approach, we derive the general conditions that the metric functions of any braneworld spacetime must satisfy to describe a wormhole structure in the bulk. Particular emphasis is placed on clarifying the proper uplift of 4D spacetimes, expressed in terms of arbitrary radial coordinates on the brane, and we demonstrate the important role of the circumferential radius metric function $r(u)$ for the embedding. To ensure applicability even when $r(u)$ is non-invertible, we develop an extended formulation of the GEA. Additionally, the flare-out conditions for braneworld wormholes are presented for the first time and are found to differ from the case of flat extra dimensions. To illustrate the method, we first perform the uplift into both thin (Randall-Sundrum II) and thick braneworld models for four well-known 4D wormhole spacetimes: the effective braneworld wormhole solutions of Casadio-Fabbri-Mazzacurati and Bronnikov-Kim, the Simpson-Visser spacetime, and the Ellis-Bronnikov or "anti-Fisher" solution. Subsequently, we study their bulk features by means of curvature invariants, flare-out conditions, energy conditions and embedding diagrams. Our analysis reveals that the assumption of a warped extra dimension has non-trivial implications for the structure of 5D wormholes.</description>

      <title>Coherence DeepClean: Toward autonomous denoising of gravitational-wave detector data</title>

Abstract: Technical and environmental noise in ground-based laser interferometers designed for gravitational-wave observations like Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo and KAGRA, can manifest as narrow (&lt;1Hz) or broadband ($10'$s or even $100'$s of Hz) spectral lines and features in the instruments' strain amplitude spectral density. When the sources of this noise cannot be identified or removed, in cases where there are witness sensors sensitive to this noise source, denoising of the gravitational-wave strain channel can be performed in software, enabling recovery of instrument sensitivity over affected frequency bands. This noise hunting and removal process can be particularly challenging due to the wealth of auxiliary channels monitoring the interferometry and the environment and the non-linear couplings that may be present. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis approach and corresponding cyberinfrastructure to promptly identify and remove noise in software using machine learning techniques. The approach builds on earlier work (referred to as DeepClean) in using machine learning methods for linear and non-linear regression of noise. We demonstrate how this procedure can be operated and optimized in a tandem fashion close to online data taking; it starts off with a coherence monitoring analysis that first singles out and prioritizes witness channels that can then be used by DeepClean. The resulting denoised strain by DeepClean reflects a 1.4\% improvement in the binary neutron star range, which can translate into a 4.3\% increase in the sensitive volume. This cyber infrastructure we refer to as Coherence DeepClean, or CDC, is a significant step toward autonomous operations of noise subtraction for ground-based interferometers.</description>

      <title>Exact path integrals on half-line in quantum cosmology with a fluid clock and aspects of operator ordering ambiguity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform $\textit{exact}$ half-line path integral quantization of flat, homogeneous cosmological models containing a perfect fluid acting as an internal clock, in a $D+1$ dimensional minisuperspace setup. We also discuss certain classes of operator ordering ambiguity inherent in such quantization procedures and argue that a particular ordering prescription in the quantum theory can preserve two symmetries, namely arbitrary lapse rescalings and general covariance, which are already present at the classical level. As a result of this imposition, a large class of quantum Hamiltonians differing by operator ordering produces the same inner products between quantum states. This imposition of the two symmetries of the classical minisuperspace models leads to a unique prescription for writing the quantum Hamiltonian for minisuperspace dimension $D&gt;2$. Interestingly, in the case of $D=1$, the lapse rescaling symmetry is lost in the quantum theory, leading to an essentially ambiguous description of the canonical theory. We provide general proof of this in the context of both canonical quantization and path integrals. We supply concrete examples to validate our findings further.</description>

Abstract: Next-generation gravitational wave detectors such as Cosmic Explorer, the Einstein Telescope, and LISA, demand highly accurate and extensive gravitational wave (GW) catalogs to faithfully extract physical parameters from observed signals. However, numerical relativity (NR) faces significant challenges in generating these catalogs at the required scale and accuracy on modern computers, as NR codes do not fully exploit modern GPU capabilities. In response, we extend NRPy, a Python-based NR code-generation framework, to develop NRPyEllipticGPU -- a CUDA-optimized elliptic solver tailored for the binary black hole (BBH) initial data problem. NRPyEllipticGPU is the first GPU-enabled elliptic solver in the NR community, supporting a variety of coordinate systems and demonstrating substantial performance improvements on both consumer-grade and HPC-grade GPUs. We show that, when compared to a high-end CPU, NRPyEllipticGPU achieves on a high-end GPU up to a sixteenfold speedup in single precision while increasing double-precision performance by a factor of 2--4. This performance boost leverages the GPU's superior parallelism and memory bandwidth to achieve a compute-bound application and enhancing the overall simulation efficiency. As NRPyEllipticGPU shares the core infrastructure common to NR codes, this work serves as a practical guide for developing full, CUDA-optimized NR codes.</description>

      <title>Violations of the null convergence condition in kinematical transitions between singular and regular black holes, horizonless compact objects, and bounces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How do regular black holes evade the Penrose singularity theorem? Various models of stationary regular black holes globally satisfy the null convergence condition (NCC). At first glance this might seem puzzling, as the NCC must generically be violated to avoid the focusing point implied by the Penrose theorem. In fact, the Penrose singularity theorem depends on subtle global assumptions and does not provide information about where and when the singularity actually forms. In particular inner horizons are typically reached at finite affine parameter, before null geodesic focusing occurs, and the region inside the inner horizon is not itself a trapped region. Specifically, the Bardeen, Dymnikova, Hayward models of stationary regular black holes feature an inner Cauchy horizon which violates global hyperbolicity, hence violating one of the key assumptions of Penrose's singularity theorem, and furthermore challenging their viability as long-living end-points of gravitational collapse. In contrast, during non-stationary processes describing kinematic transitions between standard singular black holes and regular black holes or horizonless compact objects, the inner horizon -- when present -- need not act as a Cauchy horizon. This raises the intriguing possibility that the NCC might instead be violated during intermediate stages of such transitions. Our detailed analysis confirms that NCC violations occur frequently during such kinematic transitions, even when the stationary end-point spacetimes respect the NCC. We also investigate analogous transitions toward black-bounce spacetimes and their horizonless compact counterparts, wormholes, where the NCC is always violated. These findings offer new insights into how regular black holes and related objects evade the constraints imposed by the Penrose singularity theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An investigation of black hole thermodynamics based on Tsallis statistical mechanics is explored through the study of the thermodynamics of a gas system located near the horizon of a black hole. In spite of the difficulty in exploring black hole thermodynamics through statistical mechanics, the entropy of the nearby gas system is found to be proportional to the black hole's horizon area using Gibbs-Boltzmann statistical mechanics. This allows us to study black hole thermodynamics by using statistical mechanics through the thermodynamic behaviors of the gas system. Since the entropy of the black hole is proportional to the horizon area, it is more suitable to use non-extensive statistical mechanics instead of the usual Gibbs-Boltzmann ones. In this work, the black hole entropy is derived based on Tsallis statistical mechanics, one of well-known non-extensive statistical mechanics. It is found that the black hole entropy gets a modification due to non-extensivity. By using such an entropy, the black hole can be stabilized due to the non-extensivity, and the bound on the non-extensive parameter is also determined.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel systematic framework for engineering energy-momentum tensors in linearized gravity that generate gravitational fields with a prescribed multipolar structure, aimed at modeling black hole mimickers. As a concrete example, we analyze an anisotropic rotating fluid with a Gaussian-like energy-density profile which, at linearized order, satisfies all energy and causality conditions while generating a gravitational field that exactly reproduces the multipolar structure of a Kerr black hole. We then investigate the phenomenology of both the source and the induced metric, comparing our findings with the corresponding black hole limit.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Magnetically Charged Black Holes with Phantom Global Monopoles: Thermodynamics, Geodesics, Quasinormal Modes, and Grey-Body Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the properties of a nonlinear magnetic-charged black hole in the presence of a phantom global monopole. By incorporating nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) and exotic scalar fields, we derive an exact black hole solution and analyze its geometric structure, causal properties, and thermodynamic behavior. We examine how the presence of a phantom global monopole modifies the black hole's Hawking temperature, entropy, and stability conditions, revealing significant changes in its phase structure. Additionally, we investigate the geodesic motion of test particles. The quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum is computed using the WKB approximation and P\"oschl-Teller potential method, providing insights into the perturbative stability of the system. Furthermore, we analyze the grey-body factors that characterize radiation emission, highlighting their dependence on black hole parameters. Our findings indicate that the interplay between phantom energy, NED, and global monopoles introduces observable deviations in strong-field astrophysical phenomena. These results offer potential signatures for testing modified gravity theories and contribute to a deeper understanding of black hole physics in exotic field environments.</description>

      <title>Light trajectories and wave dynamics in optical wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18967v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the optical properties of a wormhole geometry characterized by a constant negative Gaussian curvature. This distinctive optical structure is modeled using the optical metric of the static BTZ black hole, corresponding to the hyperbolic wormhole framework. Within this model, we derive the arbitrary geodesics and the associated effective potential. Our analysis reveals that the effective potential becomes increasingly narrow as the curvature radius of the optical wormhole decreases, with all possible trajectories converging at the optical origin \(\rho = 0\). We further analyze the wave modes governing light propagation on this curved surface, demonstrating that the effective potential is purely repulsive in both the small and large \(\rho\) limits. While the potential remains finite in both regimes, its behavior differs markedly. Near the optical origin, the magnetic quantum number (\(m\)) exerts a significant influence on the effective repulsive potential, particularly for large values of \(m\), where the potential resembles a typical barrier. However, this effect diminishes with increasing optical distance. Using this framework, we compute the reflection and transmission coefficients for \(m \neq 0\). Our findings indicate that the optical properties of the background are predominantly governed by the curvature radius of the optical wormhole, highlighting its critical role in shaping light propagation in such geometries.</description>

      <title>Dynamical von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai Oscillations of a Binary on a Spherical Orbit around a Rotating Supermassive Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a binary system orbiting a rotating supermassive black hole (SMBH). Using Fermi-Walker transport, we construct a local inertial reference frame in the Kerr spacetime and set up a Newtonian binary system. Assuming the binary moves on a spherical orbit with constant radius around the black hole, we derive the equations of motion governing its dynamics.
  We focus on von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (vZLK) oscillations, which arise when the binary is compact and its initial inclination exceeds a critical angle. In our previous work on a circular orbit in the equatorial plane, we found that for hard binary systems, these oscillations in eccentricity and inclination follow a regular pattern, whereas in soft binaries, they exhibit chaotic behavior with irregular periods and amplitudes, yet remain stable.
  In this study, we extend our analysis to a spherical orbit in the Kerr background. The libration of the binary's orbit in the latitudinal direction affects the vZLK oscillations: as the libration angle increases, the oscillation period shortens, and the maximum eccentricity grows, particularly when the oscillations become chaotic. Notably, when the binary is sufficiently soft yet remains stable, the oscillation period is reduced to the dynamical timescale rather than the secular timescale. This effect arises due to the interaction between the SMBH spin and the binary's angular momentum. As the Kerr rotation parameter increases or the radius of the spherical orbit decreases, both the enhancement of maximum eccentricity and the reduction in oscillation period become more pronounced.</description>

      <title>Upper bound on the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit of black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a universal upper bound on the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCOs) for massive particles in static, spherically symmetric, and asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes. By analyzing the spacetime metrics with external matter fields, we derive the characteristic equation for ISCO via the effective potential method. By imposing appropriate energy conditions for the matter fields, we rigorously demonstrate that the ISCO radius is bounded by $r_{\mathrm{ISCO}}\le 6M$, where $M$ is the total ADM mass of the black hole. The Schwarzschild black hole saturates this bound ($r_{\mathrm{ISCO}}=6M$), and the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, supergravity black holes, fluid sphere models, which satisfy the imposed energy conditions, also obey $r_{\mathrm{ISCO}}\le 6M$. The universality of this upper limit provides a theoretical benchmark for observational astrophysics: deviations from $6M$ in accretion disk observations or gravitational wave signals could indicate the presence of exotic matter fields. This work highlights the interplay between black hole geometry and external matter fields, paving the way for future studies in compact object dynamics.</description>

      <title>Extended Tsallis-Cirto entropy for black and white holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05178v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In reference [1] we considered the black hole thermodynamics with the non-extensive entropy. This entropy obeys the composition rule which coincides with the composition rule in the non-extensive Tsallis-Cirto $\delta=2$ statistics. Here we extend this approach to the thermodynamics of white holes. The entropy of the white hole is negative as follows from the rate of macroscopic quantum tunneling from black hole to white hole. The white hole entropy is with the minus sign the entropy of the black hole with the same mass, $S_{\rm WH}(M)=-S_{\rm BH}(M)$. This reflects the anti-symmetry with respect to time reversal, at which the shift vector in the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism changes sign. This symmetry allows one to extend the Tsallis-Chirto entropy by adding a minus sign to the Tsallis-Chirto formula applied to white hole. As a result, the composition rule remains the same, with the only difference being that instead of entropy it contains the entropy modulus. The same non-extensive composition rule is obtained for the entropy of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. This entropy is formed by the positive entropy of the outer horizon and the negative entropy of the inner horizon. The model of the black hole formed by "black hole atoms" with Planck-scale mass is also extended to include the negative entropy of white holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15412v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Space-borne quantum technologies, particularly those based on atom interferometry, are heralding a new era of strategic and robust space exploration. The unique conditions of space, characterized by low noise and low gravity environments, open up diverse possibilities for applications ranging from precise time and frequency transfer to Earth Observation and the search of new Physics. In this paper, we summarise the M-class mission proposal in response to the 2022 call in ESA's science program: Space-Time Explorer and Quantum Equivalence Principle Space Test (STE-QUEST). It consists in a satellite mission featuring a dual-species atom interferometer operating over extended durations. This mission aims to tackle three of the most fundamental questions in Physics: (i) testing the universality of free fall with an accuracy better than one part in $10^{-17}$, (ii) exploring various forms of Ultra-Light Dark Matter, and (iii) scrutinizing the foundations of Quantum Mechanics.</description>

      <title>Hall effects in Carroll dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02360v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: ``Do Carroll particles move?'' The answer depends on the characteristics of the particle such as its mass, spin, electric charge, and magnetic moment. A massive Carroll particle (closely related to fractons) does not move; its immobility follows from Carroll boost symmetry which implies dipole conservation, but not conversely. A massless Carroll particle may propagate by following the Hall law, consistently with the partial breaking of the Carroll boost symmetry. The framework is extended to Carroll field theory. In $d=2$ space dimensions, the Carroll group has a two-fold central extension which allows us to generalize the dynamics to massive and massless particles, including anyons. The anyonic spin and magnetic moment combine with the doubly-extended structure parameterized by two Casimir invariants interpreted as intrinsic magnetization and non-commutativity parameter. The extended Carroll particle subjected to an electromagnetic background field moves following a generalized Hall law which includes a Zeeman force. This theory is illustrated by massless, uncharged anyons with doubly-centrally extended structure we call exotic photons, which move on the horizon of a Black Hole, giving rise to an anyonic spin-Hall Effect.</description>

      <title>Mahakala: a Python-based Modular Ray-tracing and Radiative Transfer Algorithm for Curved Space-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Mahakala, a Python-based, modular, radiative ray-tracing code for curved space-times. We employ Google's JAX framework for accelerated automatic differentiation, which can efficiently compute Christoffel symbols directly from the metric, allowing the user to easily and quickly simulate photon trajectories through non-Kerr spacetimes. JAX also enables Mahakala to run in parallel on both CPUs and GPUs. Mahakala natively uses the Cartesian Kerr-Schild coordinate system, which avoids numerical issues caused by the pole in spherical coordinate systems. We demonstrate Mahakala's capabilities by simulating 1.3 mm wavelength images (the wavelength of Event Horizon Telescope observations) of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of low-accretion rate supermassive black holes. The modular nature of Mahakala allows us to quantitatively explore how different regions of the flow influence different image features. We show that most of the emission seen in 1.3 mm images originates close to the black hole and peaks near the photon orbit. We also quantify the relative contribution of the disk, forward jet, and counter jet to 1.3 mm images.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19715v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equations of motion of an isospin-carrying particle in a Yang-Mills and gravitational field were first proposed in 1968 by Kerner, who considered geodesics in a Kaluza-Klein-type framework. Two years later the flat space Kerner equations were completed by considering also the motion of the isospin by Wong, who used a field-theoretical approach. Their groundbreaking work was then followed by a long series of rediscoveries whose history is reviewed. The concept of isospin charge and the physical meaning of its motion are discussed. Conserved quantities are studied for Wu-Yang monopoles and for diatomic molecules by using van Holten's algorithm.</description>

      <title>Search for eccentric NSBH and BNS mergers in the third observing run of Advanced LIGO and Virgo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The possible formation histories of neutron star binaries remain unresolved by current gravitational-wave catalogs. The detection of an eccentric binary system could be vital in constraining compact binary formation models. We present the first search for aligned spin eccentric neutron star-black hole binaries (NSBH) and the most sensitive search for aligned-spin eccentric binary neutron star (BNS) systems using data from the third observing run of the advanced LIGO and advanced Virgo detectors. No new statistically significant candidates are found; we constrain the local merger rate for specific astrophysical models to be less than 150 $\text{Gpc}^{-3}\text{yr}^{-1}$ for binary neutron stars in the field, and, 50, 100, and 70 $\text{Gpc}^{-3}\text{yr}^{-1}$ for neutron star-black hole binaries in globular clusters, hierarchical triples and nuclear clusters, respectively, at the 90$\%$ confidence level if we assume that no sources have been observed from these populations. We predict the capabilities of upcoming and next-generation observatory networks; we investigate the ability of three LIGO ($\text{A}^{\#}$) detectors and Cosmic Explorer CE (20km) + CE (40km) to use eccentric binary observations for determining the formation history of neutron star binaries. We find that 2 -- 100 years of observation with three $\text{A}^{\#}$ observatories are required before we observe clearly eccentric NSBH binaries; this reduces to only 10 days -- 1 year with the CE detector network. CE will observe tens to hundreds of measurably eccentric binaries from each of the formation models we consider.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger symmetry: a historical review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20316v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper reviews the history of the conformal extension of Galilean symmetry, now called Schr\"odinger symmetry. In the physics literature, its discovery is commonly attributed to Jackiw, Niederer and Hagen (1972). However, Schr\"odinger symmetry has a much older ancestry: the associated conserved quantities were known to Jacobi in 1842/43 and its euclidean counterpart was discovered by Sophus Lie in 1881 in his studies of the heat equation. A convenient way to study Schr\"odinger symmetry is provided by a non-relativistic Kaluza-Klein-type "Bargmann" framework, first proposed by Eisenhart (1929), but then forgotten and re-discovered by Duval {\it et al.} only in 1984. Representations of Schr\"odinger symmetry differ by the value $z=2$ of the dynamical exponent from the value $z=1$ found in representations of relativistic conformal invariance. For generic values of $z$, whole families of new algebras exist, which for $z=2/\ell$ include the $\ell$-conformal galilean algebras. We also review the non-relativistic limit of conformal algebras and that this limit leads to the $1$-conformal galilean algebra and not to the Schr\"odinger algebra. The latter can be recovered in the Bargmann framework through reduction. A distinctive feature of Galilean and Schr\"odinger symmetries are the Bargmann super-selection rules, algebraically related to a central extension. An empirical consequence of this was known as "mass conservation" already to Lavoisier. As an illustration of these concepts, some applications to physical ageing in simple model systems are reviewed.</description>

Abstract: Cosmological observables in perturbation theory turn out to be plagued with infrared divergences, which represents both a conceptual and computational challenge. In this paper we present a proof of concept for a systematic procedure to remove these divergences in a large class of scalar cosmological integrals and consistently define an infrared safe computable in perturbation theory. We provide diagrammatic rules which are based on the nestohedra underlying the asymptotic structure of such integrals.</description>

      <title>Upper Bounds on the Mass of Fundamental Fields from Primordial Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18435v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations in the vacuum zero point energy associated to quantum fields and their statistical distributions during inflation. It is shown that the perturbations in the vacuum zero point energy have large amplitudes which are highly non-Gaussian. The effects of vacuum zero point fluctuations can be interpreted as the loop corrections in primordial power spectrum and bispectrum. Requiring that the primordial curvature perturbation to remain nearly Gaussian and the loop corrections to be under perturbative control impose strong upper bounds on the mass of fundamental fields during inflation. These bounds depend on the hierarchy of the masses in the theory such as whether or not the masses are at the similar orders. While the mass of the heaviest field in the hierarchy may not be constrained but it is shown that a combination of the masses of the fields can not be much heavier than the Hubble scale during inflation, otherwise their vacuum zero point fluctuations induce large non-Gaussianities in primordial perturbations. Considering the observational upper bound on tensor to scalar ratio, we conclude that this combined mass scale is lighter than $10^{14}$ GeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several pulsar timing array (PTA) missions have reported convincing evidence of a stochastic gravitational wave background within their latest datasets. This background could originate from an astrophysical source, though there are multiple possibilities for its origin to be cosmological. Focusing on the NANOGrav signal, which was in good agreement with other PTAs, we evaluate the possibility of an inflationary source for the background. However, we'll consider a time-dependent minimal theory of massive gravity instead of standard general relativity for our analysis. We find that an inflationary interpretation will require a strongly blue spectrum, characterized by $n_T = 1.8 \, \pm \, 0.54$, while Big Bang Nucleosynthesis limits will require a low reheating scale of $T_\text{rh} \simeq 4000 \ \text{GeV}$. Though these constraints make it difficult for inflation to be the source of the NANOGrav signal, we find that the massive gravity model allows for a greater reheating temperature than standard general relativity, making an inflationary interpretation slightly less cumbersome.</description>

      <title>Particle Acceleration in Collisionless Magnetically Arrested Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first collisionless realization of two-dimensional axisymmetric black hole accretion consistent with a persistent magnetically arrested disk state. The accretion flow, consisting of an ion-electron disk plasma combined with magnetospheric pair creation effects, is simulated using first-principles general-relativistic particle-in-cell methods. The simulation is evolved over significant dynamical timescales during which a quasi-steady accretion state is reached with several magnetic flux eruption cycles. We include a realistic treatment of inverse Compton scattering and pair production, which allows for studying the interaction between the collisionless accretion flow and pair-loaded jet. Our findings indicate that magnetic flux eruptions associated with equatorial magnetic reconnection within the black hole magnetosphere and the formation of spark gaps are locations of maximal particle acceleration. Flux eruptions, starting near the central black hole, can trigger Kelvin-Helmholtz-like vortices at the jet-disk interface that facilitate efficient mixing between disk and jet plasma in this region. Transient periods of increased pair production following magnetic flux eruptions and reconnection events are responsible for most of the highly accelerated particles.</description>

      <title>Testing the equivalence principle across the Universe: a model-independent approach with galaxy multi-tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a test of the equivalence principle on cosmological scales. This cornerstone of general relativity has been tested with high precision for standard matter, but its validity for the unknown dark matter remains a crucial open question. We construct a measurable quantity $E_P$ that acts as a null test, i.e. it deviates from unity whenever the weak equivalence principle is violated. This quantity can be directly measured from the cross-correlation of two different galaxy populations, thanks to the inclusion of large-scale relativistic corrections. A key feature of our approach is that it only involves minimal assumptions, without the need to specify the power spectrum shape, the background evolution, the growth rate of cosmic structure, the galaxy bias function or a model for the potential violation of the equivalence principle. We provide forecasts for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). While the relativistic corrections can be detected with high significance by both surveys, $E_P$ can be constrained up to an interesting level only by SKA, with a precision around 10-15$\%$.</description>

      <title>Super-exponential Primordial Black Hole Production via Delayed Vacuum Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If a cosmological first-order phase transition occurs sufficiently slowly, delayed vacuum decay may lead to the formation of primordial black holes. Here we consider a simple model as a case study of how the abundance of the produced black holes depends on the model's input parameters. We demonstrate, using both numerical and analytical arguments and methods, that the black hole abundance is controlled by a double, ``super''-exponential dependence on the three-dimensional Euclidean action over temperature at its minimal value. We show that a modified expansion rate during the phase transition, such as one driven by an additional energy density component, leads to a weaker dependence on the underlying model parameters, but maintains the same super-exponential structure. We argue that our findings generalize to any framework of black hole production via delayed vacuum decay.</description>

      <title>Blinded Mock Data Challenge for Gravitational-Wave Cosmology-I: Assessing the Robustness of Methods Using Binary Black Holes Mass Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational Wave (GW) sources are standard sirens that provide an independent way to map the cosmic expansion history by combining with an independent redshift measurement either from an electromagnetic counterpart for a bright siren or using different statistical techniques for dark sirens. In this analysis, we perform the first Blinded Mock Data Challenge (\texttt{Blinded-MDC}) to test the robustness in inferring the value of Hubble constant $H_0$ for a dark siren technique which depends on astrophysical mass distribution of Binary Black Holes (BBHs). We have considered different analysis setups for the \texttt{Blinded-MDC} to test both statistical and systematic uncertainties and demonstrate the capabilities in inferring $H_0$ with detector sensitivity as per the fourth observation run of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. We find that when the astrophysical population of BBHs matches with the underlying assumption of the model, a cosmological pipeline can recover the injected parameters using the observed mass distribution. However, when the mock mass distribution of the astrophysical population depends slightly on redshift and one is ignorant about it in analyzing the data, it can cause a systematic discrepancy in the inferred value of $H_0$ by about $1.5\sigma$, above the statistical fluctuations due to noise and a limited number of events. In the future, elaborate studies will be required to mitigate systematic uncertainties due to unknown astrophysical complexities. This MDC framework sets the road map for inspecting the precision and accuracy of standard siren cosmology and provides the first insight into the robustness of the population-dependent cosmology inference in a blinded analysis setup.</description>

      <title>Forecast constraints on the axion-photon coupling from interstellar medium heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In interstellar media characterized by a nonrelativistic plasma of electrons and heavy ions, we study the effect of axion dark matter coupled to photons on the dynamics of an electric field. In particular, we assume the presence of a background magnetic field aligned in a specific direction. We show that there is an energy transfer from the oscillating axion field to photons and then to the plasma induced by forced resonance. This resonance is most prominent for the axion mass $m_{\phi}$ equivalent to the plasma frequency $\omega_p$. Requiring that the heating rate of the interstellar medium caused by the energy transfer does not exceed the observed astrophysical cooling rate, we place forecast constraints on the axion-photon coupling $g$ for several different amplitudes of the background magnetic field $B_0$. By choosing a typical value $B_0=10^{-6}$ G, we find that, for the resonance mass $m_{\phi}=\omega_p$, the upper limit of $g$ can be stronger than those derived from other measurements in the literature. With increased values of $B_0$, it is possible to put more stringent constraints on $g$ for a wider range of the axion mass away from the resonance point.</description>

      <title>Low-Acceleration Gravitational Anomaly from Bayesian 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: Methodology and Results with Gaia Data Release 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09373v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Isolated wide binary stars provide natural laboratories to directly probe gravity for Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$. Recent statistical analyses of wide binaries have been performed only with sky-projected relative velocities $v_p$ in the pairs. A new method of Bayesian orbit modeling exploiting three relative velocity components including the radial component $v_r$ is developed to measure the gravitational anomaly parameter $\Gamma\equiv\log_{10}\sqrt{\gamma_g}\equiv\log_{10}\sqrt{G_{\rm{eff}}/G_{\rm{N}}}$ where $G_{\rm{eff}}$ is the effective gravitational constant for pseudo-Newtonian elliptical orbits, while $G_{\rm{N}}$ is Newton's constant. The method infers individual probability distributions of $\Gamma$ and then combines the independent distributions to obtain a consolidated distribution in a specific range of $g_{\rm{N}}$. Here the method is described and applied to a sample of 312 wide binaries in a broad dynamic range $10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$ with $v_r$ uncertainties in the range $168&lt;\sigma_{v_r}&lt;380$ m s$^{-1}$ selected from the Gaia DR3 database. The following results are obtained: $\Gamma = 0.000\pm 0.011$ ($N_{\rm{binary}}=125$) for the high-acceleration regime ($10^{-7.9} \lesssim g_{\rm{N}} \lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$) agreeing well with Newton, but $\Gamma = 0.085\pm 0.040$ or $\gamma_g=1.48_{-0.23}^{+0.33}$ (35) for a MOND regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) and $\Gamma = 0.063\pm 0.015$ or $\gamma_g=1.34_{-0.08}^{+0.10}$ (111) for a MOND+transition regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-8.5}$ m s$^{-2}$). These results show that a gravitational anomaly is evident for $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$ and $\Gamma$ in the MOND regime ($\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) agrees with the prediction ($\approx 0.07$) of MOND gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Strong backreaction of gauge quanta produced during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During inflation an axion field coupled to a gauge field through a Chern-Simons term can trigger the production of gauge quanta due to a tachyonic instability. The amplification of the gauge field modes exponentially depends on the velocity of the axion field, which in turn slows down the rolling of the axion field when backreaction is taken into account. To illustrate how the strength of the Chern-Simons coupling and the slope of the axion potential influence the particle production, in this paper we consider a toy model in which the axion field is a spectator with a linear potential. In the strong backreaction regime, the energy density of the gauge field quasiperiodically oscillates. The steep slope of the axion potential linearly increases the peak amplitude of the energy density while the strong coupling linearly decreases the peak amplitude. Additionally, we calculate the energy spectrum of gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Amplitude prescriptions in field theories with complex poles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of field theories with complex poles, we scrutinize four inequivalent ways of defining the scattering amplitudes, each forfeiting one or more tenets of standard quantum field theory while preserving the others: (i) a textbook Wick rotation by analytic continuation of the external momenta from Euclidean to Lorentzian signature (no optical theorem), (ii) the Lee--Wick--Nakanishi prescription, integrating along a certain contour in the complex energy plane (no Lorentz invariance), (iiii) the fakeon prescription, where, in addition, spatial momenta are integrated on a complex path defined by the locus of singularities of the loop integrand (no analyticity of the amplitude) and (iv) to work directly on Minkowski spacetime, which violates the optical theorem and also bars power-counting renormalizability. In general, mixed Euclidean-Lorentzian prescriptions for internal and external momenta in loop integrals break Lorentz invariance, regardless of the type of masses involved. We conclude that, of the above four options, only the fakeon prescription is physically viable and can have applications to quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Constructing noncommutative black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08560v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a self-contained and consistent formulation of noncommutative (NC) gauge theory of gravity, focusing on spherically symmetric black hole geometries. Our construction starts from the gauge-theoretic viewpoint of Poincar\'{e} (or de Sitter) gravity and introduces noncommutativity through the Moyal star product and the Seiberg-Witten map, retaining NC gauge invariance at each order in the deformation parameter $\Theta$. Working systematically to second order in $\Theta$, we obtain explicit NC corrections to the spin connection, the vierbein, and various geometric objects such as the metric and curvature scalars. Using these results, we compute NC modifications of four-dimensional Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m solutions, including scenarios with a cosmological constant, as well as three-dimensional BTZ-type black holes (both uncharged and charged). For each black hole solution, we explore various possible Moyal twists, each of which generally breaks some symmetries and modifies the horizon structure, surface gravity, and curvature invariants. In particular, we show that while the radial location of horizons in Schwarzschild-like solutions remains unchanged for some twists, other twists introduce important but finite deformations in curvature scalars and can decouple the Killing horizon from the causal horizon. Similar patterns arise in the charged and lower-dimensional cases. Beyond constructing explicit examples, our approach provides a blueprint for systematically incorporating short-distance quantum corrections through noncommutativity in gravitational settings. The methods and expansions we present can be extended to more general geometries including rotating black holes and additional matter fields, offering a broad framework for future studies of NC effects in classical solutions of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Interactions of the scalaron dark matter in $f (R)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In $f(R)$ gravity, the scalaron -- a scalar degree of freedom arising from modification of General Relativity -- could account for all dark matter in the universe if its mass lies in the meV--MeV range. In this work, we revisit the scalaron's interactions with Standard Model particles, assuming their minimal coupling to gravity. In particular, we provide a detailed calculation of the scalaron's decay rate into two photons -- a one-loop process of significant interest that has been the subject of discrepancies in the literature. We demonstrate that a direct evaluation of loop diagrams with appropriate regularisation eliminates the ambiguities inherent in methods relying on Jacobians from field redefinitions. Assuming the scalaron constitutes all of dark matter, we calculate the average cosmological background radiation produced by its decays into photons. We also estimate the contribution of primordial scalarons emitted in the hot early universe to the present dark matter density and find it to be negligible. Our results support all key aspects of the original scenario, in which scalaron dark matter behaves as a coherently oscillating field.</description>
