      <title>The H.E.S.S. Gravitational Wave and Gamma-Ray Burst Follow-Up Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-wavelength and multi-messenger astrophysics have experienced rapid growth over the past decade, seeking a complete picture of different cosmic phenomena. Transient sources, in particular, benefit from the input of multi-messenger observations, offering complementary perspectives on the same event while maximizing the detection probability of a rapidly fading signal. In this context, Gravitational Wave (GW) detections serve as perfect triggers for potential counterpart detections. Notably, a GW alert could be associated with a Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB), jetted cataclysmic events produced either by the collision of a binary neutron star system or a core-collapse supernova. These sources also radiate across the electromagnetic spectrum, allowing detection by X- and gamma-ray instruments aboard various satellites and thus enabling multi-wavelength triggering opportunities. The strong interest in minimizing reaction time to capture the full-time evolution of the emission, together with the often challenging localization uncertainties of the alerts, underscores the need for rapid and well-coordinated follow-up programs such as the one developed by the H.E.S.S. Collaboration.
  This contribution will give an overview of the transient follow-up strategy carried out by the H.E.S.S. Collaboration, from the external alert trigger and the automatic reaction of the observatory to the various analysis steps of the obtained observations. To illustrate this comprehensive strategy, we will show two examples of follow-up observations of both GRBs and GWs, highlighting key results and challenges in the search for an associated high-energy gamma-ray emission.</description>

      <title>Medium-scale anisotropies measured by Telescope Array surface detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Telescope Array (TA) experiment, the largest observatory for ultra-high energy cosmic rays in the Northern Hemisphere, has identified two medium-scale anisotropies: the TA Hotspot near the constellation Ursa Major and an excess in the direction of the Perseus-Pisces supercluster. Studying these medium-scale anisotropies may provide insights into the origins of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. This presentation will explore an oversampling analysis of TA surface detector data to evaluate these medium-scale event excesses and will present the latest findings on the TA Hotspot and the Perseus-Pisces supercluster excess.</description>

      <title>Features in the Cosmic Ray Energy Spectrum Observed with Telescope Array Surface Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are extremely energetic charged particles that originate from outer space. The Telescope Array (TA) experiment, the largest UHECR observatory in the Northern Hemisphere, has provided high-precision measurements of the cosmic ray energy spectrum due to its stable operation and efficient data collection. These measurements have revealed three significant spectral features: the ankle, shoulder, and cutoff. Analyzing these features is crucial for understanding the origin and propagation of UHECRs. In this talk, we will present the latest energy spectrum measured by the TA surface detectors and discuss the observed differences in the UHECR energy spectrum between the northern and southern skies.</description>

      <title>H.E.S.S. observations of SN 2024ggi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova (SN) explosions interacting with dense circumstellar medium are considered to be very promising sites for efficient cosmic-ray (CR) acceleration and subsequent emission of neutral-pion-decay gamma rays. These environments share similarities with already detected gamma-ray novae, but with much greater available energy content, so it is important to characterize their emission in the very-high-energy range. We present the results of H.E.S.S. observations of one such candidate source - SN 2024ggi, located in NGC 3621 at a distance of 7.24 Mpc. A total of 30 hours of data, gathered throughout a month of post-explosion observations, provide flux upper limits that are used to constrain source parameters, offering meaningful insights for theoretical predictions. We exclude bright gamma-ray emission in the first day after explosion, and later upper limits are consistent with wind densities derived from optical observations.</description>

      <title>TeV Emission from PSR B1055-52 with HESS: Evidence for a Pulsar Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar halos are a recently identified class of TeV $\gamma$-ray sources, offering valuable insights into the evolution of pulsar systems at the highest energies. However, only a handful of such sources have been detected so far, making each new identification critical for understanding the properties of the population as a whole. We report the first detection of extended very-high-energy (VHE) $\gamma$-ray emission around PSR~B1055$-$52 using observations from the H.E.S.S. array. This middle-aged pulsar, previously grouped together with Geminga and PSR~B0656$+$14 as part of the ``Three Musketeers'', has now been confirmed to host a TeV pulsar halo, making it the third detected system of its kind, and the first TeV pulsar halo discovered in the southern hemisphere. Our analysis performed in an energy range of $0.3-60\,$TeV, reveals gamma-ray emission with a one sigma extension of $(2.05 \pm 0.32)^\circ$. The analysis indicates that the emission extends beyond the region which was observed with H.E.S.S.. No significant spectral variation is detected across the emission.
  The diffusion coefficient derived for this halo is significantly lower than the standard ISM value, aligning with findings in the Geminga halo and indicating that slow diffusion may be a common property of pulsar halos. The detection of this new TeV pulsar halo provides a crucial data point for studying the population-wide properties of pulsar halos, their impact on cosmic-ray propagation, and their role as a source of Galactic electrons and positrons.</description>

      <title>A supermassive black hole under the radar: repeating X-ray variability in a Seyfert galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last few years, a few supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have shown short-term (of the order of hours) X-ray variability. Given the limited size of the sample, every new addition to this class of SMBHs can bring invaluable information. Within the context of an automated search for X-ray sources showing flux variability in the \textit{Chandra} archive, we identified peculiar variability patterns in 2MASX J12571076+2724177 (J1257), a SMBH in the Coma cluster, during observations performed in 2020. We investigated the long-term evolution of the flux, together with the evolution of the spectral parameters throughout the \textit{Chandra} and \textit{XMM-Newton} observations, which cover a time span of approximately 20 years. We found that J1257 has repeatedly shown peculiar variability over the last 20 years, on typical timescales of $\simeq20-25$ ks. From our spectral analysis, we found hints of a softer-when-brighter behaviour and of two well-separated flux states. We suggest that J1257 might represent a new addition to the ever-growing size of relatively low mass SMBHs ($M\simeq10^6-10^7\mathrm{M}_\odot$) showing extreme, possibly quasi-periodic X-ray variability on short time scales. The available dataset does not allow for a definitive classification of the nature of the variability. However, given the observed properties, it could either represent a quasi-periodic oscillation at particularly low frequency or be associated with quasi-periodic eruptions in an AGN with peculiar spectral properties.</description>

      <title>Hunt for the mHz variability in the TESS and XMM-Newton observations of nova-like cataclysmic variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analysed the flickering of selected nova-like cataclysmic variables observed by the TESS satellite and XMM-Newton. We searched for break frequencies ($f_{\rm b}$) in the corresponding power density spectra (PDS), and for any long-term evolution. We found a new optical $f_{\rm b}$ in three nova-like systems and confirmed that the value of this frequency is clustered around 1 mHz. V504 Cen and V751 Cyg show possible X-ray counterparts of $f_{\rm b}$ that had previously only been seen in MV Lyr. This points towards the very central disc for source localisation. We investigated a previously proposed correlation between white dwarf mass and $f_{\rm b}$, but thanks to the new measurements we do not conclude its existence. V3885 Sgr and V1193 Ori show flaring activity in the long-term light curve during which TESS observations were made. The corresponding PDSs show changes in shape and disappearance of $f_{\rm b}$. TT Ari and SGRt 062340.2-265715 exhibit smooth changes in the long-term optical light curve, and the corresponding TESS observations show variable $f_{\rm b}$ during these changes. $f_{\rm b}$ is higher for lower brightness, which was seen only in MV Lyr so far.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Supernova Remnant IC 443 using H.E.S.S. Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IC 443 is a well-known supernova remnant that stands out due to its interaction with a dense molecular cloud, creating a complex environment where shocks can efficiently accelerate particles to high energies. This makes it a key target for investigating the mechanisms of cosmic-ray acceleration and gamma-ray production, particularly in the context of supernova remnants as potential sources of PeV cosmic rays. This work presents a first analysis of the region as observed by H.E.S.S.. We detect extended very-high-energy gamma-ray emission from IC 443, consistent with previous observations by VERITAS and MAGIC. A multi-wavelength comparison incorporating data from Fermi-LAT, MAGIC, and VERITAS strongly supports a hadronic origin of the observed emission, and highlights the presence of relativistic protons interacting with the surrounding molecular cloud. These findings reinforce the role of IC 443 as a key laboratory for studying supernova remnants as cosmic-ray accelerators and their interaction with their surrounding mediums.</description>

      <title>Rapid onset of a Comptonisation zone in the repeating tidal disruption event XMMSL2 J140446.9-251135</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report here on observations of a tidal disruption event, XMMSL2 J1404-2511, discovered in an XMM-Newton slew, in a quiescent galaxy at z=0.043. X-ray monitoring covered the epoch when the accretion disc transitioned from a thermal state, with kT~80 eV, to a harder state dominated by a warm, optically-thick corona. The bulk of the coronal formation took place within 7 days and was coincident with a temporary drop in the emitted radiation by a factor 4. After a plateau phase of ~100 days, the X-ray flux of XMMSL2 J1404-2511 decayed by a factor 500 within 230 days. We estimate the black hole mass in the galaxy to be $M_{BH}=4\pm{2}\times10^{6}$ solar masses and the peak X-ray luminosity $L_{X}\sim6\times10^{43}$ ergs/s. The optical/UV light curve is flat over the timescale of the observations with $L_{opt}\sim 2\times10^{41}$ ergs/s. We find that TDEs with coronae are more often found in an X-ray sample than in an optically-selected sample. Late-time monitoring of the optical sample is needed to test whether this is an intrinsic property of TDEs or is due to a selection effect. From the fast decay of the X-ray emission we consider that the event was likely due to the partial stripping of an evolved star rather than a full stellar disruption, an idea supported by the detection of two further re-brightening episodes, two and four years after the first event, in the SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey.</description>

      <title>Spectral nature of Sco X-1 observed using the X-ray SPECtroscopy and Timing (XSPECT) payload on-board XPoSat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scorpius X-1 is the brightest and first discovered X-ray source in the sky. Studying this source in the low-energy band has been challenging in the past due to its high brightness. However, with the X-ray SPECtroscopy and Timing (XSPECT) payload on-board Indias first X-ray Polarimetry Satellite (XPoSat), we have the capability to study the source despite its very high brightness, thanks to the fast (1 ms) readout of the instrument. We investigate the evolution of the spectral and timing properties of Sco X-1 across the horizontal, normal, and flaring branch, as observed with XSPECT. We examine changes in the spectral parameters as a function of position on the color-color diagram (CCD). Spectral studies indicate that the soft X-ray emission can be modeled using a multicolor disk component, with the inner disk temperature ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 keV. The hard component is described by a Comptonized continuum using either the nthComp or Comptb model with electron temperatures from 2.4 to 4.7 keV and optical depth between 5 and 14. Additionally, we observe the presence of an iron K-alpha line at 6.6 keV and an iron K-beta line at 7.6 keV. Both spectral models suggest a steep rise in Comptonization flux as well as disk flux in the flaring branch. An increase in neutron star blackbody temperature and inner disk temperature are also observed during flaring. The Z-track is driven by changes in the optical depth of the corona, the Comptonization flux and the disk flux and the inner disk temperature. No quasi-periodic oscillations are detected in any branch, suggesting their association with the high-energy spectrum.</description>

      <title>Likelihood-based reconstruction of muon lateral distribution function using combined integrator and binary detector modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, with energies $E \geq 10^{18}$ eV, remains unknown. Among the key observables used to investigate their nature are the energy spectrum, the arrival direction distribution, and the composition as a function of energy. The composition of the primary cosmic ray is inferred from properties of the extensive air showers they initiate, particularly from parameters sensitive to the primary mass. The most sensitive parameters to the primary mass are the atmospheric depth of the shower maximum, typically measured with fluorescence telescopes, and the muon content of the shower, measured using dedicated muon detectors. A commonly used observable in composition studies is the muon density at a fixed distance from the shower axis, derived by evaluating the reconstructed muon lateral distribution function (MLDF) at a reference distance. A specific type of muon detector features two acquisition modes: binary and integrator (commonly referred to as ADC mode, for Analog-to-Digital Converter). The binary mode allows for direct muon counting, while the ADC mode infers the muon number from the integrated signal of the detector response. Existing methods reconstruct the MLDF using data from either acquisition mode individually, or by combining both, but usually assigning a single mode per detector station in a given event. This work presents a novel method to reconstruct the MLDF based on a likelihood approach that simultaneously incorporates data from both acquisition modes at each detector station. We apply our method to the underground muon detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory as a case study. However, this general approach can be applied to future detectors with dual acquisition capabilities. Our results demonstrate that the combined method outperforms traditional techniques that rely solely on either binary or ADC mode data.</description>

      <title>Search for dark matter around intermediate mass black holes with the H.E.S.S. experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs), with masses ranging from a hundred and a million solar masses, are hypothesised to be surrounded by dense regions of dark matter known as dark matter spikes, where the annihilation of dark matter particles could produce detectable gamma rays. The detection of dark matter annihilation around IMBHs therefore offers a promising approach for probing the nature of dark matter. In this work, we search for dark matter annihilation around IMBHs using data from the Galactic Plane Survey, the Extragalactic Survey and a selection of satellite galaxies observed by the H.E.S.S. gamma-ray experiment in Namibia. Since no evidence for a gamma-ray signal from dark matter annihilation around IMBHs has been found, we set upper limits on the velocity-weighted annihilation cross section for dark matter masses between 800 GeV and 100 TeV. Our analysis obtains limits on the velocity-weighted annihilation cross section below the thermal relic cross section for dark matter masses between 10 and 100 TeV.</description>

      <title>Fluorescent Fe K line emission of gamma Cas stars II. Predictions for magnetic interactions and white-dwarf accretion scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: About 12 percent of the early-type Be stars, so-called gamma Cas stars, exhibit an unusually hard and bright thermal X-ray emission that could result from accretion onto a white dwarf companion or from magnetic interactions between the Be star and its decretion disk. Exploring the full power of high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of gamma Cas stars requires comparison of observations of the fluorescent Fe Kalpha emission lines near 6.4 keV with synthetic profiles of this line complex computed in the framework of the magnetic interaction and the accreting WD scenarios. For the latter, we further distinguish between accretion onto a non-magnetic and a magnetic WD. Our models account for different reservoirs of reprocessing material: the Be circumstellar decretion disk, the Be photosphere, an accretion disk around the WD companion, a magnetically channelled accretion flow and the WD photosphere. We find considerably different line properties for the different scenarios. For a non-magnetic accreting WD, the global Fe Kalpha complex is extremely broad, reaching a full width of 140 eV, whilst it is ~ 40 eV for the magnetic star-disk interaction and the magnetic accreting WD cases. In the magnetic star-disk interaction, the line centroid follows the orbital motion of the Be star, whereas it moves along with the WD in the case of an accreting WD. For gamma Cas, given the 15 times larger amplitude of the WD orbital motion, the shift in position for an accreting WD should be easily detectable with high-resolution spectrographs such as Resolve on XRISM, but remains essentially undetectable for the magnetic star-disk interaction. Upcoming high-resolution spectroscopy of the fluorescent Fe Kalpha emission lines in the X-ray spectra of gamma Cas stars will thus allow to distinguish between the competing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent model of cosmic ray penetration into molecular clouds: Effect of energy losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of cosmic-ray (CR) penetration into dense molecular clouds developed recently for relativistic particles by Chernyshov et al. (2024) is extended to non-relativistic CRs. Interstellar CRs streaming into the clouds are able to resonantly excite MHD waves in diffuse cloud envelopes. This leads to the self-modulation, such that streaming particles are scattered at the self-generated waves. In contrast to relativistic CRs, transport of lower-energy particles in the envelopes is generally heavily affected by ionization losses; furthermore, both CR protons and electrons contribute to wave excitation. We show that these effects have profound impact on the self-modulation, and can dramatically reduce CR spectra even for clouds with moderate column densities of a few times $10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>Optimising the MeerKAT Pulsar Timing Array and towards precision pulsar timing with SKA-mid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are Galactic-scale nanohertz-frequency gravitational wave (GW) detectors. Recently, several PTAs have found evidence for the presence of GWs in their datasets, but none of them have achieved a community-defined definitive (&gt; 5$\sigma$) detection. Here, we identify limiting noise sources for PTAs and quantify their impact on sensitivity to GWs under different observing and noise modelling strategies. First, we search for intrinsic pulse jitter in a sample of 89 MSPs observed by the MeerKAT Pulsar Timing Array and obtain new jitter measurements for 20 MSPs. We then forecast jitter noise in pulsars for the future SKA-Mid telescope, finding that the timing precision of many of the best-timed MSPs would be dominated by jitter noise. We then consider dispersion measure variations from the interstellar medium and find that their effects are best mitigated by modelling them as a stationary Gaussian process with a power-law spectrum. Improving upon the established hasasia code for PTA sensitivity analysis, we assess the timing potential of the lower frequency UHF-band (544$-$1088\,MHz) of MeerKAT and find a potential increase in GW background sensitivity by $\approx 8$\%, relative to observing at L-band. We show that this improvement relies on assumptions on the propagation through the interstellar medium, and highlight that if observing frequency-dependent propagation effects, such as scattering noise, are present, where noise is not completely correlated across observing frequency, then the improvement is significantly diminished. Using the multi-frequency receivers and sub-arraying flexibility of MeerKAT, we find that focussed, high-cadence observations of the best MSPs can enhance the sensitivity of the array for both the continuous GWs and stochastic GWB. These results highlight the role of MeerKAT and the MPTA in the context of international GW search efforts.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Nearest Ancient Sloshing Cold Front in the Sky with XMM-Newton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Virgo Cluster is the nearest cool core cluster that features two well-studied sloshing cold fronts at radii of $r \approx 30$ kpc and $r \approx 90$ kpc, respectively. In this work, we present results of XMM-Newton mosaic observations of a third, southwestern, cold front at a radius of $r \approx 250$ kpc, originally discovered with Suzaku. All three cold fronts are likely to be parts of an enormous swirling pattern, rooted in the core. The comparison with a numerical simulation of a binary cluster merger indicates that these cold fronts were produced in the same single event $-$ likely the infall of M49 from the northwest of Virgo and it is now re-entering the cluster from the south. This outermost cold front has probably survived for $2-3$ Gyr since the disturbance. We identified single sharp edges in the surface brightness profiles of the southern and southwestern sections of the cold front, whereas the western section is better characterized with double edges. This implies that magnetic fields have preserved the leading edge of the cold front, while its western side is beginning to split into two cold fronts likely due to Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. The slopes of the 2D power spectrum of the X-ray surface brightness fluctuations, derived for the brighter side of the cold front, are consistent with the expectation from Kolmogorov turbulence. Our findings highlight the role of cold fronts in shaping the thermal dynamics of the intracluster medium beyond the cluster core, which has important implications for cluster cosmology. Next-generation X-ray observatories, such as the proposed AXIS mission, will be ideal for identifying and characterizing ancient cold fronts.</description>

      <title>HESS J1831$-$098 -- Exploring a pulsar halo scenario with H.E.S.S. data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar halos are a class of extended very-high-energy (VHE) sources highlighted by the HAWC observatory towards the Geminga pulsar and PSR B0656$+$14. These VHE sources are interpreted as the inverse Compton emission from electrons and positrons diffusing in the interstellar medium at an inhibited rate, having escaped the pulsar wind nebula. Our aim is to search for new pulsar halos using H.E.S.S. data and to constrain their physical properties. Using a physically-motivated model of pulsar halos, we created template-based models of the spatial and energetic distributions of the expected gamma-ray emission using the Gammapy library. A promising candidate source to which this model can be effectively applied is HESS J1831$-$098, an extended VHE source spatially coincident with two energetic pulsars, which also exhibits spectral continuity and morphological compatibility with the ultra-high-energy source 1LHAASO J1831$-$1007u*. It could be powered by the radio pulsar PSR J1831$-$0952 with a characteristic age of 128 kyr. We present a spectro-morphological analysis of this source with H.E.S.S. data, revealing that the emission is well described with a pulsar halo model, although we cannot reject a simple 2D Gaussian morphology. We discuss the implication of the derived physical parameters of the model.</description>

      <title>The Entangled Feedback Impacts of Supernovae in Coarse- versus High-Resolution Galaxy Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is often understood that supernova (SN) feedback in galaxies is responsible for regulating star formation and generating gaseous outflows. However, a detailed look at their effect on the local interstellar medium (ISM) on small mass scales in simulations shows that these processes proceed in clearly distinct channels. We demonstrate this finding in two independent simulations with solar-mass resolution, LYRA and RIGEL, of an isolated dwarf galaxy. Focusing on the immediate environment surrounding SNe, our findings suggest that the large-scale effect of a given SN on the galaxy is best predicted by its immediate local density. Outflows are driven by SNe in diffuse regions expanding to their cooling radii on large ($\sim$ kpc) scales, while dense star-forming regions are disrupted in a localized (\sim pc) manner. However, these separate feedback channels are only distinguishable at very high numerical resolutions capable of following scales $\ll 10^3 M_\odot$. On larger scales, ISM densities are greatly mis-estimated, and differences between local environments of SNe become severely washed out. We demonstrate the practical implications of this effect by comparing with a mid-resolution simulation ($M_{\rm ptcl.} \sim 200 M_\odot$) of the same dwarf using the SMUGGLE model. The coarse-resolution simulation cannot self-consistently determine whether a given SN is responsible for generating outflows or suppressing star formation, suggesting that emergent galaxy physics such as star formation regulation through hot-phase outflows is fundamentally unresolvable by subgrid stellar feedback models, without appealing directly to simulations with highly resolved ISM.</description>

      <title>Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals in relativistic accretion discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute relativistic Lindblad torques for circular, equatorial extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) embedded in relativistic thin accretion discs, including spinning black hole configurations. We find that relativistic effects can amplify the magnitude of these torques by orders of magnitude in the strong-field regime, and that the torque can even reverse direction as the EMRI approaches the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). However, we show that the location of this reversal is highly spin-dependent, shifting progressively closer to the ISCO, where gravitational-wave emission completely dominates the inspiral, as the spin of the central black hole increases. Spin also modifies the radial dependence of the Lindblad torques. We investigate whether Lindblad torques can be approximated by parametrised power laws of the form T_LR = A(r_s / 10M)^n_r (or combinations thereof), and find significant spin- and disc-dependent variations in the slope parameter n_r. For instance, for spin a/M = 0.9, we find n_r = 3.6 in the strong-field regime, compared to the Newtonian value of n_r = 4.5. Given current forecasts of parameter recovery for ``golden'', loud EMRIs in accretion discs (\Delta n_r ~ 0.5), we predict LISA could distinguish between different disc configurations through their relativistic Lindblad torque signatures, providing the first direct probe of the midplane structure of the inner region of accretion discs, which is inaccessible to electromagnetic observations.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binaries are excellent probes of gravity in the strong- and dynamical-field regime. We report a test of general relativity (GR) with the third GW Transient Catalog (GWTC-3) using the recently developed neural post-Einsteinian framework, both on individual events and at the population level through hierarchical modeling. We find no significant violation of GR and place a constraint that, for the first time, efficiently covers non-GR theories characterized by not only post-Newtonian deviations but also those beyond under the same theory-agnostic framework.</description>

      <title>Self-lensing binaries in globular clusters -- predictions for ELT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-lensing (SL) represents a powerful technique for detecting compact objects in binary systems through gravitational microlensing effects, when a compact companion transits in front of its luminous partner. We present the first comprehensive study of SL probability within globular cluster (GC) environments, utilizing synthetic stellar populations from MOCCA simulations to predict detection rates for the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). Our analysis incorporates finite-size lens effects for white dwarf (WD) lenses and the specific observational characteristics of the ELT/MICADO instrument. We find that present-day GCs contain 1-50 SL sources with magnifications $\mu_\mathrm{sl} &gt; 1+10^{-8}$, strongly dependent on initial binary fraction, with systems dominated by WD lenses paired with low-mass main-sequence companions. The predicted populations exhibit characteristic bimodal magnitude distributions with peaks at $m \approx 24$ and 32 mag at 10 kpc distance, and typical Einstein ring crossing times of $\tau_\mathrm{eff} \sim 2$ hours. ELT observations should achieve detection efficiency of 0.015-10 sources in $\sim150$ nearby GC after a year of observations depending on distance and survey strategy, with nearby clusters ($D \lesssim 10$ kpc) offering the highest yields. Multi-year monitoring campaigns with daily cadence provide order-of-magnitude improvements over single observations through enhanced photometric precision and increased detection probability. Our results demonstrate that coordinated ELT surveys of Galactic GCs represent a viable approach for probing hidden binary populations and compact object demographics in dense stellar environments, with comprehensive programs potentially yielding up to 10-100 well-characterized SL sources after first 5 years of observations suitable for statistical studies of binary evolution in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Wide-field GMRT imaging of X-shaped Radio-Galaxies: Spectral properties of 4C32.25 and 4C61.23</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present wide-field upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) images of the fields around the X-shaped radio-galaxies (XRGs) 4C32.25, 4C61.23, and MRC 2011-298 obtained at 400 MHz. The observations are calibrated using the extreme peeling method to account for direction-dependent effects across the field of view, as previously applied to Low-frequency array (LOFAR) data. Our 400 MHz images capture in fine detail the radio-morphology of the XRGs, as well as other serendipitous radio-sources located in these fields. We use these images along with archival low-frequencyand high-frequency radio data to investigate the spectral properties of the XRGs 4C32.25 and 4C61.23. Under the assumption of conditions corresponding to the maximum radio-source age, we estimate the spectral ages of both the primary lobes and the wings. These ages indicate that the wings are the oldest component of the XRGs and are a product of past radio activity. Moreover, we have used the radio images available to derive high-resolution spectral index maps for these two XRGs. We find that the spectral index steepens from the primary lobes towards the wings, consistent with our spectral age estimates. These results suggest that precessional and backflow models explain the X-shaped radio-morphology of 4C32.25 and 4C61.23, respectively. Finally, taking advantage of our wide-area images, we identify several serendipitous diffuse radio-sources located in our XRG fields and cross-reference them with previous surveys.</description>

      <title>Dust scattering halo of 4U 1630-47: High resolution X-ray and mm observations constrain source and molecular cloud distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We re-investigated the distance to the black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630-47 by analyzing its dust scattering halo (DSH) using high-resolution X-ray (Chandra) and millimeter (APEX) observations. Dust scattering halos form when X-rays from a compact source are scattered by interstellar dust, creating diffuse ring-like structures that can provide clues about the source's distance. Our previous work suggested two possible distances: 4.9 kpc and 11.5 kpc, but uncertainties remained due to low-resolution CO maps. We developed a new methodology to refine these estimates, starting with a machine learning approach to determine a 3D representation of molecular clouds from the APEX dataset. The 3D maps are combined with X-ray flux measurements to generate synthetic DSH images. By comparing synthetic images with the observed Chandra data through radial and azimuthal profile fitting, we not only measure the source distance but also distinguish whether the molecular clouds are at their near or far distances. The current analysis again supported a distance of 11.5 kpc over alternative estimates. While the method produced a lower reduced chi-squared for both the azimuthal and radial fits for a distance of 13.6 kpc, we ruled it out as it would have produced a bright ring beyond the APEX field of view, which is not seen in the Chandra image. The 4.85 kpc estimate was also excluded due to poor fit quality and cloud distance conflicts. The systematic error of 1 kpc, arising from uncertainties in determining molecular cloud distances, dominates the total error.</description>

      <title>Robust magnetic field estimates in star-forming galaxies with the equipartition formula in the absence of equipartition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equipartition model is widely used to estimate magnetic field strength from synchrotron intensity in radio galaxies, yet the validity of its underlying assumptions remains uncertain. Using an Arepo simulation which incorporates a two-moment cosmic ray (CR) transport scheme and a multiphase interstellar medium, we compare magnetic fields inferred from synthetic synchrotron emission maps with the true fields in the simulation. Starting from the derivation of the equipartition formula, we find that the deviation between the equipartition magnetic field and the true magnetic field depends only weakly on the ratio of the magnetic to the CR energy density. In practice, for both face-on and edge-on projections, the equipartition model slightly overestimates the total synchrotron-weighted magnetic field with mean offsets of 32% (0.17 dex) and 36% (0.2 dex), even though the energy equipartition does not hold locally. Beyond these average offsets, a clear trend emerges in edge-on projections that the model underestimates the field in the disk and overestimates it in the halo. Our results demonstrate that the validity of the equipartition model depends only weakly on the strict fulfillment of energy equipartition, and that the equipartition model remains a practical method for estimating magnetic field strengths in face-on projection maps based on our CR-magnetohydrodynamics simulation.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Role of Intrinsic Variability in Black Hole Parameter Inference using Multi-Epoch EHT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of M87* provide a means of constraining parameters of both the black hole and its surrounding plasma. However, intrinsic variability of the emitting material introduces a major source of systematic uncertainty, complicating parameter inference. The precise origin and structure of this variability remain uncertain, and previous studies have largely relied on general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations to estimate its effects. Here, we fit a semi-analytic, dual-cone model of the emitting plasma to multiple years of EHT observations to empirically assess the impact of intrinsic variability and improved array coverage on key measurements including the black hole mass-to-distance ratio, spin, and viewing inclination. Despite substantial differences in the images of the two epochs, we find that the inferred mass-to-distance ratio remains stable and mutually consistent. The black hole spin is unconstrained for both observations, despite the improved baseline coverage in 2018. The inferred position angle and inclination of the black hole spin axis are discrepant between the two years, suggesting that variability and model misspecification contribute significantly to the total error budget for these quantities. Our findings highlight both the promise and challenges of multi-epoch EHT observations: while they can refine parameter constraints, they also reveal the limitations of simple parametric models in capturing the full complexity of the source. Our analysis -- the first to fit semi-analytic emission models to 2018 EHT observations -- underscores the importance of systematic uncertainty quantification from intrinsic variability in future high-resolution imaging studies of black hole environments and the role of repeated observations in quantifying these uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Crust composition and the Shallow Heat Source in KS 1731-260</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of a strong shallow heat source of unknown origin in accreting neutron star crusts has been inferred by analyzing X-ray observations of their cooling in quiescence. We model the cooling of KS 1731-260 using realistic crust compositions and nuclear heating and cooling sources from detailed nuclear reaction network calculations. We find that the required strength of the shallow heat source in KS 1731-260 is reduced by more than a factor of 3 compared to previous analysis, a 5-sigma difference that alleviates the need for exotic solutions. Our analysis also suggests the existence of an impure nuclear pasta layer in the inner crust of KS 1731-260 though future observations will provide more stringent constraints. In addition, we obtain constraints on the dominant surface burning modes of KS 1731-260 over its history.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15-Year Data Set: Improved Timing Precision With VLBI Astrometric Priors</title>

Abstract: Accurate pulsar astrometric estimates play an essential role in almost all high-precision pulsar timing experiments. Traditional pulsar timing techniques refine these estimates by including them as free parameters when fitting a model to observed pulse time-of-arrival measurements. However, reliable sub-milliarcsecond astrometric estimations require years of observations and, even then, power from red noise can be inadvertently absorbed into astrometric parameter fits, biasing the resulting estimations and reducing our sensitivity to red noise processes, including gravitational waves (GWs). In this work, we seek to mitigate these shortcomings by using pulsar astrometric estimates derived from Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) as priors for the timing fit. First, we calibrated a frame tie to account for the offsets between the reference frames used in VLBI and timing. Then, we used the VLBI-informed priors and timing-based likelihoods of several astrometric solutions consistent with both techniques to obtain a maximum-posterior astrometric solution. We found offsets between our results and the timing-based astrometric solutions, which, if real, would lead to absorption of spectral power at frequencies of interest for single-source GW searches. However, we do not find significant power absorption due to astrometric fitting at the low-frequency domain of the GW background.</description>

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic events in the universe, offering insights into stellar collapse, extreme matter behavior, and cosmic evolution. The advent of multi-messenger astronomy, combining electromagnetic, gravitational wave, and neutrino observations, alongside advances in high-energy polarimetry, is revolutionizing GRB research, enabling deeper exploration of their physical mechanisms.
  This manuscript summarizes how upcoming and proposed space-based missions will tackle key challenges in GRB science, focusing on four areas: (i) identifying high-redshift GRBs to probe the early universe, (ii) enhancing multi-messenger detection and localization, (iii) improving multi-wavelength follow-up of GRB afterglows, and (iv) studying prompt emission polarization to understand jet dynamics and magnetic fields. Highlighting planned missions and their advancements, this work provides a snapshot of current GRB research frontiers, with updates on the evolving status of these missions.</description>

      <title>Pan-STARRS follow-up of the gravitational-wave event S250818k and the lightcurve of SN 2025ulz</title>

Abstract: Kilonovae are the scientifically rich, but observationally elusive, optical transient phenomena associated with compact binary mergers. Only a handful of events have been discovered to date, all through multi-wavelength (gamma ray) and multi-messenger (gravitational wave) signals. Given their scarcity, it is important to maximise the discovery possibility of new kilonova events. To this end, we present our follow-up observations of the gravitational-wave signal, S250818k, a plausible binary neutron star merger at a distance of $237 \pm 62$ Mpc. Pan-STARRS tiled 286 and 318 square degrees (32% and 34% of the 90% sky localisation region) within 3 and 7 days of the GW signal, respectively. ATLAS covered 70% of the skymap within 3 days, but with lower sensitivity. These observations uncovered 47 new transients; however, none were deemed to be linked to S250818k. We undertook an expansive follow-up campaign of AT 2025ulz, the purported counterpart to S250818k. The griz-band lightcurve, combined with our redshift measurement ($z = 0.0849 \pm 0.0003$) all indicate that SN 2025ulz is a SN IIb, and thus not the counterpart to S250818k. We rule out the presence of a AT 2017gfo-like kilonova within $\approx 27$% of the distance posterior sampled by our Pan-STARRS pointings ($\approx 9.1$% across the total 90% three-dimensional sky localisation). We demonstrate that early observations are optimal for probing the distance posterior of the three-dimensional gravitational-wave skymap, and that SN 2025ulz was a plausible kilonova candidate for $\lesssim 5$ days, before ultimately being ruled out.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Inference of the Structure and Orbit of Milky Way Satellites with Semi-Analytic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semi-analytic modeling furnishes an efficient avenue for characterizing the properties of dark matter halos associated with satellites of Milky Way-like systems, as it easily accounts for uncertainties arising from halo-to-halo variance, the orbital disruption of satellites, baryonic feedback, and the stellar-to-halo mass (SMHM) relation. We use the SatGen semi-analytic satellite generator -- which incorporates both empirical models of the galaxy-halo connection in the field as well as analytic prescriptions for the orbital evolution of these satellites after they enter a host galaxy -- to create large samples of Milky Way-like systems and their satellites. By selecting satellites in the sample that match the observed properties of a particular dwarf galaxy, we can then infer arbitrary properties of the satellite galaxy within the Cold Dark Matter paradigm. For the Milky Way's classical dwarfs, we provide inferred values (with associated uncertainties) for the maximum circular velocity $v_{max}$ and the radius $r_{max}$ at which it occurs, varying over two choices of feedback model and two prescriptions for the SMHM relation that populate dark matter halos with physically distinct galaxies. While simple empirical scaling relations can recover the median inferred value for $v_{max}$ and $r_{max}$, this approach provides realistic correlated uncertainties and aids interpretability through variation of the model. For these different models, we also demonstrate how the internal properties of a satellite's dark matter profile correlate with its orbit, and we show that it is difficult to reproduce observations of the Fornax dwarf without strong baryonic feedback. The technique developed in this work is flexible in its application of observational data and can leverage arbitrary information about the satellite galaxies to make inferences about their dark matter halos and population statistics.</description>

      <title>Properties of general stationary axisymmetric spacetimes: circularity and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse properties of general stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes, with a particular focus on circularity -- an accidental symmetry enjoyed by the Kerr metric, and therefore widely assumed when searching for rotating black hole solutions in alternative theories of gravity as well as when constructing models of Kerr mimickers. Within a gauge specified by seven (or six) free functions, the local existence of which we prove, we solve the differential circularity conditions and translate them into algebraic relations among the metric components. This result opens the way to investigating the consequences of circularity breaking in a controlled manner. In particular, we construct two simple analytical examples of non-circular deformations of the Kerr spacetime. The first one is "minimal", since the horizon and the ergosphere are identical to their Kerr counterparts, except for the fact that the horizon is not Killing and its surface gravity is therefore not constant. The second is "not so minimal", as the horizon's profile can be chosen arbitrarily and the difference between the horizon and the so-called rotosurface can be appreciated. Our findings thus pave the way for further research into the phenomenology of non-circular stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Generic EFT-motivated beyond General Relativity gravitational wave tests and their curvature dependence: from observation to interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a "dictionary" to expedite the identification of potential deviations in gravitational waveforms from those predicted by General Relativity (GR) during the inspiral phase of black hole binaries. Assuming deviations from GR can be described by a local Effective Field Theory (EFT) formulated in terms of curvature operators (and possibly additional scalar fields), this dictionary characterizes how deviations scale with the masses of the binary components and identifies the leading order Post-Newtonian corrections in generic theories constructed within the EFT framework. By establishing a direct connection between observations and candidate theories beyond GR, this dictionary also aids in distinguishing genuine physical effects from systematic errors. These results can be readily incorporated into essentially all existing tests for the inspiral regime and, in particular, facilitate a more efficient combination of data from multiple events.</description>

      <title>Gluon Condensation as a Unifying Mechanism for Special Spectra of Cosmic Gamma Rays and Low-Momentum Pion Enhancement at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decoding the internal structure of the proton is a fundamental challenge in physics. Historically, any new discovery about the proton has fuelled advances in several scientific fields. We have reported that gluons inside the proton accumulate near the critical momentum due to chaotic phenomena, forming gluon condensation. Surprisingly, the pion distribution predicted by this gluon distribution for the production of high-energy proton collisions could answer two puzzles in astronomy and high-energy physics. We find that during ultrahigh-energy cosmic ray collisions, gluon condensation may abruptly produce a large number of low-momentum pions, whose electromagnetic decays have the typical breakout properties appearing in various cosmic gamma-ray spectra. On the other hand, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which is well below the cosmic ray energy scale, also shows weak but recognisable signs of gluon condensation, which had been mistaken for BEC pions. The connection between these two phenomena, which occur at different scales in the Universe, supports the existence of a new structure within the proton-gluon condensation.</description>
