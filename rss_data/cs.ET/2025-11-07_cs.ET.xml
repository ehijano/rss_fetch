      <title>OpenMENA: An Open-Source Memristor Interfacing and Compute Board for Neuromorphic Edge-AI Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memristive crossbars enable in-memory multiply-accumulate and local plasticity learning, offering a path to energy-efficient edge AI. To this end, we present Open-MENA (Open Memristor-in-Memory Accelerator), which, to our knowledge, is the first fully open memristor interfacing system integrating (i) a reproducible hardware interface for memristor crossbars with mixed-signal read-program-verify loops; (ii) a firmware-software stack with high-level APIs for inference and on-device learning; and (iii) a Voltage-Incremental Proportional-Integral (VIPI) method to program pre-trained weights into analog conductances, followed by chip-in-the-loop fine-tuning to mitigate device non-idealities. OpenMENA is validated on digit recognition, demonstrating the flow from weight transfer to on-device adaptation, and on a real-world robot obstacle-avoidance task, where the memristor-based model learns to map localization inputs to motor commands. OpenMENA is released as open source to democratize memristor-enabled edge-AI research.</description>

      <title>Implementation of transformer-based LLMs with large-scale optoelectronic neurons on a CMOS image sensor platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent rapid deployment of datacenter infrastructures for performing large language models (LLMs) and related artificial intelligence (AI) applications in the clouds is predicted to incur an exponentially growing energy consumption in the near-term future. In this paper, we propose and analyze the implementation of the transformer model, which is the cornerstone of the modern LLMs, with novel large-scale optoelectronic neurons (OENs) constructed over the commercially available complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor (CIS) platform. With all of the required optoelectronic devices and electronic circuits integrated in a chiplet only about 2 cm by 3 cm in size, 175 billon parameters in the case of GPT-3 are shown to perform inference at an unprecedented speed of 12.6 POPS using only a 40 nm CMOS process node, along with a high power efficiency of 74 TOPS/W and a high area efficiency of 19 TOPS/mm2, both surpassing the related digital electronics by roughly two orders of magnitude. The influence of the quantization formats and the hardware induced errors are numerically investigated, and are shown to have a minimal impact. Our study presents a new yet practical path toward analog neural processing units (NPUs) to complement existing digital processing units.</description>

      <title>Human Resource Management and AI: A Contextual Transparency Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI tools are proliferating in human resources management (HRM) and recruiting, helping to mediate access to the labor market. As these systems spread, profession-specific transparency needs emerging from black-boxed systems in HRM move into focus. Prior work often frames transparency technically or abstractly, but we contend AI transparency is a social project shaped by materials, meanings, and competencies of practice. This paper introduces the Talent Acquisition and Recruiting AI (TARAI) Index, situating AI systems within the social practice of recruiting by examining product functionality, claims, assumptions, and AI clarity. Built through an iterative, mixed-methods process, the database demonstrates how transparency emerges: not as a fixed property, but as a dynamic outcome shaped by professional practices, interactions, and competencies. By centering social practice, our work offers a grounded, actionable approach to understanding and articulating AI transparency in HR and provides a blueprint for participatory database design for contextual transparency in professional practice.</description>

      <title>Self-correcting High-speed Opto-electronic Probabilistic Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel self-correcting, high-speed optoelectronic probabilistic computer architecture that leverages source-device independent (SDI) quantum photonic p-bits integrated with robust electronic control. Our approach combines the intrinsic randomness and high bandwidth of quantum photonics with the programmability and scal- ability of classical electronics, enabling efficient and flexible probabilistic computation. We detail the design and implementation of a prototype system based on photonic integrated circuits and FPGA-based control, capable of implementing and manipulating 64000 logical p-bits. Experimental results demonstrate that our architecture achieves a flip rate of 2.7 x 10^9 flips/s with an energy consumption of 4.9 nJ/flip, representing nearly three orders of magnitude improvement in speed and energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art magnetic tunnel junc- tion (MTJ) based systems. Furthermore, the SDI protocol enables real-time self-certification and error correction, ensuring reliable operation across a wide range of conditions and solving the problem of hardware variability as the number of p-bits scale. Our results establish quantum photonic p-bits as a promising platform for scalable, high-performance probabilistic computing, with significant implications for combinatorial optimization, machine learning, and complex system modeling.</description>

      <title>On the solvable-unsolvable transition due to noise-induced chaos in digital memcomputing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital memcomputing machines (DMMs) have been designed to solve complex combinatorial optimization problems. Since DMMs are fundamentally classical dynamical systems, their ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can be efficiently simulated on modern computers. This provides a unique platform to study their performance under various conditions. An aspect that has received little attention so far is how their performance is affected by the numerical errors in the solution of their ODEs and the physical noise they would be naturally subject to if built in hardware. Here, we analyze these two aspects in detail by varying the integration time step (numerical noise) and adding stochastic perturbations (physical noise) into the equations of DMMs. We are particularly interested in understanding how noise induces a chaotic transition that marks the shift from successful problem-solving to failure in these systems. Our study includes an analysis of power spectra and Lyapunov exponents depending on the noise strength. The results reveal a correlation between the instance solvability and the sign of the ensemble averaged mean largest Lyapunov exponent. Interestingly, we find a regime in which DMMs with positive mean largest Lyapunov exponents still exhibit solvability. Furthermore, the power spectra provide additional information about our system by distinguishing between regular behavior (peaks) and chaotic behavior (broadband spectrum). Therefore, power spectra could be utilized to control whether a DMM operates in the optimal dynamical regime. Overall, we find that the qualitative effects of numerical and physical noise are mostly similar, despite their fundamentally different origin.</description>
