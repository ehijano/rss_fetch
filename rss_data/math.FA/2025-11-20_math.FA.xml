      <title>Va\u{i}nberg--Br\`{e}gman geometry and quasinonexpansive operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain an array of new results in the theory of Va\u{i}nberg--Br\`{e}gman relative entropies and quasinonexpansive operators on reflexive Banach spaces, and we also develop an extension of this theory to nonreflexive Banach spaces, providing a joint generalisation of the reflexive approach with the finite-dimensional information geometric approach. In the reflexive case, we study generalised pythagorean inequality, as well as norm-to-norm, uniform, and Lipschitz--H\"{o}lder continuity of entropic projections, proximal maps, and resolvents. We also provide a detailed account of the family of Va\u{i}nberg--Br\`{e}gman geometries that are naturally encoding the geometric properties of the underlying Banach space norm. The extended theory belongs to the intersection of convex theoretic and homeomorphic approaches to nonlinear analysis. Its models are constructed using integration theory on order unit spaces. Our main focus is on geometry of, and nonlinear quasinonexpansive operators on, normal state spaces of JBW- and W*-algebras, modelled via nonlinear embeddings into reflexive rearrangement invariant spaces. For example, we analyse the extended Va\u{i}nberg--Br\`{e}gman geometries induced by norm geometry of noncommutative and nonassociative L$_p$ spaces via Mazur embeddings, providing sufficient conditions for monoidal composability of extended quasinonexpansive operators, and computing the exponent parameters of Lipschitz--H\"{o}lder continuity of the corresponding extended entropic projections and resolvents. Other models feature the (commutative and noncommutative) Lozanovski\u{i} factorisation map, generalised spin factors, finite dimensional base normed spaces, and convex spectral functions on unitarily invariant ideals of compact operators. We also discuss several categories of entropic projections and quasinonexpansive operators naturally appearing in this framework.</description>

      <title>Dyadic fractional Sobolev spaces: Embeddings and algebra property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a dyadic version of fractional Sobolev spaces in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n\geq 1$. It provides new proofs of the corresponding fractional Sobolev embedding as well as the algebra property of the spaces, which rely solely on dyadic techniques and in particular bypass the Fourier transform. Specific counterexamples are constructed to verify the failure of the algebra property in low-regularity ranges.</description>

      <title>Lie structures of the group of Sheffer operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Phi$ be an (LB)-space over $\mathbb F=\mathbb R$ or $\mathbb C$, and let $\Phi'$ be the dual space of $\Phi$. We study the set $\mathbb S(\Phi)$ of Sheffer operators acting in polynomials on $\Phi'$, cf.\ [16,\,18]. We prove that $\mathbb S(\Phi)$ is a group for the usual product of operators. We equip $\mathbb S(\Phi)$ with a natural topology which makes $\mathbb S(\Phi)$ into an infinite-dimensional manifold with a global parametrization. We show that $\mathbb S(\Phi)$ is an infinite-dimensional, regular Lie group, and provide an explicit description of the Lie algebra of $\mathbb S(\Phi)$, including an explicit form of the Lie bracket on it. Our main results are new even in the one-dimensional case, $\Phi=\mathbb{F}$. Furthermore, our results lead to improved understanding of the Lie algebra of the Riordan group, cf.\ [8].</description>

      <title>Transformation from integral operator with separable kernel to matrix in eigenvalue problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the eigenvalue problem of integral operators whose kernels can be expressed as a finite sum of pairwise products of single-variable functions, making them separable. By consdiering the matrix form of the separable kernel in the integral operator, we establish the relationship between the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the integral operator and the eigenpairs of a matrix. We next generalize the eigenfunction of an integral operator based on the concept of generalized eigenvectors of matrices, and show that solving the Fredholm integral equation of the second kind reduces to computing matrix eigenpairs and generalized eigenvectors. We also provide several examples to validate our results.</description>

      <title>On relationship among three types of Birkhoff-James orthogonality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study three types of Birkhoff-James orthogonality in Hilbert $C^*$-modules, that is, the strong, quasi-strong, and original Birkhoff-James orthogonality. In general, the strong Birkhoff-James orthogonality is stronger than the quasi-strong Birkhoff-James orthogonality, and the quasi-strong Birkhoff-James orthogonality is stronger than the original Birkhoff-James orthogonality. Meanwhile, each reverse implication in this chain requires additional conditions. As the main results, we show that the strong and quasi-strong Birkhoff-James orthogonality are equivalent in a full Hilbert $C^*$-module if and only if the underlying $C^*$-algebra is commutative, and that the equivalence of the quasi-strong and original Birkhoff-James orthogonality in a full Hilbert $C^*$-module implies the primeness of the underlying $C^*$-algebra. Moreover, two examples, explaining the complexity of conditions for full Hilbert $C^*$-modules in which the quasi-strong and original Birkhoff-James orthogonality are equivalent, are given in the $C^*$-algebra settings.</description>

      <title>Properties of IFS attractors with non-empty interiors, related rough domains, and associated function spaces and scattering problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fractal sets $\Gamma\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ with non-empty interior $\Omega$, that are attractors of iterated function systems (IFSs) of contracting similarities satisfying the open set condition. Examples for $n=2$ are the closures of the Koch snowflake domain and the Gosper island domain. Our first result is that $\Omega$ is thick in the sense of Triebel. A consequence is that $C_0^\infty(\Omega)$ is dense in the Sobolev space $H^s_\Gamma:= \{\phi\in H^s(\mathbb{R}^n): \mathrm{supp}(\phi)\subset \Gamma\}$ for all $s\in\mathbb{R}$. Our second result, accompanied by results on pointwise multiplication by characteristic functions and uniform extension operators, is that the spaces $\{H^s(\Omega)\}_{s\in \mathbb{R}}$, where $H^s(\Omega):=\{\phi|_\Omega: u\in H^s(\mathbb{R}^n)\}$, form an interpolation scale. This is established as a special case of new extension and interpolation results for Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces, applying to large classes of domains $\Omega$ that are thick and have boundary with Assouad dimension $&lt;n$. Our third contribution is to prove best approximation error estimates in fractional negative-order Sobolev spaces for piecewise constant approximations on a ``fractal mesh'' of $\Gamma$, generated by the IFS, in which the mesh elements are self-similar copies of $\Gamma$. As an application we study sound-soft acoustic scattering in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ by the fractal screen $\Gamma\times \{0\}$. Using our density result we prove that the standard PDE formulation of this problem is equivalent to the standard first kind boundary integral equation in which the boundary condition is imposed by restriction to the (relative) interior of the screen. To solve this equation we consider a piecewise-constant Galerkin boundary element method on a fractal mesh, and, using our best approximation error estimates, we prove convergence rates for the Galerkin approximation.</description>

      <title>Matrix Zakharov-Shabat Systems with Zero Diagonal Entry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we develop the direct and inverse scattering theory of the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS) system $\bv_x=(ik\zS+\CQ(x))\bv$, where $\zS$ is a diagonal $n\times n$ matrix with diagonal entries $1$ and $-1$ and a single zero diagonal entry and $\CQ(x)$ is an $n\times n$ potential anticommuting with $\zS$ with entries in $L^1(\R)$. We derive the time evolution of the scattering data which, through the inverse scattering transform, lead to the solution of the initial-value problem for a system of long-wave-short-wave equations.</description>

      <title>Beyond Tchakaloff Quadrature: Positive Functionals, Frames and Widths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tchakaloff's theorem from 1957 asserts the existence of exact quadrature rules with non-negative weights for any polynomial space of finite degree on $\mathbb{R}^d$ if the underlying measure is positive, compactly supported, and absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure. This classical result coined the term Tchakaloff quadrature for quadrature that is exact and only uses non-negative weights. It has been a long-standing endeavor, under which conditions such rules exist. A final answer was given in 2012 by Bisgaard with the insight that, in fact, every finite-dimensional space of integrable functions on a positive measure space admits them. In this article we recall this result and provide a major extension to the question of positive discretizability of $\mathbb{C}$-linear functionals on finite-dimensional spaces. We introduce the notion of strict $S$-positivity for such functionals, where $S$ are subsets of the functional's domain, and show the equivalence of positive discretizability to being strictly $S$-positive for a suitable choice of $S$. We further investigate consequences for other discretization problems. One fundamental implication is the guaranteed existence of $L_p$-Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund equalities in finite-dimensional spaces of $p$-integrable functions in case that $p$ is an even integer, another the exact discretizability of any frame in $\mathbb{K}^n$, where $\mathbb{K}\in\{\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}\}$, if a rescaling of the frame elements is allowed. In addition, we provide bounds for Tchakaloff quadrature widths $\kappa_n^+$ and, addressing the question of constructibility of discretization points, establish a connection to $D$-optimal design.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of normal operators that generate certain scalable iterative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A\colon H\rightarrow H$ be a normal operator on an infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert space $H$ and let $S\subseteq H$ be a finite subset such that $\{A^nx\}_{n\geq 0,\,x\in S}$ can be rescaled to form a frame for $H$. That is, there exist some subsets $J_x\subseteq \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$ and some set of nonzero scalars $(c_{n,x})_{n\in J_x,\,x\in S}$ such that $\{c_{n,x}A^nx\}_{n\in J_x,\,x\in S}$ forms a frame for $H.$ Assume that there exist some $\eta\in\mathbb{N}$ and $\delta&gt;0$ such that for each infinite $J_x$ there is an increasing syndetic subsequence $(n^x_{k})_{k\in \mathbb{N}}\subseteq J_x$ satisfying $|c_{n^x_{k},x}|\|A^{i^x_{k}}x\|\geq \delta$ for some non-negative integers $i^x_{k}$ with $|i^x_{k}- n^x_{k}|\leq \eta$ for all $k\in \mathbb{N}$. We prove that there exist finitely many numbers $(r_i)_{i=1}^N$ such that the continuous spectrum of $A$ is concentrated on arcs of a circle centered at origin with radius $r_i$. In particular, $A$ must be a diagonal operator if $S$ is a singleton.
  As an application, we establish the conjecture proposed by Aldroubi et al.\ asserting that the iterative system $\{\frac{A^nx}{\|A^nx\|}\}_{n\geq 0,\,x\in S}$ is never a frame for $H$, provided one of the following two conditions holds: (i) The continuous spectrum of $A$ contains more than $|S|-1$ points with distinct moduli; (ii) $S$ is a singleton and $A$ is not a diagonal operator</description>

      <title>A strong quantitative form of the fractional isoperimetric inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show a strong version of the fractional quantitative isoperimetric inequality, in which the isoperimetric deficit controls not only the Fraenkel asymmetry but also a sort of oscillation of the boundary. This generalizes the local result by Fusco and Julin in \cite{FJ}. The proof follows a regularization process as in \cite{FJ} but it is quite different in its spirit. Then, as a consequence of the quantitative inequality, we prove some stability estimates for a fractional Cheeger inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(\mu, \Lambda)$ be the canonical spectral pair generated by a Hadamard triple $(N,B,L)$ in $\mathbb{R}$ with $0\in B \cap L$, which means that the family $\big\{ e_\lambda(x)=e^{2\pi \mathrm{i} \lambda x}: \lambda \in \Lambda \big\}$ forms an orthonormal basis in $L^2(\mu)$.We prove that if $\#B &lt; N^{0.677}$, then there are infinitely many primes $p$ such that $(\mu, p\Lambda)$ is also a spectral pair. Under Artin's primitive root conjecture or the Elliott-Halberstam conjecture, the same conclusion holds for $\# B &lt; N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02899v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, two new topological properties for operators acting on a topological vector space were introduced: strong hypercyclicity and hypermixing. We introduce a new property called ultra hypercyclicity and compare it to strong hypercyclicity and hypermixing, as well as the classical notions of mixing, weak mixing, and hypercyclicity. We show that every ultra hypercyclic operator on Fr\'echet space must be weakly mixing, and that there exists a strongly hypercyclic operator which is not ultra hypercyclic. We also characterize, in terms of the weight sequence, the ultra hypercyclic weighted backward shifts on $c_0$ and $\ell^p$, $1\leq p&lt;\infty$. Finally, we improve upon a necessary condition for strongly hypercyclic weighted backward shifts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13735v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $p \in [1, \infty)$, we generalize the concept of classical spectral triples by extending the framework from Hilbert spaces to $L^p$-spaces, and from C*-algebras to $L^p$-operator algebras. In addition, we define an $L^p$-spectral triple to be metric when the state space of the algebra has a $p$-quantum compact metric space structure. Specifically, we construct $L^p$-spectral triples for reduced $L^p$-group algebras of discrete groups with proper length functions and also for $L^p$ UHF-algebras of infinite tensor product type, the latter inspired by E.\ Christensen and C.\ Ivan's construction of a Dirac operator on AF C*-algebras. We prove that $L^p$-spectral triples associated with $L^p$-group algebras (provided that the length function is of bounded doubling) and those associated with $L^p$ UHF-algebras are always metric.</description>

We prove that all Arens extensions of $A$ are disjointness preserving if either $A$ has finite lattice rank or the spaces are Banach lattices and $F^*$ has a Schauder basis consisting of disjointness preserving functionals.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Hahn-Banach extensions in locally convex spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We intend to study the uniqueness of the Hahn-Banach extensions of linear functionals on a subspace in locally convex spaces. Various characterizations are derived when a subspace $Y$ has an analogous version of property-U (introduced by Phelps) in a locally convex space, referred to as the property-SNP. We characterize spaces where every subspace has this property. It is demonstrated that a subspace $M$ of a Banach space $E$ has property-U if and only if the subspace $M$ of the locally convex space $E$ endowed with the weak topology has the property-SNP, mentioned above. This investigation circles around exploring the potential connections between the family of seminorms and the unique extension of functionals previously mentioned. We extensively studied this property on the spaces of continuous functions on Tychonoff spaces endowed with the topology of pointwise convergence.</description>

      <title>On the dynamics of a semigroup and its relation with the Riemann Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The semigroup of weighted composition operators $(W_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$, defined by $$W_nf(z)=(1+z+\cdots +z^n)f(z^n),$$ acts on the classical Hardy-Hilbert space $H^{2}(\mathbb{D})$, and exhibits intriguing connections with both the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) and the Invariant Subspace Problem (ISP). In this paper, we prove that the adjoint operators $W^{\ast}_{n}$, for $n\geq 2$, are Devaney chaotic, frequently hypercyclic and mixing. In particular, these operators are hypercyclic and discuss connections with the RH and invariant subspaces.</description>

      <title>Weak-type bounds for the Bergman projection with Bekoll\'e-Bonami weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish weighted weak-type bounds for the Bergman projection with respect to Bekoll\'e-Bonami characteristics. We present two proofs of an improved quantitative weak-type $(1,1)$ estimate, as well as sharp weak-type $(p,p)$ bounds for $p&gt;1$ and mixed weighted weak-type $(1,1)$ inequalities. Our results, which hold for a wide class of simple domains in $\mathbb{C}^n$, are new even in the classical settings of the upper half-plane and the unit disk.</description>

      <title>Concrete examples of the rate of convergence of Chernoff approximations: numerical results for the heat semigroup and open questions on them (with appendix: full list of pictures and Python code)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05284v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The article is devoted to the construction of examples that illustrate (using computer calculations) the rate of convergence of Chernoff approximations to the solution of the Cauchy problem for the heat equation. We are interested in the Chernoff theorem in general and select the heat semigroup as a model case because this semigroup (and solutions of the heat equations) are known, so it is easy to measure the distance between the exact solution and its Chernoff approximations. Two Chernoff functions (of the first and second order of Chernoff tangency to the generator of the heat semigroup, i.e. to the operator of taking the second derivative) and several initial conditions of different smoothness are considered. From the numerically plotted graphs, visually, it is determined that the approximations are close to the solution. For each of the two Chernoff functions, for several initial conditions of different smoothness and for approximation numbers up to 11 inclusive, the error (i.e. the supremum of the absolute value of the difference between the exact solution and the approximating function) corresponding to each approximation was numerically found. As it turned out, in all the cases studied, the dependence of the error on the number of the approximation has an approximately power-law form (we call this power the order of convergence). This follows from the fact that, as we discovered, the dependence of the logarithm of the error on the logarithm of the approximation number is approximately linear. Using the considered family of initial conditions, an empirical dependence of the order of convergence on the smoothness class of the initial condition is found. The orders of convergence for all the initial conditions studied are collected in a table.</description>

      <title>Analytic diffeomorphisms of the circle and topological Riemann-Roch theorem for circle fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10517v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the group $\mathcal G$ which is the semidirect product of the group of analytic functions with values in ${\mathbb C}^*$ on the circle and the group of analytic diffeomorphisms of the circle that preserve the orientation. Then we construct the central extensions of the group $\mathcal G$ by the group ${\mathbb C}^*$. The first central extension, so-called the determinant central extension, is constructed by means of determinants of linear operators acting in infinite-dimensional locally convex topological $\mathbb C$-vector spaces. Other central extensions are constructed by $\cup$-products of group $1$-cocycles with the application to them the map related with algebraic $K$-theory. We prove in the second cohomology group, i.e. modulo of a group $2$-coboundary, the equality of the $12$th power of the $2$-cocycle constructed by the first central extension and the product of integer powers of the $2$-cocycles constructed above by means of \linebreak $\cup$-products (in multiplicative notation). As an application of this result we obtain a new topological Riemann-Roch theorem for a complex line bundle $L$ on a smooth manifold $M$, where $\pi :M \to B$ is a fibration in oriented circles. More precisely, we prove that in the group $H^3(B, {\mathbb Z})$ the element $12 \, [ {\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is equal to the element $6 \, \pi_* ( c_1(L) \cup c_1(L))$, where $[{\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is the class of the determinant gerbe on $B$ constructed by $L$ and the determinant central extension.</description>

      <title>Frame Vector Group Representations and Amenability Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a new characterization of amenability for countable groups, based on frame representations admitting almost invariant vectors. By relaxing the frame inequalities, thereby weakening amenability, we obtain a large class of countable groups which we call {\it framenable}. We show that this class has some permanence properties, stands in contrast with property (T), and contains, for example, all free groups $\mathbb{F}_n$, $\textup{Aut}(\mathbb{F}_2)$ and $\textup{Aut}(\mathbb{F}_3)$, all (countable) lattices of $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$, the Baumslag-Solitar groups $BS_{p,q}$, the braid groups $B_n$, and Thompson's group $F$.</description>

      <title>A Lower Bound for the Fourier Entropy of Boolean Functions on the Biased Hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Boolean functions on the $p$-biased hypercube $(\{0,1\}^n,\mu_p^n)$ through the lens of Fourier/spectral entropy, i.e., the Shannon entropy of the squared Fourier coefficients. Motivated by recent progress on upper bounds toward the Fourier-Entropy-Influence (FEI) conjecture, we prove a complementary lower bound in terms of squared influences: for every $f:(\{0,1\}^n,\mu_p^n)\to \{-1,1\}$ we have $$ {\rm Ent}_p(f)\ge 4p(1-p)(2p-1)^2\cdot\sum_{k=1}^n{\rm Inf}^{(p)}_k(f)^2.$$</description>
