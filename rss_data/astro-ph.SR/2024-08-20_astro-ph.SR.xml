      <title>Testing the sources of the peculiar abundances in globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to analyze some of the polluters proposed in the self-enrichment scenarios put forward to explain the multiple populations in globular clusters (GCs), extending previous studies. Three scenarios with different polluter stars were tested: asymptotic giant branch stars, high-mass interacting binaries, and fast rotating massive stars. With abundance data available from the APOGEE survey and $\Delta Y$ estimates from precise HST photometry, twenty-six clusters were studied. We also included the study of the abundances of N, C, Mg and Al, extending previous studies that focused mainly on the abundances of He, O and Na. In addition, we constructed an empirical model to test whether one could explain the chemical signatures of the 'enriched' population of GC stars with a fixed source and dilution process based on empirical data. In agreement with work by other authors, we found that the proposed polluters can generally predict the qualitative abundance patterns in GC stars and in some cases quantitatively predict some elements, but in most cases when we compare the model yields with the observations, we find that they can not explain the entire set of observed abundance patterns. The empirical model succeeds in reproducing the abundances of Al for a given $\Delta Y$ (and vice versa), showing that there is a direct relationship between Al and He, with one increasing proportionally to the other. However, the empirical model fails to reproduce the observed abundances of Na and N, in agreement with the results of previous works. The observed decoupling between the maximum abundances of CNO-cycle elements like N and Na with those of Al and He provides new information and constraints for future models and could take us a step closer to understanding the origin of the peculiar abundance variations of globular cluster stars.</description>

      <title>Stealth Non-standard-model Confined Flare Eruptions: Sudden Reconnection Events in Ostensibly Inert Magnetic Arches from Sunspots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report seven examples of a long-ignored type of confined solar flare eruption that does not fit the standard model for confined flare eruptions. Because they are confined eruptions, do not fit the standard model, and unexpectedly erupt in ostensibly inert magnetic arches, we have named them stealth non-standard-model confined flare eruptions. Each of our flaring magnetic arches stems from a big sunspot. We tracked each eruption in full-cadence UV and EUV images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) of Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) in combination with magnetograms from SDO's Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI). We present the onset and evolution of two eruptions in detail: one of six that each make two side-by-side main flare loops, and one that makes two crossed main flare loops. For these two cases, we present cartoons of the proposed pre-eruption field configuration and how sudden reconnection makes the flare ribbons and flare loops. Each of the seven eruptions is consistent with being made by sudden reconnection at an interface between two internal field strands of the magnetic arch, where they cross at a small (10 - 20 degrees) angle. These stealth non-standard-model confined flare eruptions therefore plausibly support the idea of E. N. Parker for coronal heating in solar coronal magnetic loops by nanoflare bursts of reconnection at interfaces of internal field strands that cross at angles of 10 - 20 degrees.</description>

      <title>Multiband polarimetric imaging of HD 34700 with SCExAO/CHARIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Subaru/SCExAO + CHARIS broadband (JHK) integral field spectroscopy of HD 34700 A in polarized light. CHARIS has the unique ability to obtain polarized integral field images at 22 wavelength channels in broadband, as the incoming light is first split into different polarization states before passing though the lenslet array. We recover the transition disk around HD 34700 A in multiband polarized light in our data. We combine our polarized intensity data with previous total intensity data to examine the scattering profiles, scattering phase functions and polarized fraction of the disk at multiple wavelengths. We also carry out 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations of the disk using MCFOST, and make qualitative comparisons between our models and data to constrain dust grain properties. We find that in addition to micron-sized dust grains, a population of sub-micron grains is needed to match the surface brightness in polarized light and polarized fraction. This could indicate the existence of a population of small grains in the disk, or it could be caused by Mie theory simulations using additional small grains to compensate for sub-micron structures of real dust aggregates. We find models that match the polarized fraction of the data but the models do not apply strong constraints on the dust grain type or compositions. We find no models that can match all observed properties of the disk. More detailed modeling using realistic dust aggregates with irregular surfaces and complex structures is required to further constrain the dust properties.</description>

      <title>A Buddy for Betelgeuse: Binarity as the Origin of the Long Secondary Period in $\alpha$ Orionis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict the existence of $\alpha$ Ori B, a low-mass companion orbiting Betelgeuse. This is motivated by the presence of a 2170-day Long Secondary Period (LSP) in Betelgeuse's lightcurve, a periodicity $\approx5$ times longer than the star's 416 day fundamental radial pulsation mode. While binarity is currently the leading hypothesis for LSPs in general, the LSP and the radial velocity variation observed in Betelgeuse, taken together, necessitate a revision of the prevailing physical picture. The lightcurve-RV phase difference requires a companion to be behind Betelgeuse at the LSP luminosity minimum, 180 degrees out of phase with the system orientation associated with occultation. We demonstrate the consistency of this model with available observational constraints and identify tensions in all other proposed LSP hypotheses. Within this framework, we calculate a mass for $\alpha$ Ori B of $1.17\pm0.7\,M_\odot$ and an orbital separation of $1850\pm70\,R_\odot$, or $2.43^{+0.21}_{-0.32}$ times the radius of Betelgeuse. We then describe the features of the companion as constrained by the fundamental parameters of Betelgeuse and its orbital system, and discuss what would be required to confirm the companion's existence observationally.</description>

      <title>On the Age and Metallicity of Planet-hosting Triple Star Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a statistical analysis of the ages and metallicities of triple stellar systems that are known to host exoplanets. With controversial cases disregarded, so far 27 of those systems have been identified. Our analysis, based on an exploratory approach, shows that those systems are on average notably younger than stars situated in the solar neighborhood. Though the statistical significance of this result is not fully established, the most plausible explanation is a possible double selection effect due to the relatively high mass of planet-hosting stars of those systems (which spend less time on the main-sequence than low-mass stars) and that planets in triple stellar systems may be long-term orbitally unstable. The stellar metallicities are on average solar-like; however, owing to the limited number of data, this result is not inconsistent with the previous finding that stars with planets tend to be metal-rich as the deduced metallicity distribution is relatively broad.</description>

      <title>Modelling Hydrogen-deficient Carbon stars in MESA -- The effects of total mass and mass ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen-deficient Carbon (HdC) stars are rare, low-mass, chemically peculiar, supergiant variables believed to be formed by a double white dwarf (DWD) merger, specifically of a Carbon/Oxygen- (CO-) and a Helium-white dwarf (He-WD). They consist of two subclasses -- the dust-producing R Coronae Borealis (RCB) variables and their dustless counterparts the dustless HdCs (dLHdCs). Additionally, there is another, slightly cooler set of potentially related carbon stars, the DY Persei type variables which have some, but not conclusive, evidence of Hydrogen-deficiency. Recent works have begun to explore the relationship between these three classes of stars, theorizing that they share an evolutionary pathway (a DWD merger) but come from different binary populations, specifically different total masses (M$_{\rm tot}$) and mass ratios ($q$). In this work, we use the MESA modelling framework that has previously been used to model RCB stars and vary the merger parameters, M$_{\rm tot}$ and $q$, to explore how those parameters affect the abundances, temperatures, and luminosities of the resultant post-merger stars. We find that lower M$_{\rm tot}$ and larger $q$'s both decrease the luminosity and temperatures of post-merger models to the region of the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram populated by the dLHdCs. These lower M$_{\rm tot}$ and larger $q$ models also have smaller oxygen isotopic ratios ($^{16}$O/$^{18}$O) which is consistent with recent observations of dLHdCs compared to RCBs. None of the models generated in this work can explain the existence of the DY Persei type variables, however this may arise from the assumed metallicity of the models.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the untwisting process and upward mass transfer of a twisted prominence driven by vortex motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar filaments/prominences are common features in the Sun's atmosphere that contain cool chromospheric material suspended within the hot corona. However, the intricate topology of these structures and the mechanisms driving their instability and upward material transfer are not well understood. This study is to analyze a specific twisted prominence on February 10, 2021, and to explore its dynamics, including stability, motion, and material transfer. The study utilizes high-resolution H$\alpha$ observations from the 1-m New Vacuum Solar Telescope and space-borne observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory. We analyzed the data to investigate the characteristics and behavior of the twisted prominence. We also detected and measured the outflow speed surrounding the prominence. The study reveals that the observed prominence exhibited a stretched and twisted structure at its apex, distinguishing it from familiar cloudy prominences. Following more than 30 hours of equilibrium, the prominence destabilized, leading to a series of dynamic phenomena, such as vortex motion, oscillations, resonations, untwisting, and the upward transfer of mass. Consequently, material from the top of the prominence was carried upward and deposited into the overlying magnetic arcades. Noteworthy, outflows surrounding the prominence were characterized by speeds exceeding 40 km $s^{-1}$. We propose, for the first time, a mechanism rooted in the K\'arm\'an Vortex Street instability to explain the destabilization of the prominence. The estimated typical Strouhal Number of 0.23$\pm$0.06, which is related to vortex shedding, falls within the expected range for the K\'arm\'an Vortex Street effect, as predicted by simulations. These discoveries provide new insights into the dynamics and fundamental topology of solar prominences and reveal a previously unknown mechanism for mass loading into the upper atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Long-term optical spectroscopy of B[e] star CI Cam in a quiet state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution optical spectra of the B[e] star CI Cam were obtained on arbitrary dates 2002-2023 using the echelle spectrograph NES of the 6-m BTA telescope. The temporal variability of the powerful emissions of H$\alpha$ and HeI profiles is found. For two-peaked emissions with ``rectangular'' profiles, the intensity ratio of blue-shifted and red-shifted peaks is $V/R \ge 1$, except one date. A decrease in the intensity of all double-peaked emissions, Vr(emis-d), with ``rectangular'' profiles was revealed as they moved away in time from the 1998 outburst. The average velocity Vr(emis-d) for all observational dates varies in the range $(-50.8 \div -55.7)\pm 0.2$ km/s. The half-amplitude of the change (standard deviation) is equal to $\Delta$Vr=2.5 km/s. The velocity for single-peaked ion emissions (SiIII, AlIII, FeIII) differs little from the values of Vr(emis-d), but the measurement accuracy for these emissions is worse: the average error for different dates ranges from 0.4 to 1.3 km/s. The systemic velocity is assumed to be Vsys=$-55.4\pm 0.6$ km/s according to the stable position of the forbidden emission [NII] 5754 A. The position of single-peaked emissions [OIII] 4959 and 5007 A is also stable: Vr[OIII]=$-54.2\pm 0.4$ km/s. Forbidden emissions [OI] 5577, 6300, 6363, [CaII] 7291 and 7324 A are absent from the spectra. Appearence of the emission near 4686 A is an infrequent event, its intensity rarely exceeds the noise level. Only a wide asymmetric emission with an intensity of about 16% above the local continuum was registered in the spectrum for March 9, 2015. Questions arise about the use of this emission to estimate the orbital period of the star and about localization of this feature in the CI Cam system. The photospheric absorptions of NII, SII, and FeIII with a variable position are identified.</description>

      <title>Eight New Substellar Hyades Candidates from the UKIRT Hemisphere Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have used the UKIRT Hemisphere Survey (UHS) combined with the UKIDSS Galactic Cluster Survey (GCS), the UKIDSS Galactic Plane Survey (GPS), and the CatWISE2020 catalog to search for new substellar members of the nearest open cluster to the Sun, the Hyades. Eight new substellar Hyades candidate members were identified and observed with the Gemini/GNIRS near-infrared spectrograph. All eight objects are confirmed as brown dwarfs with spectral types ranging from L6 to T5, with two objects showing signs of spectral binarity and/or variability. A kinematic analysis demonstrates that all eight new discoveries likely belong to the Hyades cluster, with future radial velocity and parallax measurements needed to confirm their membership. CWISE J042356.23$+$130414.3, with a spectral type of T5, would be the coldest ($T_{\rm eff}$$\approx$1100 K) and lowest-mass ($M$$\approx$30 $M_{\rm Jup}$) free-floating member of the Hyades yet discovered. We further find that high-probability substellar Hyades members from this work and previous studies have redder near-infrared colors than field-age brown dwarfs, potentially due to lower surface gravities and super-solar metallicities.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Fields in Massive Star-forming Regions (MagMaR) IV: Tracing the Magnetic Fields in the O-type protostellar system IRAS 16547$-$4247</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of the massive stars, and in particular, the role that the magnetic fields play in their early evolutionary phase is still far from being completely understood. Here, we present Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.2 mm full polarized continuum, and H$^{13}$CO$^+$(3$-$2), CS(5$-$4), and HN$^{13}$C(3$-$2) line observations with a high angular resolution ($\sim$0.4$''$ or 1100 au). In the 1.2 mm continuum emission, we reveal a dusty envelope surrounding the massive protostars, IRAS16547-E and IRAS16547-W, with dimensions of $\sim$10,000 au. This envelope has a bi-conical structure likely carved by the powerful thermal radio jet present in region. The magnetic fields vectors follow very-well the bi-conical envelope. The polarization fraction is $\sim$2.0\% in this region. Some of these vectors seem to converge to IRAS 16547-E, and IRAS 16547-W, the most massive protostars. Moreover, the velocity fields revealed from the spectral lines H$^{13}$CO$^+$(3$-$2), and HN$^{13}$C(3$-$2) show velocity gradients with a good correspondence with the magnetic fields, that maybe are tracing the cavities of molecular outflows or maybe in some parts infall. We derived a magnetic field strength in some filamentary regions that goes from 2 to 6.1\,mG. We also find that the CS(5$-$4) molecular line emission reveals multiple outflow cavities or bow-shocks with different orientations, some of which seem to follow the NW-SE radio thermal jet.</description>

      <title>Microphysical Prescriptions for Parameterized Water Cloud Formation on Ultra-cool Substellar Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water must condense into ice clouds in the coldest brown dwarfs and exoplanets. When they form, these icy clouds change the emergent spectra, temperature structure, and albedo of the substellar atmosphere. The properties of clouds are governed by complex microphysics but these complexities are often not captured by the simpler parameterized cloud models used in climate models or retrieval models. Here, we combine microphysical cloud modeling and 1D climate modeling to incorporate insights from microphysical models into a self-consistent, parameterized cloud model. Using the 1D Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA), we generate microphysical water clouds and compare their properties with those from the widely-used EddySed cloud model (Ackerman &amp; Marley 2001) for a grid of Y dwarfs. We find that the mass of water condensate in our CARMA water clouds is significantly limited by available condensation nuclei; in models without additional seed particles for clouds added, the atmosphere becomes supersaturated. We incorporate water latent heat release in the convective and radiative parts of the atmosphere and find no significant impact on water-ice cloud formation for typical gas giant compositions. Our analysis reveals the CARMA cloud profiles have a gradual decrease in opacity of approximately 4% per bar below the cloud base. Incorporating this gradual cloud base falloff and a variable $f_{sed}$ parameter allows spectra generated from the parameterized Eddysed model to better match those of the microphysical CARMA model. This work provides recommendations for efficiently generating microphysically-informed water clouds for future models of cold substellar objects with H/He atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Investigating the mixing between two black hole populations in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA GWTC-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a population model to analyze the mixing between hypothesised power-law and $\sim 35 M_\odot$ Gaussian bump black hole populations in the latest gravitational wave catalog, GWTC-3, estimating their co-location and separation. We find a relatively low level of mixing, $3.1^{+5.0}_{-3.1}\%$, between the power-law and Gaussian populations, compared to the percentage of mergers containing two Gaussian bump black holes, $5.0^{+3.2}_{-1.7}\%$. Our analysis indicates that black holes within the Gaussian bump are generally separate from the power-law population, with only a minor fraction engaging in mixing and contributing to the $\mathcal{M} \sim 14 M_\odot$ peak in the chirp mass. This leads us to identify a distinct population of Binary Gaussian Black Holes (BGBHs) that arise from mergers within the Gaussian bump. We suggest that current theories for the formation of the massive $35 M_\odot$ Gaussian bump population may need to reevaluate the underlying mechanisms that drive the preference for BGBHs.</description>

Abstract: The investigation of exoplanetary habitability is integral to advancing our knowledge of extraterrestrial life potential and detailing the environmental conditions of distant worlds. In this analysis, we explore the properties of exoplanets situated with respect to circumstellar habitable zones by implementing a sophisticated filtering methodology on data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. This research encompasses a thorough examination of 5,595 confirmed exoplanets listed in the Archive as of March 10th, 2024, systematically evaluated according to their calculated surface temperatures and stellar classifications of their host stars, taking into account the biases implicit in the methodologies used for their discovery. Our findings elucidate distinctive patterns in exoplanetary attributes, which are significantly shaped by the spectral classifications and mass of the host stars. The insights garnered from our study not only enhance the existing models for managing burgeoning exoplanetary datasets, but also lay foundational groundwork for future explorations into the dynamic relationships between exoplanets and their stellar environments.</description>

      <title>On the Formation of Planets in the Milky Way's Thick Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exoplanet demographic surveys have revealed that close-in (${\lesssim}$1 au) small planets orbiting stars in the Milky Way's thick disk are ${\sim}50\%$ less abundant than those orbiting stars in the Galactic thin disk. One key difference between the two stellar populations is the time at which they emerged: thick disk stars are the likely product of cosmic noon (redshift $z {\sim}2$), an era characterized by high star formation rate, massive and dense molecular clouds, and strong supersonic turbulence. Solving for the background radiation field in these early star-forming regions, we demonstrate that protoplanetary disks at cosmic noon experienced radiation fields up to ${\sim}7$ orders of magnitude more intense than in solar neighborhood conditions. Coupling the radiation field to a one-dimensional protoplanetary disk evolution model, we find that external UV photoevaporation destroys protoplanetary disks in just ${\sim}$0.2--0.5 Myr, limiting the timescale over which planets can assemble. Disk temperatures exceed the sublimation temperatures of common volatile species for ${\gtrsim}$Myr timescales, predicting more spatial homogeneity in gas chemical composition. Our calculations imply that the deficit in planet occurrence around thick disk stars should be even more pronounced for giant planets, particularly those at wide orbital separations, predicting a higher rocky-to-giant planet ratio in the Galactic thick disk vs.~thin disk.</description>

      <title>Global weather map reveals persistent top-of-atmosphere features on the nearest brown dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs and planetary-mass companions display rotationally modulated photometric variability, especially those near the L/T transition. This variability is commonly attributed to top-of-atmosphere (TOA) inhomogeneities, with proposed models including patchy thick and thin clouds, planetary-scale jets, or chemical disequilibrium. Surface mapping techniques are powerful tools to probe their atmospheric structures and distinguish between models. One of the most successful methods for stellar surface mapping is Doppler imaging, where the existence of TOA inhomogeneities can be inferred from their varying Doppler shifts across the face of a rotating star. We applied Doppler imaging to the nearest brown dwarf binary WISE 1049AB (aka Luhman 16AB) using time-resolved, high-resolution spectroscopic observations from Gemini IGRINS, and obtained for the first time H and K band simultaneous global weather map for brown dwarfs. Compared to the only previous Doppler map for a brown dwarf in 2014 featuring a predominant mid-latitude cold spot on WISE 1049B and no feature on WISE 1049A, our observations detected persistent spot-like structures on WISE 1049B in the equatorial to mid-latitude regions on two nights, and revealed new polar spots on WISE 1049A. Our results suggest stability of atmospheric features over timescale of days and possible long-term stable or recurring structures. H and K band maps displayed similar structures in and out of CO bands, indicating the cold spots not solely due to chemical hotspots but must involve clouds. Upcoming 30-m extremely large telescopes (ELTs) will enable more sensitive Doppler imaging of dozens of brown dwarfs and even a small number of directly-imaged exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Jupiter Analog Misaligned to the Inner Planetary System in HD 73344</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery of a Jupiter-like planet, HD 73344 d ($m_{d}=2.55^{+0.56}_{-0.46}\ \mathrm{M_{J}}$, $a_{d}=6.70^{+0.25}_{-0.26}$ AU, $e_{d}=0.18^{+0.14}_{-0.12}$) based on 27-year radial velocity observations. HD 73344 also hosts a compact inner planetary system, including a transiting sub-Neptune HD 73344 b ($P_{b}=15.61\ \mathrm{days}$, $r_{b}=2.88^{+0.08}_{-0.07}\ \mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$) and a non-transiting Saturn-mass planet ($P_{c}=65.936\ \mathrm{days}$, $m_{c}\sin{i_c}=0.36^{+0.02}_{-0.02}\ \mathrm{M_{J}}$). By analyzing TESS light curves, we identified a stellar rotation period of $9.03\pm{1.3}$ days. Combining this with $v\sin{i_*}$ measurements from stellar spectra, we derived a stellar inclination of $63.6^{+17.4}_{-16.5}\ \rm{deg} $. Furthermore, by combining radial velocities and Hipparcos-Gaia astrometric acceleration, we characterized the three-dimensional orbit of the outer giant planet and constrained its mutual inclination relative to the innermost transiting planet to be $46 &lt;\Delta I_{bd}&lt; 134\ \rm{deg}\ (1\sigma)$ and $20 &lt;\Delta I_{bd}&lt; 160\ \rm{deg}\ (2\sigma)$, strongly disfavoring coplanar architectures. Our analytical calculations and N-body simulation reveal that the two inner planets are strongly coupled with each other and undergo nodal precession together around the orbital axis of the giant planet. During nodal precession, the orbital inclination of inner planets oscillate with time and therefore become misaligned relative to the stellar spin axis. The formation of such systems suggests a history of planet-planet scattering or misalignment between the inner and outer components of protoplanetary disks. The upcoming release of Gaia DR4 will uncover more systems similar to HD 73344 and enable the study of the flatness of exoplanet systems with a mixture of inner and outer planetary systems on a statistical level.</description>

      <title>A Spatial Uniformity Check of Gaia DR3 Photometry and BP/RP Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaia DR3 photometry and BP/RP spectra have been widely used as reference in photometric calibrations. In this work, we check the spatial uniformity of Gaia DR3 photometry and BP/RP spectra by comparing the BP, RP and G bands photometry with the synthetic ones from the BP/RP spectra. The discrepancies have a small dispersion of 1.07, 0.55 and 1.02 mmag for the BP, RP, and G bands, respectively. However, the discrepancies exhibit obvious spatial patterns, which are clearly associated with the Gaia's scanning law. The patterns observed in the BP and G bands are similar, with discrepancies between photometry and spectra being more pronounced in these bands compared to the RP band. A further independent test with the Dark Energy Survey DR2 photometry reveals that the spatial patterns are more likely attributed to the Gaia DR3 BP/RP spectra, particularly in the BP band. On one hand, our results confirm the high spatial uniformity of Gaia data at the mmag level. On the other hand, our results suggest that the spatial uniformity of Gaia DR3 BP/RP spectra is not as good as that of Gaia DR3 photometry, and could be further improved in the future.</description>

      <title>Physical properties of embedded clusters in ATLASGAL clumps with HII regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the optimal sampling model, we synthesized the embedded clusters of ATLASGAL clumps with HII regions (HII-clumps). The 0.1 Myr isochrone was used to estimate the bolometric luminosity of each star in an embedded cluster, we also added the accretion luminosity of each star in the embeded cluster. The total bolometric luminosity of synthetic embedded clusters can well fit the observed bolometric luminosity of HII-clumps. More realistically, we considered the age spread in the young star and protostar populations in embedded clusters of HII-clumps by modeling both constant and time-varying star formation histories (SFHs). According to the age distribution of the stellar population, we distributed the appropriate isochrones to each star, and sorted out the fraction of stellar objects that are still protostars (Class 0 and Class I phases) to properly add their accretion luminosities. Compared to a constant SFH, burst-like and time-dependent SFHs can better fit the observational data. We found that as long as 20\% of the stars within the embedded cluster are still accreting, the contribution of accretion luminosity will be significant to the total bolometric luminosity of low-mass HII-clumps with mass log$_{10}$(M$_{\rm cl}$/M$_{\odot}$) $&lt;$ 2.8. Variations in the accretion rate, the SFE and the initial mass function (IMF) and more physical processes like the external heating from HII regions and the flaring from pre-main sequence (PMS) stars and protostars need to be investigated to further explain the excess luminosity of low-mass HII-clumps.</description>

      <title>Towards a self-consistent model of the convective core boundary in upper main sequence stars. Part I: 2.5D and 3D simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is strong observational evidence that the convective cores of intermediate-mass and massive main sequence stars are substantially larger than those predicted by standard stellar-evolution models. However, it is unclear what physical processes cause this phenomenon or how to predict the extent and stratification of stellar convective boundary layers. Convective penetration is a thermal-timescale process that is likely to be particularly relevant during the slow evolution on the main sequence. We use our low-Mach-number Seven-League Hydro code to study this process in 2.5D and 3D geometries. Starting with a chemically homogeneous model of a $15\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ zero-age main sequence star, we construct a series of simulations with the luminosity increased and opacity decreased by the same factor, ranging from $10^3$ to $10^6$. After reaching thermal equilibrium, all of our models show a clear penetration layer; its thickness becomes statistically constant in time and it is shown to converge upon grid refinement. The penetration layer becomes nearly adiabatic with a steep transition to a radiative stratification in simulations at the lower end of our luminosity range. This structure corresponds to the adiabatic `step overshoot' model often employed in stellar-evolution calculations. The simulations with the highest and lowest luminosity differ by less than a factor of two in the penetration distance. The high computational cost of 3D simulations makes our current 3D data set rather sparse. Depending on how we extrapolate the 3D data to the actual luminosity of the initial stellar model, we obtain penetration distances ranging from $0.09$ to $0.44$ pressure scale heights, which is broadly compatible with observations.</description>

      <title>Primeval very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs -- VIII. The first age benchmark L subdwarf, a wide companion to a halo white dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19219v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of five white dwarf + ultracool dwarf systems identified as common proper motion wide binaries in the Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars. The discoveries include a white dwarf + L subdwarf binary, VVV 1256-62AB, a gravitationally bound system located 75.6(+1.9/-1.8) pc away with a projected separation of 1375(+35/-33) au. The primary is a cool DC white dwarf with a hydrogen dominated atmosphere, and has a total age of 10.5(+3.3/-2.1) Gyr, based on white dwarf model fitting. The secondary is an L subdwarf with a metallicity of [M/H] = -0.72(+0.08/-0.10) (i.e. [Fe/H] = -0.81+/-0.10) and Teff = 2298(+45/-43) K based on atmospheric model fitting of its optical to near infrared spectrum, and likely has a mass just above the stellar/substellar boundary. The sub-solar metallicity of the L subdwarf and the system's total space velocity of 406 km/s indicates membership in the Galactic halo, and it has a flat eccentric Galactic orbit passing within 1~kpc of the centre of the Milky Way every ~0.4Gyr and extending to 15-31 kpc at apogal. VVV 1256-62B is the first L subdwarf to have a well-constrained age, making it an ideal benchmark of metal-poor ultracool dwarf atmospheres and evolution.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear wave propagation in large extra spatial dimensions and the blackbody thermal laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear wave propagation in large extra spatial dimensions (on and above $d=2$) is investigated in the context of nonlinear electrodynamics theories that depend exclusively on the invariant $\mathcal{F}\left(=-(1/4)F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}\right)$. In this vein, we consider propagating waves under the influence of external uniform electric and magnetic fields. Features related to the blackbody radiation in the presence of a background constant electric field such as the generalization of the spectral energy density distribution and the Stefan-Boltzmann law are obtained. Interestingly enough, anisotropic contributions to the frequency spectrum appear in connection to the nonlinearity of the electromagnetic field. In addition, the long wavelength regime and Wien's displacement law in this situation are studied. The corresponding thermodynamics quantities at thermal equilibrium, such as energy, pressure, entropy, and heat capacity densities are contemplated as well.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Primordial Alignment: Insights from Stellar Obliquity Measurements for Compact Sub-Saturn Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite decades of effort, the mechanisms by which the spin axis of a star and the orbital axes of its planets become misaligned remain elusive. Particularly, it is of great interest whether the large spin-orbit misalignments observed are driven primarily by high-eccentricity migration -- expected to have occurred for short-period, isolated planets -- or reflect a more universal process that operates across systems with a variety of present-day architectures. Compact multi-planet systems offer a unique opportunity to differentiate between these competing hypotheses, as their tightly-packed configurations preclude violent dynamical histories, including high-eccentricity migration, allowing them to trace the primordial disk plane. In this context, we report measurements of the sky-projected stellar obliquity ($\lambda$) via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for two sub-Saturns in multiple-transiting systems: TOI-5126 b ($\lambda=1\pm 48 ^\circ$) and TOI-5398 b ($\lambda=-8.1^{+5.3 \circ}_{-6.3}$). Both are spin-orbit aligned, joining a fast-growing group of just three other compact sub-Saturn systems, all of which exhibit spin-orbit alignment. In aggregate with archival data, our results strongly suggest that sub-Saturn systems are primordially aligned and become misaligned largely in the post-disk phase, as appears to be the case increasingly for other exoplanet populations.</description>
