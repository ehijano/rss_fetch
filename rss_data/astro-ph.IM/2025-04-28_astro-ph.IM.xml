      <title>SSOXmatch: a Java pipeline to compute cross-matches of Solar System bodies in astronomical observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper I will describe a new software package developed using the Java programming language, aimed to compute the positions of any Solar System body (among asteroids, comets, planets, and satellites) to help to perform cross-matches of them in observations taken from earth- and space-based observatories. The space telescopes supported are Hubble, James Webb, Euclid, XMM-Newton, Spitzer, Herschel, Gaia, Kepler, Chandra, and TESS, although the flexibility of the software allows to support any other mission without the need to change a single line of code. The orbital elements can be selected among the asteroid database from the Lowell observatory (completed with the cometpro database of comets maintained by the LTE), and the JPL database of minor bodies.
  The software does not depend on external tools, and performs its own numerical integration of minor bodies. The dynamical model implemented for the Solar System includes the gravity effects of all major bodies, including the Earth, Moon, and Pluto as individual bodies, 16 perturbing asteroids as in other tools, the General Relativity effects, the oblateness of the Sun, Earth, and Moon, and the non-gravitational forces for both comets and asteroids. A complete set of web services allow to compute the cross-matches (that are later to be confirmed, for instance by visual inspection of the images) and also ephemerides of specific bodies. The code is highly optimized and follows the highest standards in terms of software quality and documentation.</description>

      <title>Robust Binding Energy Distribution Sampling on Amorphous Solid Water Models. Method testing and validation with NH3, CO and CH4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to develop a method based on a structurally reliable ice model and a statistically and physico-chemically robust approach for BE distribution inference, with the aim to be applicable to various relevant interstellar species. A multiscale computational approach is presented, with a Molecular Dynamics (MD) Heat &amp; Quench protocol for the amorphous water ice model, and an ONIOM(B3LYP-D3(BJ)/6-311+G**:GFN2-xtb) scheme for the BE inference, with a prime emphasis onto the BE/real system size convergence. The sampling of the binding configurations is twofold, exploring both regularly spaced binding sites, as well as various adsorbate-to-substrate orientations on each locally distinct site. This second source of BE diversity accounts for the local roughness of the potential energy landscape of the substrate. Three different adsorbate test cases are considered, i.e. NH3, CO and CH4, owing to their significance in dust icy mantles, and their distinct binding behavior with water ices. The BE distributions for NH3, CO and CH4 have been inferred, with converged statistics. The distribution for NH3 is better represented by a double Gaussian component profile. Three starting adsorbate orientations per site are required to reach convergence for both Gaussian components of NH3, while 2 orientations are sufficient for CO, and one unique for CH4 (symmetric). Further geometrical and molecular surrounding insights have been provided. These results encompass previously reported results.</description>

      <title>MROP: Modulated Rank-One Projections for compressive radio interferometric imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging generation of radio-interferometric (RI) arrays are set to form images of the sky with a new regime of sensitivity and resolution. This implies a significant increase in visibility data volumes, scaling as $\mathcal{O}(Q^{2}B)$ for $Q$ antennas and $B$ short-time integration intervals (or batches), calling for efficient data dimensionality reduction techniques. This paper proposes a new approach to data compression during acquisition, coined modulated rank-one projection (MROP). MROP compresses the $Q\times Q$ batchwise covariance matrix into a smaller number $P$ of random rank-one projections and compresses across time by trading $B$ for a smaller number $M$ of random modulations of the ROP measurement vectors. Firstly, we introduce a dual perspective on the MROP acquisition, which can either be understood as random beamforming, or as a post-correlation compression. Secondly, we analyse the noise statistics of MROPs and demonstrate that the random projections induce a uniform noise level across measurements independently of the visibility-weighting scheme used. Thirdly, we propose a detailed analysis of the memory and computational cost requirements across the data acquisition and image reconstruction stages, with comparison to state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction approaches. Finally, the MROP model is validated in simulation for monochromatic intensity imaging, with comparison to the classical and baseline-dependent averaging (BDA) models, and using the uSARA optimisation algorithm for image formation. An extensive experimental setup is considered, with ground-truth images containing diffuse and faint emission and spanning a wide variety of dynamic ranges, and for a range of $uv$-coverages corresponding to VLA and MeerKAT observation.</description>

      <title>Validation of the ESPRESSO Wavelength Calibration Using Iodine Absorption Cell Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High quality wavelength calibration is crucial for science cases like radial-velocity studies of exoplanets, the search for a possible variation of fundamental constants, and the redshift drift experiment. However, for state-of-the-art spectrographs it has become difficult to verify the wavelength calibration on sky, because no astrophysical source provides spectra with sufficiently stable or accurate wavelength information. We therefore propose to use iodine absorption cells to validate the wavelength calibration. Observing a bright and featureless star through the iodine cell emulates an astrophysical target with exactly known spectral features that can be analyzed like any other science target, allowing to verify the wavelength calibration derived from the internal calibration sources and to identify systematics in the data processing. As demonstration, we temporarily installed an I$_2$ absorption cell at ESPRESSO. Employing a full forward modeling approach of the I$_2$ spectrum, including the instrumental line-spread function, we demonstrate wavelength calibration accuracy at the level of a few m/s. We also show that wavelength measurements do depend on the geometry of the light-injection into the spectrograph fibers. This highlights the importance of probing exactly the same light path as science targets, something not possible with internal calibration sources alone. We also demonstrate excellent radial-velocity stability at the &lt;20 cm/s level in a full end-to-end fashion, from sky to data product. Our study therefore showcases the great potential of absorption cells for the verification and long-term monitoring of the wavelength calibration as well as the unique insights they can provide.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Cosmological Information from Neural Networks in the Hydrodynamic Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What happens when a black box (neural network) meets a black box (simulation of the Universe)? Recent work has shown that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can infer cosmological parameters from the matter density field in the presence of complex baryonic processes. A key question that arises is, which parts of the cosmic web is the neural network obtaining information from? We shed light on the matter by identifying the Fourier scales, density scales, and morphological features of the cosmic web that CNNs pay most attention to. We find that CNNs extract cosmological information from both high and low density regions: overdense regions provide the most information per pixel, while underdense regions -- particularly deep voids and their surroundings -- contribute significantly due to their large spatial extent and coherent spatial features. Remarkably, we demonstrate that there is negligible degradation in cosmological constraining power after aggressive cutting in both maximum Fourier scale and density. Furthermore, we find similar results when considering both hydrodynamic and gravity-only simulations, implying that neural networks can marginalize over baryonic effects with minimal loss in cosmological constraining power. Our findings point to practical strategies for optimal and robust field-level cosmological inference in the presence of uncertainly modeled astrophysics.</description>

      <title>PowerSensor3: A Fast and Accurate Open Source Power Measurement Tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Power consumption is a major concern in data centers and HPC applications, with GPUs typically accounting for more than half of system power usage. While accurate power measurement tools are crucial for optimizing the energy efficiency of (GPU) applications, both built-in power sensors as well as state-of-the-art power meters often lack the accuracy and temporal granularity needed, or are impractical to use. Released as open hardware, firmware, and software, PowerSensor3 provides a cost-effective solution for evaluating energy efficiency, enabling advancements in sustainable computing. The toolkit consists of a baseboard with a variety of sensor modules accompanied by host libraries with C++ and Python bindings. PowerSensor3 enables real-time power measurements of SoC boards and PCIe cards, including GPUs, FPGAs, NICs, SSDs, and domain-specific AI and ML accelerators. Additionally, it provides significant improvements over previous tools, such as a robust and modular design, current sensors resistant to external interference, simplified calibration, and a sampling rate up to 20 kHz, which is essential to identify GPU behavior at high temporal granularity. This work describes the toolkit design, evaluates its performance characteristics, and shows several use cases (GPUs, NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin, and SSD), demonstrating PowerSensor3's potential to significantly enhance energy efficiency in modern computing environments.</description>

      <title>Teleportation-based Speed Meter for Precision Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum teleportation-based speed meter for interferometric displacement sensing. Two equivalent implementations are presented: an online approach that uses real-time displacement operation and an offline approach that relies on post-processing. Both implementations reduce quantum radiation pressure noise and surpass the standard quantum limit of measuring displacement. We discuss potential applications to gravitational-wave detectors, where our scheme enhances low-frequency sensitivity without requiring modifications to the core optics of a conventional Michelson interferometer (e.g., substrate or coating properties). This approach offers a new path to back-action evasion enabled by quantum entanglement.</description>

      <title>An Unsupervised Machine Learning Approach to Identify Spectral Energy Distribution Outliers: Application to the S-PLUS DR4 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identification of specific stellar populations using photometry for spectroscopic follow-up is a first step to confirm and better understand their nature. In this context, we present an unsupervised machine learning approach to identify candidates for spectroscopic follow-up using data from the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS). First, using an anomaly detection technique based on an autoencoder model, we select a large sample of objects ($\sim 19,000$) whose Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) is not well reconstructed by the model after training it on a well-behaved star sample. Then, we apply the t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) algorithm to the 66 color measurements from S-PLUS, complemented by information from the SIMBAD database, to identify stellar populations. Our analysis reveals 69 carbon-rich star candidates that, based on their spatial and kinematic characteristics, may belong to the CH or Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP) categories. Among these chemically peculiar candidates, we identify four as likely carbon dwarf stars. We show that it is feasible to identify three primary white dwarf (WD) populations: WDs with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres (DA), WDs with neutral helium-dominated atmospheres (DB), and the WDs main sequence binaries (WD + MS). Furthermore, by using eROSITA X-ray data, we also highlight the identification of candidates for very active low-mass stars. Finally, we identified a large number of binary systems using the autoencoder model, but did not observe a clear association between the overdensities in the t-SNE map and their orbital properties.</description>

      <title>First upper limits on the 21-cm signal power spectrum of neutral hydrogen at $z=9.16$ from the LOFAR 3C196 field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The redshifted 21-cm signal of neutral hydrogen from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) can potentially be detected using low-frequency radio instruments such as the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR). So far, LOFAR upper limits on the 21-cm signal power spectrum have been published using a single target field: the North Celestial Pole (NCP). In this work, we analyse and provide upper limits for the 3C196 field, observed by LOFAR, with a strong ${\approx}80\,$Jy source in the centre. This field offers advantages such as higher sensitivity due to zenith-crossing observations and reduced geostationary radio-frequency interference, but also poses challenges due to the presence of the bright central source. After constructing a wide-field sky model, we process a single 6-hour night of 3C196 observations using direction-independent and direction-dependent calibration, followed by a residual foreground subtraction with a machine learned Gaussian process regression (ML-GPR). A bias correction is necessary to account for signal suppression in the GPR step. Still, even after this correction, the upper limits are a factor of two lower than previous single-night NCP results, with a lowest $2\sigma$ upper limit of $(146.61\,\text{mK})^2$ at $z = 9.16$ and $k=0.078\,h\,\text{cMpc}^{-1}$ (with $\text{d}k/k\approx 0.3$). The results also reveal an excess power, different in behaviour from that observed in the NCP field, suggesting a potential residual foreground origin. In future work, the use of multiple nights of 3C196 observations combined with improvements to sky modelling and ML-GPR to avoid the need for bias correction should provide tighter constraints per unit observing time than the NCP.</description>

      <title>Tutorial on running median subtraction filter with application to searches for exotic field transients in multi-messenger astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Running Median Subtraction Filter (RMSF) is a robust statistical tool for removing slowly varying baselines in data streams containing transients (short-duration signals) of interest. In this work, we explore the RMSF performance and properties using simulated time series and analytical methods. We study the RMSF fidelity in preserving the signal of interest in the data using (i) a Gaussian pulse and (ii) a transient oscillatory signal. Such signals may be generated by hypothetical exotic low-mass fields (ELFs) associated with intense astrophysical events like binary black hole or neutron star mergers. We consider and assess RMSF as a candidate method to extract transient ELF signals. RMSF operates by sliding a window across the data and subtracting the median value within each window from the data points. With a suitable choice of running window size, RMSF effectively filters out baseline variations without compromising the integrity of transients. The RMSF window width is a critical parameter: it must be wide enough to encompass a short transient but narrow enough to remove the slowly varying baseline. We show that the RMSF removes the mean of a normally distributed white noise while preserving its variance and higher order moments in the limit of large windows. In addition, RMSF does not color the white noise stream, i.e., it does not induce any significant correlation in the filtered data. Ideally, a filter would preserve both the signal of interest and the statistical characteristics of the stochastic component of the data, while removing the background clutter and outliers. We find the RMSF to satisfy these practical criteria for data pre-processing. While we rigorously prove several RMSF properties, the paper is organized as a tutorial with multiple illustrations of RMSF applications.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational wave data analysis (GWDA) faces significant challenges due to high-dimensional parameter spaces and non-Gaussian, non-stationary artifacts in the interferometer background, which traditional methods have made significant progress in addressing but continue to face limitations. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning (DL) algorithms, offers potential advantages, including computational efficiency, scalability, and adaptability, which may complement traditional approaches in tackling these challenges more effectively. In this review, we explore AI-driven approaches to GWDA, covering every stage of the pipeline and presenting first explorations in waveform modeling and parameter estimation. This work represents the most comprehensive review to date, integrating the latest AI advancements with practical GWDA applications. Our meta-analysis reveals insights and trends, highlighting the transformative potential of AI in revolutionizing gravitational wave research and paving the way for future discoveries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has opened new frontiers in understanding the cosmos, while the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in science promises to revolutionize data analysis methodologies. However, a significant gap exists, as there is currently no dedicated platform that enables scientists to develop, test, and evaluate AI algorithms efficiently for GW data analysis. To address this gap, we introduce GWAI, a pioneering AI-centered software platform designed for GW data analysis. GWAI contains a three-layered architecture that emphasizes simplicity, modularity, and flexibility, covering the entire analysis pipeline. GWAI aims to accelerate scientific discoveries, bridging the gap between advanced AI techniques and astrophysical research.</description>

Abstract: Molecular clouds show complex structures reflecting their non-linear dynamics. Many studies investigating the bridge between their morphology and physical properties have shown the value of non-Gaussian higher-order statistics in capturing physical information. Yet, as this bridge is usually characterized in the supervised world of simulations, transferring it to observations can be hazardous, especially when the discrepancy between simulations and observations remains unknown. In this paper, we aim to identify relevant summary statistics, directly from the observation data. To do so, we developed a test to compare the informative power of two sets of summary statistics for a given unlabeled dataset. Contrary to supervised approaches, this test does not require knowledge of any class label or parameter associated with the data. Instead, it evaluates and compares the degeneracy levels of the summary statistics based on a notion of statistical compatibility. We applied this test to column density maps of 14 nearby molecular clouds observed by Herschel and iteratively compared different sets of typical summary statistics. We show that a standard Gaussian description of these clouds is highly degenerate but can be substantially improved when being estimated on the logarithm of the maps. This illustrates that low-order statistics, when properly used, remain very powerful. We further show that such descriptions still exhibit a small quantity of degeneracies, some of which are lifted by the higher-order statistics provided by reduced wavelet scattering transforms. These degeneracies quantitatively differ between observations and state-of-the-art simulations of dense cloud collapse, and they are not present for logFBM models. Finally, we show how to cooperatively use the summary statistics identified to build a morphological distance, which is evaluated visually and gives convincing results.</description>

      <title>A differentiable N-body code for transit timing and dynamical modelling -- II. Photodynamics</title>

Abstract: Exoplanet transits contain substantial information about the architecture of a system. By fitting transit lightcurves we can extract dynamical parameters and place constraints on the properties of the planets and their host star. Having a well-defined probabilistic model plays a crucial role in making robust measurements of these parameters, and the ability to differentiate the model provides access to more robust inference tools. Gradient-based inference methods can allow for more rapid and accurate sampling of high-dimensional parameter spaces. We present a fully differentiable photodynamical model for multi-planet transit lightcurves that display transit-timing variations. We model time-integrated exposures, compute the dynamics of a system over the full length of observations, and provide analytic expressions for derivatives of the flux with respect to the dynamical and photometric model parameters. The model has been implemented in the Julia language and is available open-source on GitHub. We demonstrate with a simulated dataset that Bayesian inference with the NUTS HMC algorithm, which uses the model gradient, can outperform the affine-invariant (e.g. \texttt{emcee}) MCMC algorithm in CPU time per effective sample, and we find that the relative sampling efficiency improves with the number of model parameters.</description>

      <title>Lessons learned from the detection of wide companions by radial velocity and astrometry</title>

Abstract: The detection and constraint of the orbits of long-period giant planets is essential for enabling their further study through direct imaging. Recently, it has been highlighted that there are discrepancies between different orbital fitting solutions. We address these concerns by reanalyzing the data for HD 28185, GJ 229, HD 62364, HD 38529, 14 Her, eps Ind A, HD 211847, HD 111031, and GJ 680, offering explanations for these discrepancies. Based on the comparison between our direct modeling of the astrometric catalog data and the orvara code, we find the discrepancies are primarily data-related rather than methodology-related. Our re-analysis of HD 28185 highlights many of the data-related issues and particularly the importance of parallax modeling for year-long companions. The case of eps Ind A b is instructive to emphasize the value of an extended RV baseline for accurately determining orbits of long period companions. Our orbital solutions highlight other causes for discrepancies between solutions including the combination of absolute and relative astrometry, clear definitions of conventions, and efficient posterior sampling for the detection of wide-orbit giant planets.</description>

      <title>Optimization of singly-charged particles identification with the AMS02 RICH detector by a machine learning method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01265</link>

Abstract: AMS-02 is a detector currently in operation onboard the International Space Station (ISS). One of the main scientific goals of the spectrometer is the measurement of charged particle fluxes. The detector design makes possible the identification of particles and antiparticles by precise measurement of particle momentum in the AMS-02 Silicon Tracker, and velocity in the Cherenkov (RICH) detector. The RICH is able to measure the isotopic composition of the light elements (up to charge Z=5) in the kinetic energy range from a few GeV/n to about 10 GeV/n. However, the velocity reconstruction for charge 1 particles is particularly challenging due to the low number of photons they produce in the RICH detector which can lead to wrong event reconstruction. In this paper, we show the high potential of the Multilayer Perceptron deep learning model (MLP-BFGS) for identification of signal and the background due to interactions inside the AMS-02 detector, and to significantly improve particle identification by its mass.</description>

      <title>[C II]-deficit caused by self-absorption in an ionized carbon-filled bubble in RCW79</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08976v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent spectroscopic observations of the [C II] 158$\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ fine-structure line of ionized carbon (C$^+$), using the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), have revealed expanding [C II] shells in Galactic H II regions. We report the discovery of a bubble-shaped source (S144 in RCW79), associated with a compact H II region, excited by a single O7.5--9.5V/III star, which is consistent with a scenario that the bubble is still mostly ``filled'' with C$^+$. This indicates most likely a very early evolutionary state, in which the stellar wind has not yet blown material away, as it is the case for more evolved H II regions. Using the SimLine non-LTE radiative transfer code, the [C II] emission can be modeled to originate from three regions. First, a central H II region with little C$^+$ in the fully ionized phase, followed by two layers with gas density around $2500\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ of partially photo-dissociated gas. The second layer is a slowly expanding [C II] shell with an expansion velocity of $\sim\,$$2.6\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. The outermost layer exhibits a temperature and velocity gradient that produces the observed self-absorption features in the optically thick [C II] line ($\tau \sim 4$) leading to an apparent deficit in [C II] emission and a low ratio of [C II] to total far-infrared (FIR) emission. We developed a procedure to approximate the missing [C II] flux and find a linear correlation between [C II] and FIR without a [C II]-deficit. This demonstrates that at least some of the [C II]-deficit found in Galactic H II bubbles can be attributed to self-absorption.</description>

      <title>Introducing STARDIS: An Open and Modular Stellar Spectral Synthesis Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new 1D stellar spectral synthesis Python code called stardis. stardis is a modular, open-source radiative transfer code that is capable of spectral synthesis from near-UV to IR for FGK stars. We describe the structure, inputs, features, underlying physics, and assumptions of stardis as well as the radiative transfer scheme implemented. To validate our code, we show spectral comparisons between stardis and korg with the same input atmospheric structure models, and also compare qualitatively to phoenix for solar models. We find that stardis generally agrees well with korg for solar models on the few percent level or better, that the codes can diverge in the ultraviolet, with more extreme differences in cooler stars. stardis can be found at https://github.com/tardis-sn/stardis, and documentation can be found at https://tardis-sn.github.io/stardis/.</description>
