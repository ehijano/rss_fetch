      <title>Information Design With Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information design is typically studied through the lens of Bayesian signaling, where signals shape beliefs based on their correlation with the true state of the world. However, Behavioral Economics and Psychology emphasize that human decision-making is more complex and can depend on how information is framed. This paper formalizes a language-based notion of framing and bridges this to the popular Bayesian-persuasion model. We model framing as a possibly non-Bayesian, linguistic way to influence a receiver's belief, while a signaling (or recommendation) scheme can further refine this belief in the classic Bayesian way. A key challenge in systematically optimizing in this framework is the vast space of possible framings and the difficulty of predicting their effects on receivers. Based on growing evidence that Large Language Models (LLMs) can effectively serve as proxies for human behavior, we formulate a theoretical model based on access to a framing-to-belief oracle. This model then enables us to precisely characterize when solely optimizing framing or jointly optimizing framing and signaling is tractable. We substantiate our theoretical analysis with an empirical algorithm that leverages LLMs to (1) approximate the framing-to-belief oracle, and (2) optimize over language space using a hill-climbing method. We apply this to two marketing-inspired case studies and validate the effectiveness through analytical and human evaluation.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Programming Approach for Nash Equilibrium Computation in Multiplayer Imperfect-Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been significant recent progress in algorithms for approximation of Nash equilibrium in large two-player zero-sum imperfect-information games and exact computation of Nash equilibrium in multiplayer strategic-form games. While counterfactual regret minimization and fictitious play are scalable to large games and have convergence guarantees in two-player zero-sum games, they do not guarantee convergence to Nash equilibrium in multiplayer games. We present an approach for exact computation of Nash equilibrium in multiplayer imperfect-information games that solves a quadratically-constrained program based on a nonlinear complementarity problem formulation from the sequence-form game representation. This approach capitalizes on recent advances for solving nonconvex quadratic programs. Our algorithm is able to quickly solve three-player Kuhn poker after removal of dominated actions. Of the available algorithms in the Gambit software suite, only the logit quantal response approach is successfully able to solve the game; however, the approach takes longer than our algorithm and also involves a degree of approximation. Our formulation also leads to a new approach for computing Nash equilibrium in multiplayer strategic-form games which we demonstrate to outperform a previous quadratically-constrained program formulation.</description>

      <title>Achieving Pareto Optimality in Games via Single-bit Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient coordination in multi-agent systems often incurs high communication overhead or slow convergence rates, making scalable welfare optimization difficult. We propose Single-Bit Coordination Dynamics for Pareto-Efficient Outcomes (SBC-PE), a decentralized learning algorithm requiring only a single-bit satisfaction signal per agent each round. Despite this extreme efficiency, SBC-PE guarantees convergence to the exact optimal solution in arbitrary finite games. We establish explicit regret bounds, showing expected regret grows only logarithmically with the horizon, i.e., O(log T). Compared with prior payoff-based or bandit-style rules, SBC-PE uniquely combines minimal signaling, general applicability, and finite-time guarantees. These results show scalable welfare optimization is achievable under minimal communication constraints.</description>

      <title>Feedback Control for Small Budget Pacing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Budget pacing is critical in online advertising to align spend with campaign goals under dynamic auctions. Existing pacing methods often rely on ad-hoc parameter tuning, which can be unstable and inefficient. We propose a principled controller that combines bucketized hysteresis with proportional feedback to provide stable and adaptive spend control. Our method provides a framework and analysis for parameter selection that enables accurate tracking of desired spend rates across campaigns. Experiments in real-world auctions demonstrate significant improvements in pacing accuracy and delivery consistency, reducing pacing error by 13% and $\lambda$-volatility by 54% compared to baseline method. By bridging control theory with advertising systems, our approach offers a scalable and reliable solution for budget pacing, with particular benefits for small-budget campaigns.</description>

      <title>PAST: Pilot and Adaptive Orchestration for Timely and Resilient Service Delivery in Edge-Assisted UAV Networks under Spatio-Temporal Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incentive-driven resource trading is essential for UAV applications with intensive, time-sensitive computing demands. Traditional spot trading suffers from negotiation delays and high energy costs, while conventional futures trading struggles to adapt to the dynamic, uncertain UAV-edge environment. To address these challenges, we propose PAST (pilot-and-adaptive stable trading), a novel framework for edge-assisted UAV networks with spatio-temporal dynamism. PAST integrates two complementary mechanisms: PilotAO (pilot trading agreements with overbooking), a risk-aware, overbooking-enabled early-stage decision-making module that establishes long-term, mutually beneficial agreements and boosts resource utilization; and AdaptAO (adaptive trading agreements with overbooking rate update), an intelligent adaptation module that dynamically updates agreements and overbooking rates based on UAV mobility, supply-demand variations, and agreement performance. Together, these mechanisms enable both stability and flexibility, guaranteeing individual rationality, strong stability, competitive equilibrium, and weak Pareto optimality. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that PAST consistently outperforms benchmark methods in decision-making overhead, task completion latency, resource utilization, and social welfare. By combining predictive planning with real-time adjustments, PAST offers a valuable reference on robust and adaptive practice for improving low-altitude mission performance.</description>

      <title>Searcher Competition in Block Building</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the amount of maximal extractable value (MEV) captured by validators, as a function of searcher competition, in blockchains with competitive block building markets such as Ethereum. We argue that the core is a suitable solution concept in this context that makes robust predictions that are independent of implementation details or specific mechanisms chosen. We characterize how much value validators extract in the core and quantify the surplus share of validators as a function of searcher competition. Searchers can obtain at most the marginal value increase of the winning block relative to the best block that can be built without their bundles. Dually this gives a lower bound on the value extracted by the validator. If arbitrages are easy to find and many searchers find similar bundles, the validator gets paid all value almost surely, while searchers can capture most value if there is little searcher competition per arbitrage. For the case of passive block-proposers we study, moreover, mechanisms that implement core allocations in dominant strategies and find that for submodular value, there is a unique dominant-strategy incentive compatible core-selecting mechanism that gives each searcher exactly their marginal value contribution to the winning block. We validate our theoretical prediction empirically with aggregate bundle data and find a significant positive relation between the number of submitted backruns for the same opportunity and the median value captured by the proposer from the opportunity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05533v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information designers, such as online platforms, often do not know the beliefs of their receivers. We design learning algorithms so that the information designer can learn the receivers' prior belief from their actions through repeated interactions. Our learning algorithms achieve no regret relative to the optimality for the known prior at a fast speed, achieving a tight regret bound $\Theta(\log T)$ in general and a tight regret bound $\Theta(\log \log T)$ in the important special case of binary actions.</description>

      <title>From Competition to Centralization: The Oligopoly in Ethereum Block Building Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Block production on the Ethereum blockchain has adopted an auction-based mechanism known as Proposer--Builder Separation (PBS), where validators outsource block creation to builders competing in MEV--Boost auctions for Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) rewards. We employ empirical game-theoretic analysis based on simulations to examine how advantages in latency and MEV access shape builder strategic bidding and auction outcomes. We find that a small set of dominant builders leverage these advantages, consolidating power, reducing auction efficiency, and heightening centralization. Our results underscore the need for fair MEV distribution and sustained efforts to promote decentralization in Ethereum's block building market.</description>

      <title>The Free Option Problem of ePBS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ethereum's upcoming Glamsterdam upgrade introduces EIP-7732 enshrined Proposer--Builder Separation (ePBS), which improves the block production pipeline by addressing trust and scalability challenges. Yet it also creates a new liveness risk: builders gain a short-dated ``free'' option to prevent the execution payload they committed to from becoming canonical, without incurring an additional penalty. Exercising this option renders an empty block for the slot in question, thereby degrading network liveness.
  We present the first systematic study of the free option problem. Our theoretical results predict that option value and exercise probability grow with market volatility, the length of the option window, and the share of block value derived from external signals such as external market prices. The availability of a free option will lead to mispricing and LP losses. The problem would be exacerbated if Ethereum further scales and attracts more liquidity. Empirical estimates of values and exercise probabilities on historical blocks largely confirm our theoretical predictions. While the option is rarely profitable to exercise on average (0.82\% of blocks assuming an 8-second option time window), it becomes significant in volatile periods, reaching up to 6\% of blocks on high-volatility days -- precisely when users most require timely execution.
  Moreover, builders whose block value relies heavily on CEX-DEX arbitrage are more likely to exercise the option. We demonstrate that mitigation strategies -- shortening the option window or penalizing exercised options -- effectively reduce liveness risk.</description>

      <title>Thunderdome: Timelock-Free Rationally-Secure Virtual Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14418v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Payment channel networks (PCNs) offer a promising solution to address the limited transaction throughput of deployed blockchains. However, several attacks have recently been proposed that stress the vulnerability of PCNs to timelock and censoring attacks. To address such attacks, we introduce Thunderdome, the first timelock-free PCN. Instead, Thunderdome leverages the design rationale of virtual channels to extend a timelock-free payment channel primitive, thereby enabling multi-hop transactions without timelocks. Previous works either utilize timelocks or do not accommodate transactions between parties that do not share a channel.
  At its core, Thunderdome relies on a committee of non-trusted watchtowers, known as wardens, who ensure that no honest party loses funds, even when offline, during the channel closure process. We introduce tailored incentive mechanisms to ensure that all participants follow the protocol's correct execution. Besides a traditional security proof that assumes an honest majority of the committee, we conduct a formal game-theoretic analysis to demonstrate the security of Thunderdome when all participants, including wardens, act rationally. We implement a proof of concept of Thunderdome on Ethereum to validate its feasibility and evaluate its costs. Our evaluation shows that deploying Thunderdome, including opening the underlying payment channel, costs approximately \$15 (0.0089 ETH), while the worst-case cost for closing a channel is about \$7 (0.004 ETH).</description>

      <title>Construct to Commitment: The Effect of Narratives on Economic Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how government-led narratives through mass media evolve from construct, a mechanism for framing expectations, into commitment, a sustainable pillar for growth. We propose the "Narratives-Construct-Commitment (NCC)" framework outlining the mechanism and institutionalization of narratives, and formalize it as a dynamic Bayesian game. Using the Innovation-Driven Development Strategy (2016) as a case study, we identify the narrative shock from high-frequency financial data and trace its impact using local projection method. By shaping expectations, credible narratives institutionalize investment incentives, channel resources into R\&amp;D, and facilitate sustained improvements in total factor productivity (TFP). Our findings strive to provide insights into the New Quality Productive Forces initiative, highlighting the role of narratives in transforming vision into tangible economic growth.</description>

      <title>Discrepancy Beyond Additive Functions with Applications to Fair Division</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a setting where we have a ground set $M$ together with real-valued set functions $f_1, \dots, f_n$, and the goal is to partition $M$ into two sets $S_1,S_2$ such that $|f_i(S_1) - f_i(S_2)|$ is small for every $i$. Many results in discrepancy theory can be stated in this form with the functions $f_i$ being additive. In this work, we initiate the study of the unstructured case where $f_i$ is not assumed to be additive. We show that even without the additivity assumption, the upper bound remains at most $O(\sqrt{n \log n})$.
  Our result has implications on the fair allocation of indivisible goods. In particular, we show that a consensus halving up to $O(\sqrt{n \log n})$ goods always exists for $n$ agents with monotone utilities. Previously, only an $O(n)$ bound was known for this setting.</description>
