      <title>Self-similar phase diagram of the Fibonacci-driven quantum Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a stroboscopic quantum Ising model with Fibonacci dynamics. Focusing on boundary spin correlation functions in long but finite chains, our simulations as well as analytical arguments reveal a self-similar phase diagram exhibiting regions with Majorana zero modes (MZM) as well as Majorana golden-ratio modes (MGM). We identify the self-similarity transform which governs the evolution of the phase diagram with increasing simulation time. Integrability-breaking perturbations lead to a temporal decay of the boundary spin correlations, ultimaltely limiting the self-similarity of the phase diagram. Our predictions are testable with current quantum information processors.</description>

      <title>Emergence of non-ergodic multifractal quantum states in geometrical fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eigenstate multifractality, a hallmark of non-interacting disordered metals which can potentially be observed in many-body localized states as well, is characterized by anomalous slow dynamics and appears relevant for many areas of quantum physics from measurement-driven systems to superconductivity. We propose a novel approach to achieve non-ergodic multifractal (NEM) states without disorder by iteratively introducing defects into a crystal lattice, reshaping it from a plain structure into fractal geometry. By comprehensive analysis of the Sierpi\'nski gasket case, we find a robust evidence of the emergence of NEM states that go beyond the conventional classification of quantum states and designate new pathways for quantum transport studies. We discuss potential experimental signatures of these states.</description>

      <title>Long-range hopping in the quasi-periodic potential weakens the non-Hermitian skin effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model characterized by power-law hoppings ($1/s^{a}$) and a quasi-periodic parameter $\beta$, where $a$ denotes the power-law index, $s$ represents the hopping distance, and $\beta$ belongs to the metallic mean family. In the intermediate phases, we find that ergodic states correspond to complex eigenvalues, multifractal states to real eigenvalues, and localized states may exhibit either complex or real eigenvalues. Moreover, both real and complex energy spectra emerge in the localized phase, with real spectra attributed to pseudo-Hermiticity. Under open boundary conditions, our analysis of fractal dimensions and eigenstates reveals that all ergodic states transform into skin states. Furthermore, we demonstrate that long-range hoppings weaken the skin effect, offering a new perspective for exploring non-Hermitian skin effects.</description>

      <title>Bilinear Sequence Regression: A Model for Learning from Long Sequences of High-dimensional Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current progress in artificial intelligence is centered around so-called large language models that consist of neural networks processing long sequences of high-dimensional vectors called tokens. Statistical physics provides powerful tools to study the functioning of learning with neural networks and has played a recognized role in the development of modern machine learning. The statistical physics approach relies on simplified and analytically tractable models of data. However, simple tractable models for long sequences of high-dimensional tokens are largely underexplored. Inspired by the crucial role models such as the single-layer teacher-student perceptron (aka generalized linear regression) played in the theory of fully connected neural networks, in this paper, we introduce and study the bilinear sequence regression (BSR) as one of the most basic models for sequences of tokens. We note that modern architectures naturally subsume the BSR model due to the skip connections. Building on recent methodological progress, we compute the Bayes-optimal generalization error for the model in the limit of long sequences of high-dimensional tokens, and provide a message-passing algorithm that matches this performance. We quantify the improvement that optimal learning brings with respect to vectorizing the sequence of tokens and learning via simple linear regression. We also unveil surprising properties of the gradient descent algorithms in the BSR model.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Neural Networks for Functional Differential Equations: Cylindrical Approximation and Its Convergence Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the first learning scheme for functional differential equations (FDEs). FDEs play a fundamental role in physics, mathematics, and optimal control. However, the numerical analysis of FDEs has faced challenges due to its unrealistic computational costs and has been a long standing problem over decades. Thus, numerical approximations of FDEs have been developed, but they often oversimplify the solutions. To tackle these two issues, we propose a hybrid approach combining physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with the \textit{cylindrical approximation}. The cylindrical approximation expands functions and functional derivatives with an orthonormal basis and transforms FDEs into high-dimensional PDEs. To validate the reliability of the cylindrical approximation for FDE applications, we prove the convergence theorems of approximated functional derivatives and solutions. Then, the derived high-dimensional PDEs are numerically solved with PINNs. Through the capabilities of PINNs, our approach can handle a broader class of functional derivatives more efficiently than conventional discretization-based methods, improving the scalability of the cylindrical approximation. As a proof of concept, we conduct experiments on two FDEs and demonstrate that our model can successfully achieve typical $L^1$ relative error orders of PINNs $\sim 10^{-3}$. Overall, our work provides a strong backbone for physicists, mathematicians, and machine learning experts to analyze previously challenging FDEs, thereby democratizing their numerical analysis, which has received limited attention.

      <title>KMS states of Information Flow in Directed Brain Synaptic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The brain's synaptic network, characterized by parallel connections and feedback loops, drives information flow between neurons through a large system with infinitely many degrees of freedom. This system is best modeled by the graph $C^*$-algebra of the underlying directed graph, the Toeplitz-Cuntz-Krieger algebra, which captures the diversity of potential information pathways. Coupled with the gauge action, this graph algebra defines an {\em algebraic quantum system}, and here we demonstrate that its thermodynamic properties provide a natural framework for describing the dynamic mappings of information flow within the network. Specifically, we show that the KMS states of this system yield global statistical measures of neuronal interactions, with computational illustrations based on the {\em C. elegans} synaptic network.</description>

      <title>Causality and instability in wave propagation in random time-varying media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical model to investigate wave propagation in media with random time-varying properties, where temporal fluctuations lead to complex scattering dynamics. Focusing on the ensemble-averaged field, we derive an exact expression for the average Green's function in the presence of finite temporal disorder, and extend our analysis to the thermodynamic limit. In contrast to spatial disorder, causality prevents recurrent scattering, allowing us to achieve a non-perturbative solution. We identify two distinct propagation regimes: one where the field oscillates with constant amplitude, and another where it grows exponentially at long times. Our findings offer new insights into wave dynamics in temporally disordered media, with potential applications in time-varying metamaterials, dynamic sensing, and imaging in turbulent or chaotic environments.</description>

      <title>Stark Many-Body Localisation Under Periodic Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study stability of localisation under periodic driving in many-body Stark systems. We find that localisation is stable except near special resonant frequencies, where resonances cause delocalisation. We provide approximate analytical arguments and numerical evidence in support of these results. This shows that disorder-free broken ergodicity is stable to driving, opening up the way to studying nonequilibrium driven physics in a novel setting.</description>

      <title>Gaussian disorder and its applications in one-dimensional chain and sys-env models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces Gaussian disorder, characterized by two parameters:the expected value and the standard deviation.Studying this type of disorder enhances our understanding of how many-body localization (MBL) transition is influenced by the central value and breadth of disorder.We apply Gaussian disorder to a one-dimensional spin-1/2 chain to reveal its features.Our findings indicate that the crucial parameter driving localization transitions is the standard deviation; as it increases, the system transitions from the ergodic phase to the localized phase, while the expected value has no effect,so the critical factor influencing MBL transition is the breadth of disorder rather than its central value.We then explore Gaussian disorder in two system-environment models (hereafter referred to as the sye-env models, consisting of ladder configuration and staggered configuration),analyzing the mutual influence when they are coupled.We extensively explore the impacts brought about by system disorder,environment disorder,initial state,and the strength of the sys-env interaction.Finally,for theses two different models,we consider the system and environment as a whole,studying how the localization properties of the entire system are influenced by the disorder strength of each chain and the interaction strength between the two chains.In the ladder configuration, we observe a strong dependence on the initial state,which can lead to either the loss or retention of information,whereas no such dependence on the initial state is found in the staggered configuration.We emphasize that when using dynamic indicators to analyze system characteristics, it is essential to consider the influence of different initial states,as this may lead to significant differences under certain structural conditions,and not all initial states can accurately reflect the localization properties of the many-body system.</description>

      <title>Fundamental computational limits of weak learnability in high-dimensional multi-index models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15480v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-index models - functions which only depend on the covariates through a non-linear transformation of their projection on a subspace - are a useful benchmark for investigating feature learning with neural nets. This paper examines the theoretical boundaries of efficient learnability in this hypothesis class, focusing on the minimum sample complexity required for weakly recovering their low-dimensional structure with first-order iterative algorithms, in the high-dimensional regime where the number of samples $n\!=\!\alpha d$ is proportional to the covariate dimension $d$. Our findings unfold in three parts: (i) we identify under which conditions a trivial subspace can be learned with a single step of a first-order algorithm for any $\alpha\!&gt;\!0$; (ii) if the trivial subspace is empty, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an easy subspace where directions that can be learned only above a certain sample complexity $\alpha\!&gt;\!\alpha_c$, where $\alpha_{c}$ marks a computational phase transition. In a limited but interesting set of really hard directions -- akin to the parity problem -- $\alpha_c$ is found to diverge. Finally, (iii) we show that interactions between different directions can result in an intricate hierarchical learning phenomenon, where directions can be learned sequentially when coupled to easier ones. We discuss in detail the grand staircase picture associated to these functions (and contrast it with the original staircase one). Our theory builds on the optimality of approximate message-passing among first-order iterative methods, delineating the fundamental learnability limit across a broad spectrum of algorithms, including neural networks trained with gradient descent, which we discuss in this context.</description>
