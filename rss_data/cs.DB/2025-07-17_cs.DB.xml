      <title>SIEVE: Effective Filtered Vector Search with Collection of Indexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real-world tasks such as recommending videos with the kids tag can be reduced to finding most similar vectors associated with hard predicates. This task, filtered vector search, is challenging as prior state-of-the-art graph-based (unfiltered) similarity search techniques quickly degenerate when hard constraints are considered. That is, effective graph-based filtered similarity search relies on sufficient connectivity for reaching the most similar items within just a few hops. To consider predicates, recent works propose modifying graph traversal to visit only the items that may satisfy predicates. However, they fail to offer the just-a-few-hops property for a wide range of predicates: they must restrict predicates significantly or lose efficiency if only a small fraction of items satisfy predicates.
  We propose an opposite approach: instead of constraining traversal, we build many indexes each serving different predicate forms. For effective construction, we devise a three-dimensional analytical model capturing relationships among index size, search time, and recall, with which we follow a workload-aware approach to pack as many useful indexes as possible into a collection. At query time, the analytical model is employed yet again to discern the one that offers the fastest search at a given recall. We show superior performance and support on datasets with varying selectivities and forms: our approach achieves up to 8.06x speedup while having as low as 1% build time versus other indexes, with less than 2.15x memory of a standard HNSW graph and modest knowledge of past workloads.</description>

      <title>Towards Relational Contextual Equality Saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equality saturation is a powerful technique for program optimization. Contextual equality saturation extends this to support rewrite rules that are conditioned on where a term appears in an expression. Existing work has brought contextual reasoning to egg; in this paper, we share our ongoing work to extend this to relational equality saturation in egglog. We summarize the existing approaches to contextual equality saturation, outline its main applications, and identify key challenges in combining this approach with relational models.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Modern AI in Metadata Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metadata management plays a critical role in data governance, resource discovery, and decision-making in the data-driven era. While traditional metadata approaches have primarily focused on organization, classification, and resource reuse, the integration of modern artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has significantly transformed these processes. This paper investigates both traditional and AI-driven metadata approaches by examining open-source solutions, commercial tools, and research initiatives. A comparative analysis of traditional and AI-driven metadata management methods is provided, highlighting existing challenges and their impact on next-generation datasets. The paper also presents an innovative AI-assisted metadata management framework designed to address these challenges. This framework leverages more advanced modern AI technologies to automate metadata generation, enhance governance, and improve the accessibility and usability of modern datasets. Finally, the paper outlines future directions for research and development, proposing opportunities to further advance metadata management in the context of AI-driven innovation and complex datasets.</description>

      <title>THOR: Transformer Heuristics for On-Demand Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the THOR (Transformer Heuristics for On-Demand Retrieval) Module, designed and implemented by eSapiens, a secure, scalable engine that transforms natural-language questions into verified, read-only SQL analytics for enterprise databases. The Text-to-SQL module follows a decoupled orchestration/execution architecture: a Supervisor Agent routes queries, Schema Retrieval dynamically injects table and column metadata, and a SQL Generation Agent emits single-statement SELECT queries protected by a read-only guardrail. An integrated Self-Correction &amp; Rating loop captures empty results, execution errors, or low-quality outputs and triggers up to five LLM-driven regeneration attempts. Finally, a Result Interpretation Agent produces concise, human-readable insights and hands raw rows to the Insight &amp; Intelligence engine for visualization or forecasting.
  Smoke tests across finance, sales, and operations scenarios demonstrate reliable ad-hoc querying and automated periodic reporting. By embedding schema awareness, fault-tolerant execution, and compliance guardrails, the THOR Module empowers non-technical users to access live data with zero-SQL simplicity and enterprise-grade safety.</description>
