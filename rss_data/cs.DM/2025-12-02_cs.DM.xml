      <title>The Bottleneck Birthday Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a fun problem that can be considered as a variant of the classic birthday problem, the Bottleneck Birthday Problem (BBP). It is stated as: what is the maximum number of people we have to choose so that no day of the year has more than $r \geq 1$ birthdays incident on it with probability at least 1/2? We provide a survey of techniques used in the literature on occupancy and load balancing problems to derive recurrence relations for exact computation of the probability and the number of people, keeping probability fixed at a threshold. Further, we show that restricted Stirling numbers of the second kind can be used to derive an additional recurrence, in a novel way. We provide numerical results from an implementation of the recurrences.</description>

      <title>Structural and Spectral Properties of Strictly Interval Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we deal with a subclass of chordal graphs, which are simultaneously strictly chordal and interval, the strictly interval graphs. We present a new characterization of the class that leads to a simple linear recognition algorithm. Next we introduce a new subclass of strictly interval graphs, the $SI$-core graphs, that are non-split and non-cograph graphs and show that several elements of the new class are Laplacian integral.</description>

      <title>Heuristic algorithms for the stochastic critical node detection problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a network, the critical node detection problem finds a subset of nodes whose removal disrupts the network connectivity. Since many real-world systems are naturally modeled as graphs, assessing the vulnerability of the network is essential, with applications in transportation systems, traffic forecasting, epidemic control, and biological networks. In this paper, we consider a stochastic version of the critical node detection problem, where the existence of edges is given by certain probabilities. We propose heuristics and learning-based methods for the problem and compare them with existing algorithms. Experimental results performed on random graphs from small to larger scales, with edge-survival probabilities drawn from different distributions, demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods. Heuristic methods often illustrate the strongest results with high scalability, while learning-based methods maintain nearly constant inference time as the network size and density grow.</description>

      <title>Computing Treedepth Obstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The graph parameter treedepth is minor-monotone; hence, the class of graphs with treedepth at most $k$ is minor-closed. By the Graph Minor Theorem, such a class is characterized by a finite set of forbidden minors. A conjecture of Dvo\v{r}\'ak, Giannopoulou, and Thilikos states that every such forbidden minor has at most $2^k$ vertices. We present an algorithm that, given $n, k \in \mathbb{N}$, computes the set of forbidden minors, forbidden subgraphs, and forbidden induced subgraphs on at most $n$ vertices, for the class of graphs of treedepth at most $k$. Applying this algorithm to $k = 4$ and $n = 16$, we enumerate 1546 forbidden minors, 1718 forbidden subgraphs, and 12204 forbidden induced subgraphs. Assuming the above conjecture holds, these sets constitute the complete obstruction sets for graphs of treedepth at most 4.</description>

      <title>A Fast Algorithm for Finding Minimum Weight Cycles in Mining Cyclic Graph Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyclic structures are fundamental topological features in graphs, playing critical roles in network robustness, information flow, community structure, and various dynamic processes. Algorithmic tools that can efficiently probe and analyze these cyclic topologies are increasingly vital for tasks in graph mining, network optimization, bioinformatics, and social network analysis. A core primitive for quantitative analysis of cycles is finding the Minimum Weight Cycle (MWC), representing the shortest cyclic path in a weighted graph. However, computing the MWC efficiently remains a challenge, particularly compared to shortest path computations. This paper introduces a novel deterministic algorithm for finding the MWC in general weighted graphs. Our approach adapts the structure of Dijkstra's algorithm by introducing and minimizing a \textit{composite distance} metric, effectively translating the global cycle search into an iterative node-centric optimization. We provide a rigorous proof of correctness based on loop invariants. We detail two mechanisms for accelerating the search: a provable node discarding technique based on intermediate results, and a highly effective graph pruning heuristic. This heuristic dynamically restricts the search to relevant subgraphs, leveraging the principle of locality often present in complex networks to achieve significant empirical speedups, while periodic resets ensure global optimality is maintained. The efficiency of the proposed MWC algorithm enables its use as a core component in more complex analyses focused on cyclic properties. We illustrate this through a detailed application case study: accelerating the computation of the Loop Modulus, a measure of cycle richness used in advanced network characterization. Our algorithm dramatically reduces the runtime of the iterative constraint-finding bottleneck in this computation.</description>

      <title>Beware of the Classical Benchmark Instances for the Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple and exact informed search method for the Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows and Makespan objective (TSPTW-M) that solves all instances of the classical benchmark with 50 or more customers in less than ten seconds each. Applying this algorithm as an off-the-shelf method, we also solve all but one of these instances for the Duration objective. Our main conclusion is that these instances should no longer be employed for evaluating the TSPTW-M and its Duration variant: they can be ``hacked'' to yield results that seem outstanding at first sight. Additionally, caution is advised when designing hard training sets for machine learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Excluding a Forest Induced Minor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the first paper of the Graph Minors series [JCTB '83], Robertson and Seymour proved the Forest Minor theorem: the $H$-minor-free graphs have bounded pathwidth if and only if $H$ is a forest. In recent years, considerable effort has been devoted to understanding the unavoidable induced substructures of graphs with large pathwidth or large treewidth. In this paper, we give an induced counterpart of the Forest Minor theorem: for any $t \geqslant 2$, the $K_{t,t}$-subgraph-free $H$-induced-minor-free graphs have bounded pathwidth if and only if $H$ belongs to a class $\mathcal F$ of forests, which we describe as the induced minors of two (very similar) infinite parameterized families. This constitutes a significant step toward classifying the graphs $H$ for which every weakly sparse $H$-induced-minor-free class has bounded treewidth. Our work builds on the theory of constellations developed in the Induced Subgraphs and Tree Decompositions series.</description>

      <title>Minimally tough series-parallel graphs with toughness at least $1/2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $t$ be a positive real number. A graph is called \emph{$t$-tough} if the removal of any vertex set $S$ that disconnects the graph leaves at most $|S|/t$ components. The toughness of a graph is the largest $t$ for which the graph is $t$-tough. A graph is minimally $t$-tough if the toughness of the graph is $t$, and the deletion of any edge from the graph decreases the toughness. Series--parallel graphs are graphs with two distinguished vertices called
  terminals, formed recursively by two simple composition operations, series
  and parallel joins. They can be used to model series and parallel electric circuits.
  We characterize the minimally $t$-tough series-parallel graphs for all $t\ge 1/2$. It is clear that there is no minimally $t$-tough series-parallel graph if $t&gt;1$. We show that for $1\ge t &gt;1/2$, most of the series-parallel graphs with toughness $t$ are minimally $t$-tough, but most of the series-parallel graphs with toughness $1/2$ are not minimally $1/2$-tough.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant mutual-visibility: complexity and solutions for grid-like networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks are often modeled using graphs, and within this setting we introduce the notion of $k$-fault-tolerant mutual visibility. Informally, a set of vertices $X \subseteq V(G)$ in a graph $G$ is a $k$-fault-tolerant mutual-visibility set ($k$-ftmv set) if any two vertices in $X$ are connected by a bundle of $k+1$ shortest paths such that: ($i$) each shortest path contains no other vertex of $X$, and ($ii$) these paths are internally disjoint. The cardinality of a largest $k$-ftmv set is denoted by $\mathrm{f}\mu^{k}(G)$. The classical notion of mutual visibility corresponds to the case $k = 0$.
  This generalized concept is motivated by applications in communication networks, where agents located at vertices must communicate both efficiently (i.e., via shortest paths) and confidentially (i.e., without messages passing through the location of any other agent). The original notion of mutual visibility may fail in unreliable networks, where vertices or links can become unavailable.
  Several properties of $k$-ftmv sets are established, including a natural relationship between $\mathrm{f}\mu^{k}(G)$ and $\omega(G)$, as well as a characterization of graphs for which $\mathrm{f}\mu^{k}(G)$ is large. It is shown that computing $\mathrm{f}\mu^{k}(G)$ is NP-hard for any positive integer $k$, whether $k$ is fixed or not. Exact formulae for $\mathrm{f}\mu^{k}(G)$ are derived for several specific graph topologies, including grid-like networks such as cylinders and tori, and for diameter-two networks defined by Hamming graphs and by the direct product of complete graphs.</description>

      <title>Fortifying Critical Infrastructure Networks with Multicriteria Portfolio Decision Analysis: An Application to Railway Stations in Finland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06279v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advanced societies are crucially dependent on critical infrastructure networks for the reliable delivery of essential goods and services. Hence, well-founded analyses concerning disruptions are necessary to inform decisions that aim to ensure the performance of these networks in the face of failures caused by vulnerabilities to external hazards or technical malfunctions. In this setting, we develop an approach based on multicriteria decision analysis to support the identification of cost-efficient portfolios of preventive fortification actions. Our approach (i) accounts for multiple performance objectives, such as those that maximize the uninterrupted volume of traffic between different origin-destination pairs in a transportation network, (ii) uses methods of probabilistic risk assessment to quantify the expected performance of the network with regard to these objectives, and (iii) uses a search algorithm combined with an optimization model to identify those combinations of fortification actions that are cost-efficient in improving the performance of the network, given the available, possibly partial information about the relative importance of objectives and minimum performance requirements on them. Our methodological contributions are illustrated by a case study on the analysis of railway switches at a representative Finnish railway station.</description>

      <title>Approximately Dominating Sets in Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Condorcet's paradox is a fundamental result in social choice theory which states that there exist elections in which, no matter which candidate wins, a majority of voters prefer a different candidate. In fact, even if we can select any $k$ winners, there still may exist another candidate that would beat each of the winners in a majority vote. That is, elections may require arbitrarily large dominating sets.
  We show that approximately dominating sets of constant size always exist. In particular, for every $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, every election (irrespective of the number of voters or candidates) can select $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon ^2})$ winners such that no other candidate beats each of the winners by a margin of more than $\varepsilon$ fraction of voters.
  Our proof uses a simple probabilistic construction using samples from a maximal lottery, a well-studied distribution over candidates derived from the Nash equilibrium of a two-player game. In stark contrast to general approximate equilibria, which may require support logarithmic in the number of pure strategies, we show that maximal lotteries can be approximated with constant support size. These approximate maximal lotteries may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Approximate polymorphisms of predicates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A generalized polymorphism of a predicate $P \subseteq \{0,1\}^m$ is a tuple of functions $f_1,\dots,f_m\colon \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ satisfying the following property: If $x^{(1)},\dots,x^{(m)} \in \{0,1\}^n$ are such that $(x^{(1)}_i,\dots,x^{(m)}_i) \in P$ for all $i$, then also $(f_1(x^{(1)}),\dots,f_m(x^{(m)})) \in P$.
  We show that if $f_1,\dots,f_m$ satisfy this property for most $x^{(1)},\dots,x^{(m)}$ (as measured with respect to an arbitrary full support distribution $\mu$ on $P$), then $f_1,\dots,f_m$ are close to a generalized polymorphism of $P$ (with respect to the marginals of $\mu$).
  Our main result generalizes several results in the literature: linearity testing, quantitative Arrow theorems, approximate intersecting families, AND testing, and more generally $f$-testing.</description>

      <title>Matroids are Equitable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that if the ground set of a matroid can be partitioned into $k\ge 2$ bases, then for any given subset $S$ of the ground set, there is a partition into $k$ bases such that the sizes of the intersections of the bases with $S$ may differ by at most one. This settles the matroid equitability conjecture by Fekete and Szab\'o (Electron. J. Comb. 2011) in the affirmative. We also investigate equitable splittings of two disjoint sets $S_1$ and $S_2$, and show that there is a partition into $k$ bases such that the sizes of the intersections with $S_1$ may differ by at most one and the sizes of the intersections with $S_2$ may differ by at most two; this is the best one can hope for arbitrary matroids.
  We also derive applications of this result into matroid constrained fair division problems. We show that there exists a matroid-constrained fair division that is envy-free up to one item if the valuations are identical and tri-valued additive. We also show that for bi-valued additive valuations, there exists a matroid-constrained allocation that provides everyone their maximin share.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Branching Rauzy induction is a two-sided form of Rauzy induction that acts on regular interval exchange transformations (IETs). We introduce an extended form of branching Rauzy induction that applies to arbitrary standard IETs, including non-minimal ones. The procedure generalizes the branching Rauzy method with two induction steps, merging and splitting, to handle equal-length cuts and invariant components respectively. As an application, we show, via a stepwise morphic argument, that all return words in the language of an arbitrary IET cluster in the Burrows-Wheeler sense.</description>
