      <title>Finding perfect matchings in bridgeless cubic multigraphs without dynamic (2-)connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Petersen's theorem, one of the earliest results in graph theory, states that any bridgeless cubic multigraph contains a perfect matching. While the original proof was neither constructive nor algorithmic, Biedl, Bose, Demaine, and Lubiw [J. Algorithms 38(1)] showed how to implement a later constructive proof by Frink in $\mathcal{O}(n\log^{4}n)$ time using a fully dynamic 2-edge-connectivity structure. Then, Diks and Sta\'nczyk [SOFSEM 2010] described a faster approach that only needs a fully dynamic connectivity structure and works in $\mathcal{O}(n\log^{2}n)$ time. Both algorithms, while reasonable simple, utilize non-trivial (2-edge-)connectivity structures. We show that this is not necessary, and in fact a structure for maintaining a dynamic tree, e.g. link-cut trees, suffices to obtain a simple $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ time algorithm.</description>

      <title>Diameter of the inversion graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an oriented graph $\vec{G}$, the inversion of a subset $X$ of vertices consists in reversing the orientation of all arcs with both endvertices in $X$. The inversion graph of a labelled graph $G$, denoted by ${\mathcal{I}}(G)$, is the graph whose vertices are the labelled orientations of $G$ in which two labelled orientations $\vec{G}_1$ and $\vec{G}_2$ of $G$ are adjacent if and only if there is an inversion $X$ transforming $\vec{G}_1$ into $\vec{G}_2$. In this paper, we study the inversion diameter of a graph which is the diameter of its inversion graph denoted by $diam(\mathcal{I}(G))$. We show that the inversion diameter is tied to the star chromatic number, the acyclic chromatic number and the oriented chromatic number. Thus a graph class has bounded inversion diameter if and only if it also has bounded star chromatic number, acyclic chromatic number and oriented chromatic number. We give some upper bounds on the inversion diameter of a graph $G$ contained in one of the following graph classes: planar graphs ($diam(\mathcal{I}(G)) \leq 12$), planar graphs of girth 8 ($diam(\mathcal{I}(G)) \leq 3$), graphs with maximum degree $\Delta$ ($diam(\mathcal{I}(G)) \leq 2\Delta -1$), graphs with treewidth at mots $t$ ($diam(\mathcal{I}(G)) \leq 2t$).
  We also show that determining the inversion diameter of a given graph is NP-hard.</description>

      <title>A Random Walk Approach to Broadcasting on Random Recursive Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the broadcasting problem on trees, a $\{0,1\}$-message originating in an unknown node is passed along the tree with a certain error probability $q$. The goal is to estimate the original message without knowing the order in which the nodes were informed. A variation of the problem is considering this broadcasting process on a randomly growing tree, which Addario-Berry et al. have investigated for uniform and linear preferential attachment recursive trees. We extend their studies of the majority estimator to the entire group of very simple increasing trees as well as shape exchangeable trees using the connection to inhomogeneous random walks and other stochastic processes with memory effects such as P\'olya Urns.</description>

      <title>PoW Security-Latency under Random Delays and the Effect of Transaction Fees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety guarantees and security-latency problem of Nakamoto consensus have been extensively studied in the last decade with a bounded delay model. Recent studies have shown that PoW protocol is secure under random delay models as well. In this paper, we analyze the security-latency problem, i.e., how secure a block is, after it becomes k-deep in the blockchain, under general random delay distributions. We provide tight and explicit bounds which only require determining the distribution of the number of Poisson arrivals during the random delay. We further consider potential effects of recent Bitcoin halving on the security-latency problem by extending our results.</description>

      <title>Local certification of geometric graph classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of local certification is to locally convince the vertices of a graph $G$ that $G$ satisfies a given property. A prover assigns short certificates to the vertices of the graph, then the vertices are allowed to check their certificates and the certificates of their neighbors, and based only on this local view, they must decide whether $G$ satisfies the given property. If the graph indeed satisfies the property, all vertices must accept the instance, and otherwise at least one vertex must reject the instance (for any possible assignment of certificates). The goal is to minimize the size of the certificates.
  In this paper we study the local certification of geometric and topological graph classes. While it is known that in $n$-vertex graphs, planarity can be certified locally with certificates of size $O(\log n)$, we show that several closely related graph classes require certificates of size $\Omega(n)$. This includes penny graphs, unit-distance graphs, (induced) subgraphs of the square grid, 1-planar graphs, and unit-square graphs. These bounds are tight up to a constant factor and give the first known examples of hereditary (and even monotone) graph classes for which the certificates must have linear size. For unit-disk graphs we obtain a lower bound of $\Omega(n^{1-\delta})$ for any $\delta&gt;0$ on the size of the certificates, and an upper bound of $O(n \log n)$. The lower bounds are obtained by proving rigidity properties of the considered graphs, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>1-in-3 vs. Not-All-Equal: Dichotomy of a broken promise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 1-in-3 and Not-All-Equal satisfiability problems for Boolean CNF formulas are two well-known NP-hard problems. In contrast, the promise 1-in-3 vs. Not-All-Equal problem can be solved in polynomial time. In the present work, we investigate this constraint satisfaction problem in a regime where the promise is weakened from either side by a rainbow-free structure, and establish a complexity dichotomy for the resulting class of computational problems.</description>

      <title>On polynomials associated to Voronoi diagrams of point sets and crossing numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three polynomials are defined for given sets $S$ of $n$ points in general position in the plane: The Voronoi polynomial with coefficients the numbers of vertices of the order-$k$ Voronoi diagrams of $S$, the circle polynomial with coefficients the numbers of circles through three points of $S$ enclosing $k$ points of $S$, and the $E_{\leq k}$ polynomial with coefficients the numbers of (at most $k$)-edges of $S$. We present several formulas for the rectilinear crossing number of $S$ in terms of these polynomials and their roots. We also prove that the roots of the Voronoi polynomial lie on the unit circle if, and only if, $S$ is in convex position. Further, we present bounds on the location of the roots of these polynomials.</description>

      <title>Redicolouring digraphs: directed treewidth and cycle-degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a digraph $D=(V,A)$ on $n$ vertices and a vertex $v\in V$, the cycle-degree of $v$ is the minimum size of a set $S \subseteq V(D) \setminus \{v\}$ intersecting every directed cycle of $D$ containing $v$. From this definition of cycle-degree, we define the $c$-degeneracy (or cycle-degeneracy) of $D$, which we denote by $\delta^*_c(D)$. It appears to be a nice generalisation of the undirected degeneracy. In this work, using this new definition of cycle-degeneracy, we extend several evidences for Cereceda's conjecture to digraphs. The $k$-dicolouring graph of $D$, denoted by $\mathcal{D}_k(D)$, is the undirected graph whose vertices are the $k$-dicolourings of $D$ and in which two $k$-dicolourings are adjacent if they differ on the colour of exactly one vertex.
  We show that $\mathcal{D}_k(D)$ has diameter at most $O_{\delta^*_c(D)}(n^{\delta^*_c(D) + 1})$ (respectively $O(n^2)$ and $(\delta^*_c(D)+1)n$) when $k$ is at least $\delta^*_c(D)+2$ (respectively $\frac{3}{2}(\delta^*_c(D)+1)$ and $2(\delta^*_c(D)+1)$). This improves known results on digraph redicolouring (Bousquet et al.).
  Next, we extend a result due to Feghali to digraphs, showing that $\mathcal{D}_{d+1}(D)$ has diameter at most $O_{d,\epsilon}(n(\log n)^{d-1})$ when $D$ has maximum average cycle-degree at most $d-\epsilon$. We then show that two proofs of Bonamy and Bousquet for undirected graphs can be extended to digraphs. The first one uses the digrundy number of a digraph and the second one uses the $\mathscr{D}$-width.
  Finally, we give a general theorem which makes a connection between the recolourability of a digraph $D$ and the recolourability of its underlying graph $UG(D)$. This result directly extends a number of results on planar graph recolouring to planar digraph redicolouring.</description>

      <title>Boolean Variation and Boolean Logic BackPropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of variation is introduced for the Boolean set and based on which Boolean logic backpropagation principle is developed. Using this concept, deep models can be built with weights and activations being Boolean numbers and operated with Boolean logic instead of real arithmetic. In particular, Boolean deep models can be trained directly in the Boolean domain without latent weights. No gradient but logic is synthesized and backpropagated through layers.</description>
