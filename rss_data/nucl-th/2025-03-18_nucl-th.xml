      <title>Radiative corrections for the two-nucleon interaction in effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiative corrections are playing an increasingly significant role in low-energy nuclear physics. We investigate the influence of photons as explicit degrees of freedom within nuclear EFT on the deuteron binding energy, charge form factor, and the radiative capture process $ np \to d\gamma $ using the velocity renormalization group. In each case, evolving the subtraction velocity to a characteristic nucleon velocity in the bound state induces percent-level modifications in the relevant observables. These findings indicate that electromagnetic corrections represent a non-negligible source of uncertainty in current few-body calculations.</description>

      <title>Towards shell model interactions with credible uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: The nuclear shell model offers realistic predictions of nuclear structure starting from (quasi-) proton and neutron degrees of freedom, but relies on coupling constants (interaction matrix elements) that must be fit to experiment. To extend the shell model's applicability across the nuclear chart, and specifically toward the driplines, we must first be able to efficiently test new interaction matrix elements and assign credible uncertainties.
  Purpose: We develop and test a framework to efficiently fit new shell model interactions and obtain credible uncertainties. We further demonstrate its use by validating the uncertainty estimates of the known \textit{sd}-shell effective interactions.
  Methods: We use eigenvector continuation to emulate solutions to the exact shell model. First, we use the emulator to replicate earlier results using a well-known linear-combination chi-squared minimization algorithm. Then, we employ a modern Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to test for nonlinearities in the observable posterior distributions, which previous sensitivity analyses precluded.
  Results: The emulator reproduces the USDB interaction within a small margin of error, allowing for the quantification of the matrix element uncertainty. However, we find that to obtain credible predictive intervals the model defect of the shell model itself, rather than experimental or emulator uncertainty/error, must be taken into account.
  Conclusions: Eigenvector continuation can be used to accelerate fitting shell model interactions. We confirm that the linear approximation used to develop interactions in the past is indeed sufficient. However, we find that typical assumptions about the likelihood function must be modified in order to obtain a credible uncertainty-quantified interaction.</description>

      <title>Quantification of the evaporation process during fragmentation of space-relevant nuclei on elemental targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines charge-changing cross sections for 12C, 14N, 16O, and 20Ne projectiles on elemental targets (C, Al, Cu) at a beam energy of around 290 MeV/nucleon. The two-stage abrasion-ablation model is used, with the abrasion stage described via the Glauber model, incorporating validated single-nucleon density distributions from proton elastic scattering data. In the ablation stage, where particle evaporation occurs, the contribution to charge-changing cross sections is estimated using two approaches. First, a statistical decay model is employed to analyze the evaporation of protons following neutron removal in the abrasion stage. The second approach estimates evaporation contributions by subtracting the direct process component (abrasion) from the experimental charge-changing cross section data. A comparison between these estimated contributions from the experimental data and the predictions of the statistical model enables a systematic evaluation of the evaporation process. The key factors influencing evaporation, such as excitation energy distribution parameters, decay width of the emitted particles, and nucleon separation energies, are analyzed. A strong correlation is observed between the maximum excitation energy available for evaporation and the neutron separation energy of the projectiles across different targets, highlighting the role of evaporation dynamics in the charge-changing cross sections.</description>

      <title>Study of \b{eta}-Decay, log ft Values and Nuclear Structure Properties of Neutron-rich Ge Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the relativistic mean field (RMF) model to conduct a thorough analysis of the ground-state properties of $^{67\text{--}80}$Ge nuclei. Binding energies and neutron skin thicknesses are computed for a total of 14 neutron-rich Ge isotopes. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the RMF model's explanation of nuclear ground-state properties. Furthermore, we examine the $\log ft$ values of the allowed $\beta^\pm$ decays and electron/positron capture rates on Ge isotopes in the mass region $A = 67\text{--}80$. The proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation (pn-QRPA) method was employed to calculate the $\beta$-decay properties of selected Ge isotopes. The calculated $\log ft$ values show good consistency with the measured data. The predicted $\beta$-decay half-lives are within a factor of 2 of the measured values. For high temperature and density conditions in the core of massive stars, the calculated pn-QRPA stellar rates are up to an order of magnitude larger than the independent shell model rates. The findings reported in this study could be valuable for simulating the late-stage stellar evolution of massive stars.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Excitation and Control Induced by Intense Vortex Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existing intense laser-based approaches for nuclear excitation offer ultrafast temporal resolution and high efficiency compared to traditional accelerator probes. However, controlling nuclear properties such as spin and magnetic moment remains an unprecedented challenge. Here, we put forward a novel method for nuclear excitation and control induced by intense vortex lasers. We develop a theory incorporating the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of vortex laser within the nuclear hyperfine mixing framework. We find that intense vortex laser can effectively excite hydrogen-like thorium-229 nucleus and induce three-dimensional rotation of the nuclear magnetic moment. This rotation arises from the localized electromagnetic field and new transition channels excited by the vortex laser, and can be reconstructed through radiation spectrum analysis. Moreover, the OAM of vortex laser enables the chaotic system to exhibit topologically protected periodic patterns in nuclear excitation and radiation, facilitating precise experimental measurements. Our findings underscore the potential of vortex laser for high-precision nuclear control and imaging, deepening our understanding of nuclear properties and hyperfine structure, and advancing quantum information and nuclear technologies.</description>

      <title>Effect of transverse momentum conservation and flow on symmetric cumulants $sc_{2,3} \left \{ 4 \right \}$ and $sc_{2,3,4} \left \{ 6 \right \}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetric cumulants can improve our understanding of the joint probability distribution function $ P\left ( v_{m},v_{n},v_{k}, \dots,\Psi _{m},\Psi _{n},\Psi _{k},\dots \right )$, potentially offering new insights into the nature of the fluctuations of the quark-gluon plasma produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. In this work, the four-particle symmetric cumulants $sc_{2,3} \left \{ 4 \right \}$, six-particle symmetric cumulants $sc_{2,3,4} \left \{ 6 \right \}$, and the normalized cumulants $nsc_{2,3} \left \{ 4 \right \}$ and $nsc_{2,3,4} \left \{ 6 \right \}$ originating from transverse momentum conservation, collective flow, and the interplay between the two effects are calculated. Our results are consistent with the ATLAS data using the subevent cumulant method and the simulations using the realistic Monte Carlo models of iEBE-VISHNU and HIJING, facilitating a more profound understanding of the origins of these symmetric cumulants in small systems.</description>

      <title>On the mapping after and before truncation in the boson expansion theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the norm operator method, which extends and corrects the conventional boson expansion theories, we investigate two boson mappings of the boson expansion theory, the so-called mapping after truncation and the mapping before truncation. The difference between them stems from the treatment of the phonon excitation modes; those not adopted as boson excitation modes in the former mapping are adopted in the latter mapping. When the commutation relations among the phonon operators are closed among the excitation modes adopted as the boson excitation modes in the mapping after truncation, the mapping after and the mapping before truncation coincide, not depending on the types, Hermitian and non-Hermitian. We also investigate the Park operator, which judges whether a boson state vector is physical, and reveal that the conventional claim, which claims that it is applicable only when the mapping is that of the whole fermion space, is incorrect.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties and spin alignment of $\phi$ meson in QCD Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the spin alignment of a vector meson is predicted to be correlated with its spectral properties, we study the spectral properties of the $\phi$ meson using two microscopic Lagrangians based either on chiral effective field theory or the quark-meson model. We calculate the self-energies and spectral functions of the $\phi$ meson for these two Lagrangians at the one-loop level within the Matsubara formalism of finite-temperature quantum field theory, employing various parameters to represent different physical scenarios. Using these spectral functions, transport coefficients related to the spin alignment and tensor polarization are obtained, connecting the spin alignment of the $\phi$ meson to hydrodynamic gradients. Using the standard freeze-out picture within the relativistic hydrodynamic model, we explore how the possible pattern of the spin alignment can be generated using these microscopically calculated spectral functions. We discover that, with certain assumptions, these simple microscopic model-based calculations can produce sizable spin alignments with a sign-flipping behavior in their $p_T$ and centrality dependence, similar to those observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>Testing the QCD formation time with reconstructed parton splittings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high-energy elementary collisions the space-time ordering of parton branching processes is not accessible experimentally. In contrast, in heavy-ion collisions, parton showers interact with a spatially extended dense medium. This sets a reference length scale with respect to which the space-time ordering may be analysed. Here, we explore the possibility of identifying experimental signatures of the QCD formation time, $\tau_f$, on the level of a single parton splitting. Since heavy flavour offers an additional handle on tracing the propagation of individual quarks through the medium, we focus on the $g\to c\bar{c}$ splitting. Combining adapted versions of the Cambridge-Aachen and FlavourCone jet finding algorithms with grooming techniques, we show how the kinematics of such splittings can be reconstructed with high fidelity using either final state partons or hadrons, and how the formation time distribution of parton splittings can be constructed therefrom. Medium modification leads to a characteristic modification of this $\tau_f$ distribution. This effect can be used to construct experimentally-accessible ratios of $\tau_f$ distributions, in which the sensitivity of the medium modification to the QCD formation time becomes measurable.</description>

      <title>NNPDFpol2.0: unbiased global determination of polarized PDFs and their uncertainties at next-to-next-to-leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present NNPDFpol2.0, a new set of collinear helicity parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton based on legacy measurements of structure functions in inclusive neutral-current longitudinally polarised deep-inelastic scattering (DIS), and of W -boson, single-inclusive, and di-jet production asymmetries in longitudinally polarised proton-proton collisions. The determination is accurate to next-to-next-to-leading order in the strong coupling, and includes heavy quark mass corrections in the analysis of DIS data. Uncertainties due to missing higher-order corrections are systematically incorporated by means of a covariance matrix determined by scale variations. NNPDFpol2.0 is based on a machine learning methodology, that makes use of Monte Carlo sampling for the representation of uncertainties into PDFs, of a neural network for the parametrisation of PDFs, of stochastic gradient descent for the optimisation of PDF parameters, and of hyperoptimisation for the selection of the best fitting model. We study the impact on PDFs of higher-order corrections, of the positivity constraint, and of the data. We demonstrate two phenomenological applications of NNPDFpol2.0, specifically the determination of the proton spin fraction carried by gluons and quarks, and of theoretical predictions for single-hadron production in longitudinally polarised DIS and proton-proton collisions.</description>

      <title>The ${\phi NN,J/\psi NN,\eta_c NN}$ systems based on HAL QCD interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of bound states and resonances in the ${\phi NN, J/\psi NN, \eta_c NN}$ systems using HAL QCD interactions for ${\phi N, J/\psi N}$, and ${\eta_c N}$. We employ the Gaussian expansion method to solve the complex-scaled Schr\"odinger equation and find no resonances or bound states in the ${J/\psi NN}$ and ${\eta_c NN}$ systems. We estimate the interaction between charmonium and nuclei, concluding that the $J/\psi$ or $\eta_c$ is likely to bind with ${}^3\mathrm{H}$, ${}^3\mathrm{He}$, ${}^4\mathrm{He}$, and heavier nuclei. For the $\phi NN$ system, the lattice QCD $\phi N\left({ }^2 S_{1 / 2}\right)$ interaction is absent. We combine the $\phi p$ correlation function analysis and HAL QCD results in Model A. We assume the spin-spin interactions for $J/\psi N$ and $\phi N$ systems are inversely proportional to their masses in Model B. Model A predicts a stronger $\phi N({}^2 S_{1/2})$ interaction and permits a two-body bound state, whereas Model B suggests the interaction is attractive but too weak to form a bound state. Both models predict bound states for the $I(J^P) = 0(0^-)$ and $0(1^-)$ $\phi NN$ systems. In Model A, these states are deeply bound with binding energies exceeding 15 MeV and remain existent when considering parameter uncertainties. In contrast, these states are very loosely bound in Model B, with binding energies below 1 MeV and an existent probability of about 60\% when parameter uncertainties are considered. In both models, there exist very loosely bound $I(J^P) = 0(2^-)$ three-body states which resemble a $\phi$-d atom with the $\phi$ meson surrounding the deuteron, but their existences are sensitive to parameter uncertainties. No bound states or resonances are found in the isovector $I(J^P) = 1(1^-)$ $\phi NN$ system.</description>

      <title>Tomography of the Rho meson in the QCD Instanton Vacuum: Transverse Momentum Dependent Parton Distribution Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the rho meson unpolarized and polarized transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDPDFs) in the instanton liquid model (ILM). The corresponding TMDs in ILM are approximated by a constituent quark beam function in the leading Fock state multiplied by a rapidity-dependent factor resulting from the staple-shaped Wilson lines, for fixed longitudinal momentum, transverse separation, and rapidity. At the resolution of the ILM, all of the rho meson TMDs are symmetric in parton x for fixed transverse momentum, and Gaussian-like in the transverse momentum for fixed parton x. The latter is a direct consequence of the profiling of the quark zero modes in the ILM. The evolved TMDs at higher rapidity using the Collins-Soper kernel, and higher resolution using the renormalization group (RG), show substantial skewness towards low parton x.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Einstein Telescope (ET) is the European project for a gravitational-wave (GW) observatory of third-generation. In this paper we present a comprehensive discussion of its science objectives, providing state-of-the-art predictions for the capabilities of ET in both geometries currently under consideration, a single-site triangular configuration or two L-shaped detectors. We discuss the impact that ET will have on domains as broad and diverse as fundamental physics, cosmology, early Universe, astrophysics of compact objects, physics of matter in extreme conditions, and dynamics of stellar collapse. We discuss how the study of extreme astrophysical events will be enhanced by multi-messenger observations. We highlight the ET synergies with ground-based and space-borne GW observatories, including multi-band investigations of the same sources, improved parameter estimation, and complementary information on astrophysical or cosmological mechanisms obtained combining observations from different frequency bands. We present advancements in waveform modeling dedicated to third-generation observatories, along with open tools developed within the ET Collaboration for assessing the scientific potentials of different detector configurations. We finally discuss the data analysis challenges posed by third-generation observatories, which will enable access to large populations of sources and provide unprecedented precision.</description>

      <title>Axion-Like Particle Mediated Dark Matter and Neutron Star Properties in the QHD Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of the ALP-mediated dark matter (DM) model on neutron star properties using the Quantum Hadrodynamics model (QHD). Using the relativistic mean-field approximation with the QHD-ALP-DM framework, we compute the equation of state (EoS) of neutron stars. Based on our previous study, we find that typical ALP parameter values have no significant effect on the EoS. We then explore various parametrizations of this model by varying the DM Fermi momentum, $q_f$, and DM mass, $m_{\chi}$. Our results show that increasing $q_f$ or $m_{\chi}$ shifts the energy density to higher values while reducing the maximum mass, radius, and tidal deformability of neutron stars. Finally, comparison with observational constraints from gravitational wave events and pulsar measurements indicates that the allowed parameter space for this model is constrained to $q_f &lt; 0.05$ MeV and $m_{\chi} &lt; 1000$ GeV. As a result, our study highlights the importance of next-generation gamma-ray observatories, such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), in probing the ALP-mediated DM model.</description>

      <title>Gluon gravitational form factors of the proton in a light-front spectator model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the gluon gravitational form factors (GFFs) of the proton using a light-front spectator model based on soft-wall AdS/QCD, where the active parton is a gluon. The model parameters are determined by fitting the unpolarized gluon distribution function to the NNPDF3.0nlo dataset. Subsequently, we predict the polarized gluon distribution, finding consistency with global analyses. Our predictions for the gluon GFFs show good agreement with recent lattice QCD simulations and experimental extractions. Using these gluon GFFs, we compute the contribution of the gluon to the proton mass and mechanical radii. We also analyze the gluonic contribution to the two-dimensional Galilean densities, including energy density, radial and tangential pressure, isotropic pressure, and pressure anisotropy of the proton.</description>

      <title>A multi-messenger mass determination method for LISA Neutron-Star White-Dwarf Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the mass of the neutron stars (NSs) accurately improves our understanding of the NS interior and complicated binary evolution. However, the masses of the systems are degenerate with orbital inclination angle when using solely gravitational waves (GWs) or electromagnetic measurements, especially for face-on binaries. Taking advantages of both GWs and optical observations for LISA neutron-star white-dwarf (NS-WD) binaries, we propose a mass determination method utilising multi-messenger observational information. By combining the binary mass function obtained from optical observations and a GW mass function, that we introduce, derived from GW observations, we demonstrate how we can set improved constraints on the NS mass and break the degeneracy in the mass and viewing inclination determination. We further comment on the universal relation of the error bar of the GW mass function versus GW signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and propose a simple method for the estimate of capability of GW observations on mass determination with {LISA}. We show that for ultra-compact NS-WD binaries within our Galaxy, the mass of the NS can be constrained to within an accuracy of +- 0.2 \solarmass with the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections on vortical spin polarization in hot QCD matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the radiative corrections on spin polarization of relativistic fermions induced by vortical fields in thermal-equilibrium QCD matter at weak coupling. Such corrections stem from the self-energy gradients in quantum kinetic theory, which are further obtained by a more systematic and general approach through the Keldysh equation. By applying the hard-thermal-loop approximation, we obtain new corrections upon the spin-polarization spectrum and also the axial-charge current in connection to the axial/chiral vortical effect for massive quarks up to the leading order of the QCD coupling. Further influence on spin alignment of vector mesons from similar effects is also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Relativistic corrections to energy spectrum of hydrogen due to the full one-photon-exchange interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02003v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present expressions for the full effective potential corresponding to the one-photon exchange interaction within the framework of an effective Schr\"{o}dinger-like equation, which is derived exactly from the Bethe-Salpeter equation in quantum electrodynamics. The final effective potential is expressed in terms of eight scalar functions. When these eight scalar functions are expanded in terms of velocities order by order, we can return to the non-relativistic effective potential systematically organized by velocities. By retaining the exact momentum dependence in the effective potential, we estimate its corrections to the energy spectrum of hydrogen using a highly precise numerical method. The comparison of the numerical results with those obtained using conventional bound-state perturbative theory is discussed. Our calculations suggest that it is possible to accurately account for all relativistic contributions using this method. It would be interesting to extend these calculations to positronium, muonic hydrogen, and scenarios involving nuclear structure and radiative corrections.</description>

      <title>A study of bound states of $\eta, \eta^{'}, D^{0}$, $\bar{D^{0}}$, $B^{0}$, $\bar{B^{0}}$, $\bar{K^{0}}$ and $\phi$ mesons with light and heavy nuclei within chiral SU(3) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work we explore the possibilities of the formation of bound states of neutral pseudoscalar mesons $\eta, \eta^{'}, D^{0}$, $\bar{D^{0}}, B^{0}, \bar{B^{0}}$ and $\bar{K^{0}}$ and the vector meson $\phi$, with the nuclei $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O, $^{40}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb, calculating their binding energy and absorption decay width. To calculate the optical potentials of these mesons in different nuclei under study, we shall use the chiral SU(3) hadronic mean field model, in which the properties of nucleons in the medium are modified through the scalar isoscalar fields $\sigma$ and $\zeta$ and the scalar-isovector field $\delta$. The scalar-isovector field $\delta$ account for the finite isospin asymmetry of different nuclei having asymmetry in number of protons and neutrons. The binding energy and absorption decay width of mesons are calculated for the ground state and some of possible excited states of the nuclei. In the chiral SU(3) model, the mesons $ \eta, D^{0}$, $\bar{D^{0}}, B^{0}, \bar{B^{0}}$ and $\bar{K^{0}}$ are observed to have significant negative mass shift upto nuclear saturation density which lead to the possibility of the bound states at least for ground states and some of excited states in case of heavy nuclei. For the pseudoscalar singlet $\eta^{'}$ and the vector meson $\phi$ the mass shift obtained are found to be small and bound states are not formed. The present calculations are compared with different studies available in the field and will be useful in understanding the outcomes from different experimental facilities focusing on this area of research.</description>

      <title>First complete description of low-lying spectroscopy in $^{254}$No</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08210v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we report the first complete shell-model description of low-lying structures of $^{254}$No. Employing the Kuo-Herling effective interaction, the calculations are performed within the Discrete Non-Orthogonal Shell Model recently implemented with the angular-momentum Variation After Projection applied on non-axial wavefunctions. Our calculations show a striking agreement with the experimentally known spectroscopy: the \textit{Yrast} band, the $8^{-}$ ($K=8$), $3^{+}$ ($K=3$) and $10^+$ ($K=10$) isomers together with associated $K$ bands. We reproduce the recently measured Gallagher-Moszkowski splitting between the $3^+$ ($K=3$) and $4^+$ ($K=4$) band heads. We predict the appearance of a second $0^+$ state, in excellent agreement with recent new observation. In addition, we systematically examine the ground state spectra, dipole and spectroscopic quadrupole moments of even-even, odd-even, odd-odd nuclei from $A=251$ to $A=256$, which are favourably reproduced. The present description of $^{254}$No shows the ability of the Shell Model framework to describe the low-lying properties for such an exotic nucleus at the frontier of modern experimental nuclear physics research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the longitudinal spin polarization of a relativistic fluid of massive spin-1/2 particles undergoing a boost-invariant expansion in the longitudinal direction and rotating in the transverse plane. We express the polarization vector in terms of spin moments and derive closed equations of motion for the latter using spin kinetic theory with a nonlocal relaxation time approximation. These equations of motion are valid at any time of the evolution, from the free-streaming regime to the hydrodynamic regime. At late time, the polarization features contributions from gradients of the fluid velocity and of the temperature, that emerge from the nonlocal part of the collision term. Our results can be used to explore polarization phenomena in the context of heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Neutron Star Properties and Femtoscopic Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the equation of state of hypernuclear matter and study the structure of neutron stars employing a chiral hyperon-nucleon interaction of the J\"{u}lich--Bonn group tuned to femtoscopic $\Lambda p$ data of the ALICE Collaboration, and $\Lambda\Lambda$ and $\Xi$N interactions determined from lattice QCD calculations by the HAL QCD Collaboration that reproduce the femtoscopic $\Lambda\Lambda$ and $\Xi^-p$ data. We employ the ab-initio microscopic Brueckner--Hartree--Fock theory extended to the strange baryon sector. A special focus is put on the uncertainties of the hyperon interactions and how they are effectively propagated to the composition, equation of state, mass-radius relation and tidal deformability of neutron stars. To such end, we consider the uncertainty due to the experimental error of the femtoscopic $\Lambda p$ data used to fix the chiral hyperon-nucleon interaction and the theoretical uncertainty, estimated from the residual cut-off dependence of this interaction. We find that the final maximum mass of a neutron star with hyperons is in the range $1.3-1.4$ $M_\odot$, in agreement with previous works. The hyperon puzzle, therefore, remains still an open issue if only two-body hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interactions are considered. Predictions for the tidal deformability of neutron stars with hyperons are found to be in agreement with the observational constraints from the gravitational wave event GW170817 in the mass range $1.1-1.3$ $M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Validation and extrapolation of atomic mass with physics-informed fully connected neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning offers a powerful framework for validating and predicting atomic mass. We compare three improved neural network methods for representation and extrapolation for atomic mass prediction. The powerful method, adopting a macroscopic-microscopic approach and treating complex nuclear effects as output labels, achieves superior accuracy in AME2020, yielding a much lower root-mean-square deviation of 0.122 MeV in the test set, significantly lower than alternative methods. It also exhibits a better extrapolation performance when predicting AME2020 from AME2016, with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.191 MeV. We further conduct sensitivity analyses against the model inputs to verify interpretable alignment beyond statistical metrics. Incorporating theoretical predictions of magic numbers and masses, our fully connected neural networks reproduce key nuclear phenomena including nucleon pairing correlation and magic number effects. The extrapolation capability of the framework is discussed and the accuracy of predicting new mass measurements for isotope chains has also been tested.</description>

Abstract: We investigate dilepton production in heavy-ion, proton-proton, and proton-nucleus collisions from low energies of 1 AGeV (SIS) to ultra-relativistic energies (LHC) using the Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach. PHSD is a microscopic, non-equilibrium approach that integrates hadronic and partonic degrees of freedom, providing a comprehensive description of relativistic heavy-ion collisions from initial nucleon-nucleon interactions to quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation, hadronization, and final-state interactions. Key dilepton sources in PHSD include hadronic decays, bremsstrahlung, QGP radiation ($q+\bar q \to e^+e^-$, \ $q+\bar q \to g+ e^+e^-$, \ $q+g \to q+ e^+e^-$), primary Drell-Yan production, and semileptonic decays of correlated charm and bottom pairs. PHSD well describes dilepton data from HADES, STAR, and ALICE experiments. We examine in-medium effects, such as the vector meson spectral function broadening, and present the excitation function for the dilepton "excess" in the invariant mass range $0.4&lt;M_{ee}&lt;0.75$ GeV/c$^2$. For the first time we report on the baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$-dependence of the QGP radiation calculated on a basis of the Dynamical-Quasi-Particle Model (DQPM) in PHSD. The influence of $\mu_B$ on the QGP yield grows at lower collision energies, where $\mu_B$ becomes large, however, its impact on the total dilepton spectra is small due to the lowering of the QGP volume with decreasing energy. The excitation function of QGP dileptons, is presented versus correlated charm, confirming that the QGP radiation overshines charm contributions at $\sqrt{s} \simeq 25-30$ GeV in central Au+Au collisions, providing access to thermal QGP dileptons at BES RHIC and FAIR.</description>

      <title>$\gamma W$-exchange contributions in neutron $\beta$ decay in the forward-angle limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the contributions from $\gamma W$-exchange in neutron $\beta$ decay are estimated at the amplitude level. Using a general form for the electromagnetic (EM) form factors (FFs) of the proton, the EM FFs of the neutron, and the weak FFs of the $Wnp$ interaction as inputs, we present analytical expressions for the inner part of the $\gamma W$-exchange amplitude under the forward angle limit. The differences and relations between our method and those used in the references are discussed. To compare our numerical results with those provided in the references, we consider three types of FFs as examples. The numerical results show that when the favored EM FFs are used, our result for the contribution from the Fermi part is consistent with those reported in the references, while our results for the Gamow-Teller parts are about 7\% and 13\% larger than those reported in Ref.~\cite{Hayen-2021}.</description>

      <title>Spin kinetic theory with a nonlocal relaxation time approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel relaxation time approximation for kinetic theory with spin which takes into account the nonlocality of particle collisions. In particular, it models the property of the microscopic nonlocal collision term to vanish in global, but not in local equilibrium. We study the asymptotic distribution function obtained as the solution of the Boltzmann equation within the nonlocal relaxation time approximation in the limit of small gradients and short relaxation time. We show that the resulting polarization agrees with the one obtained from the Zubarev formalism for a certain value of a coefficient that determines the time scale on which orbital angular momentum is converted into spin. This coefficient can be identified with a parameter related to the pseudo gauge choice in the Zubarev formalism. Finally, we demonstrate how the nonlocal collision term generates polarization from vorticity by studying a nonrelativistic rotating cylinder both from kinetic and hydrodynamic approaches, which are shown to be equivalent in this example.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal modulation in light-by-light scattering from ultraperipheral collisions at LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Elastic light-by-light(LbL) scattering, one of the most fascinating processes in the Standard Model(SM), has recently been observed in the ultraperipheral collisions(UPCs) of relativistic heavy ions in the Atlas and CMS experiments at the Large Hadron Collider LHC. Recognizing that the incident quasi-real photons in LbL scattering are strongly linearly polarized, we re-investigate the LbL scattering in UPCs by incorporating the joint dependence of the impact parameter and transverse momenta of the incident photons. We show that the linear polarization of incident photons generates a sizable $\cos2\phi$-type azimuthal modulation, which awaits the test in future LHC and EIC experiments.</description>

      <title>Study on axial fields in the dynamically assisted Schwinger effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14283v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamically assisted Schwinger effect, the generation of fermion-antifermion pairs in vacuum under a strong, slow-varying field and a weak, high-frequency field, has become a promising avenue to probe the vacuum structure and the nonlinear dynamics of QED. However, the role of axial fields in this phenomenon has remained underexplored. This study aims at analyzing how spatial axial fields influence particle production in the dynamically assisted Schwinger effect. Employing the high-frequency effective theory based on the Floquet-Magnus expansion, we demonstrate that a spatial axial field can occur as the effective field of a circular polarized high-frequency plane wave and significantly increase the number of fermions produced across different timescales. This enhancement offers both theoretical insights and useful tools for the experimental implementation of the Schwinger effect.</description>

      <title>Tomography of Pions and Kaons in the QCD Vacuum: Transverse Momentum Dependent Parton Distribution Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the pion and kaon transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDPDFs) in the instanton liquid model (ILM), a model of the QCD vacuum at low resolution. The relevant TMDs are factored into a constituent quark distribution times a rapidity dependent soft factor from staple-shaped Wilson lines, for fixed parton longitudinal momentum and transverse separation. The results are evolved to higher rapidities using the Collins-Soper (CS) kernel and higher resolution using renormalization group evolution. The comparison to existing extractions of pion TMDs from Drell-Yan (DY) data is briefly discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the rotational Brownian motion of heavy quark in QCD medium and provide predictions for polarization of open heavy-flavor hadrons. We calculate expressions for vector and tensor polarization, corresponding to baryon spin polarization and vector meson spin alignment, respectively. We propose that the transverse momentum dependence of heavy quark polarization may serve as a distinctive signature of the intense initial magnetic field generated in off-central relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Novel concept for low-energy antineutron production and its application for antineutron scattering experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extensive data of antiproton scattering cross sections with protons and nuclei have advanced our understanding of hadronic interactions with antinucleons. However, low-energy antineutron scattering data are scarce, thereby limiting our understanding of the S-wave antinucleon-nucleon and antinucleon-nucleus interactions. We present a novel production scheme of extremely low-energy antineutrons that could remedy this situation. This method is based on backward charge-exchange reaction ($p\bar{p}\to n\bar{n}$), and can reach the lowest momentum of 9 MeV/c, which would be well suited to study of the S-wave antinucleon-nucleon or antinucleon-nucleus interactions.</description>

      <title>Further Exploration of Precise Binding Energies from Physics Informed Machine Learning and the Development of a Practical Ensemble Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sixteen new physics informed machine learning models have been trained on binding energy residuals from modern mass models that leverage shape parameters and other physical features. The models have been trained on a subset of AME 2012 data and have been verified with a subset of the AME 2020 data. Among the machine learning approaches tested in this work, the preferred approach is the least squares boosted ensemble of trees which appears to have a superior ability to both interpolate and extrapolate binding energy residuals. The machine learning models for four mass models created from the ensemble of trees approach have been combined to create a composite model called the Four Model Tree Ensemble (FMTE). The FMTE model predicts binding energy values from AME 2020 with a standard deviation of 76 keV and a mean deviation of 34 keV for all nuclei with N &gt; 7 and Z &gt; 7. A comparison with new mass measurements for 33 isotopes not included in AME 2012 or AME 2020 indicates that the FMTE performs better than all mass models that were tested.</description>
