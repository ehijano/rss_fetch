      <title>Multi-Objective Optimization Algorithms for Energy Management Systems in Microgrids: A Control Strategy Based on a PHIL System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research a real time power hardware in loop configuration has been implemented for an microgrid with the combination of distribution energy resources such as photovoltaic, grid tied inverter, battery, utility grid, and a diesel generator. This paper introduces an unique adaptive multi-objective optimization approach that employs weighted optimization techniques for real-time microgrid systems. The aim is to effectively balance various factors including fuel consumption, load mismatch, power quality, battery degradation, and the utilization of renewable energy sources. A real time experimental data from power hardware in loop system has been used for dynamically updating system states. The adaptive preference-based selection method are adjusted based on state of battery charging thresholds. The technique has been integrated with six technical objectives and complex constraints. This approach helps to practical microgrid decision making and optimization of dynamic energy systems. The energy management process were also able to maximize photovoltaic production where minimizing power mismatch, stabilizing battery state of charge under different condition. The research results were also compared with the baseline system without optimization techniques, and a reliable outcome was found.</description>

      <title>Sampled-data Systems: Stability, Contractivity and Single-iteration Suboptimal MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the stability of interconnected continuous-time (CT) and discrete-time (DT) systems coupled through sampling and zero-order hold mechanisms. The DT system updates its output at regular intervals $T&gt;0$ by applying an $n$-fold composition of a given map. This setup is motivated by online and sampled-data implementations of optimization-based controllers - particularly model predictive control (MPC) - where the DT system models $n$ iterations of an algorithm approximating the solution of an optimization problem.
  We introduce the concept of a reduced model, defined as the limiting behavior of the sampled-data system as $T \to 0^+$ and $n \to +\infty$. Our main theoretical contribution establishes that when the reduced model is contractive, there exists a threshold duration $T(n)$ for each iteration count $n$ such that the CT-DT interconnection achieves exponential stability for all sampling periods $T &lt; T(n)$. Finally, under the stronger condition that both the CT and DT systems are contractive, we show exponential stability of their interconnection using a small-gain argument. Our theoretical results provide new insights into suboptimal MPC stability, showing that convergence guarantees hold even when using a single iteration of the optimization algorithm - a practically significant finding for real-time control applications.</description>

      <title>Agent-Based Decentralized Energy Management of EV Charging Station with Solar Photovoltaics via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the pursuit of energy net zero within smart cities, transportation electrification plays a pivotal role. The adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) keeps increasing, making energy management of EV charging stations critically important. While previous studies have managed to reduce energy cost of EV charging while maintaining grid stability, they often overlook the robustness of EV charging management against uncertainties of various forms, such as varying charging behaviors and possible faults in faults in some chargers. To address the gap, a novel Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach is proposed treating each charger to be an agent and coordinate all the agents in the EV charging station with solar photovoltaics in a more realistic scenario, where system faults may occur. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is incorporated in the MARL algorithm to extract temporal features from time-series. Additionally, a dense reward mechanism is designed for training the agents in the MARL algorithm to improve EV charging experience. Through validation on a real-world dataset, we show that our approach is robust against system uncertainties and faults and also effective in minimizing EV charging costs and maximizing charging service satisfaction.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Nonlinear Guidance with Impact Time and Field-of-view Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the time-constrained interception of targets at a predetermined time with bounded field-of-view capability of the seeker-equipped interceptors. We propose guidance laws using the effective lead angle and velocity lead angles of the interceptor to achieve a successful interception of the target. The former scheme extends the existing two-dimensional guidance strategy to a three-dimensional setting. We have shown that such an extension may result in high-frequency switching in the input demand, which may degrade the interceptor's performance. To overcome the potential limitations of such a guidance strategy, we propose an elegant solution using the velocity lead angles and the range error with a backstepping technique. Using the velocity lead angles as virtual inputs, the effective lead angle profile is subsequently regulated to satisfy the seeker's field-of-view bound. Unlike the existing strategies, the proposed guidance strategy does not rely on the time-to-go estimate, which is an appealing feature of the design, as the time-to-go estimate may not always be available with high precision. We provide a theoretical analysis of the error variable and subsequently analytically derive the bounds on achievable impact times. Numerical simulations are performed to support the theoretical findings. The performance of the proposed guidance strategy is compared with that of an existing one, and it has been shown to yield better performance. Finally, a study on different choices of virtual inputs is also provided.</description>

      <title>Robust Stability Analysis of Positive Lure System with Neural Network Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the robustness of the Lur'e problem under positivity constraints, drawing on results from the positive Aizerman conjecture and the robustness properties of Metzler matrices. Specifically, we consider a control system of Lur'e type in which not only the linear part includes parametric uncertainty but also the nonlinear sector bound is unknown. We investigate tools from positive linear systems to effectively solve the problems in complicated and uncertain nonlinear systems. By leveraging the positivity characteristic of the system, we derive an explicit formula for the stability radius of Lur'e systems. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to systems with neural network (NN) feedback loops. Building on this approach, we also propose a refinement method for sector bounds of feedforward neural networks (FFNNs). This study introduces a scalable and efficient approach for robustness analysis of both Lur'e and NN-controlled systems. Finally, the proposed results are supported by illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>An Autocovariance Least-Squares-Based Data-Driven Kalman Filter for Unknown Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the problem of data-driven state estimation for linear systems with both unknown system dynamics and noise covariances. We propose an Autocovariance Least-squares-based Data-driven Kalman Filter (ADKF), which provides a unified framework for simultaneous system identification and state estimation by utilizing pre-collected input-output trajectories and estimated initial states. Specifically, we design a SDP-based algorithm for estimating the noise covariances. We quantify the impact of model inaccuracy on noise covariances estimation using this identification algorithm, and introduce a feedback control mechanism for data collection to enhance the accuracy and stability of noise covariance estimation. The estimated noise covariances account for model inaccuracy, which are shown to be more suitable for state estimation. We also quantify the performance gap between the ADKF and the traditional Kalman filter with known system dynamics and noise covariances, showing that this gap decreases as the number and length of pre-collected trajectories increase. Finally, numerical simulations validate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed ADKF.</description>

      <title>FedORA: Resource Allocation for Federated Learning in ORAN using Radio Intelligent Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes an integrated approach for optimising Federated Learning (FL) communication in dynamic and heterogeneous network environments. Leveraging the modular flexibility of the Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) architecture and multiple Radio Access Technologies (RATs), we aim to enhance data transmission efficiency and mitigate client-server communication constraints within the FL framework. Our system employs a two-stage optimisation strategy using ORAN's rApps and xApps. In the first stage, Reinforcement Learning (RL) based rApp is used to dynamically select each user's optimal Radio Access Technology (RAT), balancing energy efficiency with network performance. In the second stage, a model-based xApp facilitates near-real-time resource allocation optimisation through predefined policies to achieve optimal network performance. The dynamic RAT selection and resource allocation capabilities enabled by ORAN and multi-RAT contribute to robust communication resilience in dynamic network environments. Our approach demonstrates competitive performance with low power consumption compared to other state-of-the-art models, showcasing its potential for real-time applications demanding both accuracy and efficiency. This robust and comprehensive framework, enabling clients to utilise available resources effectively, highlights the potential for scalable, collaborative learning applications prioritising energy efficiency and network performance.</description>

      <title>VLMLight: Traffic Signal Control via Vision-Language Meta-Control and Dual-Branch Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic signal control (TSC) is a core challenge in urban mobility, where real-time decisions must balance efficiency and safety. Existing methods - ranging from rule-based heuristics to reinforcement learning (RL) - often struggle to generalize to complex, dynamic, and safety-critical scenarios. We introduce VLMLight, a novel TSC framework that integrates vision-language meta-control with dual-branch reasoning. At the core of VLMLight is the first image-based traffic simulator that enables multi-view visual perception at intersections, allowing policies to reason over rich cues such as vehicle type, motion, and spatial density. A large language model (LLM) serves as a safety-prioritized meta-controller, selecting between a fast RL policy for routine traffic and a structured reasoning branch for critical cases. In the latter, multiple LLM agents collaborate to assess traffic phases, prioritize emergency vehicles, and verify rule compliance. Experiments show that VLMLight reduces waiting times for emergency vehicles by up to 65% over RL-only systems, while preserving real-time performance in standard conditions with less than 1% degradation. VLMLight offers a scalable, interpretable, and safety-aware solution for next-generation traffic signal control.</description>

      <title>Synchronous Models and Fundamental Systems in Observer Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of a synchronous model as an extension of the internal model concept used in observer design for dynamical systems. A system is said to contain a synchronous model of another if there is a suitable error function between the two systems that remains stationary for all of the trajectories of the two systems. A system is said to admit a synchronous lift if a second system containing a synchronous model exists. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions that a system admits a synchronous lift and provide a method to construct a (there may be many) lifted system should one exist. We characterise the class of all systems that admit a synchronous lift by showing that they consist of fundamental vector fields induced by a Lie group action, a class of system we term fundamental systems. For fundamental systems we propose a simple synchronous observer design methodology, for which we show how correction terms can be discretised and combined easily, facilitating global characterisation of convergence and performance. Finally, we provide three examples to demonstrate the key concepts of synchrony, symmetry construction, and observer design for a fundamental system.</description>

      <title>Customising Electricity Contracts at Scale with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electricity system becomes more complex, connecting massive numbers of end-users and distributed generators. Adding or removing grid connections requires expert studies to align technical constraints with user requests. In times of labour shortages, carrying out these studies represents a significant amount of time that engineers at system operators spend in planning departments. As time is limited, only standard block connectivity contracts can be offered to end-users, or the requests pile up. Even if offers are made, these often do not perfectly match the user's requirements, leading to overpaying or underusing the grid capacity. This paper investigates whether end-users can negotiate individual, flexible time-of-use contracts directly with the grid using Large Language Models (LLM) in chats at scale. The LLM-based chat has direct access to a model of the grid and studies the grid's technical constraints just as an expert engineer. The advantage of this system is that end-users can directly interact with grid models through natural language; no intermediate is needed to service, analyse, study, assess, advise, consult and engineer. This initial study paves the way toward developing this tailored LLM system, resulting in possible high-efficiency gains for grid planning and customer management.</description>

      <title>Range Space or Null Space: Least-Squares Methods for the Realization Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This contribution revisits the classical approximate realization problem, which involves determining matrices of a state-space model based on estimates of a truncated series of Markov parameters. A Hankel matrix built up by these Markov parameters plays a fundamental role in this problem, leveraging the fact that both its range space and left null space encode critical information about the state-space model. We examine two prototype realization algorithms based on the Hankel matrix: the classical range-space-based (SVD-based) method and the more recent null-space-based method. It is demonstrated that the range-space-based method corresponds to a total least-squares solution, whereas the null-space-based method corresponds to an ordinary least-squares solution. By analyzing the differences in sensitivity of the two algorithms, we determine the conditions when one or the other realization algorithm is to be preferred, and identify factors that contribute to an ill-conditioned realization problem. Furthermore, recognizing that both methods are suboptimal, we argue that the optimal realization is obtained through a weighted least-squares approach. A statistical analysis of these methods, including their consistency and asymptotic normality is also provided.</description>

      <title>Scalable quantile predictions of peak loads for non-residential customer segments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical grid congestion has emerged as an immense challenge in Europe, making the forecasting of load and its associated metrics increasingly crucial. Among these metrics, peak load is fundamental. Non-time-resolved models of peak load have their advantages of being simple and compact, and among them Velander's formula (VF) is widely used in distribution network planning. However, several aspects of VF remain inadequately addressed, including year-ahead prediction, scaling of customers, aggregation, and, most importantly, the lack of probabilistic elements. The present paper proposes a quantile interpretation of VF that enables VF to learn truncated cumulative distribution functions of peak loads with multiple quantile regression under non-crossing constraints. The evaluations on non-residential customer data confirmed its ability to predict peak load year ahead, to fit customers with a wide range of electricity consumptions, and to model aggregations of customers. A noteworthy finding is that for a given electricity consumption, aggregations of customers have statistically larger peak loads than a single customer.</description>

      <title>Chance-constrained Solar PV Hosting Capacity Assessment for Distribution Grids Using Gaussian Process and Logit Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing penetration of distributed generation such as solar PV can increase the risk of over-voltage in distribution grids, affecting network security. Therefore, assessment of the so-called, PV hosting capacity (HC) - the maximum amount of PV that a given grid can accommodate becomes an important practical problem. In this paper, we propose a novel chance-constrained HC estimation framework using Gaussian Process and Logit learning that can account for uncertainty and risk management. Also, we consider the assessment of HC under different voltage control strategies. Our results have demonstrated that the proposed models can achieve high accuracy levels of up to 93% in predicting nodal over-voltage events on IEEE 33-bus and 123-bus test-cases. Thus, these models can be effectively employed to estimate the chance-constrained HC with various risk levels. Moreover, our proposed methods have simple forms and low computational costs of only a few seconds.</description>

Abstract: Accurate parameterization of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) installations is critical for effective grid management and strategic large-scale solar deployment. The lack of high-fidelity datasets for PV configuration parameters often compels practitioners to rely on coarse assumptions, undermining both the temporal and numerical accuracy of large-scale PV performance modeling. This study introduces a fully automated framework that innovatively integrates remote sensing data, semantic segmentation, polygon-vector refinement, tilt-azimuth estimation, and module layout inference to produce a richly attributed GIS dataset of distributed PV. Applied to Eindhoven (the Netherlands), the method achieves a correlation ($R^2$) of 0.92 with Distribution System Operator (DSO) records, while capacity estimates for 73$\%$ of neighborhoods demonstrate agreement within a $\pm$25$\%$ margin of recorded data. Additionally, by accurately capturing actual system configuration parameters (e.g., tilt, azimuth, module layout) and seamlessly linking them to advanced performance models, the method yields more reliable PV energy generation forecasts within the distribution networks. Centering our experiments toward a high PV-penetration community, configuration-aware simulations help to reduce Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of energy generation modeling by up to 160$\%$ compared to the conventional assumption-based approaches. Furthermore, owing to its modular design and reliance on readily available geospatial resources, the workflow can be extended across diverse regions, offering a scalable solution for robust urban solar integration.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Offshore Wind Integration through Multi-Terminal DC Grids: A Market-Based OPF Framework for the North Sea Interconnectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interconnecting price zones and remote renewable energy sources has emerged as a key solution to achieving climate goals. The objective of this work is to present a formulation that extends the base optimal power flow model with price zones constraints to forecast the operations of upcoming offshore wind developments integrated into a multi-terminal DC grid. A case study based on the 2030 development of the North Sea is used to exemplify the utilization of the formulation. Here, three cases are presented, one with the price as a parameter and the other two with the price as a variable dependent on power flows between price zones. The paper demonstrates that, for large power flows, it is necessary to include additional constraints beyond line limitations to accurately capture the effects of price zone exchanges.</description>

      <title>Persistently Exciting Online Feedback Optimization Controller with Minimal Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a persistently exciting input generating Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) controller that estimates the sensitivity of a process ensuring minimal deviations from the descent direction while converging. This eliminates the need for random perturbations in feedback loop. The proposed controller is formulated as a bilevel optimization program, where a nonconvex full rank constraint is relaxed using linear constraints and penalization. The validation of the method is performed in a simulated scenario where multiple systems share a limited, costly resource for production optimization, simulating an oil and gas resource allocation problem. The method allows for less input perturbations while accurately estimating gradients, allowing faster convergence when the gradients are unknown. In the case study, the proposed method achieved the same profit compared to an OFO controller with random input perturbations, and $1.4\%$ higher profit compared to an OFO controller without input perturbations.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Augmented Physics-Based Model for Estimation and Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-space estimation and tracking rely on accurate dynamical models to perform well. However, obtaining an vaccurate dynamical model for complex scenarios or adapting to changes in the system poses challenges to the estimation process. Recently, augmented physics-based models (APBMs) appear as an appealing strategy to cope with these challenges where the composition of a small and adaptive neural network with known physics-based models (PBM) is learned on the fly following an augmented state-space estimation approach. A major issue when introducing data-driven components in such a scenario is the danger of compromising the meaning (or interpretability) of estimated states. In this work, we propose a novel constrained estimation strategy that constrains the APBM dynamics close to the PBM. The novel state-space constrained approach leads to more flexible ways to impose constraints than the traditional APBM approach. Our experiments with a radar-tracking scenario demonstrate different aspects of the proposed approach and the trade-offs inherent in the imposed constraints.</description>

      <title>Efficient Gaussian Mixture Filters based on Transition Density Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian mixture filters for nonlinear systems usually rely on severe approximations when calculating mixtures in the prediction and filtering step. Thus, offline approximations of noise densities by Gaussian mixture densities to reduce the approximation error have been proposed. This results in exponential growth in the number of components, requiring ongoing component reduction, which is computationally complex. In this paper, the key idea is to approximate the true transition density by an axis-aligned Gaussian mixture, where two different approaches are derived. These approximations automatically ensure a constant number of components in the posterior densities without the need for explicit reduction. In addition, they allow a trade-off between estimation quality and computational complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18188v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a two-stage deep learning framework for the inverse design of rectangular patch antennas. Our approach leverages generative modeling to learn a latent representation of antenna frequency response curves and conditions a subsequent generative model on these responses to produce feasible antenna geometries. We further demonstrate that leveraging search and optimization techniques at test-time improves the accuracy of the generated designs and enables consideration of auxiliary objectives such as manufacturability. Our approach generalizes naturally to different design criteria, and can be easily adapted to more complex geometric design spaces.</description>

      <title>MorphEUS: Morphable Omnidirectional Unmanned System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Omnidirectional aerial vehicles (OMAVs) have opened up a wide range of possibilities for inspection, navigation, and manipulation applications using drones. In this paper, we introduce MorphEUS, a morphable co-axial quadrotor that can control position and orientation independently with high efficiency. It uses a paired servo motor mechanism for each rotor arm, capable of pointing the vectored-thrust in any arbitrary direction. As compared to the \textit{state-of-the-art} OMAVs, we achieve higher and more uniform force/torque reachability with a smaller footprint and minimum thrust cancellations. The overactuated nature of the system also results in resiliency to rotor or servo-motor failures. The capabilities of this quadrotor are particularly well-suited for contact-based infrastructure inspection and close-proximity imaging of complex geometries. In the accompanying control pipeline, we present theoretical results for full controllability, almost-everywhere exponential stability, and thrust-energy optimality. We evaluate our design and controller on high-fidelity simulations showcasing the trajectory-tracking capabilities of the vehicle during various tasks. Supplementary details and experimental videos are available on the project webpage.</description>

      <title>A DSP-Free Carrier Phase Recovery System using 16-Offset-QAM Laser Forwarded Links for 400Gb/s and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical interconnects are becoming a major bottleneck in scaling up future GPU racks and network switches within data centers. Although 200 Gb/s optical transceivers using PAM-4 modulation have been demonstrated, achieving higher data rates and energy efficiencies requires high-order coherent modulations like 16-QAM. Current coherent links rely on energy-intensive digital signal processing (DSP) for channel impairment compensation and carrier phase recovery (CPR), which consumes approximately 50pJ/b - 10x higher than future intra-data center requirements. For shorter links, simpler or DSP-free CPR methods can significantly reduce power and complexity. While Costas loops enable CPR for QPSK, they face challenges in scaling to higher-order modulations (e.g., 16/64-QAM) due to varying symbol amplitudes. In this work, we propose an optical coherent link architecture using laser forwarding and a novel DSP-free CPR system using offset-QAM modulation. The proposed analog CPR feedback loop is highly scalable, capable of supporting arbitrary offset-QAM modulations without requiring architectural modifications. This scalability is achieved through its phase error detection mechanism, which operates independently of the data rate and modulation type. We validated this method using GlobalFoundry's monolithic 45nm silicon photonics PDK models, with circuit- and system-level implementation at 100GBaud in the O-band. We will investigate the feedback loop dynamics, circuit-level implementations, and phase-noise performance of the proposed CPR loop. Our method can be adopted to realize low-power QAM optical interconnects for future coherent-lite pluggable transceivers as well as co-packaged optics (CPO) applications.</description>

      <title>Optimization-Based Trajectory Planning for Tractor-Trailer Vehicles on Curvy Roads: A Progressively Increasing Sampling Number Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an optimization-based trajectory planner for tractor-trailer vehicles on curvy roads. The lack of analytical expression for the trailer's errors to the center line pose a great challenge to the trajectory planning for tractor-trailer vehicles. To address this issue, we first use geometric representations to characterize the lateral and orientation errors in Cartesian frame, where the errors would serve as the components of the cost function and the road edge constraints within our optimization process. Next, we generate a coarse trajectory to warm-start the subsequent optimization problems. On the other hand, to achieve a good approximation of the continuous-time kinematics, optimization-based methods usually discretize the kinematics with a large sampling number. This leads to an increase in the number of the variables and constraints, thus making the optimization problem difficult to solve. To address this issue, we design a Progressively Increasing Sampling Number Optimization (PISNO) framework. More specifically, we first find a nearly feasible trajectory with a small sampling number to warm-start the optimization process. Then, the sampling number is progressively increased, and the corresponding intermediate Optimal Control Problem (OCP) is solved in each iteration. Next, we further resample the obtained solution into a finer sampling period, and then use it to warm-start the intermediate OCP in next iteration. This process is repeated until reaching a threshold sampling number. Simulation and experiment results show the proposed method exhibits a good performance and less computational consumption over the benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete gradient methods are a powerful tool for the time discretization of dynamical systems, since they are structure-preserving regardless of the form of the total energy. In this work, we discuss the application of discrete gradient methods to the system class of nonlinear port-Hamiltonian differential-algebraic equations - as they emerge from the port- and energy-based modeling of physical systems in various domains. We introduce a novel numerical scheme tailored for semi-explicit differential-algebraic equations and further address more general settings using the concepts of discrete gradient pairs and Dirac-dissipative structures. Additionally, the behavior under system transformations is investigated and we demonstrate that under suitable assumptions port-Hamiltonian differential-algebraic equations admit a representation which consists of a parametrized port-Hamiltonian semi-explicit system and an unstructured equation. Finally, we present the application to multibody system dynamics and discuss numerical results to demonstrate the capabilities of our approach.</description>

      <title>Supermartingale Certificates for Quantitative Omega-regular Verification and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first supermartingale certificate for quantitative $\omega$-regular properties of discrete-time infinite-state stochastic systems. Our certificate is defined on the product of the stochastic system and a limit-deterministic B\"uchi automaton that specifies the property of interest; hence we call it a limit-deterministic B\"uchi supermartingale (LDBSM). Previously known supermartingale certificates applied only to quantitative reachability, safety, or reach-avoid properties, and to qualitative (i.e., probability 1) $\omega$-regular properties. We also present fully automated algorithms for the template-based synthesis of LDBSMs, for the case when the stochastic system dynamics and the controller can be represented in terms of polynomial inequalities. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of our method to solve verification and control tasks for stochastic systems that were beyond the reach of previous supermartingale-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Efficient Policy Optimization in Robust Constrained MDPs with Iteration Complexity Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constrained decision-making is essential for designing safe policies in real-world control systems, yet simulated environments often fail to capture real-world adversities. We consider the problem of learning a policy that will maximize the cumulative reward while satisfying a constraint, even when there is a mismatch between the real model and an accessible simulator/nominal model. In particular, we consider the robust constrained Markov decision problem (RCMDP) where an agent needs to maximize the reward and satisfy the constraint against the worst possible stochastic model under the uncertainty set centered around an unknown nominal model. Primal-dual methods, effective for standard constrained MDP (CMDP), are not applicable here because of the lack of the strong duality property. Further, one cannot apply the standard robust value-iteration based approach on the composite value function either as the worst case models may be different for the reward value function and the constraint value function. We propose a novel technique that effectively minimizes the constraint value function--to satisfy the constraints; on the other hand, when all the constraints are satisfied, it can simply maximize the robust reward value function. We prove that such an algorithm finds a policy with at most $\epsilon$ sub-optimality and feasible policy after $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations. In contrast to the state-of-the-art method, we do not need to employ a binary search, thus, we reduce the computation time by at least 4x for smaller value of discount factor ($\gamma$) and by at least 6x for larger value of $\gamma$.</description>

Abstract: Improved additive manufacturing capabilities are vital for the future development and improvement of ubiquitous robotic systems. These machines can be integrated into existing robotic systems to allow manufacturing and repair of components, as well as fabrication of custom parts for the robots themselves. The fused filament fabrication (FFF) process is one of the most common and well-developed AM processes but suffers from the effects of vibration-induced position error, particularly as the printing speed is raised. This project adapted and expanded a dynamic model of an FFF gantry system to include a passive spring-mass-damper system controller attached to the extruder carriage and tuned using optimal parameters. A case study was conducted to demonstrate the effects and generate recommendations for implementation. This work is also valuable for other mechatronic systems which operate using an open-loop control system and which suffer from vibration, including numerous robotic systems, pick-and-place machines, positioners, and similar.</description>

      <title>Alignment of large language models with constrained learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of computing an optimal large language model (LLM) policy for a constrained alignment problem, where the goal is to maximize a primary reward objective while satisfying constraints on secondary utilities. Despite the popularity of Lagrangian-based LLM policy search in constrained alignment, iterative primal-dual methods often fail to converge, and non-iterative dual-based methods do not achieve optimality in the LLM parameter space. To address these challenges, we employ Lagrangian duality to develop an iterative dual-based alignment method that alternates between updating the LLM policy via Lagrangian maximization and updating the dual variable via dual descent. In theory, we characterize the primal-dual gap between the primal value in the distribution space and the dual value in the LLM parameter space. We further quantify the optimality gap of the learned LLM policies at near-optimal dual variables with respect to both the objective and the constraint functions. These results prove that dual-based alignment methods can find an optimal constrained LLM policy, up to an LLM parametrization gap. We demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our approach through extensive experiments conducted on the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset.</description>

      <title>Split-as-a-Pro: behavioral control via operator splitting and alternating projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper introduces Split-as-a-Pro, a control framework that integrates behavioral systems theory, operator splitting methods, and alternating projection algorithms. The framework reduces dynamic optimization problems - arising in both control and estimation - to efficient projection computations. Split-as-a-Pro builds on a non-parametric formulation that exploits system structure to separate dynamic constraints imposed by individual subsystems from external ones, such as interconnection constraints and input/output constraints. This enables the use of arbitrary system representations, as long as the associated projection is efficiently computable, thereby enhancing scalability and compatibility with gray-box modeling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Split-as-a-Pro by developing a distributed algorithm for solving finite-horizon linear quadratic control problems and illustrate its use in predictive control. Our numerical case studies show that algorithms obtained using Split-as-a-Pro significantly outperform their centralized counterparts in runtime and scalability across various standard graph topologies, while seamlessly leveraging both model-based and data-driven system representations.</description>

      <title>Direct Pseudospectral Optimal Control by Orthogonal Polynomial Integral Collocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper details a methodology to transcribe an optimal control problem into a nonlinear program for generation of the trajectories that optimize a given functional by approximating only the highest order derivatives of a given system's dynamics. The underlying method uses orthogonal polynomial integral collocation by which successive integrals are taken to approximate all lower order states. Hence, one set of polynomial coefficients can represent an entire coordinate's degree of freedom. Specifically, Chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kind and Legendre polynomials are used over their associated common interpolating grids derived from the bases' roots and extrema. Simple example problems compare different polynomial bases' performance to analytical solutions. The planar circular orbit raising problem is used to verify the method with solutions obtained by other pseudospectral methods in literature. Finally, a rocket landing flip maneuver problem is solved to demonstrate the ability to solve complex problems with multiple states and control variables with constraints. Simulations establish this method's performance, and reveal that the polynomial/node choice for a given problem notably affects the performance.</description>

      <title>LLA-MPC: Fast Adaptive Control for Autonomous Racing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Look-Back and Look-Ahead Adaptive Model Predictive Control (LLA-MPC), a real-time adaptive control framework for autonomous racing that addresses the challenge of rapidly changing tire-surface interactions. Unlike existing approaches requiring substantial data collection or offline training, LLA-MPC employs a model bank for immediate adaptation without a learning period. It integrates two key mechanisms: a look-back window that evaluates recent vehicle behavior to select the most accurate model and a look-ahead horizon that optimizes trajectory planning based on the identified dynamics. The selected model and estimated friction coefficient are then incorporated into a trajectory planner to optimize reference paths in real-time. Experiments across diverse racing scenarios demonstrate that LLA-MPC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in adaptation speed and handling, even during sudden friction transitions. Its learning-free, computationally efficient design enables rapid adaptation, making it ideal for high-speed autonomous racing in multi-surface environments.</description>

      <title>Learning Dynamics under Environmental Constraints via Measurement-Induced Bundle Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning unknown dynamics under environmental (or external) constraints is fundamental to many fields (e.g., modern robotics), particularly challenging when constraint information is only locally available and uncertain. Existing approaches requiring global constraints or using probabilistic filtering fail to fully exploit the geometric structure inherent in local measurements (by using, e.g., sensors) and constraints. This paper presents a geometric framework unifying measurements, constraints, and dynamics learning through a fiber bundle structure over the state space. This naturally induced geometric structure enables measurement-aware Control Barrier Functions that adapt to local sensing (or measurement) conditions. By integrating Neural ODEs, our framework learns continuous-time dynamics while preserving geometric constraints, with theoretical guarantees of learning convergence and constraint satisfaction dependent on sensing quality. The geometric framework not only enables efficient dynamics learning but also suggests promising directions for integration with reinforcement learning approaches. Extensive simulations demonstrate significant improvements in both learning efficiency and constraint satisfaction over traditional methods, especially under limited and uncertain sensing conditions.</description>

      <title>Signed Angle Rigid Graphs for Network Localization and Formation Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph rigidity theory studies the capability of a graph embedded in the Euclidean space to constrain its global geometric shape via local constraints among nodes and edges, and has been widely exploited in network localization and formation control. In recent years, the traditional rigidity theory has been extended by considering new types of local constraints such as bearing, angle, ratio of distance, etc. Among them, the signed angle constraint received extensive attention since it is practically measurable and independent of the global coordinate frame. However, existing studies on signed angle rigidity always consider special graph structures, which are actually not necessary. This paper presents a comprehensive combinatorial analysis in terms of graphs and angle index sets for signed angle rigidity. We show that Laman graphs equivalently characterize minimally signed angle rigid graphs. Moreover, we propose a method to construct the minimal set of signed angle constraints in a Laman graph to effectively ensure signed angle rigidity. These results are finally applied to distributed network localization and formation stabilization problems, respectively, where each agent only has access to signed angle measurements.</description>

      <title>Dynamically Learned Test-Time Model Routing in Language Model Zoos with Service Level Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-weight LLM zoos provide access to numerous high-quality models, but selecting the appropriate model for specific tasks remains challenging and requires technical expertise. Most users simply want factually correct, safe, and satisfying responses without concerning themselves with model technicalities, while inference service providers prioritize minimizing operating costs. These competing interests are typically mediated through service level agreements (SLAs) that guarantee minimum service quality. We introduce MESS+, a stochastic optimization algorithm for cost-optimal LLM request routing while providing rigorous SLA compliance guarantees. MESS+ learns request satisfaction probabilities of LLMs in real-time as users interact with the system, based on which model selection decisions are made by solving a per-request optimization problem. Our algorithm includes a novel combination of virtual queues and request satisfaction prediction, along with a theoretical analysis of cost optimality and constraint satisfaction. Across a wide range of state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks, MESS+ achieves an average of 2x cost savings compared to existing LLM routing techniques.</description>

      <title>A Cooperative Aerial System of A Payload Drone Equipped with Dexterous Rappelling End Droid for Cluttered Space Pickup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cluttered spaces, such as forests, drone picking up a payload via an abseil claw is an open challenge, as the cable is likely tangled and blocked by the branches and obstacles. To address such a challenge, in this work, a cooperative aerial system is proposed, which consists of a payload drone and a dexterous rappelling end droid. The two ends are linked via a Kevlar tether cable. The end droid is actuated by four propellers, which enable mid-air dexterous adjustment of clawing angle and guidance of cable movement. To avoid tanglement and rappelling obstacles, a trajectory optimization method that integrates cable length constraints and dynamic feasibility is developed, which guarantees safe pickup. A tether cable dynamic model is established to evaluate real-time cable status, considering both taut and sagging conditions. Simulation and real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed system is capable of picking up payload in cluttered spaces. As a result, the end droid can reach the target point successfully under cable constraints and achieve passive retrieval during the lifting phase without propulsion, which enables effective and efficient aerial manipulation.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Time Series Forecasting with Transformer Architectures: Extensive Simulation Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in domains such as energy, finance, and healthcare, where accurate predictions inform decision-making under uncertainty. Although Transformer-based models have demonstrated success in sequential modeling, their adoption for time series remains limited by challenges such as noise sensitivity, long-range dependencies, and a lack of inductive bias for temporal structure. In this work, we present a unified and principled framework for benchmarking three prominent Transformer forecasting architectures-Autoformer, Informer, and Patchtst-each evaluated through three architectural variants: Minimal, Standard, and Full, representing increasing levels of complexity and modeling capacity.
  We conduct over 1500 controlled experiments on a suite of ten synthetic signals, spanning five patch lengths and five forecast horizons under both clean and noisy conditions. Our analysis reveals consistent patterns across model families.
  To advance this landscape further, we introduce the Koopman-enhanced Transformer framework, Deep Koopformer, which integrates operator-theoretic latent state modeling to improve stability and interpretability. We demonstrate its efficacy on nonlinear and chaotic dynamical systems. Our results highlight Koopman based Transformer as a promising hybrid approach for robust, interpretable, and theoretically grounded time series forecasting in noisy and complex real-world conditions.</description>

Abstract: We show that a special class of (nonconvex) NMPC problems admits an exact solution by reformulating them as a finite number of convex subproblems, extending previous results to the multi-input case. Our approach is applicable to a special class of input-affine discrete-time systems, which includes a class of bilinear rank-one systems that is considered useful in modeling certain controlled networks. We illustrate our results with two numerical examples, including the aforementioned rank-one bilinear network.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of implicit predictors, which characterize the input-(state)-output prediction behavior underlying a predictive control scheme, even if it is not explicitly enforced as an equality constraint (as in traditional model or subspace predictive control). To demonstrate this concept, we derive and analyze implicit predictors for some basic data-driven predictive control (DPC) schemes, which offers a new perspective on this popular approach that may form the basis for modified DPC schemes and further theoretical insights.</description>

      <title>A Unifying Perspective for Safety of Stochastic Systems: From Barrier Functions to Finite Abstractions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01802v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Providing safety guarantees for stochastic dynamical systems is a central problem in various fields, including control theory, machine learning, and robotics. Existing methods either employ Stochastic Barrier Functions (SBFs) or rely on numerical approaches based on finite abstractions. SBFs, analogous to Lyapunov functions, are used to establish (probabilistic) set invariance, whereas abstraction-based approaches approximate the stochastic system with a finite model to compute safety probability bounds. This paper presents a unifying perspective on these seemingly different approaches. Specifically, we show that both methods can be interpreted as approximations of a stochastic dynamic programming problem. This perspective allows us to formally establish the correctness of both techniques, characterize their convergence and optimality properties, and analyze their respective assumptions, advantages, and limitations. Our analysis reveals that, unlike SBFs-based methods, abstraction-based approaches can provide asymptotically optimal safety certificates, albeit at the cost of increased computational effort.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design of direct data-based controllers has become a fundamental part of control theory research in the last few years. In this paper, we consider three classes of data-based state feedback control problems for linear systems. These control problems are such that, besides stabilization, some additional performance requirements must be satisfied. First, we formulate and solve a trajectory-reference control problem, on which desired closed-loop trajectories are known and a controller that allows the system to closely follow those trajectories is computed. Then, the solution of the LQR problem for continuous-time systems is presented. Finally, we consider the case in which the precise position of the desired poles of the closed-loop system is known, and introduce a data-based variant of a robust pole-placement procedure. The applicability of the proposed methods is tested using numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tube-based model predictive control (MPC) is one of the principal robust control techniques for constrained linear systems affected by additive disturbances. While tube-based methods with online-computed tubes have been successfully applied to systems with additive disturbances, their application to systems affected by additional model uncertainties is challenging. This paper proposes a tube-based MPC method - named filter-based system level tube-MPC (SLTMPC) - which overapproximates both types of uncertainties with an online optimized disturbance set, while simultaneously computing the tube controller online. For the first time, we provide rigorous closed-loop guarantees for receding horizon control of such a MPC method. These guarantees are obtained by virtue of a new terminal controller design and an online optimized terminal set. To reduce the computational complexity of the proposed method, we additionally introduce an asynchronous computation scheme that separates the optimization of the tube controller and the nominal trajectory. Finally, we provide a comprehensive numerical evaluation of the proposed methods to demonstrate their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Subsynchronous Oscillation Suppression for Renewable Energy Integrated Power Systems Based on Koopman Operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, subsynchronous oscillations (SSOs) have emerged frequently worldwide, with the high penetration of renewable power generation in modern power systems. The SSO introduced by renewables has become a prominent new stability problem, seriously threatening the stable operation of systems. This paper proposes a data-driven dynamic optimal controller for renewable energy integrated power systems, to suppress SSOs with the control of renewables. The challenges of the controller design are the nonlinearity, complexity and hard accessibility of the system models. Using Koopman operator, the system dynamics are accurately extracted from data and utilized to the linear model predictive control (MPC). Firstly, the globally linear representation of the system dynamics is obtained by lifting, and the key states are selected as control signals by analyzing Koopman participation factors. Subsequently, augmented with the control term, the Koopman linear parameter-varying predictor of the controlled system is constructed. Finally, using MPC, the proposed controller computes control signals online in a moving horizon fashion. Case studies show that the proposed controller is effective, adaptive and robust in various conditions, surpassing other controllers with reliable control performance.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of Gradient Flow for Overparameterized LQR Formulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15456v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in control design, this paper analyses the intersection between results from gradient methods for the model-free linear quadratic regulator (LQR), and linear feedforward neural networks (LFFNNs), More specifically, it looks into the case where one wants to find a LFFNN feedback that minimizes a LQR cost. This paper starts by analyzing the structure of the gradient expression for the parameters of each layer, which implies a key conservation law of the system. This conservation law is then leveraged to generalize existing results on boundedness and global convergence of solutions to critical points, and invariance of the set of stabilizing networks under the training dynamics. This is followed by an analysis of the case where the LFFNN has a single hidden layer, for which the paper proves that the training converges not only to the critical points, but to the optimal feedback control law for all but a set of Lebesgue measure zero of the initializations. These theoretical results are followed by an extensive analysis of a simple version of the problem -- the ``vector case'' -- proving the theoretical properties of accelerated convergence and small-input input-to-state stability (ISS) for this simpler example. Finally, the paper presents numerical evidence of faster convergence of the training of general LFFNNs when compared to non-overparameterized formulations, showing that the acceleration of the solution is observable even when the gradient is not explicitly computed, but estimated from evaluations of the cost function.</description>

      <title>Multi-Partite Output Regulation of Multi-Agent Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article proposes a simple, graph-independent perspective on partitioning the node set of a graph and provides multi-agent systems (MASs) with objectives beyond cooperation and bipartition. Specifically, we first introduce the notion of $k$-partition transformation to achieve any desired partition of the nodes. Then, we use this notion to formulate the multi-partite output regulation problem (MORP) of heterogeneous linear MASs, which comprises the existing cooperative output regulation problem (CORP) and bipartite output regulation problem (BORP) as subcases. The goal of the MORP is to design a distributed control law such that each follower that belongs to the same set in the partition asymptotically tracks a scalar multiple of the reference while ensuring the internal stability of the closed-loop system. It is shown that the necessary and sufficient conditions for the solvability of the MORP with a feedforward-based distributed control law follow from the CORP and lead to the first design strategy for the control parameters. However, it has a drawback in terms of scalability due to a partition-dependent condition. We prove that this condition is implied by its partition-independent version under a mild structural condition. This implication yields the second design strategy that is much more scalable than the first one. Finally, an experiment is conducted to demonstrate the MORP's flexibility, and two numerical examples are provided to illustrate its generality and compare both design strategies regarding scalability.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a large real-world dataset obtained from monitoring a smart company facility over the course of six years, from 2018 to 2023. The dataset includes energy consumption data from various facility areas and components, energy production data from a photovoltaic system and a combined heat and power plant, operational data from heating and cooling systems, and weather data from an on-site weather station. The measurement sensors installed throughout the facility are organized in a hierarchical metering structure with multiple sub-metering levels, which is reflected in the dataset. The dataset contains measurement data from 72 energy meters, 9 heat meters and a weather station. Both raw and processed data at different processing levels, including labeled issues, is available. In this paper, we describe the data acquisition and post-processing employed to create the dataset. The dataset enables the application of a wide range of methods in the domain of energy management, including optimization, modeling, and machine learning to optimize building operations and reduce costs and carbon emissions.</description>

      <title>IAE Optimized PID Tuning via Second Order Step Response Target Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents SOSTIAE (Second-Order System Target IAE), a novel PID tuning method that combines IAE minimization with explicit transient response shaping for practical control applications. The algorithm generates optimal PID parameters by matching the closed-loop response to a target second-order system with user-defined settling time (Ts) and percent overshoot (PO), while maintaining the conventional IAE performance metric. Comparative evaluations on first to third-order systems demonstrate that SOSTIAE consistently outperforms MATLAB's proprietary pidtune function, achieving 47-67% lower overshoot and up to 26% better IAE performance for higher-order plants. The constrained optimization framework ensures physically realizable controllers by enforcing non-negative PID gains and stability criteria, addressing known limitations of unconstrained IAE methods. Results indicate that SOSTIAE provides engineers with a systematic alternative for PID tuning when transient specifications and practical implementation constraints are critical.</description>

      <title>Linearization of ReLU Activation Function for Neural Network-Embedded Optimization: Optimal Day-Ahead Energy Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, neural networks have been widely applied in the power system area. They can be used for better predicting input information and modeling system performance with increased accuracy. In some applications such as battery degradation neural network-based microgrid day-ahead energy scheduling, the input features of the trained learning model are variables to be solved in optimization models that enforce limits on the output of the same learning model. This will create a neural network-embedded optimization problem; the use of nonlinear activation functions in the neural network will make such problems extremely hard to solve if not unsolvable. To address this emerging challenge, this paper investigated different methods for linearizing the nonlinear activation functions with a particular focus on the widely used rectified linear unit (ReLU) function. Four linearization methods tailored for the ReLU activation function are developed, analyzed and compared in this paper. Each method employs a set of linear constraints to replace the ReLU function, effectively linearizing the optimization problem, which can overcome the computational challenges associated with the nonlinearity of the neural network model. These proposed linearization methods provide valuable tools for effectively solving optimization problems that integrate neural network models with ReLU activation functions</description>

      <title>Variance-Reduced Cascade Q-learning: Algorithms and Sample Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the optimal Q-function of $\gamma$-discounted Markov decision processes (MDPs) under the synchronous setting, where independent samples for all state-action pairs are drawn from a generative model at each iteration. We introduce and analyze a novel model-free algorithm called Variance-Reduced Cascade Q-learning (VRCQ). VRCQ comprises two key building blocks: (i) the established direct variance reduction technique and (ii) our proposed variance reduction scheme, Cascade Q-learning. By leveraging these techniques, VRCQ provides superior guarantees in the $\ell_\infty$-norm compared with the existing model-free stochastic approximation-type algorithms. Specifically, we demonstrate that VRCQ is minimax optimal. Additionally, when the action set is a singleton (so that the Q-learning problem reduces to policy evaluation), it achieves non-asymptotic instance optimality while requiring the minimum number of samples theoretically possible. Our theoretical results and their practical implications are supported by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>(Un)supervised Learning of Maximal Lyapunov Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of discovering maximal Lyapunov functions, as a means of determining the region of attraction of a dynamical system. To this end, we design a novel neural network architecture, which we prove to be a universal approximator of (maximal) Lyapunov functions. The architecture combines a local quadratic approximation with the output of a neural network, which models global higher-order terms in the Taylor expansion. We formulate the problem of training the Lyapunov function as an unsupervised optimization problem with dynamical constraints, which can be solved leveraging techniques from physics-informed learning. We propose and analyze a tailored training algorithm, based on the primal-dual algorithm, that can efficiently solve the problem. Additionally, we show how the learning problem formulation can be adapted to integrate data, when available. We apply the proposed approach to different classes of systems, showing that it matches or outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in the accuracy of the approximated regions of attraction.</description>

      <title>Interacting Large Language Model Agents. Interpretable Models and Social Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses the theory and algorithms for interacting large language model agents (LLMAs) using methods from statistical signal processing and microeconomics. While both fields are mature, their application to decision-making involving interacting LLMAs remains unexplored. Motivated by Bayesian sentiment analysis on online platforms, we construct interpretable models and algorithms that enable LLMAs to interact and perform Bayesian inference. Because interacting LLMAs learn from both prior decisions and external inputs, they can exhibit bias and herding behavior. Thus, developing interpretable models and stochastic control algorithms is essential to understand and mitigate these behaviors. This paper has three main results. First, we show using Bayesian revealed preferences from microeconomics that an individual LLMA satisfies the necessary and sufficient conditions for rationally inattentive (bounded rationality) Bayesian utility maximization and, given an observation, the LLMA chooses an action that maximizes a regularized utility. Second, we utilize Bayesian social learning to construct interpretable models for LLMAs that interact sequentially with each other and the environment while performing Bayesian inference. Our proposed models capture the herding behavior exhibited by interacting LLMAs. Third, we propose a stochastic control framework to delay herding and improve state estimation accuracy under 2 settings: (a) centrally controlled LLMAs (b) autonomous LLMAs with incentives. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on real datasets for hate speech classification and product quality assessment, using open-source models like LLaMA and closed-source models like ChatGPT. The main takeaway of this paper, based on empirical analysis and mathematical formalism, is that LLMAs act as rationally bounded Bayesian agents that exhibit social learning when interacting.</description>

      <title>Future-Oriented Navigation: Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance with One-Shot Energy-Based Multimodal Motion Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an integrated approach for the safe and efficient control of mobile robots in dynamic and uncertain environments. The approach consists of two key steps: one-shot multimodal motion prediction to anticipate motions of dynamic obstacles and model predictive control to incorporate these predictions into the motion planning process. Motion prediction is driven by an energy-based neural network that generates high-resolution, multi-step predictions in a single operation. The prediction outcomes are further utilized to create geometric shapes formulated as mathematical constraints. Instead of treating each dynamic obstacle individually, predicted obstacles are grouped by proximity in an unsupervised way to improve performance and efficiency. The overall collision-free navigation is handled by model predictive control with a specific design for proactive dynamic obstacle avoidance. The proposed approach allows mobile robots to navigate effectively in dynamic environments. Its performance is accessed across various scenarios that represent typical warehouse settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms other existing dynamic obstacle avoidance methods.</description>

      <title>Dual Acceleration for Minimax Optimization: Linear Convergence Under Relaxed Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the bilinearly coupled minimax optimization problem: $\min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^{d_x}}\max_{y \in \mathbb{R}^{d_y}} \ f_1(x) + f_2(x) + y^{\top} Bx - g_1(y) - g_2(y)$, where $f_1$ and $g_1$ are smooth convex functions, $f_2$ and $g_2$ are potentially nonsmooth convex functions, and $B$ is a coupling matrix. Existing algorithms for solving this problem achieve linear convergence only under stronger conditions, which may not be met in many scenarios. We first introduce the Primal-Dual Proximal Gradient (PDPG) method and demonstrate that it converges linearly under an assumption where existing algorithms fail to achieve linear convergence. Building on insights gained from analyzing the convergence conditions of existing algorithms and PDPG, we further propose the inexact Dual Accelerated Proximal Gradient (iDAPG) method. This method achieves linear convergence under weaker conditions than those required by existing approaches. Moreover, even in cases where existing methods guarantee linear convergence, iDAPG can still provide superior theoretical performance in certain scenarios.</description>

      <title>Proactive Hierarchical Control Barrier Function-Based Safety Prioritization in Close Human-Robot Interaction Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In collaborative human-robot environments, the unpredictable and dynamic nature of human motion can lead to situations where collisions become unavoidable. In such cases, it is essential for the robotic system to proactively mitigate potential harm through intelligent control strategies. This paper presents a hierarchical control framework based on Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) designed to ensure safe and adaptive operation of autonomous robotic manipulators during close-proximity human-robot interaction. The proposed method introduces a relaxation variable that enables real-time prioritization of safety constraints, allowing the robot to dynamically manage collision risks based on the criticality of different parts of the human body. A secondary constraint mechanism is incorporated to resolve infeasibility by increasing the priority of imminent threats. The framework is experimentally validated on a Franka Research 3 robot equipped with a ZED2i AI camera for real-time human pose and body detection. Experimental results confirm that the CBF-based controller, integrated with depth sensing, facilitates responsive and safe human-robot collaboration, while providing detailed risk analysis and maintaining robust performance in highly dynamic settings.</description>
