      <title>Convergence of sub-series' and sub-signed series' in terms of the asymptotic $\psi$-density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a non-negative real sequence $\{c_n\}_n$ such that the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}c_n$ diverges, it is known that the size of an infinite subset $A\subset\mathbb{N}$ can be measured in terms of the linear density such that the sub-series $\sum_{n\in A}c_n$ either (a) converges or (b) still diverges. The purpose of this research is to study these convergence/divergence questions by measuring the size of the set $A\subset\mathbb{N}$ in a more precise way in terms of the recently introduced asymptotic $\psi$-density. The convergence of the associated sub-signed series $\sum_{n=1 }^{\infty}m_nc_n$ is also discussed, where $\{m_n\}_n$ is a real sequence with values restricted to the set $\{-1, 0, 1\}$.</description>

      <title>The exact dimension of Liouville numbers: The Fourier side</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study the generalized Fourier dimension of the set of Liouville numbers $\mathbb{L}$. Being a set of zero Hausdorff dimension, the analysis has to be done at the level of functions with a slow decay at infinity acting as control for the Fourier transform of (Rajchman) measures supported on $\mathbb{L}$. We give an almost complete characterization of admissible decays for this set in terms of comparison to power-like functions. This work can be seen as the ``Fourier side'' of the analysis made by Olsen and Renfro regarding the generalized Hausdorff dimension using gauge functions. We also provide an approach to deal with the problem of classifying oscillating candidates for a Fourier decay for $\mathbb{L}$ relying on its translation invariance property.</description>

      <title>Adelic and Rational Grassmannians for finite dimensional algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of Wilson's adelic Grassmannian ${\mathrm{Gr}}^{\mathrm{ad}}(R)$ and Segal-Wilson's rational Grasssmannian ${\mathrm{Gr}}^ {\mathrm{rat}}(R)$ associated to an arbitrary finite dimensional complex algebra $R$. We provide several equivalent descriptions of the former in terms of the indecomposable projective modules of $R$ and its primitive idempotents, and prove that it classifies the bispectral Darboux transformations of the $R$-valued exponential function. The rational Grasssmannian $ {\mathrm{Gr}}^{\mathrm{rat}}(R)$ is defined by using certain free submodules of $R(z)$ and it is proved that it can be alternatively defined via Wilson type conditions imposed in a representation theoretic settings. A canonical embedding ${\mathrm{Gr}}^{\mathrm{ad}}(R) \hookrightarrow {\mathrm{Gr}}^{\mathrm{rat}}(R)$ is constructed based on a perfect pairing between the $R$-bimodule of quasiexponentials with values in $R$ and the $R$-bimodule $R[z]$.</description>

      <title>New variable weighted conditions for fractional maximal operators over spaces of homogeneous type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the rapid development of dyadic analysis and the theory of variable weighted function spaces over the spaces of homogeneous type $(X,d,\mu)$ in recent years, we systematically consider the quantitative variable weighted characterizations for fractional maximal operators. On the one hand, a new class of variable multiple weight $A_{\vec{p}(\cdot),q(\cdot)}(X)$ is established, which enables us to prove the strong and weak type variable multiple weighted estimates for multilinear fractional maximal operators ${{{\mathscr M}_{\eta }}}$. More precisely, \[ {\left[ {\vec \omega } \right]_{{A_{\vec p( \cdot ),q( \cdot )}}(X)}} \lesssim {\left\| \mathscr{M}_\eta \right\|_{\prod\limits_{i = 1}^m {{L^{p_i( \cdot )}}({X,\omega _i})} \to {L^{q( \cdot )}}(X,\omega )({WL^{q( \cdot )}}(X,\omega ))}} \le {C_{\vec \omega ,\eta ,m,\mu ,X,\vec p( \cdot )}}. \]
  On the other hand, on account of the classical Sawyer's condition $S_{p,q}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, a new variable testing condition $C_{{p}(\cdot),q(\cdot)}(X)$ also appears in here, which allows us to obtain quantitative two-weighted estimates for fractional maximal operators ${{{M}_{\eta }}}$. To be exact, \begin{align*}
  \|M_{\eta}\|_{L^{p(\cdot)}(X,\omega)\rightarrow L^{q(\cdot)}(X,v)} \lesssim \sum_{\theta=\frac{1}{{{p_{\rm{ - }}}}},\frac{1}{{{p_{\rm{ + }}}}}} \left([\omega ]_{C_{p( \cdot ),q( \cdot )}^1(X)} [\omega, v]_{C_{p(\cdot), q(\cdot)}^2(X)}\right)^{\theta}, \end{align*} The implicit constants mentioned above are independent on the weights.</description>

      <title>Piecewise constant profiles minimizing total variation energies of Kobayashi-Warren-Carter type with fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a total variation type energy which measures the jump discontinuities different from usual total variation energy. Such a type of energy is obtained as a singular limit of the Kobayashi-Warren-Carter energy with minimization with respect to the order parameter. We consider the Rudin-Osher-Fatemi type energy by replacing relaxation term by this type of total variation energy. We show that all minimizers are piecewise constant if the data is continuous in one-dimensional setting. Moreover, the number of jumps is bounded by an explicit constant involving a constant related to the fidelity. This is quite different from conventional Rudin-Osher-Fatemi energy where a minimizer must have no jump if the data has no jumps. The existence of a minimizer is guaranteed in multi-dimensional setting when the data is bounded.</description>

      <title>Shifted second moment of the Riemann zeta function and a Fourier type kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the second moment of the Riemann zeta function for shifted arguments over a domain that extends the ones in the literature. We use the Riemann-Siegel formula for the error term in the approximate functional equation and take the products of all the terms into account. We also show that, as a function of imaginary shifts on the critical line, the the second moment behaves like a Fourier-Cauchy type kernel on a class of functions. This is reminiscent of orthogonal functions.</description>

      <title>An existence and uniqueness theory to stochastic partial differential equations involving pseudo-differential operators driven by space-time white noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to develop a new weak formulation that ensures well-posedness for a broad range of stochastic partial differential equations with pseudo-differential operators whose symbols depend only on time and spatial frequencies. The main focus of this paper is to relax the conditions on the symbols of pseudo-differential operators and data while still ensuring that the stochastic partial differential equations remain well-posed in a weak sense. Specifically, we allow symbols to be random and remove all regularity and ellipticity conditions on them. As a result, our main operators include many interesting rough operators that cannot generate any regularity gain or integrability improvement from the equations. In addition, our data do not need to be regular or possess finite stochastic moments.</description>

      <title>On the radially deformed Fourier transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the kernel of the radially deformed Fourier transform introduced in the context of Clifford analysis in [10]. By adapting the Laplace transform method from [4], we obtain the Laplace domain expressions of the kernel for the cases of $m=2$ and $m &gt; 2$ when $1+c=\frac{1}{n}, n\in \mathbb{N}_0\backslash\{1\}$ with $n$ odd. Moreover, we show that the expressions can be simplified using the Poisson kernel and the generating function of the Gegenbauer polynomials. As a consequence, the inverse formulas are used to get the integral expressions of the kernel in terms of Mittag-Leffler functions.</description>

      <title>On the distance problem over finite p-adic rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the distance problem in the setting of finite p-adic rings. In odd dimensions, our results are essentially sharp. In even dimensions, we clarify the conjecture and provide examples to support it. Surprisingly, compared to the finite field case, in this setting, we are able to provide a large family of sets such that the distance conjecture holds. By developing new restriction type estimates associated to circles and orbits, with a group theoretic argument, we will prove the $4/3$-parallel result in the two dimensions. This answers a question raised by Alex Iosevich. In a more general scenario, the existence/distribution of geometric/graph configurations will be also considered in this paper. Our results present improvements and extensions of recent results due to Ben Lichtin (2019, 2023). In comparison with Lichtin's method, our approach is much simpler and flexible, which is also one of the novelties in this paper.</description>

      <title>Extensions of the Bloch-P\'olya Theorem on the number of real zeros of polynomials (II)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16120v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that there is an absolute constant $c &gt; 0$ such that for every $$a_0,a_1, \ldots,a_n \in [1,M]\,, \qquad 1 \leq M \leq \frac 14 \exp \left( \frac n9 \right)\,,$$ there are $$b_0,b_1,\ldots,b_n \in \{-1,0,1\}$$ such that the polynomial $P$ of the form $\displaystyle{P(z) = \sum_{j=0}^n{b_ja_jz^j}}$ has at least $\displaystyle{c \left( \frac{n}{\log(4M)} \right)^{1/2}-1}$ distinct sign changes in $I_a := (1-2a,1-a)$, where $\displaystyle{a := \left( \frac{\log(4M)}{n} \right)^{1/2} \leq 1/3}$. This improves and extends earlier results of Bloch and P\'olya and Erd\'elyi and, as a special case, recaptures a special case of a more general recent result of Jacob and Nazarov.</description>

      <title>Fourier Decay from $L^2$-Flattening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified approach for establishing rates of decay for the Fourier transform of a wide class of dynamically defined measures. Among the key features of the method is the systematic use of the $L^2$-flattening theorem obtained in \cite{Khalil-Mixing}, coupled with non-concentration estimates for the derivatives of the underlying dynamical system. This method yields polylogarithmic Fourier decay for Diophantine self-similar measures, and polynomial decay for Patterson-Sullivan measures of convex cocompact hyperbolic manifolds, Gibbs measures associated to non-integrable $C^2$ conformal systems, as well as stationary measures for carpet-like non-conformal iterated function systems. Applications include essential spectral gaps on convex cocompact hyperbolic manifolds, fractal uncertainty principles, and equidistribution properties of typical vectors in fractal sets.</description>
