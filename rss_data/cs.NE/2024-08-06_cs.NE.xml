      <title>Abstraction in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how brain networks, modeled as Spiking Neural Networks, can be viewed at different levels of abstraction. Lower levels include complications such as failures of neurons and edges. Higher levels are more abstract, making simplifying assumptions to avoid these complications. We show precise relationships between executions of networks at different levels, which enables us to understand the behavior of lower-level networks in terms of the behavior of higher-level networks.
  We express our results using two abstract networks, A1 and A2, one to express firing guarantees and the other to express non-firing guarantees, and one detailed network D. The abstract networks contain reliable neurons and edges, whereas the detailed network has neurons and edges that may fail, subject to some constraints. Here we consider just initial stopping failures. To define these networks, we begin with abstract network A1 and modify it systematically to obtain the other two networks. To obtain A2, we simply lower the firing thresholds of the neurons. To obtain D, we introduce failures of neurons and edges, and incorporate redundancy in the neurons and edges in order to compensate for the failures. We also define corresponding inputs for the networks, and corresponding executions of the networks.
  We prove two main theorems, one relating corresponding executions of A1 and D and the other relating corresponding executions of A2 and D. Together, these give both firing and non-firing guarantees for the detailed network D. We also give a third theorem, relating the effects of D on an external reliable actuator neuron to the effects of the abstract networks on the same actuator neuron.</description>

      <title>MARCO: A Memory-Augmented Reinforcement Framework for Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) is an emerging domain where deep learning techniques are employed to address combinatorial optimization problems as a standalone solver. Despite their potential, existing NCO methods often suffer from inefficient search space exploration, frequently leading to local optima entrapment or redundant exploration of previously visited states. This paper introduces a versatile framework, referred to as Memory-Augmented Reinforcement for Combinatorial Optimization (MARCO), that can be used to enhance both constructive and improvement methods in NCO through an innovative memory module. MARCO stores data collected throughout the optimization trajectory and retrieves contextually relevant information at each state. This way, the search is guided by two competing criteria: making the best decision in terms of the quality of the solution and avoiding revisiting already explored solutions. This approach promotes a more efficient use of the available optimization budget. Moreover, thanks to the parallel nature of NCO models, several search threads can run simultaneously, all sharing the same memory module, enabling an efficient collaborative exploration. Empirical evaluations, carried out on the maximum cut, maximum independent set and travelling salesman problems, reveal that the memory module effectively increases the exploration, enabling the model to discover diverse, higher-quality solutions. MARCO achieves good performance in a low computational cost, establishing a promising new direction in the field of NCO.</description>

      <title>A Landscape-Aware Differential Evolution for Multimodal Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How to simultaneously locate multiple global peaks and achieve certain accuracy on the found peaks are two key challenges in solving multimodal optimization problems (MMOPs). In this paper, a landscape-aware differential evolution (LADE) algorithm is proposed for MMOPs, which utilizes landscape knowledge to maintain sufficient diversity and provide efficient search guidance. In detail, the landscape knowledge is efficiently utilized in the following three aspects. First, a landscape-aware peak exploration helps each individual evolve adaptively to locate a peak and simulates the regions of the found peaks according to search history to avoid an individual locating a found peak. Second, a landscape-aware peak distinction distinguishes whether an individual locates a new global peak, a new local peak, or a found peak. Accuracy refinement can thus only be conducted on the global peaks to enhance the search efficiency. Third, a landscape-aware reinitialization specifies the initial position of an individual adaptively according to the distribution of the found peaks, which helps explore more peaks. The experiments are conducted on 20 widely-used benchmark MMOPs. Experimental results show that LADE obtains generally better or competitive performance compared with seven well-performed algorithms proposed recently and four winner algorithms in the IEEE CEC competitions for multimodal optimization.</description>

      <title>An investigation on the use of Large Language Models for hyperparameter tuning in Evolutionary Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization is a crucial problem in Evolutionary Computation. In fact, the values of the hyperparameters directly impact the trajectory taken by the optimization process, and their choice requires extensive reasoning by human operators. Although a variety of self-adaptive Evolutionary Algorithms have been proposed in the literature, no definitive solution has been found. In this work, we perform a preliminary investigation to automate the reasoning process that leads to the choice of hyperparameter values. We employ two open-source Large Language Models (LLMs), namely Llama2-70b and Mixtral, to analyze the optimization logs online and provide novel real-time hyperparameter recommendations. We study our approach in the context of step-size adaptation for (1+1)-ES. The results suggest that LLMs can be an effective method for optimizing hyperparameters in Evolution Strategies, encouraging further research in this direction.</description>

      <title>Can multivariate Granger causality detect directed connectivity of a multistable and dynamic biological decision network model?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracting causal connections can advance interpretable AI and machine learning. Granger causality (GC) is a robust statistical method for estimating directed influences (DC) between signals. While GC has been widely applied to analysing neuronal signals in biological neural networks and other domains, its application to complex, nonlinear, and multistable neural networks is less explored. In this study, we applied time-domain multi-variate Granger causality (MVGC) to the time series neural activity of all nodes in a trained multistable biologically based decision neural network model with real-time decision uncertainty monitoring. Our analysis demonstrated that challenging two-choice decisions, where input signals could be closely matched, and the appropriate application of fine-grained sliding time windows, could readily reveal the original model's DC. Furthermore, the identified DC varied based on whether the network had correct or error decisions. Integrating the identified DC from different decision outcomes recovered most of the original model's architecture, despite some spurious and missing connectivity. This approach could be used as an initial exploration to enhance the interpretability and transparency of dynamic multistable and nonlinear biological or AI systems by revealing causal connections throughout different phases of neural network dynamics and outcomes.</description>

      <title>Active Learning for Neural PDE Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) is a fundamental problem in engineering and science. While neural PDE solvers can be more efficient than established numerical solvers, they often require large amounts of training data that is costly to obtain. Active Learning (AL) could help surrogate models reach the same accuracy with smaller training sets by querying classical solvers with more informative initial conditions and PDE parameters. While AL is more common in other domains, it has yet to be studied extensively for neural PDE solvers. To bridge this gap, we introduce AL4PDE, a modular and extensible active learning benchmark. It provides multiple parametric PDEs and state-of-the-art surrogate models for the solver-in-the-loop setting, enabling the evaluation of existing and the development of new AL methods for PDE solving. We use the benchmark to evaluate batch active learning algorithms such as uncertainty- and feature-based methods. We show that AL reduces the average error by up to 71% compared to random sampling and significantly reduces worst-case errors. Moreover, AL generates similar datasets across repeated runs, with consistent distributions over the PDE parameters and initial conditions. The acquired datasets are reusable, providing benefits for surrogate models not involved in the data generation.</description>

      <title>Understanding Deep Learning via Notions of Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the extreme popularity of deep learning in science and industry, its formal understanding is limited. This thesis puts forth notions of rank as key for developing a theory of deep learning, focusing on the fundamental aspects of generalization and expressiveness. In particular, we establish that gradient-based training can induce an implicit regularization towards low rank for several neural network architectures, and demonstrate empirically that this phenomenon may facilitate an explanation of generalization over natural data (e.g., audio, images, and text). Then, we characterize the ability of graph neural networks to model interactions via a notion of rank, which is commonly used for quantifying entanglement in quantum physics. A central tool underlying these results is a connection between neural networks and tensor factorizations. Practical implications of our theory for designing explicit regularization schemes and data preprocessing algorithms are presented.</description>

      <title>PENDRAM: Enabling High-Performance and Energy-Efficient Processing of Deep Neural Networks through a Generalized DRAM Data Mapping Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a prominent type of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), have emerged as a state-of-the-art solution for solving machine learning tasks. To improve the performance and energy efficiency of CNN inference, the employment of specialized hardware accelerators is prevalent. However, CNN accelerators still face performance- and energy-efficiency challenges due to high off-chip memory (DRAM) access latency and energy, which are especially crucial for latency- and energy-constrained embedded applications. Moreover, different DRAM architectures have different profiles of access latency and energy, thus making it challenging to optimize them for high performance and energy-efficient CNN accelerators. To address this, we present PENDRAM, a novel design space exploration methodology that enables high-performance and energy-efficient CNN acceleration through a generalized DRAM data mapping policy. Specifically, it explores the impact of different DRAM data mapping policies and DRAM architectures across different CNN partitioning and scheduling schemes on the DRAM access latency and energy, then identifies the pareto-optimal design choices. The experimental results show that our DRAM data mapping policy improves the energy-delay-product of DRAM accesses in the CNN accelerator over other mapping policies by up to 96%. In this manner, our PENDRAM methodology offers high-performance and energy-efficient CNN acceleration under any given DRAM architectures for diverse embedded AI applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically inspired approach to computer vision that can lead to more efficient processing of visual data with reduced energy consumption. However, maintaining homeostasis within these networks is challenging, as it requires continuous adjustment of neural responses to preserve equilibrium and optimal processing efficiency amidst diverse and often unpredictable input signals. In response to these challenges, we propose the Asynchronous Bioplausible Neuron (ABN), a dynamic spike firing mechanism to auto-adjust the variations in the input signal. Comprehensive evaluation across various datasets demonstrates ABN's enhanced performance in image classification and segmentation, maintenance of neural equilibrium, and energy efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This review explores the application of intelligent optimization algorithms to Multi-Objective Optimal Power Flow (MOPF) in enhancing modern power systems. It delves into the challenges posed by the integration of renewables, smart grids, and increasing energy demands, focusing on evolutionary algorithms, swarm intelligence, and deep reinforcement learning. The effectiveness, scalability, and application of these algorithms are analyzed, with findings suggesting that algorithm selection is contingent on the specific MOPF problem at hand, and hybrid approaches offer significant promise. The importance of standard test systems for verifying solutions and the role of software tools in facilitating analysis are emphasized. Future research is directed towards exploiting machine learning for dynamic optimization, embracing decentralized energy systems, and adapting to evolving policy frameworks to improve power system efficiency and sustainability. This review aims to advance MOPF research by highlighting state-of-the-art methodologies and encouraging the development of innovative solutions for future energy challenges.</description>

      <title>Towards Explainable Evolution Strategies with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an approach that integrates self-adaptive Evolution Strategies (ES) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the explainability of complex optimization processes. By employing a self-adaptive ES equipped with a restart mechanism, we effectively navigate the challenging landscapes of benchmark functions, capturing detailed logs of the optimization journey. The logs include fitness evolution, step-size adjustments and restart events due to stagnation. An LLM is then utilized to process these logs, generating concise, user-friendly summaries that highlight key aspects such as convergence behavior, optimal fitness achievements, and encounters with local optima. Our case study on the Rastrigin function demonstrates how our approach makes the complexities of ES optimization transparent. Our findings highlight the potential of using LLMs to bridge the gap between advanced optimization algorithms and their interpretability.</description>

      <title>Input Invex Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.08748v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Connected decision boundaries are useful in several tasks like image segmentation, clustering, alpha-shape or defining a region in nD-space. However, the machine learning literature lacks methods for generating connected decision boundaries using neural networks. Thresholding an invex function, a generalization of a convex function, generates such decision boundaries. This paper presents two methods for constructing invex functions using neural networks. The first approach is based on constraining a neural network with Gradient Clipped-Gradient Penality (GCGP), where we clip and penalise the gradients. In contrast, the second one is based on the relationship of the invex function to the composition of invertible and convex functions. We employ connectedness as a basic interpretation method and create connected region-based classifiers. We show that multiple connected set based classifiers can approximate any classification function. In the experiments section, we use our methods for classification tasks using an ensemble of 1-vs-all models as well as using a single multiclass model on small-scale datasets. The experiments show that connected set-based classifiers do not pose any disadvantage over ordinary neural network classifiers, but rather, enhance their interpretability. We also did an extensive study on the properties of invex function and connected sets for interpretability and network morphism with experiments on toy and real-world data sets. Our study suggests that invex function is fundamental to understanding and applying locality and connectedness of input space which is useful for various downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Open Sesame! Universal Black Box Jailbreaking of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01446v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), designed to provide helpful and safe responses, often rely on alignment techniques to align with user intent and social guidelines. Unfortunately, this alignment can be exploited by malicious actors seeking to manipulate an LLM's outputs for unintended purposes. In this paper we introduce a novel approach that employs a genetic algorithm (GA) to manipulate LLMs when model architecture and parameters are inaccessible. The GA attack works by optimizing a universal adversarial prompt that -- when combined with a user's query -- disrupts the attacked model's alignment, resulting in unintended and potentially harmful outputs. Our novel approach systematically reveals a model's limitations and vulnerabilities by uncovering instances where its responses deviate from expected behavior. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate the efficacy of our technique, thus contributing to the ongoing discussion on responsible AI development by providing a diagnostic tool for evaluating and enhancing alignment of LLMs with human intent. To our knowledge this is the first automated universal black box jailbreak attack.</description>
