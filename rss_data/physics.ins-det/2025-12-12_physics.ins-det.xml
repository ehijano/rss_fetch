      <title>Identifying Neutron Sources using Recoil and Time-of-Flight Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron-source identification is central to nuclear physics and its applications, from planetary science to nuclear security, yet direct discrimination from neutron spectra remains fundamentally elusive. Here, we introduce a Bayesian protocol that directly infers source ensembles from measured neutron spectra by combining full-spectrum template matching with probabilistic evidence evaluation. Applying this protocol to recoil and time-of-flight spectroscopy, we recover single- and two-source configurations with strong statistical significance ($&gt;\!\!4\sigma$) at event counts as low as $\sim\!\!10^{3}$. These results demonstrate that neutron spectral signatures can be leveraged for robust source identification, opening a new observational window for both fundamental research and operationally driven applications.</description>

      <title>A Computational Procedure for Assessing I$_c$($\varepsilon$) in Nb$_3$Sn/Bi-2212 Hybrid Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The critical current of superconductors is commonly measured by testing unloaded wires under an external magnetic field. While stressed by intense Lorentz forces, the existing HTS/LTS superconductors are prone to a reduction in critical current before reaching their structural mechanical limit. In this work, the magnetic and mechanical analysis of the FNAL 4-layer Bi-2212/Nb$_3$Sn hybrid dipole magnet is reported, aimed at predicting the critical current degradation for both the superconductors during powering at 16 T. All the Rutherford cables in the coils of the hybrid magnet were modeled at the strand level in Ansys APDL with the heterogeneous cable model. Utilizing this detailed geometry, it was possible to evaluate the effects of strain on the critical current degradation for both the Nb$_3$Sn and Bi-2212 superconductors under the intense Lorentz forces. The analysis presented in this paper integrates strain-dependent critical current laws, with parameters derived from experimental data, to simulate the hybrid magnet's performance for all possible current-powering configurations. The proposed methodology enables a detailed assessment of conductor integrity and I$_C$($\varepsilon$) reduction in existing hybrid magnet designs, providing a versatile and rigorous framework for optimizing future high-field hybrid magnets.</description>

      <title>{\mu}RWELL-PICOSEC: Precision Timing with Resistive Micro-Well Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PICOSEC detector concept uses a micro-pattern gaseous detector (MPGD) amplification structure combined with a Cerenkov radiator coated with a semi-transparent photocathode to provide below tens of picosecond-level precision timing capabilities with minimum ionizing particles. PICOSEC has triggered interest in the development of time-of-flight detectors for particle identification and timing detectors for track reconstruction in the high rate environment of future nuclear and high energy physics experiments. The PICOSEC Micromegas (or PICOSEC-MM) detector, developed by the CERN-based PICOSEC collaboration, use the Micromegas structure for gaseous amplification and achieve below 20 ps timing resolution. A new type of PICOSEC detector, the {\mu}RWELL-PICOSEC based on {\mu}RWELL amplification structure, is being investigated at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab) alongside PICOSEC-MM R&amp;D efforts in Europe. Preliminary results from the two 2024 beam test campaigns at CERN demonstrate a timing performance better than 24 ps is achievable with a single-channel {\mu}RWELL-PICOSEC prototype. A vigorous R&amp;D effort is ongoing to improve the timing performance, robustness and operational stability of {\mu}RWELL-PICOSEC detectors. Development of a large size {\mu}RWELL-PICOSEC is also under consideration for applications in large scale experiments.</description>

      <title>Accurate laboratory testing of low-frequency triaxial vibration sensors under various environmental conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triaxial vibration sensor are widely used used in various application. Recently, low-cost sensors based on micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) technology are also becoming more widely adopted. However, their measurement accuracy can be affected by environmental factors such as temperature. In this study, we developed an environmental testing system integrated with a triaxial vibration exciter. The system can reproduce long-stroke, low-frequency triaxial vibrations -- such as those caused by huge earthquakes -- under temperatures ranging from $-30~^\circ\mathrm{C}$ to $+80~^\circ\mathrm{C}$. Using this system, the measurement accuracy of vibration sensors can be evaluated under different environmental conditions. The system provides highly accurate reference measurements using a laser interferometer and reference accelerometers that are primarily calibrated within the system. The overall accuracy of the reference vibration measurement is estimated to be approximately 0.23~\%. Based on these reference measurements, we investigated the accuracy of earthquake observations using a MEMS accelerometer as a demonstration. The system configuration and testing procedures are presented in this paper.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray Measurements Using Charge and Light Readout in a Pixelated Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid argon time projection chambers have emerged as a competitive technology for detecting solar neutrinos. The SoLAr collaboration was formed to explore argon detectors with pixelated light and charge readout, aiming for high detection efficiency and improved energy resolution. Building on the success of an initial prototype, we present results obtained with a second SoLAr prototype (V2), a $30 \times 30 \times 30$ cm$^{3}$ time projection chamber operated in a cryostat containing several hundred kilograms of liquid argon. We report measurements of cosmic-ray muons using both tracking and calorimetry from light and charge sensors, and we highlight the improved performance achieved through combined charge and light reconstruction. These results demonstrate the promise of dual-readout detectors and motivate future prototyping efforts toward kiloton-scale facilities.</description>

      <title>Enabling searches for long-lived particles at a future 10 TeV Muon Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Muon Colliders offer fantastic opportunities to explore new phenomena at the energy frontier. However, beam-induced-backgrounds from muon decays pose significant challenges for detector design, readout, and reconstruction. Previous detector studies have employed stringent hit-timing requirements to reduce occupancy to manageable levels with negligible efficiency loss for prompt Standard Model particles. In the spirit of maximizing discovery potential, we investigate the capability of detecting meta-stable charged long-lived particles at a 10 TeV Muon Collider. As a benchmark, we consider a Gauge Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking (GMSB) model in which the stau is long-lived and can be identified as a high momentum, slowly moving track. We find that nominal hit-timing selections are too restrictive, and investigate the impact of looser requirements. We demonstrate that it is possible to recover sensitivity to particles with masses close to $\sqrt{s}/2$ by expanding time acceptance, and provide recommendations to further improve tracker design and track reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Solid-state Laser Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the first proof-of-concept demonstrations of photoluminescence-based optical refrigeration, solid-state laser cooling has developed into a credible competitor to conventional cryogenic technologies. Solid-state laser cooling continues to advance as new materials push cooling limits. These developments have created a need to consolidate progress made to date as well as standardize critical experimental considerations needed for reliable and verifiable cooling measurements. This primer therefore outlines essential concepts and requirements, which underpin solid-state laser cooling. The primer summarizes key milestones achieved with cooling-grade, rare-earth-doped glasses and crystals as well as with semiconductors. It additionally highlights emerging applications of solid-state optical refrigeration. To strengthen the consistency and reproducibility of cooling results going forward, two reporting checklists are introduced. They cover materials, cooling metrics, and thermometry. This primer is intended to serve as both a tutorial and a practical reference for incoming and existing researchers involved in solid-state laser-cooling.</description>

      <title>Modeling Light Signals Using Data from the First Pulsed Neutron Source Program at the DUNE Vertical Drift ColdBox Test Facility at CERN Neutrino Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a first quantitative test of detected light signals produced in a pulsed neutron source run in a small vertical drift LArTPC at the CERN neutrino platform ColdBox test facility. The ColdBox cryostat, detectors, neutron sources, and particle interactions are modeled and simulated using Fluka. A good agreement is found in the detected number of photoelectrons, with values below 650 photoelectrons in both data and simulation, for all four X-ARAPUCA photodetectors on the cathode in the LArTPC. A time constant is also fitted from the neutron-beam-off light signal spectrum and found consistent between data and MC. Several important systematic effects are discussed and serve as guides for future runs at larger LArTPCs.</description>

      <title>A telecommunications system based on axion dark matter coherent transmission</title>

Abstract: In this manuscript we anticipate axion detection in order to theorize on a novel telecommunications system based on the coherent axion-two-photon vertex Primakoff effect conversion and reversion of microwave photons transmitting a modulated signal. We suggest a possible set-up for an experiment or industrial application using state-of-the-art technology and we estimate the output power and photon rate expected to be received as a function of the axion-photon coupling constant $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$. We find that, although challenging,this system has no physical restriction to render it unfeasible. Finally, we summarize the advantages and disadvantages of a hypothetical axion-based telecommunications system compared to traditional telecommunication systems. We then extend the discussion, noting the more important conclusions.</description>

      <title>Optimization of 3D diamond detectors with graphitized electrodes based on an innovative numerical simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future experiments at hadron colliders require an evolution of the tracking sensors to ensure sufficient radiation hardness as well as space and time resolution to handle unprecedented particle fluxes. 3D diamond sensors with laser-graphitized electrodes are promising candidates due to their strong binding energy, small atomic number, and high carrier mobility. However, the high resistance of the engraved electrodes delays the propagation of the induced signals towards the readout electronics, thereby degrading the precision of the timing measurements. So far, this effect has been the dominant factor limiting the time resolution of these devices, with other contributions, such as those due to electric field inhomogeneities or electronic noise, typically neglected. Recent advancements in graphitization technology, however, motivate a renewed effort in modeling signal generation in 3D diamond detectors, to achieve more reliable predictions. To this purpose, we apply an extended version of the Ramo-Shockley theorem, describing the effect of signal propagation as a time-dependent weighting potential, obtained by numerically solving the Maxwell's equations in a quasi-static approximation. We developed a custom spectral method solver and validated it against COMSOL MultiPhysics. The response of the modeled sensor to a beam of particles is then simulated using Garfield++ and is compared to the data acquired in a beam test carried on in 2021 by the TimeSPOT Collaboration at the SPS, at CERN. Based on the results obtained with this simulation workflow, we conclude that reducing the resistivity of the graphitic columns remains the priority for significantly improving the time resolution of 3D diamond detectors. Once achieved, optimization of the detector geometry and readout electronics design will become equally important steps to further enhance the timing performance of these devices.</description>

      <title>Simulation of MAPS and a MAPS-based Inner Tracker for the Super Tau-Charm Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) are a promising detector candidate for the inner tracker of the Super Tau-Charm Facility (STCF). To evaluate the performance of MAPS and the MAPS-based inner tracker, a dedicated simulation workflow has been developed, offering essential insights for detector design and optimization.
  The intrinsic characteristics of MAPS, designed using several fabrication processes and pixel geometries, were investigated through a combination of Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) and Monte Carlo simulations. Simulations were conducted with both minimum ionizing particles and $^{55}$Fe X-rays to assess critical parameters such as detection efficiency, cluster size, spatial resolution, and charge collection efficiency. Based on these evaluations, a MAPS sensor featuring a strip-like pixel and a high-resistivity epitaxial layer is selected as the baseline sensor design for the STCF inner tracker due to its excellent performance.
  Using this optimized MAPS design, a three-layer MAPS-based inner tracker was modeled and simulated. The simulation demonstrated an average detection efficiency exceeding 99%, spatial resolutions of 44.8$\rm{\mu m}$ in the $z$ direction and 8.2$\rm{\mu m}$ in the $r-\phi$ direction, and an intrinsic sensor time resolution of 5.9ns for 1GeV/c $\mu^-$ particles originating from the interaction point. These promising results suggest that the MAPS-based inner tracker fulfills the performance requirements of the STCF experiment.</description>

      <title>Progress on the ALETHEIA project and a new approach to mitigate events overlap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ALETHEIA project aims to search for low-mass dark matter using liquid helium (LHe)-filled time projection chambers (TPCs). While liquid argon and liquid xenon TPCs have been extensively employed in the field of direct dark matter detection, successful development of LHe TPCs has not yet been achieved. Launched in 2020, our project has made significant progress since then. These advancements have convinced us that a single-phase LHe TPC is technologically feasible. Compared to liquid xenon and liquid argon TPCs, one of the unique challenges for LHe TPCs is event overlap caused by the 13-second lifetime scintillation. We will demonstrate that this overlap can be entirely mitigated when the LHe temperature is maintained near 1.0 K. At this temperature, electron mobility is three orders of magnitude higher than at approximately 4.0 K, which is the temperature we initially proposed for the LHe TPC.</description>

      <title>Design and Performance Simulation of the Electromagnetic Calorimeter at EicC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) is a key detector component for precise electron and photon measurements in electron-ion collision experiments. At the Electron-Ion Collider in China (EicC), high-performance calorimetry is essential for exploring the internal structure of nucleons and studying the dynamics of quarks and gluons within quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This paper presents the optimized design and performance simulation of the EicC ECAL system. The ECAL consists of three specialized sections tailored to distinct detection environments: (1) an electron-Endcap employing high-resolution pure Cesium Iodide (pCsI) crystals, (2) a central barrel, and (3) an ion-Endcap, both adopting a cost-effective Shashlik-style sampling calorimeter with improved light yield. Each segment's geometry and material composition have been systematically optimized through Geant4 simulations to achieve excellent energy and position resolutions as well as strong electron-pion discrimination. The simulated performance indicates that the ECAL can achieve energy resolutions of 2 percent divided by sqrt(E) for pCsI crystals and 5 percent divided by sqrt(E) for Shashlik modules, meeting the design goals of the EicC detector.</description>

      <title>Demonstration and frequency noise characterization of a 17 $\mu$m quantum cascade laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16460v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the spectral performance of a novel continuous-wave room-temperature distributed feedback quantum cascade laser operating at the long wavelength of 17 $\mu$m. By demonstrating broadband laser absorption spectroscopy of the $\nu$2 fundamental vibrational mode of N2O molecules, we have determined the spectral range and established the spectroscopic potential of this laser. We have characterized the frequency noise and measured the line width of this new device, uncovering a discrepancy with the current consensus on the theoretical modeling of quantum cascade lasers. Our results confirm the potential of such novel narrow-line-width sources for vibrational spectroscopy. Extending laser spectroscopy to longer wavelength is a fascinating prospect that paves the way for a wide range of opportunities from chemical detection, to frequency metrology as well as for exploring light-matter interaction with an extended variety of molecules, from ultra-cold diatomic species to increasingly complex molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Efficient Radon Removal by Silver-Zeolite in a Dark Matter Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the performance of an efficient radon trap using silver-zeolite Ag-ETS-10, measured with a spherical proportional counter filled with an argon/methane mixture. Our study compares the radon reduction capabilities of silver-zeolite and the widely used activated charcoal, both at room temperature. We demonstrate that silver-zeolite significantly outperforms activated charcoal by three orders of magnitude in radon capture. Given that radon is a major background contaminant in rare event searches, our findings highlight silver-zeolite as a highly promising adsorbent, offering compelling operational advantages for both current and future dark matter and neutrino physics experiments. Furthermore, this not only offers great promise for developing future radon reduction systems in underground laboratories, but also paves the way for innovative, multidisciplinary advancements with far-reaching implications in science, engineering and environmental health.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Muon-induced Backgrounds for the Colorado Underground Research Institute (CURIE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation of muon-induced backgrounds for the Colorado Underground Research Institute (CURIE), a shallow-underground facility with $\approx 415$~m.w.e. overburden. Using coupled \textsc{mute} and \textsc{geant4} frameworks, we characterize the production and transport of muon-induced secondaries through site-specific rock compositions and geometries, establishing a proof-of-concept for high-precision, end-to-end simulations. Our simulations employ angular-dependent muon energy distributions, which improve secondary flux accuracy. For the Subatomic Particle Hideout and Cryolab I research spaces, we predict total muon-induced neutron fluxes of $(8.52 \pm 1.30_{\text{sys}}) \times 10^{-3}$~m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and $(8.86 \pm 1.62_{\text{sys}}) \times 10^{-3}$~m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, respectively. Additionally, we develop a Depth-Intensity Relation (DIR) to predict the muon-induced neutron flux as a function of facility depth, which is consistent with measurements across a broad range of underground depths. These results provide quantitative background predictions for experimental design and sensitivity projections at shallow- and deep-underground facilities. They further demonstrate that local geology and overburden geometry influence muon-induced secondary yields and energy spectra, emphasizing the need for site-specific simulations for accurate underground background characterization. Therefore, the simulation framework has been made publicly available at \href{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17196581}{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17196581}, for the broader low-background physics community to enable meaningful inter-facility comparisons.</description>
