      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy from Lattice Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behavior of the vacuum in Euclidean dynamical triangulations (EDT). Algorithmic improvements and better lattice spacing determinations allow us to test the properties of the emergent de Sitter geometries of our simulations to higher precision than previously possible. Although the agreement with de Sitter is good, the improved precision reveals deviations that can be interpreted as non-trivial vacuum dynamics, well-described by a cosmological constant that runs with scale. The simulations show that the dominant running is quadratic and that the scale can be identified with the Hubble rate. Several key cross-checks support this picture, including consistent results across multiple lattice spacings and the fact that covariant energy conservation is maintained. The parameters of the running are fully determined by simulations, enabling predictions when extrapolated to the scales relevant for our universe. This leads to a model for dark energy that is compatible with current observations, but which predicts deviations from $\Lambda$CDM at the ${\cal O}(10^{-3})$ level in cosmological observables that could be tested with future improvements in precision measurements.</description>

      <title>Coulomb confinement in the Hamiltonian limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gribov--Zwanziger scenario attributes the phenomenon of confinement to the instantaneous interaction term in the QCD Hamiltonian in the Coulomb gauge. For a static quark-antiquark pair, it leads to a potential energy that increases linearly with the distance between them. Lattice studies of the SU(2) Yang--Mills theory determined the corresponding (Coulomb) string tension for sources in the fundamental representation, $\sigma_{C}$, to be about three times larger than the Wilson loop string tension, $\sigma_F$. It is far above the Zwanziger variational bound, $\sigma_C \geq \sigma_F$. We argue that the value established in the literature is artificially inflated. We examine the lattice definition of the instantaneous potential, find the source of the string tension's enhancement, and perform its improved determination in SU(2) lattice gauge theory. We report our conservative estimate for the value of the Coulomb string tension as $\sigma_C/\sigma_F = 2.0 \pm 0.4$ and discuss its phenomenological implications.</description>

      <title>Floquet prethermalization of ${\bf Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory on superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating nonequilibirum dynamics of a quantum many-body system is one of the promising applications of quantum computing. We simulate the time evolution of one-dimensional ${\bf Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory on IBM's superconducting 156-qubit device ibm\_fez. We consider the Floquet circuit made of the Trotter decomposition of Hamiltonian evolution and focus on its dynamics toward thermalization. Quantum simulation with the help of error mitigation is successful in running the Floquet circuit made of $38$ and $116$ qubits up to $10$ Trotter steps in the best case. This is enough to reach the early stage of prethermalization. Our work would be a benchmark for the potential power of quantum computing for high-energy physics problems.</description>

      <title>Double pole structures of $X_1(2900)$ as the $P$-wave $\bar{D}^*K^*$ resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reveal the double pole structures of the manifestly exotic tetraquark state $X_1(2900)$ in the scenario of $P$-wave $\bar{D}^*K^*$ dimeson resonance. We find that the observed enhancement signal associated with $X_1(2900)$ in $B^+ \to D^+D^-K^+$ by LHCb contains two $P$-wave poles denoted as $T_{cs1-}(2900)$ and $T^{\prime}_{cs1-}(2900)$, respectively. After considering the channel couplings among the $\bar{D}K$, $\bar{D}^*K$, $\bar{D}K^*$ and $\bar{D}^*K^*$ and the width of the $K^*$ meson, the masses and widths of the $S$-wave pole $T_{cs0+}(2900)$ and two $P$-wave poles $T_{cs1-}(2900)$ and $T^{\prime}_{cs1-}(2900)$ coincide with those of the $X_0(2900)$ and $X_1(2900)$ remarkably, which provides strong support for identifying $X_0(2900)$ and $X_1(2900)$ as $\bar{D}^{(*)}K^{(*)}$ dimeson states. Furthermore, we extensively calculate all $S$-wave and $P$-wave $\bar{D}^{(*)}K^{(*)}$ systems up to $J=3$ and predict four new isoscalar charmed-strange dimeson-type tetraquark states: an $S$-wave state $T_{cs1+}(2900)$ with quantum number $J^P=1^+$, three $P$-wave states $T_{cs1-}(2760)$ with $J^P=1^-$, $T_{cs0-}(2760)$ with $J^P=0^-$ and $T_{cs2-}(2900)$ with $J^P=2^-$. These near-threshold poles can be searched for at LHCb, Belle II and BESIII.</description>

      <title>Effective range expansion with the left-hand cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The validity range of the time-honored effective range expansion can be very limited due to the presence of a left-hand cut close to the two-particle threshold. Such a left-hand cut arises in the two-particle interaction involving a light particle exchange with a mass small or slightly heavier than the mass difference of the two particles, a scenario encountered in a wide range of systems. This can hinder a precise extraction of low-energy scattering observables and resonance poles. To address this issue, we propose a new parameterization for the low-energy scattering amplitude that accounts for the left-hand cut. The parameterization is like a Pad\'e approximation but with nonanalytic terms from the left-hand cut and can be regarded as an extension of the effective range expansion. It is ready to be applied to a broad class of scatterings and, in particular, should be invaluable in understanding various near-threshold hadron resonances. As byproducts, we also show that the parameterization can be used to extract the couplings of the exchanged particle to the scattering particles, and derive expressions for amplitude zeros caused by the interplay between the short- and long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Chiral Symmetry and Large Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large magnetic fields exist in magnetars and are produced in off-central heavy-ion collisions. For the latter, field strengths are estimated to be comparable to strong interaction scales. This fact has motivated many studies of QCD physics in large magnetic fields, ranging from various model studies to lattice QCD computations. We provide a selective overview of results stemming from chiral perturbation theory. These results are based solely on the pattern of spontaneous and explicit symmetry breaking of QCD in a magnetic field; accordingly, they constitute low-energy theorems that must be satisfied in any approach. A few discrepancies with models and tension with lattice data are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative phase boundaries in the Gross-Neveu model from a stability analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two out of three phase boundaries of the 1+1 dimensional Gross-Neveu model in the chiral limit can be obtained from a standard, perturbative stability analysis of the homogeneous phases. The third one separating the massive homogeneous phase from the kink crystal is non-perturbative and could so far only be inferred from the full solution of the model. We show that this phase boundary can also be obtained via a modified stability analysis, based on the thermodynamic potential of a single kink or baryon. The same method works for the massive Gross-Neveu model, so that all phase boundaries of the Gross-Neveu model could have been predicted quantitatively without prior knowledge of the full crystal solution.</description>

      <title>Systematic Improvement of $x$-dependent Unpolarized Nucleon Generalized Parton Distribution in Lattice-QCD Calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a first study of the effects of renormalization-group resummation (RGR) and leading-renormalon resummation (LRR) on the systematic errors of the unpolarized isovector nucleon generalized parton distribution in the framework of large-momentum effective theory (LaMET). This work is done using lattice gauge ensembles generated by the MILC collaboration, consisting of 2+1+1 flavors of highly improved staggered quarks with a physical pion mass at lattice spacing $a\approx 0.09$ fm and a box width $L\approx 5.76$ fm. We present results for the nucleon $H$ and $E$ GPDs with average boost momentum $P_z\approx 2$ GeV at momentum transfers $Q^2=[0, 0.97]$ GeV$^2$ at skewness $\xi=0$ as well as $Q^2\in 0.23$ GeV$^2$ at $\xi=0.1$, renormalized in the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme at scale $\mu=2.0$ GeV, with two- and one-loop matching, respectively. We demonstrate that the simultaneous application of RGR and LRR significantly reduces the systematic errors in renormalized matrix elements and distributions for both the zero and nonzero skewness GPDs, and that it is necessary to include both RGR and LRR at higher orders in the matching and renormalization processes.</description>

      <title>Digital quantum simulation of a (1+1)D SU(2) lattice gauge theory with ion qudits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum simulation strategy for a (1+1)D SU(2) non-abelian lattice gauge theory with dynamical matter, a hardcore-gluon Hamiltonian Yang-Mills, tailored to a six-level trapped-ion qudit quantum processor, as recently experimentally realized. We employ a qudit encoding fulfilling gauge invariance, an SU(2) Gauss law. We discuss the experimental feasibility of generalized M\"olmer-S\"orensen gates used to efficiently simulate the dynamics. We illustrate how a shallow circuit with these resources is sufficient to implement scalable digital quantum simulation of the model. We also numerically show that this model, albeit simple, can dynamically manifest physically-relevant properties specific to non-abelian field theories, such as baryon excitations.</description>
