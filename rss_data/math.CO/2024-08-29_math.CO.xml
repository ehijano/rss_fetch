      <title>A characterisation of graphs quasi-isometric to $K_4$-minor-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that there is a function $f$ such that every graph with no $K$-fat $K_4$ minor is $f(K)$-quasi-isometric to a graph with no $K_4$ minor. This solves the $K_4$-case of a general conjecture of Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu. Our proof technique also yields a new short proof of the respective $K_4^-$-case, which was first established by Fujiwara and Papasoglu.</description>

      <title>Avoiding abelian and additive powers in rich words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the avoidability of abelian and additive powers in infinite rich words. In particular, we construct an infinite additive $5$-power-free rich word over $\{0,1\}$ and an infinite additive $4$-power-free rich word over $\{0, 1, 2\}$. The alphabet sizes are as small as possible in both cases, even for abelian powers.</description>

      <title>Maximum spectral gaps of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spread of a graph $G$ is the difference $\lambda_1 - \lambda_n$ between the largest and smallest eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix. Breen, Riasanovsky, Tait and Urschel recently determined the graph on $n$ vertices with maximum spread for sufficiently large $n$. In this paper, we study a related question of maximizing the difference $\lambda_{i+1} - \lambda_{n-j}$ for a given pair $(i, j)$ over all graphs on $n$ vertices. We give upper bounds for all pairs $(i, j)$, exhibit an infinite family of pairs where the bound is tight, and show that for the pair $(1, 0)$ the extremal example is unique. These results contribute to a line of inquiry pioneered by Nikiforov aiming to maximize different linear combinations of eigenvalues over all graphs on $n$ vertices.</description>

      <title>A strong structural stability of $C_{2k+1}$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: F\"uredi and Gunderson showed that $ex(n, C_{2k+1})$ is achieved only on $K_{\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor, \lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil}$ if $n\ge 4k-2$. It is natural to study how far a $ C_{2k+1}$-free graph is from being bipartite.Let $T^*(r, n)$ be obtained by adding a suspension $K_{r}$ with $1$ suspension point to $K_{\lfloor\frac{n-r+1}{2}\rfloor, \lceil\frac{n-r+1}{2}\rceil}$. We show that for integers $r, k$ with $3\le r\le 2k-4$ and $n\ge 20(r+2)^2k$, if $G$ is a $C_{2k+1}$-free $n$-vertex graph with $e(G)\ge e(T^*(r, n))$, then $G$ is obtained by adding suspensions to a bipartite graph one by one and the total number of vertices in all suspensions minus intersection points is no more than $r-1$. In other words, $G=B\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^p G_i$, where $B$ is a bipartite graph, $G_1$ is a suspension to $B$, $G_j$ is a suspension to $B\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{j-1} G_i$ for $2\le j\le p$ and $\sum\limits_{i=1}^p \vert V(G_i)-V(G_i)\cap V(B\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{j-1} G_i) \vert\le r-1$. Furthermore, $\sum\limits_{i=1}^p \vert V(G_i)-V(G_i)\cap V(B\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{j-1} G_i) \vert= r-1$ if and only if $G=T^*(r, n)$. Let $d_2(G)=\min\{|T|: T\subseteq V(G), G-T \ \text{is bipartite}\}$ and $\gamma_2(G)=\min\{|E|: E\subseteq E(G), G-E \ \text{is bipartite}\}$. Our structural stability result implies that $d_2(G)\le r-1$ and $\gamma_2(G)\le {\lceil\frac{r}{2}\rceil \choose 2}+{\lfloor\frac{r}{2}\rfloor \choose 2}$ under the same condition, which is a recent result of Ren-Wang-Wang-Yang [SIAM J. Discrete Math. 38 (2024)]. They proved $d_2(G)\le r-1$ and $\gamma_2(G)\le {\lceil\frac{r}{2}\rceil \choose 2}+{\lfloor\frac{r}{2}\rfloor \choose 2}$ separately. We introduce a new concept strong-$2k$-core which is the key that we can give a stronger structural stability result but a simpler proof.</description>

      <title>Analytic properties of Speyer's $g$-polynomial of uniform matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $U_{n,d}$ denote the uniform matroid of rank $d$ on $n$ elements. We obtain some recurrence relations satisfied by Speyer's $g$-polynomials $g_{U_{n,d}}(t)$ of $U_{n,d}$. Based on these recurrence relations, we prove that the polynomial $g_{U_{n,d}}(t)$ has only real zeros for any $n-1\geq d\geq 1$. Furthermore, we show that the coefficient of $g_{U_{n,[n/2]}}(t)$ is asymptotically normal by local and central limit theorems.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Equimatchable Even-Regular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is called equimatchable if all of its maximal matchings have the same size. Due to Eiben and Kotrbcik, any connected graph with odd order and independence number $\alpha(G)$ at most $2$ is equimatchable. Akbari et al. showed that for any odd number $r$, a connected equimatchable $r$-regular graph must be either the complete graph $K_{r+1}$ or the complete bipartite graph $K_{r,r}$. They also determined all connected equimatchable $4$-regular graphs and proved that for any even $r$, any connected equimatchable $r$-regular graph is either $K_{r,r}$ or factor-critical. In this paper, we confirm that for any even $r\ge 6$, there exists a unique connected equimatchable $r$-regular graph $G$ with $\alpha(G)\geq 3$ and odd order.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial invariants of finite metric spaces and the Wasserstein arrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2010, Vershik proposed a new combinatorial invariant of metric spaces given by a class of polytopes that arise in the theory of optimal transport and are called ``Wasserstein polytopes'' or ``Kantorovich-Rubinstein polytopes'' in the literature. Answering a question posed by Vershik, we describe the stratification of the metric cone induced by the combinatorial type of these polytopes through a hyperplane arrangement. Moreover, we study its relationships with the stratification by combinatorial type of the injective hull (i.e., the tight span) and, in particular, with certain types of metrics arising in phylogenetic analysis. We also compute enumerative invariants in the case of metrics on up to six points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a sum rule for $r$-derangements (meaning that the elements are restricted to be in distinct cycles in the cycle decomposition) involving binomial coefficients. The identity, obtained using the Cauchy product of two exponential generating functions, generalizes a known relation for usual derangements.</description>

      <title>General position problems in strong and lexicographic products of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outer, dual, and total general position sets are studied on strong and lexicographic products of graphs. Sharp lower and upper bounds are proved for the outer and the dual general position number of strong products and several exact values are obtained. For the lexicographic product, the outer general position number is determined in all the cases, and the dual general position number in many cases. The total general position number is determined for both products. Along the way some results on outer general position sets are also derived.</description>

      <title>What makes math problems hard for reinforcement learning: a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a long-standing conjecture from combinatorial group theory, we explore, from multiple angles, the challenges of finding rare instances carrying disproportionately high rewards. Based on lessons learned in the mathematical context defined by the Andrews-Curtis conjecture, we propose algorithmic improvements that can be relevant in other domains with ultra-sparse reward problems. Although our case study can be formulated as a game, its shortest winning sequences are potentially $10^6$ or $10^9$ times longer than those encountered in chess. In the process of our study, we demonstrate that one of the potential counterexamples due to Akbulut and Kirby, whose status escaped direct mathematical methods for 39 years, is stably AC-trivial.</description>

      <title>New Results on Periodic Golay Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide algorithmic methods for conducting exhaustive searches for periodic Golay pairs. Our methods enumerate several lengths beyond the currently known state-of-the-art available searches: we conducted exhaustive searches for periodic Golay pairs of all lengths $v \leq 72$ using our methods, while only lengths $v \leq 34$ had previously been exhaustively enumerated. Our methods are applicable to periodic complementary sequences in general. We utilize sequence compression, a method of sequence generation derived in 2013 by Djokovi\'c and Kotsireas. We also introduce and implement a new method of "multi-level" compression, where sequences are uncompressed in several steps. This method allowed us to exhaustively search all lengths $v \leq 72$ using less than 10 CPU years. For cases of complementary sequences where uncompression is not possible, we introduce some new methods of sequence generation inspired by the isomorph-free exhaustive generation algorithm of orderly generation. Finally, we pose a conjecture regarding the structure of periodic Golay pairs and prove it holds in many lengths, including all lengths $v \lt 100$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A triangle presentation is a combinatorial datum that encodes the action of a group on a $2$-dimensional triangle complex with prescribed links, which is simply transitive on the vertices. We provide the first infinite family of triangle presentations that give rise to lattices in exotic buildings of type $\widetilde{\text{A}_2}$ of arbitrarily large order. Our method also gives rise to infinite families of triangle presentations for other link types, such as opposition complexes in Desarguesian projective planes.</description>

      <title>Tree-tubings and the combinatorics of resurgent Dyson-Schwinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a novel combinatorial interpretation to the perturbative series solutions for a class of Dyson-Schwinger equations. We show how binary tubings of rooted trees with labels from an alphabet on the tubes, and where the labels satisfy certain compatibility constraints, can be used to give series solutions to Dyson-Schwinger equations with a single Mellin transform which is the reciprocal of a polynomial with rational roots, in a fully combinatorial way. Further, the structure of these tubings leads directly to systems of differential equations for the anomalous dimension that are ideally suited for resurgent analysis. We give a general result in the distinct root case, and investigate the effect of repeated roots, which drastically changes the asymptotics and the transseries structure.</description>

      <title>Explicit Folded Reed-Solomon and Multiplicity Codes Achieve Relaxed Generalized Singleton Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that any `appropriate' folded Reed-Solomon and univariate multiplicity codes achieve relaxed generalized Singleton bound for list size $L\ge1.$ More concretely, we show the following: (1) Any $(s,\gamma)$-folded RS code over the alphabet $\mathbb{F}_q^s$ of block length $n$ and rate $R$ with pair-wise distinct evaluation points $\{\gamma^i\alpha_j\}_{(i,j)\in\left(\{0\}\sqcup[s-1],[n]\right)}\subset\mathbb{F}_q$ are $\left(\frac{L}{L+1}\left(1-\frac{sR}{s-L+1}\right),L\right)$ (average-radius) list-decodable for list size $L\in[s]$. (2) Any $s$-order univariate multiplicity code over the alphabet $\mathbb{F}_p^s$ ($p$ is a prime) of block length $n$ and rate $R$ with pair-wise distinct evaluation points $\{\alpha_i\}_{i\in[n]}\subset\mathbb{F}_p$ are $\left(\frac{L}{L+1}\left(1-\frac{sR}{s-L+1}\right),L\right)$ (average-radius) list-decodable for list size $L\in[s]$.
  Choose $s=\Theta(1/\epsilon^2)$ and $L=O(1/\epsilon)$, our results imply that both explicit folded RS codes and explicit univariate multiplicity codes achieve list decoding capacity $1-R-\epsilon$ with evidently optimal list size $O(1/\epsilon)$, which exponentially improves the previous state-of-the-art $(1/\epsilon)^{O(1/\epsilon)}$ established by Kopparty, Ron-Zewi, Saraf, and Wootters (FOCS 2018 or SICOMP, 2023) and Tamo (IEEE TIT, 2024). In particular, our results on folded Reed--Solomon codes fully resolve a long-standing open problem originally proposed by Guruswami and Rudra (STOC 2006 or IEEE TIT, 2008). Furthermore, our results imply the first explicit constructions of $(1-R-\epsilon,O(1/\epsilon))$ (average-radius) list-decodable codes of rate $R$ with polynomial-sized alphabets in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1811.12344v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize Schwenk's result that almost all trees contain any given limb to trees with positive integer vertex weights. The concept of characteristic polynomial is extended to such weighted trees and we prove that the proportion of $n$-vertex weighted trees that is weighted cospectral to another $n$-vertex weighted tree approaches $1$ as $n$ approaches infinity. We also prove that, for any integer $k\ge 2$, the proportion of $n$-vertex trees containing $k$ non-similar cospectral vertices approaches $1$ as $n$ approaches infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15633v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph burning is a discrete-time process that models the spread of influence in a network. Vertices are either burning or unburned, and in each round, a burning vertex causes all of its neighbours to become burning before a new fire source is chosen to become burning. We introduce a variation of this process that incorporates an adversarial game played on a nested, growing sequence of graphs. Two players, Arsonist and Builder, play in turns: Builder adds a certain number of new unburned vertices and edges incident to these to create a larger graph, then every vertex neighbouring a burning vertex becomes burning, and finally Arsonist `burns' a new fire source. This process repeats forever. Arsonist is said to win if the limiting fraction of burning vertices tends to 1, while Builder is said to win if this fraction is bounded away from 1.
  The central question of this paper is determining if, given that Builder adds $f(n)$ vertices at turn $n$, either Arsonist or Builder has a winning strategy. In the case that $f(n)$ is asymptotically polynomial, we give threshold results for which player has a winning strategy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00357v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Via the contour integral method, we establish a reduction formula from a double series to a single series with parameters, which not only implies Uncu and Zudilin's two results and Cao and Wang's two results, but also is related to Berkovich and Warnaar's equation. Similarly, we also discover some triple-sum generalizations of Cao and Wang's formulas. As conclusions, several multidimensional Rogers--Ramanujan type identities with parameters or without parameters are given.</description>

      <title>Induced subgraphs and tree decompositions IX. Grid theorem for perforated graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated Erd\H{o}s-P\'{o}sa Theorem, in one formulation, asserts that for every $c\geq 1$, graphs with no subgraph (or equivalently, minor) isomorphic to the disjoint union of $c$ cycles have bounded treewidth. What can we say about the treewidth of graphs containing no induced subgraph isomorphic to the disjoint union of $c$ cycles?
  Let us call these graphs $c$-perforated. While $1$-perforated graphs have treewidth one, complete graphs and complete bipartite graphs are examples of $2$-perforated graphs with arbitrarily large treewidth. But there are sparse examples, too: Bonamy, Bonnet, D\'{e}pr\'{e}s, Esperet, Geniet, Hilaire, Thomass\'{e} and Wesolek constructed $2$-perforated graphs with arbitrarily large treewidth and no induced subgraph isomorphic to $K_3$ or $K_{3,3}$; we call these graphs occultations. Indeed, it turns out that a mild (and inevitable) adjustment of occultations provides examples of $2$-perforated graphs with arbitrarily large treewidth and arbitrarily large girth, which we refer to as full occultations.
  Our main result shows that the converse also holds: for every $c\geq 1$, a $c$-perforated graph has large treewidth if and only if it contains, as an induced subgraph, either a large complete graph, or a large complete bipartite graph, or a large full occultation. This distinguishes $c$-perforated graphs, among graph classes purely defined by forbidden induced subgraphs, as the first to admit a grid-type theorem incorporating obstructions other than subdivided walls and their line graphs.
  More generally, for all $c,o\geq 1$, we establish a full characterization of induced subgraph obstructions to bounded treewidth in graphs containing no induced subgraph isomorphic to the disjoint union of $c$ cycles, each of length at least $o+2$.</description>

      <title>On the $nk-attack Roman Dominating Number of a Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, the dominating number of a graph is the minimum size of a vertex set, $V' \subseteq V$, so that every vertex in the graph is either in $V'$ or is adjacent to a vertex in $V'$. A Roman Dominating function of $G$ is defined as $f:V \rightarrow \{0,1,2\}$ such that every vertex with a label of 0 in $G$ is adjacent to a vertex with a label of 2. The Roman Dominating number of a graph is the minimum total weight over all possible Roman Dominating functions. We consider the $k$-attack Roman Domination, particularly focusing on 2-attack Roman Domination. A Roman Dominating function of $G$ is a $k$-attack Roman Dominating function of $G$ if for all $j\leq k$, any subset $S$ of $j$ vertices all with label 0 must have at least $j$ vertices with label 2 in the open neighborhood of $S$. The $k$-attack Roman Dominating number of $G, \gkaRD{G}$, is the minimum total weight over all possible $k$-attack Roman Dominating functions. We find $\gtaRD{G}$ for particular graph class, discuss properties of $k$-attack Roman Domination, and make several connections with other domination ideas.</description>

      <title>Towards Nash-Williams Orientation Conjecture for Infinite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10631v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1960 Nash-Williams proved that an edge-connectivity of 2k is sufficient for a finite graph to have a k-arc-connected orientation. He then conjectured that the same is true for infinite graphs. In 2016, Thomassen, using his own results on the auxiliary lifting graph, proved that 8k-edge-connected infinite graphs admit a $k$-arc connected orientation. Here we improve this result for the class of $1$-ended locally-finite graphs and show that an edge-connectivity of 4k is enough in that case. Crucial to this improvement are results presented in a separate paper, by the same author of this paper, on the key concept of the lifting graph, extending results by Ok, Richter, and Thomassen.</description>

      <title>Constructing disjoint Steiner trees in Sierpi\'{n}ski graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph and $S\subseteq V(G)$ with $|S|\geq 2$. Then the trees $T_1, T_2, \cdots, T_\ell$ in $G$ are \emph{internally disjoint Steiner trees} connecting $S$ (or $S$-Steiner trees) if $E(T_i) \cap E(T_j )=\emptyset$ and $V(T_i)\cap V(T_j)=S$ for every pair of distinct integers $i,j$, $1 \leq i, j \leq \ell$. Similarly, if we only have the condition $E(T_i) \cap E(T_j )=\emptyset$ but without the condition $V(T_i)\cap V(T_j)=S$, then they are \emph{edge-disjoint Steiner trees}. The \emph{generalized $k$-connectivity}, denoted by $\kappa_k(G)$, of a graph $G$, is defined as $\kappa_k(G)=\min\{\kappa_G(S)|S \subseteq V(G) \ \textrm{and} \ |S|=k \}$, where $\kappa_G(S)$ is the maximum number of internally disjoint $S$-Steiner trees. The \emph{generalized local edge-connectivity} $\lambda_{G}(S)$ is the maximum number of edge-disjoint Steiner trees connecting $S$ in $G$. The {\it generalized $k$-edge-connectivity} $\lambda_k(G)$ of $G$ is defined as $\lambda_k(G)=\min\{\lambda_{G}(S)\,|\,S\subseteq V(G) \ and \ |S|=k\}$. These measures are generalizations of the concepts of connectivity and edge-connectivity, and they and can be used as measures of vulnerability of networks. It is, in general, difficult to compute these generalized connectivities. However, there are precise results for some special classes of graphs. In this paper, we obtain the exact value of $\lambda_{k}(S(n,\ell))$ for $3\leq k\leq \ell^n$, and the exact value of $\kappa_{k}(S(n,\ell))$ for $3\leq k\leq \ell$, where $S(n, \ell)$ is the Sierpi\'{n}ski graphs with order $\ell^n$. As a direct consequence, these graphs provide additional interesting examples when $\lambda_{k}(S(n,\ell))=\kappa_{k}(S(n,\ell))$. We also study the some network properties of Sierpi\'{n}ski graphs.</description>

      <title>Every connected graph admits a local antimagic orientation and almost every graph admits an antimagic orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An undirected graph $G$ is said to admit an antimagic orientation if there exist an orientation $D$ and a bijection between $E(G)$ and $\{1,2,\ldots,|E(G)|\}$ such that any two vertices have distinct vertex sums, where the vertex sum of a vertex is the sum of the labels of the in-edges minus that of the out-edges incident to the vertex. It is conjectured by Hefetz, M\"{u}tze, and Schwartz that every connected graph admits an antimagic orientation. A weak version of this problem is to require the distinct vertex sums only for the adjacent vertices. In that case, we say the graph admits a local antimagic orientation. Chang, Jing, and Wang~\cite{CJW20} conjectured that every connected graph admits a local antimagic orientation. In this paper, we give an affirmative answer to the conjecture of Chang et al., and show that almost every graph satisfies the conjecture of Hefetz et al.</description>

      <title>Off-diagonally symmetric domino tilings of the Aztec diamond of odd order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09057v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the enumeration of off-diagonally symmetric domino tilings of odd-order Aztec diamonds in two directions: (1) with one boundary defect, and (2) with maximally-many zeroes on the diagonal. In the first direction, we prove a symmetry property which states that the numbers of off-diagonally symmetric domino tilings of the Aztec diamond of order $2n-1$ are equal when the boundary defect is at the $k$th position and the $(2n-k)$th position on the boundary, respectively. This symmetry property proves a special case of a recent conjecture by Behrend, Fischer, and Koutschan.
  In the second direction, a Pfaffian formula is obtained for the number of "nearly" off-diagonally symmetric domino tilings of odd-order Aztec diamonds, where the entries of the Pfaffian satisfy a simple recurrence relation. The numbers of domino tilings mentioned in the above two directions do not seem to have a simple product formula, but we show that these numbers satisfy simple matrix equations in which the entries of the matrix are given by Delannoy numbers. The proof of these results involves the method of non-intersecting lattice paths and a modification of Stembridge's Pfaffian formula for families of non-intersecting lattice paths. Finally, we propose conjectures concerning the log-concavity and asymptotic behavior of the number of off-diagonally symmetric domino tilings of odd-order Aztec diamonds.</description>

      <title>Knights are 24/13 times faster than the king</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On an infinite chess board, how much faster can the knight reach a square when compared to the king, in average? More generally, for coprime $b&gt;a \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$ such that $a+b$ is odd, define the $(a,b)$-knight and the king as
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
  \mathrm{N}_{a,b} = \{(a,b), (b,a), (-a,b), (-b,a), (-b,-a), (-a,-b), (a,-b), (b, -a)\},\newline
  \mathrm{K}=\{(1,0), (1,1), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (-1,-1), (0,-1), (1,-1)\} \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^2,
  \end{aligned}
  \end{equation*}
  respectively. One way to formulate this question is by asking for the average ratio, for $\mathbf{p}\in \mathbb{Z}^2$ in a box, between $\min\{h\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1} ~|~ \mathbf{p}\in h\mathrm{N}\}$ and $\min\{h\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1} ~|~ \mathbf{p}\in h\mathrm{K}\}$, where $hA = \{\mathbf{a}_1+\cdots+\mathbf{a}_h ~|~ \mathbf{a}_1,\ldots, \mathbf{a}_h \in A\}$ is the $h$-fold sumset of $A$. We show that this ratio equals $2(a+b)b^2/(a^2+3b^2)$.</description>

Abstract: The famous Sidorenko's conjecture asserts that for every bipartite graph $H$, the number of homomorphisms from $H$ to a graph $G$ with given edge density is minimized when $G$ is pseudorandom. We prove that for any graph $H$, a graph obtained from replacing edges of $H$ by generalized theta graphs consisting of even paths satisfies Sidorenko's conjecture, provided a certain divisibility condition on the number of paths. To achieve this, we prove unconditionally that bipartite graphs obtained from replacing each edge of a complete graph with a generalized theta graph satisfy Sidorenko's conjecture, which extends a result of Conlon, Kim, Lee and Lee [J. Lond. Math. Soc., 2018].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number with $p\equiv 2\pmod{3}$ and let $n\ge 1$ be a dimension. It is known that a sum-free subset of ${\mathbb F}_p^n$ can have at most the size $\frac13(p+1)p^{n-1}$ and that, up to automorphisms of ${\mathbb F}_p^n$, the only extremal example is the `cuboid' $\bigl[\frac{p+1}3, \frac{2p-1}3\bigr]\times {\mathbb F}_p^{n-1}$.
  For $p\ge 11$ we show that if a sum-free subset of ${\mathbb F}_p^n$ is not contained in such an extremal one, then its size is at most $\frac13(p-2)p^{n-1}$. This bound is optimal and we classify the extremal configurations. The remaining cases $p=2, 5$ are known to behave differently. For $p=3$ the analogous question was solved by Vsevolod Lev, and for $p\equiv 1\pmod{3}$ it is less interesting.</description>

      <title>Pushing Tree Decompositions Forward Along Graph Homomorphisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is folklore that tree-width is monotone under taking subgraphs (i.e. injective graph homomorphisms) and contractions (certain kinds of surjective graph homomorphisms). However, although tree-width is obviously not monotone under any surjective graph homomorphism, it is not clear whether contractions are canonically the only class of surjections with respect to which it is monotone. We prove that this is indeed the case: we show that - up to isomorphism - contractions are the only surjective graph homomorphisms that preserve tree decompositions and the shape of the decomposition tree. Furthermore, our results provide a framework for answering questions of this sort for many other kinds of combinatorial data structures (such as directed multigraphs, hypergraphs, Petri nets, circular port graphs, half-edge graphs, databases, simplicial complexes etc.) for which natural analogues of tree decompositions can be defined.</description>

      <title>The Reverse Littlewood--Offord problem of Erd\H{o}s</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\epsilon_{1},\ldots,\epsilon_{n}$ be a sequence of independent Rademacher random variables. We prove that there is a constant $c&gt;0$ such that for any unit vectors $v_1,\ldots,v_n\in \mathbb{R}^2$,
  $$\Pr\left[||\epsilon_1 v_1+\ldots+\epsilon_n v_n||_2 \leq \sqrt{2}\right]\geq \frac{c}{n}.$$
  This resolves the only remaining conjecture from the seminal paper of Erd\H{o}s on the Littlewood--Offord problem, and it is sharp both in the sense that the constant $\sqrt{2}$ cannot be reduced and that the magnitude $n^{-1}$ is best possible. We also prove polynomial bounds for the analogous problem in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>A strange five vertex model and multispecies ASEP on a ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of constructing the stationary states of the multispecies asymmetric simple exclusion process on a one-dimensional periodic lattice. Central to our approach is a quantum oscillator weighted five vertex model which features a strange weight conservation distinct from the conventional one. Our results clarify the interrelations among several known results and refine their derivations. For instance, the stationary probability derived from the multiline queue construction by Martin (2020) and Corteel--Mandelshtam--Williams (2022) is identified with the partition function of a three-dimensional system. The matrix product operators by Prolhac--Evans--Mallick (2009) acquire a natural diagrammatic interpretation as corner transfer matrices (CTM). The origin of their recursive tensor structure, as questioned by Aggarwal--Nicoletti--Petrov (2023), is revealed through the CTM diagrams. Finally, the derivation of the Zamolodchikov--Faddeev algebra by Cantini--de Gier--Wheeler (2015) is made intrinsic by elucidating its precise connection to a solution to the Yang--Baxter equation originating from quantum group representations.</description>
