      <title>Fully heavy tetraquark resonant states with different flavors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the quark potential model to calculate the mass spectrum of the S-wave fully heavy tetraquark systems with different flavors, including the $ bc\bar b\bar c, bb\bar c\bar c, cc\bar c\bar b $ and $ bb\bar b\bar c $ systems. We employ the Gaussian expansion method to solve the four-body Schr\"odinger equation, and the complex scaling method to identify resonant states. The $ bc\bar b\bar c, bb\bar c\bar c, cc\bar c\bar b $ and $ bb\bar b\bar c $ resonant states are obtained in the mass regions of $ (13.2,13.5) $, $ (13.3,13.6) $, $ (10.0,10.3) $, $ (16.5,16.7) $ GeV, respectively. Among these states, the $ bc\bar b\bar c $ tetraquark states are the most promising ones to be discovered in the near future. We recommend the experimental exploration of the $ 1^{++} $ and $ 2^{++} $ $ bc\bar b\bar c $ states with masses near $ 13.3 $ GeV in the $ J/\psi\Upsilon $ channel. From the root-mean-square radii, we find that all the resonant states we have identified are compact tetraquark states.</description>

      <title>Fractionally Charged Particles at the Energy Frontier: The SM Gauge Group and One-Form Global Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observed Standard Model is consistent with the existence of vector-like species with electric charge a multiple of $e/6$. The discovery of a fractionally charged particle would provide nonperturbative information about Standard Model physics, and furthermore rule out some or all of the minimal theories of unification. We discuss the phenomenology of such particles and focus particularly on current LHC constraints, for which we reinterpret various searches to bound a variety of fractionally charged representations. We emphasize that in some circumstances the collider bounds are surprisingly low or nonexistent, which highlights the discovery potential for these species which have distinctive signatures and important implications. We additionally offer pedagogical discussions of the representation theory of gauge groups with different global structures, and separately of the modern framework of Generalized Global Symmetries, either of which serves to underscore the bottom-up importance of these searches.</description>

      <title>Constraining gravitational-wave backgrounds from conversions into photons in the Galactic magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-frequency gravitational waves ($f \gtrsim 1$ MHz) may provide a unique signature for the existence of exotic physics. The lack of current and future gravitational-wave experiments sensitive at those frequencies leads to the need of employing different indirect techniques. Notably, one of the most promising one is constituted by graviton-photon conversions in magnetic fields. In this work, we focus on conversions of a gravitational-wave background into photons inside the Milky-Way magnetic field, taking into account the state-of-the-art models for both regular and turbulent components. We discuss how graviton-to-photon conversions may lead to imprints in the cosmic photon background spectrum in the range of frequencies $f\sim10^{9}-10^{26}\,$Hz, where the observed photon flux is widely explained by astrophysics emission models. Hence, the absence of any significant evidence for a diffuse photon flux induced by graviton-photon conversions allows us to set stringent constraints on the gravitational-wave strain $h_c$, strengthening current astrophysical bounds by $\sim1-2$ orders of magnitude in the whole range of frequencies considered.</description>

      <title>Discrete dark matter with light Dirac neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new realisation of light Dirac neutrino mass and dark matter (DM) within the framework of a non-Abelian discrete flavour symmetry $A_4$. In addition to $A_4$, we also consider a $Z_2$ and an unbroken global lepton number symmetry $U(1)_L$ to keep unwanted terms away while guaranteeing the Dirac nature of light neutrinos. The field content, their transformations and flavon vacuum alignments are chosen in such a way that the type-I Dirac seesaw generates only one light Dirac neutrino mass while the other two masses arise from scotogenic contributions at one-loop. The symmetry breaking of $A_4$ leaves a remnant $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry responsible for stabilising DM. Dirac nature of light neutrinos introduces additional relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ within reach of cosmic microwave background experiments.</description>

      <title>Matching the Weak Mixing Angle at Low Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The running weak mixing angle is used as a convenient tool to keep control of dominating logarithmic corrections in the Standard Model of the electroweak interactions connecting measurements at largely differing energy scales. To relate the solutions of the renormalization group equation for the weak mixing angle above and below particle thresholds one needs matching conditions. We suggest to define the matching at the W-boson threshold by comparing the full Standard Model with a low-energy effective theory where the weak neutral current, in particular for parity-violating fermion scattering, is described by 4-fermion operators and calculate the corresponding matching relation.</description>

      <title>Time-kernel for lattice determinations of NLO hadronic vacuum polarization contributions to the muon $g$-$2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the time-momentum representation of the kernel needed to compute hadronic vacuum polarization contributions to the muon $g$-$2$ in the space-like region at next-to-leading order. For small values of the time, we present analytical series expansions; for large values of the time, we present numerical series expansions which overcome the problems showed by na\"ive asymptotic expansions. These results are to be employed in lattice QCD determination of hadronic vacuum polarization contributions to the muon $g$-$2$ at next-to-leading order.</description>

      <title>Precise determination of the bottom-quark on-shell mass using its four-loop relation to the $\overline{\rm MS}$-scheme running mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the properties of the bottom-quark on-shell mass ($M_b$) by using its relation to the $\overline{\rm MS}$ mass (${\overline m}_b$). At present, this $\overline{\rm MS}$-on-shell relation has been known up to four-loop QCD corrections, which however still has a $\sim 2\%$ scale uncertainty by taking the renormalization scale as ${\overline m}_b({\overline m}_b)$ and varying it within the usual range of $[{\overline m}_b({\overline m}_b)/2, 2 {\overline m}_b({\overline m}_b)]$. The principle of maximum conformality (PMC) has been adopted to achieve a more precise $\overline{\rm MS}$-on-shell relation by eliminating such scale uncertainty. As a step forward, we also estimate the magnitude of the uncalculated higher-order terms by using the Pad\'{e} approximation approach. Numerically, by using the $\overline{\rm MS}$ mass ${\overline m}_b({\overline m}_b)=4.18^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$ GeV as an input, our predicted value for the bottom-quark on-shell mass becomes $M_b\simeq 5.36^{+0.10}_{-0.07}$ GeV, where the uncertainty is the squared average of the ones caused by $\Delta \alpha_s(M_Z)$, $\Delta {\overline m}_b({\overline m}_b)$, and the estimated magnitude of the higher-order terms.</description>

      <title>Complex scalar dark matter in a new gauged U(1) symmetry with kinetic and direct mixings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scalar dark matter model featuring a hidden gauge symmetry, denoted as U(1)_X, with two complex scalars, Phi and S. In this framework, Phi spontaneously breaks the U(1)_X gauge symmetry, while S serves as a viable dark matter candidate. Particularly, the kinetic and direct mixings between the U(1)_X and U(1)_Y gauge groups provide a portal between dark matter and the Standard Model particles. These mixings offer a plausible explanation for the W boson mass anomaly observed by the CDF Collaboration. We study the comprehensive phenomenological constraints of this model from colliders and dark matter detection experiments, including Z' searches at the LHC, the 125 GeV Higgs boson measurements, the relic density of dark matter and the indirect detection of dark matter annihilation. By randomly scanning the parameter space, we find that the regions where m_(Z') &gt; 4750 GeV and m_(Z') &lt; 4750 GeV for g_x close to 1 remain viable and can be tested by future experiments.</description>

      <title>Transition magnetic moment of Majorana neutrinos in the triplets next-to-minimal MSSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The TNMSSM is an attractive extension of the Standard Model. It combines the advantages of the NMSSM and the TMSSM to give three tiny Majorana neutrinos masses via a type I+II seesaw mechanism. With the on-shell renormalization scheme, we consider the neutrino masses up to one loop approximation. Applying the effective Lagrangian method, we study the transition magnetic moments of Majorana neutrinos and consider the normal hierarchy (NH) and inverse hierarchy (IH) neutrino mass spectra within the constraints of experimental data on neutrino oscillations. The solar neutrino transition magnetic moment is further deduced, and compared with the XENONnT experiment limit.</description>

      <title>Non-Planar Two-Loop Amplitudes for Five-Parton Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the current status of high-multiplicity double-virtual QCD corrections to processes relevant for LHC phenomenology. In particular, we discuss the recent full-color calculation of the five-parton process, whose two-loop amplitudes are required to obtain next-to-next-to-leading order predictions for three-jet production at the LHC. We address various aspects of the computation, including color decomposition, renormalization, partial amplitudes, color identities and the construction of the finite remainder. We review the method of numerical unitarity, which is used to generate finite-field samples of the amplitude. We then focus on the analytic reconstruction of the coefficient functions from these numerical samples via Ansatz techniques. A novel algorithm, based on the correlation of codimension-one residues, helps manage the complexity of the calculation. Little-group rescalings of the gluon amplitude, inspired by supersymmetry Ward identities, facilitate the computation of the quark amplitudes. We conclude with an outlook towards upcoming computations with an increased number of scales, leading to larger Ans\"atze and more complicated alphabets.</description>

      <title>Theories of flavour from the Planck scale to the electroweak scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flavour puzzle remains as one of the most intriguing enigmas of particle physics. In this thesis, we propose and study theories of flavour which generically hint to a multi-scale origin of flavour. First we explore the idea of fermiophobic models and messenger dominance, where the chiral fermions of the Standard Model are uncharged under (part of) an extended gauge symmetry, which also forbids Yukawa couplings for chiral fermions. These are generated effectively due to the presence of hierarchically heavy messengers, including vector-like fermions and/or heavy Higgs doublets. Simultaneously, this mechanism generates effective couplings of chiral fermions to the gauge bosons of the extended symmetry, leading to a predictive phenomenology connected to the origin of flavour hierarchies. We present two models of this kind, based on gauge $U(1)$ and twin Pati-Salam symmetries, that have implications for low energy flavour anomalies. Secondly, we study the framework of flavour deconstruction, where the Standard Model emerges from a non-universal gauge theory that contains a separate gauge factor for each fermion family. We argue that one of the most simple ways to achieve this is by assigning a separate gauge hypercharge to each fermion family, denoted as the "tri-hypercharge" theory. If the SM Higgs only carries third family hypercharge, then only the third family is massive at renormalisable level, and light families get their mass from higher dimensional operators. Finally, we propose a gauge unified origin for gauge non-universal frameworks such as the aforementioned tri-hypercharge theory. The model assigns a separate $SU(5)$ group to each fermion family. However, assuming that the three $SU(5)$ groups are related by a cyclic permutation symmetry $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$, then the model is described by a single gauge coupling in the ultraviolet, despite $SU(5)^{3}$ being a non-simple group.</description>

      <title>Relativistic theory of the viscosity of fluids across the entire energy spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shear viscosity is a fundamental transport property of matter. Surprisingly, there is no simple analytical theory for the viscosity of relativistic fluids that is able to recover the viscosity of non-relativistic gases as one of its analytical limits. Here we derive a general theory of the viscosity of gases based on the relativistic Langevin equation (deduced from a relativistic Lagrangian) and nonaffine linear response theory. The proposed relativistic theory is able to recover the viscosity of non-relativistic classical gases, with all its key dependencies on mass, temperature, particle diameter and Boltzmann constant, in the limit of Lorentz factor $\gamma=1$. It also unveils the relativistic enhancement of viscosity, which is a fundamental relativistic effect that has been overlooked so far. In the limit of ultrarelativistic fluids, the theory reproduces the cubic increase of viscosity with temperature in agreement with previous estimates for the QGP-type fluid.</description>

      <title>Universal Anomaly Detection at the LHC: Transforming Optimal Classifiers and the DDD Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel approach to transform supervised classifiers into effective unsupervised anomaly detectors. The method we have developed, termed Discriminatory Detection of Distortions (DDD), enhances anomaly detection by training a discriminator model on both original and artificially modified datasets. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of our models on the Dark Machines Anomaly Score Challenge channels and a search for 4-top quark events, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach across various final states and beyond the Standard Model scenarios.
  We compare the performance of the DDD method with the Deep Robust One-Class Classification method (DROCC), which incorporates signals in the training process, and the Deep Support Vector Data Description (DeepSVDD) method, a well established and well performing method for anomaly detection. Results show that the effectiveness of each model varies by signal and channel, with DDD proving to be a very effective anomaly detector. We recommend the combined use of DeepSVDD and DDD for purely unsupervised applications, with the addition of flow models for improved performance when resources allow.
  Findings suggest that network architectures that excel in supervised contexts, such as the particle transformer with standard model interactions, also perform well as unsupervised anomaly detectors. We also show that with these methods, it is likely possible to recognize 4-top quark production as an anomaly without prior knowledge of the process. We argue that the Large Hadron Collider community can transform supervised classifiers into anomaly detectors to uncover potential new physical phenomena in each search.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Dirac Neutrinos and Relic Neutrino Matter Effect on the High-energy Neutrino Flavor Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if neutrinos are pseudo-Dirac, they can potentially affect the flavor ratio predictions for the high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux observed by IceCube. In this context, we point out a novel matter effect induced by the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B) on the flavor ratio composition. Specifically, the active-sterile neutrino oscillations over the astrophysical baseline lead to an energy-dependent flavor ratio at Earth due to the C$\nu$B matter effect, which is distinguishable from the vacuum oscillation effect, provided there is a local C$\nu$B overdensity. Considering the projected precision of the 3-neutrino oscillation parameter measurements and improved flavor triangle measurements, we show that the next-generation neutrino telescopes, such as IceCube-Gen2 and KM3NeT, can probe the pseudo-Dirac neutrino hypothesis in a distinctive way.</description>

Abstract: This report summarizes the work of the EMMI Rapid Reaction Task Force on "Real and Virtual Photon Production at Ultra-Low Transverse Momentum and Low Mass at the LHC". We provide an overview of the soft-photon puzzle, i.e., of the long-standing discrepancy between experimental data and predictions based on Low's soft-photon theorem, also referred to as "anomalous" soft photon production, and we review the current theoretical understanding of soft radiation and soft theorems. We also focus on low-mass dileptons as a tool for determining the electrical conductivity of the medium produced in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions. We discuss how both topics can be addressed with the planned ALICE 3 detector at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the controversy over the time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect considers the situation in which the magnetic flux inside the solenoid changes time-dependently. Different from the standard AB-effect, the problem is unexpectedly subtle and not easy to solve without any doubt, which is the reason why it is still in a state of unsettlement even theoretically. The difficulty originates from the fact that its theoretical analysis requires line-integral along a path in the 4-dimensional Minkowski space. The central controversy concerns the success or failure of the claim by Singleton and collaborators, which states that the time-dependent part of the AB-phase shift due to the magnetic vector potential is precisely cancelled by the effect of induced electric field generated by the time-variation of the magnetic flux. In this paper, we try to demonstrate that their cancellation argument would not be justified by going back to the basic quantum mechanical analysis of the charged particle motion under the presence of external electromagnetic potential. At the end, we conclude that the failure of the cancellation argument is due to unjustified application of the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem to the problem of time-dependent AB-effect.</description>

      <title>Timing and Scintillation Studies of Pulsars in Globular Cluster M3 (NGC 5272) with FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the phase-connected timing solutions of all the five pulsars in globular cluster (GC) M3 (NGC 5272), namely PSRs M3A to F (PSRs J1342+2822A to F), with the exception of PSR M3C, from FAST archival data. In these timing solutions, those of PSRs M3E, and F are obtained for the first time. We find that PSRs M3E and F have low mass companions, and are in circular orbits with periods of 7.1 and 3.0 days, respectively. For PSR M3C, we have not detected it in all the 41 observations. We found no X-ray counterparts for these pulsars in archival Chandra images in the band of 0.2-20 keV. We noticed that the pulsars in M3 seem to be native. From the Auto-Correlation Function (ACF) analysis of the M3A's and M3B's dynamic spectra, the scintillation timescale ranges from $7.0\pm0.3$ min to $60.0\pm0.6$ min, and the scintillation bandwidth ranges from $4.6\pm0.2$ MHz to $57.1\pm1.1$ MHz. The measured scintillation bandwidths from the dynamic spectra indicate strong scintillation, and the scattering medium is anisotropic. From the secondary spectra, we captured a scintillation arc only for PSR M3B with a curvature of $649\pm23 {\rm m}^{-1} {\rm mHz}^{-2}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aether Scalar-Tensor theory is a modification of general relativity proposed to explain galactic and cosmological mass discrepancies conventionally attributed to dark matter. The theory is able to fit the cosmic microwave background and the linear matter power spectrum without dark matter. In this work, we derive the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation in this theory and solve it for realistic nuclear equations of state to predict the mass-radius relation of neutron stars. We find solutions that are compatible with all current observations of neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applications of new techniques in machine learning are speeding up progress in research in various fields. In this work, we construct and evaluate a deep neural network (DNN) to be used within a Bayesian statistical framework as a faster and more reliable alternative to the Gaussian Process (GP) emulator of an isospin-dependent Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (IBUU) transport model simulator of heavy-ion reactions at intermediate beam energies. We found strong evidence of DNN being able to emulate the IBUU simulator's prediction on the strengths of protons' directed and elliptical flow very efficiently even with small training datasets and with accuracy about ten times higher than the GP. Limitations of our present work and future improvements are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Upper Bounds on the Mass of Fundamental Fields from Primordial Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations in the vacuum zero point energy associated to quantum fields and their statistical distributions during inflation. It is shown that the perturbations in the vacuum zero point energy have large amplitudes which are highly non-Gaussian. The effects of vacuum zero point fluctuations can be interpreted as the loop corrections in primordial power spectrum and bispectrum. Requiring that the primordial curvature perturbation to remain nearly scale-invariant and Gaussian imposes strong upper bounds on the mass of fundamental fields during inflation. We show that the fundamental fields can not be much heavier than the Hubble scale during inflation, otherwise their vacuum zero point fluctuations induce large non-Gaussianities and scale-dependence in primordial perturbations. Considering the observational upper bound on tensor to scalar ratio, we conclude that all fundamental fields are lighter than $10^{14}$ GeV.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM cosmology: Alleviating major cosmological tensions by predicting standard neutrino properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a two-parameter extension of the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model by allowing variations in the effective number of neutrino species $N_{\rm eff}$ and their total mass $\sum m_\nu$. Our motivation is twofold: (i) to examine whether $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM retains its success in fitting the data and addressing major cosmological tensions, without suggesting a need for a deviation from the standard model of particle physics, and (ii) to determine whether the data indicate new physics that could potentially address cosmological tensions, either in the post-recombination universe through the late-time mirror AdS-dS transition, or in the pre-recombination universe through modifications in the standard values of $N_{\rm eff}$ and $\sum m_\nu$, or both. Within the extended $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, referred to as $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM+$N_{\rm eff}$+$\sum m_{\rm \nu}$, we find no significant tension when considering the Planck-alone analysis. We observe that incorporating BAO data limits the further success of the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM extension. However, the weakly model-dependent BAOtr data, along with Planck and Planck+PP\&amp;SH0ES, favor $H_0\sim 73\,{\rm km\, s^{-1}\, Mpc^{-1}}$. In cases where BAOtr dataset is used, the mirror AdS-dS transition is very effective in providing enhanced $H_0$ values, and thus the model requires no significant deviation from the standard value of $N_{\rm eff} = 3.044$. Both the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions are effectively addressed, with some compromise in the case of the Planck+BAO dataset. Finally, the upper bounds obtained on $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.5$~eV are fully compatible with neutrino oscillation experiments. Our findings provide evidence that late-time physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM, such as $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM, without altering the standard pre-recombination universe, can suffice to alleviate the major cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>Electrical conductivity of the Quark-Gluon Plasma in the presence of strong magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the electrical conductivity of the strongly interacting medium in the presence of strong magnetic background fields, $eB=4,9~GeV^2$, and for different values of the temperature, both in the confined and in the deconfined Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) phase. The conductivity is obtained from the Euclidean lattice time correlator of the electrical current, computed on gauge configurations sampled from Monte-Carlo simulations of an improved staggered discretization of $N_f = 2+1$ QCD. We perform the inverse Laplace transform of the correlator adopting a recently-proposed version of the standard Backus--Gilbert procedure for the inversion. The results obtained in the QGP phase show a sizable enhancement of the conductivity in the direction parallel to the magnetic field, as well as a suppression in the direction orthogonal to it. Such enhancement could be attributed to the manifestation of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME): following this guess, we extract the behaviour of the relaxation time of this process, extrapolate it to the continuum limit and compare it to previous results, finding it lower than expected in the explored range of temperatures.</description>

      <title>anyH3: precise predictions for the trilinear Higgs coupling in the Standard Model and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03015v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The trilinear Higgs coupling $\lambda_{hhh}$ of the detected Higgs boson is an important probe for physics beyond the Standard Model. Correspondingly, improving the precision of the theoretical predictions for this coupling as well as the experimental constraints on it are among the main goals of particle physics in the near future. In this article, we present the public $\mathtt{Python}$ code $\mathtt{anyH3}$, which provides precise theoretical predictions for $\lambda_{hhh}$. The program can easily be used for any renormalisable model, where for the input the $\mathtt{UFO}$ format is adopted. It allows including corrections up to the full one-loop level with arbitrary values of the external squared momenta and features a semi-automatic and highly flexible renormalisation procedure. The code is validated against known results in the literature. Moreover, we present new results for $\lambda_{hhh}$ in models which so far have not been investigated in the literature.</description>

Abstract: For loops with UV divergences, finite physical results obtained via $\infty - \infty$ mean the physical transition amplitudes of loops are not well-defined. In this paper, a presumption that the physical contributions of loops from UV regions are insignificant is proposed, and a method of UV-free scheme described by an equation is introduced to derive loop results without UV divergences. This scheme provides a new perspective to an open question of the hierarchy problem of Higgs mass, i.e., an alternative interpretation without fine-tuning within the standard model.</description>

      <title>Impact of scalar NSI on the neutrino mass ordering sensitivity at DUNE, HK and KNO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12249v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of neutrino non-standard interactions (NSI) is a well-motivated phenomenological scenario to explore new physics beyond the Standard Model. The possible scalar coupling of neutrinos ($\nu$) with matter is one of such new physics scenarios that appears as a sub-dominant effect that can impact the $\nu$-oscillations in matter. The presence of scalar NSI introduces an additional contribution directly to the $\nu$-mass matrix in the interaction Hamiltonian and subsequently to the $\nu$-oscillations. This indicates that scalar NSI may have a significant impact on measurements related to $\nu$-oscillations e.g. leptonic CP phase $(\delta_{CP})$, $\theta_{23}$ octant and neutrino mass ordering (MO). The linear scaling of the effects of scalar NSI with matter density also motivates its exploration in long-baseline (LBL) experiments. In this paper, we study the impact of a scalar-mediated NSI on the MO sensitivity of DUNE, HK and HK+KNO, which are upcoming LBL experiments. We study the impact on MO sensitivities at these experiments assuming that scalar NSI parameters are present in nature and is known from other non-LBL experiments. We observe that the presence of diagonal scalar NSI elements can significantly affect the $\nu$-mass ordering sensitivities. We then also combine the data from DUNE with HK and HK+KNO to explore possible synergy among these experiments in a wider parameter space. We also observe a significant enhancement in the MO sensitivities for the combined analysis.</description>

Abstract: Simulations of neutrino interactions are playing an increasingly important role in the pursuit of high-priority measurements for the field of particle physics. A significant technical barrier for efficient development of these simulations is the lack of a standard data format for representing individual neutrino scattering events. We propose and define such a universal format, named NuHepMC, as a common standard for the output of neutrino event generators. The NuHepMC format uses data structures and concepts from the HepMC3 event record library adopted by other subfields of high-energy physics. These are supplemented with an original set of conventions for generically representing neutrino interaction physics within the HepMC3 infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Tri-unification: a separate $SU(5)$ for each fermion family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05683v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss $SU(5)^{3}$ with cyclic symmetry as a possible grand unified theory (GUT). The basic idea of such a tri-unification is that there is a separate $SU(5)$ for each fermion family, with the light Higgs doublet(s) arising from the third family $SU(5)$, providing a basis for charged fermion mass hierarchies. $SU(5)^{3}$ tri-unification reconciles the idea of gauge non-universality with the idea of gauge coupling unification, opening the possibility to build consistent non-universal descriptions of Nature that are valid all the way up to the scale of grand unification. As a concrete example, we propose a grand unified embedding of the tri-hypercharge model $U(1)_Y^3$ based on an $SU(5)^{3}$ framework with cyclic symmetry. We discuss a minimal tri-hypercharge example which can account for all the quark and lepton (including neutrino) masses and mixing parameters. We show that it is possible to unify the many gauge couplings into a single gauge coupling associated with the cyclic $SU(5)^{3}$ gauge group, by assuming minimal multiplet splitting, together with a set of relatively light colour octet scalars. We also study proton decay in this example, and present the predictions for the proton lifetime in the dominant $e^+\pi^0$ channel.</description>

      <title>On Lepton Flavor Violation and Dark Matter in Scotogenic model with Trimaximal Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the Scotogenic model employing the TM$_2$ mixing matrix, $U_{\text{TM}_2}$, for neutrinos and parameterize the Yukawa coupling matrix $y$ based on the diagonalization condition for the neutrino mass matrix, $m_{\nu}$. Our investigation centers on analyzing the relic density of cold dark matter ($\Omega h^2$) and possible lepton flavor violation (LFV) in the model. In particular, we study coannihilation dynamics and LFV, in the model, considering various coannihilation scenarios including non-zero mass splitting between lightest sterile neutrinos. While analyzing, we have taken into consideration respective experimental constraints on $\Omega h^2$ and LFV alongside neutrino oscillation data. Our study reveals that in both normal and inverted hierarchy of neutrino masses, splitting between masses of $N_1$ and $N_2$ can be up to $\approx 15\%$ for the model to be in consonance with the above constraints. In the second part, we have extended the analysis incorporating extended magic symmetry in $m_\nu$ enabling us to completely determine Yukawa coupling matrix ($y$). We observe a notable exclusion of the effective Majorana mass $|m_{ee}|$ parameter space by cosmological bound on sum of neutrino masses, particularly in the normal hierarchy while inverted hierarchy scenario is excluded due to constraints coming from extended magic symmetry. These findings shed light on the interplay among the Scotogenic model, TM$_2$ mixing, and extended magic symmetry, offering insights into the permitted parameter space and hierarchy exclusion.</description>

      <title>Estimation of electric field in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We estimate the spacetime profile of the electric field in head-on heavy-ion collisions at intermediate collision energies $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = {\mathcal O}(3 \;-\; 10\;{\rm GeV})$. Using a hadronic cascade model (JAM; Jet AA Microscopic transport model), we numerically demonstrate that the produced field has strength $eE = {\mathcal O}((30 \;-\; 60\;{\rm MeV})^2)$, which is supercritical to the Schwinger limit of QED and is non-negligibly large compared even to the hadron/QCD scale, and survives for a long time $\tau = {\mathcal O}(10\;{\rm fm}/c)$ due to the baryon stopping. We show that the produced field is nonperturbatively strong in the sense that the nonperturbativity parameters (e.g., the Keldysh parameter) are sufficiently large. This is in contrast to high-energy collisions $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} \gtrsim 100 \;{\rm GeV}$, where the field is extremely short-lived and hence is perturbative. Our results imply that the electromagnetic field may have phenomenological impacts on hadronic/QCD processes in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions and that heavy-ion collisions can be used as a new tool to explore strong-field physics in the nonperturbative regime.</description>

      <title>Probing the mixing between sterile and tau neutrinos in the SHiP experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the expected sensitivity to the mixing between sterile and tau neutrinos directly from the tau neutrino disappearance in the high-energy fixed target experiment. Here, the beam energy is large enough to produce tau neutrinos at the target with large luminosity. During their propagation to the detector, tau neutrinos may oscillate into sterile neutrinos. By examining the energy spectrum of the observed tau neutrino events, we can probe the mixing between sterile and tau neutrinos directly. In this paper, we consider Scattering and Neutrino Detector (SND) at SHiP experiment as a showcase, which uses 400 GeV protons from SPS at CERN, and expect to observe 7,300 tau and anti-tau neutrinos from the $2\times 10^{20}$ POT for 5 years operation. Assuming the uncertainty of 10\%, we find the sensitivity $|U_{\tau 4}|^2 \sim 0.08$\, (90\% CL) for $\Delta m_{41}^2 \sim 500\ \mathrm{eV}^2$ with 10\% background to the signal. We also consider a far SND at the end of the SHiP Hidden Sector Decay Spectrometer (HSDS), in which case the sensitivity would be enhanced to $|U_{\tau 4}|^2 \sim 0.02$. Away from this mass, the sensitivity becomes lower than $|U_{\tau 4}|^2 \sim 0.15$ for $\Delta m_{41}^2 \lesssim 100\ \mathrm{eV}^2$ or $\Delta m_{41}^2\gtrsim 10^4 \mathrm{eV}^2$.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate possible bound states of the $\Lambda_c\bar{\Lambda}_c$ system in the Bethe-Salpeter formalism in the ladder and instantaneous approximations. By numerically solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we confirm the existence of $\Lambda_c\bar{\Lambda}_c$ bound states with quantum numbers $J^{PC}=0^{-+}$ and $J^{PC}=1^{--}$. We further investigate the partial decay widths of the $\Lambda_c\bar{\Lambda}_c$ bound states into $N\bar{N}$, $D\bar{D}$, $D\bar{D}^\ast$, $D^\ast\bar{D}^\ast$, $\pi\bar{\pi}$, and $K\bar{K}$. Our results indicate that the decay width of the $\Lambda_c\bar{\Lambda}_c$ bound state with $J^{PC}=1^{--}$ is much larger than that with $J^{PC}=0^{-+}$, and among their decay channels, the $D\bar{D}^\ast$ final state is the main decay mode. We suggest experiments to search for the $\Lambda_c\bar{\Lambda}_c$ bound states in the $D\bar{D}^\ast$ final state.</description>

      <title>A partitioned dipole-antenna shower with improved transverse recoil</title>

Abstract: The implementation of a new final-state parton-shower algorithm in the Pythia event generator is described. The shower algorithm, dubbed Apollo, combines central aspects of the Vincia antenna shower with the global transverse-recoil scheme of the Alaric framework in order to achieve formal consistency with next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) resummation. The shower algorithm is constructed in such a way that it facilitates a straightforward combination with fixed-order calculations. As an explicit proof of concept, a general scheme for matrix-element corrections (MECs) and two separate multiplicative next-to-leading order (NLO) matching schemes are outlined. It is argued that both matching schemes retain the logarithmic accuracy of the shower. The improved modelling of radiation is examined by contrasting the new algorithm with existing leading-logarithmic parton showers in Pythia.</description>

      <title>Entanglement suppression and low-energy scattering of heavy mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently entanglement suppression was proposed to be one possible origin of emergent symmetries. Here we test this conjecture in the context of heavy meson scatterings. The low-energy interactions of $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$ and $D^{(*)} D^{(*)}$ are closely related to the hadronic molecular candidates $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$, respectively, and can be described by a nonrelativistic effective Lagrangian manifesting heavy-quark spin symmetry, which includes only constant contact potentials at leading order. We explore entanglement suppression in a tensor-product framework to treat both the isospin and spin degrees of freedom. Using the $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ as inputs, we find that entanglement suppression indeed leads to an emergent symmetry, namely, a light-quark spin symmetry, and as such the $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$ or $D^{(*)} D^{(*)}$ interaction strengths for a given total isospin do not depend on the total angular momentum of light (anti)quarks. The $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ are predicted to have five and one isoscalar partner, respectively, while the corresponding partner numbers derived solely from heavy-quark spin symmetry are three and one, respectively. The predictions need to be confronted with experimental data and lattice quantum chromodynamics results to further test the entanglement suppression conjecture.</description>

      <title>Ratios of the light quark masses: Cubic curve vs ellipse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bounds on the light quark masses are obtained by fitting the squares of pseudoscalar meson masses $m_\pi^2$ and $m_K^2$ to second order in $1/N_c$ expansion. The result is an algebraic cubic curve whose coefficients are the known Weinberg values for the quark mass ratios $m_u/m_d$ and $m_s/m_d$. Additional restrictions arise when using the ratio $m_s/m_{ud}=27.23(10)$ quoted by FLAG for lattice simulations with four quark flavors. This provides a tight constraint on the ratio $m_u/m_d = 0.455(8)$.</description>

Abstract: Evaluating the H(x, s; pp) scaling function of elastic proton-proton (pp) collisions from recent TOTEM data at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV and comparing it with the same function of elastic proton-antiproton (pp-) data of the D0 collaboration at sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV, we find, from this comparison alone, an at least 3.79 sigma {\signal} of Odderon exchange. If we combine this model independently obtained result with that of a similar analysis but using TOTEM elastic pp scattering data at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV, which resulted in an at least 6.26 {\sigma} signal, the combined significance of Odderon exchange increases to at least 7.08 {\sigma}, model independently. Further combinations of various datasets in the TeV energy range are detailed in the manuscript</description>

Abstract: Due to the assumption that sterile neutrinos are right-handed neutrinos, an analysis of the modern experimental situation in neutron decay for right-handed currents was carried out. As a result of the analysis, it was found that there are indications of the existence of a right-handed vector boson $W_R$ with a mass $M_{W_R}\approx 870_{-140}^{+260} \text{GeV}$ and a mixing angle with $W_L$: $\zeta=0.061_{-0.024}^{+0.017}$. This circumstance is the basis for discussing the possibility of expanding the Standard Model with an additional gauge vector boson $W_R$ and right-handed neutrinos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the possibility that the two nearby resonances observed by BESIII partially below the \,$p\bar p$\, threshold might be due to mixing between two metastable states with the same $J^{PC}=0^{-+}$ quantum numbers, but rather different internal structure. One is a $p \bar p$ hadronic molecule and the other a bound state of a light-quark diquark and an antidiquark, both with spin 1 and isospin 0, a composite color antitriplet and triplet, respectively. The doubling of resonances, one of which may be interpreted as a hadronic molecule, while the other arises from $q \bar q$ annihilation in a state with vacuum quantum numbers may be a more general feature than the specific case considered here.</description>

      <title>Bell inequality is violated in charmonium decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The experimental data on the charmonium decay helicity amplitudes make it possible to measure entanglement in final state spin correlations and test the violation of the Bell inequality it may entail. We find that the Bell inequality is violated with a significance of 5$\sigma$ or more in the decays
  $ \eta_{c}, \, \chi_{c}^{0}, \, J/\psi ,\, \psi(3686) \to \Lambda +\bar \Lambda $,
  $J/\psi \to \Xi^- +\bar \Xi^+,\; \Xi^0 +\bar \Xi^0, \;\Sigma^{-} +\bar \Sigma^{+},\; \Sigma^{0} +\bar \Sigma^{0} $,
  $\psi(3686) \to \Xi^- +\bar \Xi^+,\; \Sigma^- +\bar \Sigma^+,\; \Sigma^{0} +\bar \Sigma^{0} $,
  $\chi^{0}_{c} ,\, \chi_{c}^{1} \to \phi+ \phi $.
  The decay $\psi(3686) \to \Xi^0 +\bar \Xi^0$ shows the same violation but with less significance. The decay $\psi(3686) \to \Omega^- +\bar \Omega^+$ displays entanglement. These results firmly establish the presence of entanglement and quantum non-separability at high energies, in a setting with particles of different spins and interacting through electroweak and strong interactions. In addition, the relatively long lifetime of some of the strange baryons produced in the decays provides a natural probe to test whether quantum spin correlations remain present after the particles have interacted with the beam pipe and the first few layers of the detector.</description>

Abstract: Some gauge theories with a spontaneously broken $U(1)$ symmetry exhibit fractional Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phases around vortices in the Higgs regime. We discuss continuity between confining and Higgs regimes in such gauge theories with fundamental matter fields, focusing on the AB phases. By explicit calculations in relevant lattice models, we demonstrate that the AB phase is smoothly connected between the confining and Higgs regimes, supporting the Higgs-confinement continuity. This result provides new insight into phase structures of gauge theories with superfluidity, such as dense QCD.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Beam of Gravitational Radiation from a Cosmic String Loop</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate exact and approximate techniques to calculate the emission of gravitational radiation from cosmic string loops in order to generate beam models covering the entire celestial sphere for a wide range of modes $m$. One approach entails summing over contributions of stationary and nearly-stationary points of individual, factorized, left- and right-moving modes. This "multipoint method" generalizes traditional methods that rely on expansions around exact stationary points of mode products. A second complementary approach extends the method of steepest descent to generate an asymptotic description of the beam as $m \to \infty$. We present example calculations of the emission of power from cusp-containing loops and compare the results with those obtained by numerically exact techniques as well as by previous approaches. The multipoint method achieves its best results at an intermediate range of modes, improving over previous methods in terms of accuracy. It handles the emission from all regions of the loop not just those near cusps. We demonstrate this capability by making a detailed study of the "pseudocusp" phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Scattering Constraints from Observations of Stars Surrounding Sgr A*</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High resolution infrared data has revealed several young stars in close proximity to Sgr A*. These stars may encounter extremely high dark matter densities. We examine scenarios where dark matter scatters on stellar gas, accumulates in stellar cores, and then annihilates. We study the stars S2, S62, S4711 and S4714 and find three observable effects. First, dark matter interactions can inhibit in situ star-formation close to Sgr A*, favoring scenarios where these stars migrate into the Galactic Center. Second, dark matter interactions can delay main sequence evolution, making stars older than they appear. Third, very high dark matter densities can inject enough energy to disrupt main sequence stars, allowing S-star observations to constrain the dark matter density near Sgr A*.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the spectrum of field theories with non-integer $O(N)$ symmetry from quantum evanescence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify constraints in the energy spectra of quantum theories that have a global $O(N)$ symmetry, where $N$ is treated as a continuous parameter. We point out that a class of evanescent states fall out of the spectrum at integer values of $N$ in pairs, via an annihilation mechanism. This forces the energies of the states in such a pair to approach equality as $N$ approaches a certain integer, with both states disappearing at precisely integer $N$ and the point of would-be degeneracy. These constraints occur between different irreducible representations of the analytic continuation of $O(N)$ and hold non-perturbatively. We give examples in the spectra of the critical $O(N)$ model.</description>

Abstract: The classical dynamics and the construction of quantum states in a plane wave curved spacetime are examined, paying particular attention to the similarities with the case of an electromagnetic plane wave in flat spacetime. A natural map connecting the dynamics of a particle in the Rosen metric and the motion of a charged particle in an electromagnetic plane wave is unveiled. We then discuss how this map can be translated into the quantum description by exploiting the large number of underlying symmetries. We examine the complete analogy between Volkov solutions and fermion states in the Rosen chart and properly extend this to massive vector bosons. We finally report the squared S-matrix element of Compton scattering in a sandwich plane wave spacetime in the form of a two-dimensional integral.</description>

      <title>A Scaling Relation, $Z_m$-type Deconfinement Phases and Imaginary Chemical Potentials in Finite Temperature Large-$N$ Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the effective potentials for the Polyakov loops in finite temperature SU$(N)$ gauge theories obey a certain scaling relation with respect to temperature in the large-$N$ limit. This scaling relation strongly constrains the possible terms in the Polyakov loop effective potentials. Moreover, by using the effective potentials in the presence of imaginary chemical potentials or imaginary angular velocities in several models, we find that phase transitions to $Z_m$-type deconfinement phases ($Z_m$ phase) occur, where the eigenvalues of the Polyakov loop are distributed $Z_m$ symmetrically. Physical quantities in the $Z_m$ phase obey the scaling properties of the effective potential. The models include Yang-Mills (YM) theories, the bosonic BFSS matrix model and ${\mathcal N}=4$ supersymmetric YM theory on $S^3$. Thus, the phase diagrams of large-$N$ gauge theories with imaginary chemical potentials are very rich and the stable $Z_m$ phase would be ubiquitous. Monte-Carlo calculations also support this. As a related topic, we discuss the phase diagrams of large-$N$ YM theories with real angular velocities in finite volume spaces.</description>

      <title>The Born regime of gravitational amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $2 \to 2$ scattering in the regime where the wavelength of the scattered objects is comparable to their distance but is much larger than any Compton wavelength in the quantum field theory. We observe that in this regime - which differs from the eikonal - the Feynman diagram expansion takes the form of a geometric series, akin to the Born series of quantum mechanics. Conversely, we can define the Feynman diagram expansion as the Born series of a relativistic effective-one-body (EOB) Schr\"odinger equation. For a gravitational theory in this regime we observe that the EOB Schr\"odinger equation reduces to the Regge-Wheeler or Teukolsky wave equations. We make use of this understanding to study the tree-level Compton scattering off a Kerr black hole. We compute the scalar and photon Compton amplitude up to $O(a^{30})$ in the black hole spin $a$ and propose an all-order expression. Remarkably, we find that boundary terms, which are typically neglected, give non-zero contact pieces necessary for restoring crossing symmetry and gauge invariance of the Kerr-Compton amplitude.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the origin of Short Gamma ray Bursts with or without extended emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The merger of compact binary stars produces short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs), involving channels such as neutron star - neutron star (BNS) and neutron star - black hole (NS-BH). The association between sGRB 170817A and gravitational wave GW 170817 provides reliable evidence for the BNS channel. The spatial distribution and merger rate differ between BNS mergers and NS-BH mergers. Some speculations suggest that sGRBs with extended emission (EE) may represent another distinct population. We compared the offset distributions of these two types of samples and found that they follow the same distribution. Utilizing non-parametric methods, we investigated the origin of these burst types in terms of their formation rate. We examined the luminosity function and formation rate of sGRBs without any assuming. The luminosity function can be described as $\psi(L_{0}) \propto L_{0}^{-0.09 \pm 0.01}$ for $L_{0} &lt; L_0^b$ ($\psi(L_{0}) \propto L_{0}^{-0.57 \pm 0.02}$ for $L_{0} &gt; L_0^b$) for standard sGRBs and $\psi(L_{0}) \propto L_{0}^{-0.11 \pm 0.004}$ for $L_{0} &lt; L_0^b$ ($\psi(L_{0}) \propto L_{0}^{-0.61 \pm 0.01}$ for $L_{0} &gt; L_0^b$) for sGRBs with EE. The formation rate is characterized as $\rho(z) \propto (1 + z)^{-4.21 \pm 0.22}$ for $z &lt; 0.8$ and $\rho(z) \propto (1 + z)^{-0.22 \pm 0.74}$ for $0.8 &lt; z &lt; 3$ for standard sGRBs, while for sGRBs with EE, it is $\rho(z) \propto (1 + z)^{-4.30 \pm 0.13}$ for $z &lt; 0.8$ and $\rho(z) \propto (1 + z)^{-0.33 \pm 0.66}$ for $0.8 &lt; z &lt; 3$. Based on these findings, we suggest that there is no significant difference in the progenitor stars of sGRBs with and without EE, considering the spatial offset and formation rate perspectives.</description>
