      <title>From terrestrial weather to space weather through the history of scintillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of interplanetary scintillation (IPS) at radio frequencies have proved to be a powerful tool for probing the solar environment from the ground. But how far back does this tradition really extend? Our survey of the literature to date has revealed a long history of scintillating observations, beginning with the oral traditions of Indigenous peoples from around the globe, encompassing the works of the Ancient Greeks and Renaissance scholars, and continuing right through into modern optics, astronomy and space science. We outline here the major steps that humanity has taken along this journey, using scintillation as a tool for predicting first terrestrial, and then space weather without ever having to leave the ground.</description>

      <title>The magnetic origin of the mystery of rare H$\alpha$ Moreton waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past three decades, a lot of coronal fast-mode waves were detected by space missions, but their counterparts in the chromosphere, called the Moreton waves, were rarely captured. How this happens remains a mystery. Here, to shed light on this problem, we investigate the photospheric vector magnetograms of the Moreton wave events associated with M- and X-class solar flares in 2010--2023. The H$\alpha$ data are taken with the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) and the Chinese H$\alpha$ Solar Explorer (CHASE). Our statistical results show that more than 80\% of the events occur at the edge of active regions and propagate non-radially due to asymmetric magnetic fields above the flares. According to the reconstructed magnetic field and atmospheric model, Moreton waves propagate in the direction along which the horizontal fast-mode wave speed drops the fastest. The result supports that the inclined magnetic configuration of the eruption is crucial to generate Moreton waves, even for X-class flares. It may explain the low occurrence rate of Moreton waves and why some X-class flares accompanied with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) do not generate Moreton waves.</description>

      <title>A Point-cloud Clustering &amp; Tracking Algorithm for Radar Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In data mining, density-based clustering, which entails classifying datapoints according to their distributions in some space, is an essential method to extract information from large datasets. With the advent of software-based radio, ionospheric radars are capable of producing unprecedentedly large datasets of plasma turbulence backscatter observations, and new automatic techniques are needed to sift through them. We present an algorithm to automatically identify and track clusters of radar echoes through time, using \texttt{dbscan}, a celebrated density-based clustering method for noisy point-clouds. We demonstrate our algorithm's efficiency by tracking turbulent structures in the E-region ionosphere, the so-called radar aurora. Through conjugate auroral imagery, as well as \emph{in-situ} satellite observations, we demonstrate that the observed turbulent structures generally track the motion of auroras. What is more, the radar aurora bulk motions exhibit key qualities of auroral electric field enhancements that has previously been observed with various instruments. We present preliminary statistical results using our new method, and briefly discuss the method's limitations and potential future adaptations.</description>

      <title>Reformulating polarized radiative transfer for astrophysical applications. (I) A formalism allowing non-local Magnus solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The solar atmosphere is diagnosed by solving the polarized radiative transfer problem for plasmas in Non-Local Thermodynamical Equilibrium (NLTE). A key challenge in multidimensional NLTE diagnosis is to integrate the radiative transfer equation (RTE) efficiently, but current methods are local, limited to constant propagation matrices. The formalism presented in this paper lays the foundations to achieve an efficient non-local integration of the RTE based on the Magnus expansion. Our approach starts formulating the problem in terms of rotations represented in the Lorentz-Poincare group (Stokes formalism) and motivating the use of the Magnus expansion. Then, we combine a highly detailed algebraic characterization of the propagation matrix with Magnus to reformulate the homogenous solution to the RTE. Thus, we obtain a compact analytical evolution operator supporting arbitrary variations of the propagation matrix to first and second order in the Magnus expansion and showing the way to higher orders. Finally, we reformulate the inhomogeneous part to make it solvable with the Magnus expansion too, which gives rise to an interesting new object: the inhomogeneous evolution operator. This provides the first consistent and general formal solution of the RTE that furthermore is non-local, efficient, and accurate by design, with other peculiarity: it separates the integration part from the algebraic formal solution. Our framework is verified analytically and with a computational implementation that leads to a new family of numerical radiative transfer methods and suggests several applications, e.g. accelerating NLTE calculations with non-local radiative transfer. With cosmetic changes, our results apply to other universal physical problems sharing the Lorentz-Poincare algebra of the RTE and special relativity.</description>

      <title>Diverse dust populations in the near-Sun environment characterized by PSP/IS$\odot$IS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (IS$\odot$IS) energetic particle instrument suite on Parker Solar Probe is dedicated to measuring energetic ions and electrons in the near-Sun environment. It includes a half-sky-viewing time-of-flight mass spectrometer (EPI-Lo) and five high-energy silicon solid-state detector-telescopes (EPI-Hi). To August 2024, eight of EPI-Lo's eighty separate telescope foils have experienced direct dust puncture events, most of which occurred inside 40 solar radii (0.19 au). These impacts represent the closest ever direct dust detections to the Sun. While there is limited information about the size/mass of each impact due to the lack of a dedicated dust instrument, we can determine the impact direction for six punctures, allowing us to partially constrain the inner zodiacal abundance. Remarkably, one of six unambiguous dust impacters was likely on a retrograde orbit, suggesting long-period cometary material may survive within 20 solar radii (0.09 au). We discuss observations in the context of improving our understanding of the inner zodiacal dust environment, highlighting multiple dust populations responsible for these events, and refining hazard assessment for near-Sun spacecraft.</description>
