      <title>Cyclical Long Memory: Decoupling, Modulation, and Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new model for general cyclical long memory is introduced, by means of random modulation of certain bivariate long memory time series. This construction essentially decouples the two key features of cyclical long memory: quasi-periodicity and long-term persistence. It further allows for a general cyclical phase in cyclical long memory time series. Several choices for suitable bivariate long memory series are discussed, including a parametric fractionally integrated vector ARMA model. The parametric models introduced in this work have explicit autocovariance functions that can be used readily in simulation, estimation, and other tasks.</description>

      <title>On Ranking-based Tests of Independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a novel nonparametric framework to test the independence of two random variables $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$ with unknown respective marginals $H(dx)$ and $G(dy)$ and joint distribution $F(dx dy)$, based on {\it Receiver Operating Characteristic} (ROC) analysis and bipartite ranking. The rationale behind our approach relies on the fact that, the independence hypothesis $\mathcal{H}\_0$ is necessarily false as soon as the optimal scoring function related to the pair of distributions $(H\otimes G,\; F)$, obtained from a bipartite ranking algorithm, has a ROC curve that deviates from the main diagonal of the unit square.We consider a wide class of rank statistics encompassing many ways of deviating from the diagonal in the ROC space to build tests of independence. Beyond its great flexibility, this new method has theoretical properties that far surpass those of its competitors. Nonasymptotic bounds for the two types of testing errors are established. From an empirical perspective, the novel procedure we promote in this paper exhibits a remarkable ability to detect small departures, of various types, from the null assumption $\mathcal{H}_0$, even in high dimension, as supported by the numerical experiments presented here.</description>

      <title>Directional testing for one-way MANOVA in divergent dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Testing the equality of mean vectors across $g$ different groups plays an important role in many scientific fields. In regular frameworks, likelihood-based statistics under the normality assumption offer a general solution to this task. However, the accuracy of standard asymptotic results is not reliable when the dimension $p$ of the data is large relative to the sample size $n_i$ of each group. We propose here an exact directional test for the equality of $g$ normal mean vectors with identical unknown covariance matrix, provided that $\sum_{i=1}^g n_i \ge p+g+1$. In the case of two groups ($g=2$), the directional test is equivalent to the Hotelling's $T^2$ test. In the more general situation where the $g$ independent groups may have different unknown covariance matrices, although exactness does not hold, simulation studies show that the directional test is more accurate than most commonly used likelihood based solutions. Robustness of the directional approach and its competitors under deviation from multivariate normality is also numerically investigated.</description>

      <title>The Minimax Rate of HSIC Estimation for Translation-Invariant Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kernel techniques are among the most influential approaches in data science and statistics. Under mild conditions, the reproducing kernel Hilbert space associated to a kernel is capable of encoding the independence of $M\ge 2$ random variables. Probably the most widespread independence measure relying on kernels is the so-called Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC; also referred to as distance covariance in the statistics literature). Despite various existing HSIC estimators designed since its introduction close to two decades ago, the fundamental question of the rate at which HSIC can be estimated is still open. In this work, we prove that the minimax optimal rate of HSIC estimation on $\mathbb R^d$ for Borel measures containing the Gaussians with continuous bounded translation-invariant characteristic kernels is $\mathcal O\!\left(n^{-1/2}\right)$. Specifically, our result implies the optimality in the minimax sense of many of the most-frequently used estimators (including the U-statistic, the V-statistic, and the Nystr\"om-based one) on $\mathbb R^d$.</description>

      <title>Privacy Guarantees in Posterior Sampling under Contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, differential privacy has been adopted by tech-companies and governmental agencies as the standard for measuring privacy in algorithms. We study the level of differential privacy in Bayesian posterior sampling setups. As opposed to the common privatization approach of injecting Laplace/Gaussian noise into the output, Huber's contamination model is considered, where we replace at random the data points with samples from a heavy-tailed distribution. We derived bounds for the differential privacy level $(\epsilon,\delta)$ for our approach while lifting the common restriction on assuming bounded observation and parameter space seen in the existing literature. We further consider the effect of sample size on privacy level and the convergence rate of $(\epsilon,\delta)$ to zero. Asymptotically, the contamination approach is fully private at no cost of information loss. We also provide some examples depicting inference models that our setup is applicable to with a theoretical estimation of convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Low coordinate degree algorithms I: Universality of computational thresholds for hypothesis testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study when low coordinate degree functions (LCDF) -- linear combinations of functions depending on small subsets of entries of a vector -- can hypothesis test between high-dimensional probability measures. These functions are a generalization, proposed in Hopkins' 2018 thesis but seldom studied since, of low degree polynomials (LDP), a class widely used in recent literature as a proxy for all efficient algorithms for tasks in statistics and optimization. Instead of the orthogonal polynomial decompositions used in LDP calculations, our analysis of LCDF is based on the Efron-Stein or ANOVA decomposition, making it much more broadly applicable. By way of illustration, we prove channel universality for the success of LCDF in testing for the presence of sufficiently "dilute" random signals through noisy channels: the efficacy of LCDF depends on the channel only through the scalar Fisher information for a class of channels including nearly arbitrary additive i.i.d. noise and nearly arbitrary exponential families. As applications, we extend lower bounds against LDP for spiked matrix and tensor models under additive Gaussian noise to lower bounds against LCDF under general noisy channels. We also give a simple and unified treatment of the effect of censoring models by erasing observations at random and of quantizing models by taking the sign of the observations. These results are the first computational lower bounds against any large class of algorithms for all of these models when the channel is not one of a few special cases, and thereby give the first substantial evidence for the universality of several statistical-to-computational gaps.</description>

      <title>Plant-Capture Methods for Estimating Population Size from Uncertain Plant Captures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plant-capture is a variant of classical capture-recapture methods used to estimate the size of a population. In this method, decoys referred to as "plants" are introduced into the population in order to estimate the capture probability. The method has shown considerable success in estimating population sizes from limited samples in many epidemiological, ecological, and demographic studies. However, previous plant-recapture studies have not systematically accounted for uncertainty in the capture status of each individual plant. In this work, we propose various approaches to formally incorporate uncertainty into the plant-capture model arising from (i) the capture status of plants and (ii) the heterogeneity between multiple survey sites. We present two inference methods and compare their performance in simulation studies. We then apply our methods to estimate the size of the homeless population in several US cities using the large-scale "S-night" study conducted by the US Census Bureau.</description>

      <title>A polynomial chaos approach for uncertainty quantification of Monte Carlo transport codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, we discuss the construction of Polynomial Chaos surrogates for Monte Carlo radiation transport applications via non-intrusive spectral projection. This contribution focuses on improvements with respect to the approach that we previously introduced in previous work. We focus on understanding the impact of re-sampling cost on the algorithm performance and provide algorithm refinements, which allow to obtain unbiased estimators for the variance, estimate the PC variability due to limited samples, and adapt the expansion. An attenuation-only test case is provided to illustrate and discuss the results.</description>

      <title>A multiscale cavity method for sublinear-rank symmetric matrix factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a statistical model for symmetric matrix factorization with additive Gaussian noise in the high-dimensional regime where the rank $M$ of the signal matrix to infer scales with its size $N$ as $M = o(N^{1/10})$. Allowing for a $N$-dependent rank offers new challenges and requires new methods. Working in the Bayesian-optimal setting, we show that whenever the signal has i.i.d. entries the limiting mutual information between signal and data is given by a variational formula involving a rank-one replica symmetric potential. In other words, from the information-theoretic perspective, the case of a (slowly) growing rank is the same as when $M = 1$ (namely, the standard spiked Wigner model). The proof is primarily based on a novel multiscale cavity method allowing for growing rank along with some information-theoretic identities on worst noise for the Gaussian vector channel. We believe that the cavity method developed here will play a role in the analysis of a broader class of inference and spin models where the degrees of freedom are large arrays instead of vectors.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Expansions of the Limit Laws of Gaussian and Laguerre (Wishart) Ensembles at the Soft Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large-matrix limit laws of the rescaled largest eigenvalue of the orthogonal, unitary and symplectic $n$-dimensional Gaussian ensembles -- and of the corresponding Laguerre ensembles (Wishart distributions) for various regimes of the parameter $\alpha$ (degrees of freedom $p$) -- are known to be the Tracy-Widom distributions $F_\beta$ ($\beta=1,2,4$). We will establish (paying particular attention to large, or small, ratios $p/n$) that, with careful choices of the rescaling constants and the expansion parameter $h$, the limit laws embed into asymptotic expansions in powers of $h$, where $h \asymp n^{-2/3}$ resp. $h \asymp (n\,\wedge\,p)^{-2/3}$. We find explicit analytic expressions of the first few expansions terms as linear combinations, with rational polynomial coefficients, of higher order derivatives of the limit law $F_\beta$. With a proper parametrization, the expansions in the Gaussian cases can be understood, for given $n$, as the limit $p\to\infty$ of the Laguerre cases. Whereas the results for $\beta=2$ are presented with proof, the discussion of the cases $\beta=1,4$ is based on some hypotheses, focussing on the algebraic aspects of actually computing the polynomial coefficients. For the purposes of illustration and validation, the various results are checked against simulation data with a sample size of a thousand million.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce isotonic conditional laws (ICL) which extend the classical notion of conditional laws by the additional requirement that there exists an isotonic relationship between the random variable of interest and the conditioning random object. We show existence and uniqueness of ICL building on conditional expectations given $\sigma$-lattices. ICL corresponds to a classical conditional law if and only if the latter is already isotonic. ICL is motivated from a statistical point of view by showing that ICL emerges equivalently as the minimizer of an expected score where the scoring rule may be taken from a large class comprising the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS). Furthermore, ICL is calibrated in the sense that it is invariant to certain conditioning operations, and the corresponding event probabilities and quantiles are simultaneously optimal with respect to all relevant scoring functions. We develop a new notion of general conditional functionals given $\sigma$-lattices which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On the Gaussian product inequality conjecture for disjoint principal minors of Wishart random matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends various results related to the Gaussian product inequality (GPI) conjecture to the setting of disjoint principal minors of Wishart random matrices. This includes product-type inequalities for matrix-variate analogs of completely monotone functions and Bernstein functions of Wishart disjoint principal minors, respectively. In particular, the product-type inequalities apply to inverse determinant powers. Quantitative versions of the inequalities are also obtained when there is a mix of positive and negative exponents. Furthermore, an extended form of the GPI is shown to hold for the eigenvalues of Wishart random matrices by virtue of their law being multivariate totally positive of order~2 ($\mathrm{MTP}_2$). A new, unexplored avenue of research is presented to study the GPI from the point of view of elliptical distributions.</description>

      <title>Learning and Decision-Making with Data: Optimal Formulations and Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.06911v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of designing optimal learning and decision-making formulations when only historical data is available. Prior work typically commits to a particular class of data-driven formulation and subsequently tries to establish out-of-sample performance guarantees. We take here the opposite approach. We define first a sensible yard stick with which to measure the quality of any data-driven formulation and subsequently seek to find an optimal such formulation. Informally, any data-driven formulation can be seen to balance a measure of proximity of the estimated cost to the actual cost while guaranteeing a level of out-of-sample performance. Given an acceptable level of out-of-sample performance, we construct explicitly a data-driven formulation that is uniformly closer to the true cost than any other formulation enjoying the same out-of-sample performance. We show the existence of three distinct out-of-sample performance regimes (a superexponential regime, an exponential regime and a subexponential regime) between which the nature of the optimal data-driven formulation experiences a phase transition. The optimal data-driven formulations can be interpreted as a classically robust formulation in the superexponential regime, an entropic distributionally robust formulation in the exponential regime and finally a variance penalized formulation in the subexponential regime. This final observation unveils a surprising connection between these three, at first glance seemingly unrelated, data-driven formulations which until now remained hidden.</description>

      <title>Empirical study of periodic autoregressive models with additive noise -- estimation and testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodic autoregressive (PAR) time series with finite variance is considered as one of the most common models of second-order cyclostationary processes. However, in the real applications, the signals with periodic characteristics may be disturbed by additional noise related to measurement device disturbances or to other external sources. Thus, the known estimation techniques dedicated for PAR models may be inefficient for such cases. When the variance of the additive noise is relatively small, it can be ignored and the classical estimation techniques can be applied. However, for extreme cases, the additive noise can have a significant influence on the estimation results. In this paper, we propose four estimation techniques for the noise-corrupted PAR models with finite variance distributions. The methodology is based on Yule-Walker equations utilizing the autocovariance function. It can be used for any type of the finite variance additive noise. The presented simulation study clearly indicates the efficiency of the proposed techniques, also for extreme case, when the additive noise is a sum of the Gaussian additive noise and additive outliers. The proposed estimation techniques are also applied for testing if the data corresponds to noise-corrupted PAR model. This issue is strongly related to the identification of informative component in the data in case when the model is disturbed by additive non-informative noise. The power of the test is studied for simulated data. Finally, the testing procedure is applied for two real time series describing particulate matter concentration in the air.</description>
