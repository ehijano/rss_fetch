      <title>Multiscaling in the Rough Bergomi Model: A Tale of Tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rough Bergomi (rBergomi) model, characterised by its roughness parameter $H$, has been shown to exhibit multiscaling behaviour as $H$ approaches zero. Multiscaling has profound implications for financial modelling: it affects extreme risk estimation, influences optimal portfolio allocation across different time horizons, and challenges traditional option pricing approaches that assume uniscaling behaviours. Understanding whether multiscaling arises primarily from the roughness of volatility paths or from the resulting fat-tailed returns has important implications for financial modelling, option pricing, and risk management. This paper investigates the real source of this multiscaling behaviour by introducing a novel two-stage statistical testing procedure. In the first stage, we establish the presence of multiscaling in the rBergomi model against an uniscaling fractional Brownian motion process. We quantify multiscaling by using weighted least squares regression that accounts for heteroscedastic estimation errors across moments. In the second stage, we apply shuffled surrogates that preserve return distributions while destroying temporal correlations. This is done by using distance-based permutation tests robust to asymmetric null distributions. In order to validate our procedure, we check the robustness of the results by using synthetic processes with known multifractal properties, namely the Multifractal Random Walk (MRW) and the Fractional L\'evy Stable Motion (FLSM). We provide compelling evidence that multiscaling in the rBergomi model arises primarily from fat-tailed return distributions rather than memory effects. Our findings suggest that the apparent multiscaling in rough volatility models is largely attributable to distributional properties rather than genuine temporal scaling behaviour.</description>

      <title>Regime-Dependent Predictive Structure Between Equity Factors: Evidence from Granger Causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We document regime-dependent predictive structure between equity factors using 35 years of Fama-French data (1990-2024). We find that Value (HML) Granger-causes Size (SMB) during crisis regimes (p &lt; 1e-4, 9-day lag) but not during normal conditions, validating across 5 of 6 historical stress events (2008, 2011, 2015, 2018, 2020). Regimes are identified via a Student-t HMM, which detects moderate crises such as 2011 (69%) that Gaussian models miss entirely (0%). Although the relationship does not yield trading profits, the 9-day lead time may support risk management decisions. We note that Granger causality implies temporal precedence, not structural causality, and that common drivers could explain the pattern; our economic interpretation is a hypothesis rather than a verified mechanism.</description>

      <title>Fast Times, Slow Times: Timescale Separation in Financial Timeseries Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial time series exhibit multiscale behavior, with interaction between multiple processes operating on different timescales. This paper introduces a method for separating these processes using variance and tail stationarity criteria, framed as generalized eigenvalue problems. The approach allows for the identification of slow and fast components in asset returns and prices, with applications to parameter drift, mean reversion, and tail risk management. Empirical examples using currencies, equity ETFs and treasury yields illustrate the practical utility of the method.</description>
