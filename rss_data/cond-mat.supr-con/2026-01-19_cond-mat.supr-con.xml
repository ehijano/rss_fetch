      <title>Widefield NV Magnetic Field Reconstruction for Probing the Meissner Effect and Critical Current Density under Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial distribution of a magnetic field can be determined with micrometer resolution using widefield nitrogen vacancy (NV) center magnetic imaging. Nevertheless, reconstructing the magnetic field from the raw data can be challenging due to the degeneracy of the four possible NV axes and the tremendous amount of data. While a qualitative approach is sufficient for most analyses, a quantitative analysis offers deeper insight into the physical system. Here, we apply NV widefield magnetic imaging to a HgBa$_{2}$Ca$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Hg-1223) superconducting microcrystal at a pressure of 4 GPa. We fit the results with solutions from the Hamiltonian describing the NV center ground state and take into account the relative intensities of the resonances to determine the local magnetic field magnitude and angle. Thus, we reconstruct the temperature-dependent expulsion of the magnetic field due to the Meissner effect around the superconductor. By comparing the resulting parameters to Brandt's model, which describes the magnetic behavior of a type-II superconductor, we extract the critical current density $j_c$. Overall, this work showcases the first widefield quantitative reconstruction of the Meissner effect under pressure and an optical method to study critical current density. Thus, it provides new insights into the application of NV magnetometry to superconductivity research at high pressures.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity from the Slater mode: Application to KTaO3 heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity has been observed for the 2D electron gas (2DEG) at the interface of KTaO3 with other oxides, with a transition temperature about an order of magnitude higher than its 3d cousin SrTiO3. The superconducting transition temperature is strongly dependent on the orientation of the interface. Motivated by this observation, we study pairing due to exchange of the soft transverse optic phonon mode characteristic of quantum paraelectrics and use the resulting theory to comment on the nature of superconductivity of this 2DEG. We find (1) an orientation dependence consistent with experiment along with an anisotropic gap function, but (2) a BCS coupling constant that is smaller than needed and so must be augmented by contributions from other phonons to be consistent with the observed values of Tc.</description>

      <title>Coexisting electronic smectic liquid crystal and superconductivity in a Si square-net semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic nematic and smectic liquid crystals are spontaneous symmetry-breaking phases that are seen to precede or coexist with enigmatic unconventional superconducting states in multiple classes of materials. In this Letter we describe scanning tunneling microscopy observations of a short ranged charge stripe (smectic) order in NaAlSi, whose superconductivity is speculated to have an unconventional origin. As well as this we resolve a clear spatial modulation of the superconducting gap amplitude, which arises due to the intertwined superconducting and smectic orders. Numerical calculations help to understand the possible driving mechanism as a suppression of kinetic energy on the Fermi surface formed in part by two large, flat-topped hole pockets of p-orbital character.</description>

      <title>Majorana Zero Modes and Topological Nature in Bi2Ta3S6-family Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we report that Bi2Ta3S6-family superconductors exhibit nontrivial band topology. They possess a natural quantum-well structure consisting of alternating stacks of TaS2 and honeycomb Bi layers, which contribute superconducting and topological properties, respectively. Symmetry-based indicators $(\mathbb{Z}_4;\mathbb{Z}_{2}\mathbb{Z}_{2}\mathbb{Z}_{2})=(2;000)$ reveal that the topological nature arises entirely from the Bi layers, which belong to a quantum spin Hall phase characterized by a $p_x-p_y$ model on a honeycomb lattice. The topological zigzag (ZZ) and armchair (AC) edge states are obtained. Using VASP2KP, the in-plane $g$ factors of these topological edge states are computed from the ab initio calculations: $g_{x/y}^{\mathrm{ZZ}}=2.07/1.60$ and $g_{x/y}^{\mathrm{AC}}=0.50/0.06$. The strong anisotropy of the edge-state $g$ factors allows us to explore Majorana zero modes in the Bi monolayer on a superconductor, which can be obtained by exfoliation or molecular beam epitaxy. The relaxed structures of the Bi2Ta3Se6, Bi2Nb3S6 and Bi2Nb3Se6 are obtained. Their superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ are estimated based on the electron-phonon coupling and the McMillan formula. Furthermore, using the experimental superconducting gap $\Delta$ and the computed $g$ factors, we obtain the phase diagram, which shows that the in-plane field $B_y&gt;2.62\mathrm{ T}$ can generate corner Majorana zero modes in the Bi monolayer of the superconductor Bi2Ta3S6. A similar paradigm also applies to the Bi2Ta3S6 bulk with the emergence of Majorana hinge states. These natural quantum-well superconductors therefore offer ideal platforms for exploring topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes.</description>

      <title>Oriented Triplet $p$-Wave Pairing from Fermi surface Anisotropy and Nonlocal Attraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo, we map the ground-state phase diagram versus the nearest-neighbor (NN) attraction $V$ and spin-dependent hopping anisotropy $\alpha$ for the two-dimensional attractive $t$--$U$--$V$ Hubbard model at filling $n\simeq0.85$. We identify an onsite $s$-wave superfluid, a Cooper pair Bose metal with an uncondensed Bose surface, and an oriented equal-spin triplet $p$-wave pairing phase. The NN attraction activates the odd-parity channel, while hopping anisotropy suppresses the competing $s$-wave coherence and selects a $p_x/p_y$ polar axis, and thus lowers the critical $|V_c|$ for the onset of triplet-dominant $p$-wave pairing. A channel-resolved Landau analysis provides a criterion for the Landau $p$-wave scale $V_c^{\mathrm L}(\alpha)$, consistent with the observed anisotropy dependence of $|V_c|$. Our results establish how NN interaction and Fermi surface anisotropy cooperate to generate the oriented triplet $p$-wave pairing, and suggest that cold-atom and altermagnetic platforms could potentially realize this mechanism.</description>

      <title>Vacuum-selected timescales in driven Josephson systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that the intrinsic timescale of a Josephson junction can be controlled through dynamical vacuum selection. By applying a Kapitza-like high-frequency drive to the system, the effective Josephson potential is reshaped, allowing for the stabilization of inphase or antiphase configuration. As a result, the Josephson plasma frequency, that is, the clock frequency of the junction, becomes a tunable property of the selected vacuum. Our findings establish a vacuum-controlled Josephson clock principle, in which the dynamical vacuum acts as an internal reference that fixes the operational timescale of Josephson oscillations, rather than this scale being imposed externally.</description>

      <title>Surface Functional Renormalization Group for Layered Quantum Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an extension to the two-dimensional functional renormalization group to efficiently treat interactions on the surface or at interfaces of three-dimensional systems. As an application, we consider a semi-infinite stack of two-dimensional square lattices, including a Hubbard interaction on the surface layer and an alternating interlayer coupling. We investigate how strongly correlated states of the decoupled two-dimensional Hubbard model on the surface evolve under inclusion of such an SSH-like interlayer coupling. For large parts of the phase diagram as a function of the interlayer hopping parameters, the physics of the two-dimensional system prevails, with antiferromagnetic, superconducting d-wave, and ferromagnetic correlations taking center stage. However, for intermediate interlayer couplings the superconducting state at intermediate interaction strengths separates into two regimes by a small region of incommensurate spin-density-wave and spin-bond order, enabling the potential realization of chiral spin-bond order.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Excitations of a Half-Filled Tl-based Cuprate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong electron correlations drive Mott insulator transitions. Yet, there exists no framework to classify Mott insulators by their degree of correlation. Cuprate superconductors, with their tunable doping and rich phase diagrams, offer a unique platform to investigate the evolution of these interactions. However, spectroscopic access to a clean half-filled Mott-insulating state is lacking in compounds with the highest superconducting onset temperature. To fill this gap, we introduce a pristine, half-filled thallium-based cuprate system, Tl$_2$Ba$_5$Cu$_4$O$_{x}$. Using high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, we probe long-lived magnon excitations and uncover a pronounced kink in the magnon dispersion, marked by a simultaneous change in group velocity and lifetime broadening. Modeling the dispersion within a Hubbard-Heisenberg approach, we extract the interaction strength and compare it with other cuprate systems. Our results establish a cuprate universal relation between electron-electron interaction and magnon zone-boundary dispersion. Superconductivity seems to be optimal at intermediate correlation strength, suggesting an optimal balance between localization and itinerancy.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing and Tuning Superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ Films: Oxygen Recycling Protocol Reveals Hole-Doping Analogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent achievement of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ with transition temperatures exceeding 40 K in thin films under compressive strain and 80 K in bulk crystals under high pressure opens new avenues for research on high-temperature superconductivity. The realization of superconductivity in thin films requires delicate control of growth conditions, which presents significant challenges in the synthesis process. Furthermore, the stability of superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ films is compromised by oxygen loss, which complicates their characterization. We introduce an effective recycling protocol that involves oxygen removal in a precursor phase followed by ozone-assisted annealing, which restores superconducting properties. By tuning the oxygen content, we construct an electronic phase diagram that highlights oxygen addition as a potential analogue to hole doping via La substitution with Sr, providing insights into the doping mechanism and guiding future material optimization.</description>

      <title>Angular momentum of vortex-core Majorana zero modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are highly sought-after states with a possible application in quantum computation. Here, we show that vortex-core MZMs can carry a nontrivial angular momentum. This establishes new `flavors' of Majorana modes, independent of the Chern classification of topological superconductors. The MZM angular momentum is explicitly calculated for a microscopic model of a $d+id$ superconductor placed on a three-dimensional topological insulator ($d+id+\phantom{}$Dirac model) using both exact diagonalization and the Chebyshev expansion. We classify all possible quantum numbers of MZMs depending on the windings of the order parameter and underlying normal state. The topological protection of the MZM is set by the bulk gap, quasiparticle poisoning by trivial in-gap states, and its localization length. All these severely limit the stability of MZMs in the $d+id+\phantom{}$Dirac model, in contrast to earlier claims. Nevertheless, the possibility of having different flavors of MZM - in the form of angular momentum or something else - can provide a unique path forward for the study of MZMs.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory for the superfluid vortex lattice from coset construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Guided by symmetry principles, we construct an effective field theory that captures the long-wavelength dynamics of two-dimensional vortex crystals observed in rotating Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in a harmonic potential. By embedding the system into Newton--Cartan spacetime and analyzing its isometries, we identify the appropriate spacetime symmetry group for trapped condensates at finite angular momentum. After introducing a coarse-grained description of the vortex lattice we consider a homogeneous equilibrium configuration and discuss the associated symmetry breaking pattern. We apply the coset construction method to identify covariant structures that enter the effective action and discuss the physical interpretation of the inverse Higgs constraints. We verify that Kohn's theorem is satisfied within our construction and subsequently focus on the gapless sector of the theory. In this regime, the effective theory accommodates a single gapless excitation--the Tkachenko mode--for which we construct both the leading-order and next-to-leading-order actions, the latter including cubic interaction terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of correlated electron phases in rhombohedral $N$-layer graphene due to two-valley Coulomb interactions within a low-energy $k \cdot p$ framework. Analytical expressions for Lindhard susceptibilities in intra- and intervalley channels are derived, and the critical temperatures for phase transitions are estimated using both the random phase approximation (RPA) and the parquet approximation (PA). Within RPA, only Stoner and intervalley coherent (IVC) phases are supported, while the PA reveals a richer phase structure including particle-particle (PP) channel instabilities. We establish a general scaling law for the critical temperature with respect to layer number $N$, highlighting an upper bound as $N \rightarrow \infty$, and demonstrate a non-monotonic decrease of the critical temperature with increasing chemical potential. The PA uncovers the role of interaction symmetry: $SU(4)$-symmetric interactions favor intervalley Stoner order in the density channel, whereas $SU(2) \times SU(2)$-symmetric interactions permit a broader set of phases. A crossover in the dominant instability occurs in the particle-hole channel at a critical layer number, suggesting the emergence of magnetic or IVC phases in thicker systems. We also identify conditions under which pair-density wave (PDW) order could form in the PP channel, though its physical realization may be constrained.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive framework for constructing various architectures of globally driven quantum computers, with a focus on superconducting qubits. Our approach leverages static inhomogeneities in the Rabi frequencies of qubits controlled by a common classical pulse -- a technique we refer to as the "crossed-qubit" method. We detail the essential components and design principles required to realize such systems, highlighting how global control can be harnessed to perform local operations, enabling universal quantum computation. This framework offers a scalable pathway toward quantum processors by striking a balance between wiring complexity and computational efficiency, with potential applications in addressing current challenges to scalability.</description>

Abstract: Two of the iconic phases of the hole-doped cuprate materials are the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal and the lower temperature $d$-wave superconductor. Following the prescient suggestion of P. W. Anderson, there were numerous early theories of these phases as doped quantum spin liquids. However, these theories have had difficulties with two prominent observations:
  (i) angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements (ADMR) in the pseudogap metal, including observation of the Yamaji effect, present convincing evidence of small hole pockets which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers (Fang et al., Nature Physics 18, 558 (2022); Chan et al., Nature Physics 21, 1753 (2025)) and
  (ii) the velocities of the nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the $d$-wave superconductor are highly anisotropic, with $v_F \gg v_\Delta$ (Chiao et al., Phys. Rev. B 62, 3554 (2000)).
  These lecture notes review how the fractionalized Fermi Liquid (FL*) state, which dopes quantum spin liquids with gauge-neutral electron-like quasiparticles, resolves both difficulties. Theories of insulating quantum spin liquids employing fractionalization of the electron spin into bosonic or fermionic partons are discussed. Doping the bosonic parton theory leads to a holon metal theory: while not appropriate for the cuprate pseudogap, this theory is argued to apply to the Lieb lattice. Doping the fermionic parton theory leads to a $d$-wave superconductor with nearly isotropic quasiparticle velocities. The construction of the FL* state in a single band Hubbard-type model is described using a quantum dimer model, followed by a more realistic description using the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM), which is then used to obtain the theory of the pseudogap and the $d$-wave superconductor.</description>
