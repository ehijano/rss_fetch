      <title>Twisted cocycle for interval exchange transformations: Invariant structures and Lyapunov spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the algebraic and dynamical properties of the twisted cocycle, a $\mathrm{GL}(d, \mathbb{C})$-valued cocycle defined over the toral extension of the Zorich (Rauzy-Veech) renormalization for interval exchange transformations (IET). As a natural generalization of the Zorich cocycle, the twisted cocycle plays a central role in studying the asymptotic growth of twisted Birkhoff sums which in turn provide a suitable tool for obtaining fine spectral information about IETs and translation flows such as the local dimension of spectral measures and quantitative weak mixing. Although it shares similarities with the classical (untwisted) Zorich cocycle, structural differences make its analysis more challenging. Our results yield a block-form decomposition into invariant and covariant subbundles allowing us to demonstrate the existence of $\kappa+1$ zero exponents with respect to a large class of natural invariant measures where $\kappa$ is an explicit integer depending on the permutation. We establish the symmetry of the Lyapunov spectrum by showing the existence of a family of non-degenerate invariant symplectic forms. As a corollary, we prove that for rotation-type permutations, the twisted cocycle has a degenerate Lyapunov spectrum with respect to certain natural ergodic invariant measures in contrast with the higher genus case where the existence of at least one positive Lyapunov exponent is guaranteed by previous work of the authors. In the appendix, we apply our result about the invariant section to substitution systems and prove the pure singularity of the spectrum for a substantially large class of substitutions on two letters, while greatly simplifying the proof for some systems previously known to have this property.</description>

      <title>Predator-prey models: a review on some recent adaptations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last years, predator-prey systems have increased their applications and have given rise to systems which represent more accurately different biological issues that appear in the context of interacting species. Our aim in this paper is to give a state-of-art review of recent predator-prey models which include some interesting characteristics as Allee effect, fear effect, cannibalism and immigration. We compare the qualitative results obtained for each of them, particularly regarding the equilibria, local and global stability, and the existence of limit cycles.</description>

      <title>Stochastic multisymplectic PDEs and their structure-preserving numerical methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct stochastic multisymplectic systems by considering a stochastic extension to the variational formulation of multisymplectic partial differential equations proposed in [Hydon, {\it Proc. R. Soc. A}, 461, 1627--1637, 2005]. The stochastic variational principle implies the existence of stochastic $1$-form and $2$-form conservation laws, as well as conservation laws arising from continuous variational symmetries via a stochastic Noether's theorem. These results are the stochastic analogues of those found in deterministic variational principles. Furthermore, we develop stochastic structure-preserving collocation methods for this class of stochastic multisymplectic systems. These integrators possess a discrete analogue of the stochastic $2$-form conservation law and, in the case of linear systems, also guarantee discrete momentum conservation. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated through their application to stochastic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations featuring either stochastic transport or stochastic dispersion.</description>

      <title>The cyclicity of hyperbolic hemicycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider families of planar polynomial vector fields of degree $n$ and study the cyclicity of a type of unbounded polycycle~$\Gamma$ called hemicycle. Compactified to the Poincar\'e disc,~$\Gamma$ consists of an affine straight line together with half of the line at infinity and has two singular points, which are hyperbolic saddles located at infinity. We prove four main results. Theorem A deals with the cyclicity of~$\Gamma$ when perturbed without breaking the saddle connections. For the other results we consider the case $n=2$. More concretely they are addressed to the quadratic integrable systems belonging to the class $Q_3^R$ and having two hemicycles, $\Gamma_u$ and $\Gamma_\ell$, surrounding each one a center. Theorem B gives the cyclicity of $\Gamma_u$ and $\Gamma_\ell$ when perturbed inside the whole family of quadratic systems. In Theorem C we study the number of limit cycles bifurcating simultaneously from $\Gamma_u$ and $\Gamma_\ell$ when perturbed as well inside the whole family of quadratic systems. Finally, in Theorem D we show that for three specific cases there exists a simultaneous alien limit cycle bifurcation from $\Gamma_u$ and $\Gamma_\ell$.</description>

      <title>Memorization and Regularization in Generative Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful framework for generative modeling. At the heart of the methodology is score matching: learning gradients of families of log-densities for noisy versions of the data distribution at different scales. When the loss function adopted in score matching is evaluated using empirical data, rather than the population loss, the minimizer corresponds to the score of a time-dependent Gaussian mixture. However, use of this analytically tractable minimizer leads to data memorization: in both unconditioned and conditioned settings, the generative model returns the training samples. This paper contains an analysis of the dynamical mechanism underlying memorization. The analysis highlights the need for regularization to avoid reproducing the analytically tractable minimizer; and, in so doing, lays the foundations for a principled understanding of how to regularize. Numerical experiments investigate the properties of: (i) Tikhonov regularization; (ii) regularization designed to promote asymptotic consistency; and (iii) regularizations induced by under-parameterization of a neural network or by early stopping when training a neural network. These experiments are evaluated in the context of memorization, and directions for future development of regularization are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Geometric calculations on density manifolds from reciprocal relations in hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamics are systems of equations describing the evolution of macroscopic states in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. From generalized Onsager reciprocal relationships, one can formulate a class of hydrodynamics as gradient flows of free energies. In recent years, Onsager gradient flows have been widely investigated in optimal transport-type metric spaces with nonlinear mobilities, namely hydrodynamical density manifolds. This paper studies geometric calculations in these hydrodynamical density manifolds. We first formulate Levi-Civita connections, gradient, Hessian, and parallel transport and then derive Riemannian and sectional curvatures on density manifolds. We last present closed formulas for sectional curvatures of density manifolds in one dimensional spaces, in which the sign of curvatures is characterized by the convexities of mobilities. For example, we present density manifolds and their sectional curvatures in zero-range models, such as independent particles, simple exclusion processes, and Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti models.</description>

      <title>Modeling Cost-Associated Cooperation: A Dilemma of Species Interaction Unveiling New Aspects of Fear Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With limited resources, competition is widespread, yet cooperation persists across taxa, from microorganisms to large mammals. Recent observations reveal contingent factors often drive cooperative interactions, with the intensity heterogeneously distributed within species. While cooperation has beneficial outcomes, it may also incur significant costs, largely depending on species density. This creates a dilemma that is pivotal in shaping sustainable cooperation strategies. Understanding how cooperation intensity governs the cost-benefit balance, and whether an optimal strategy exists for species survival, is a fundamental question in ecological research, and the focus of this study. We develop a novel mathematical model within the Lotka-Volterra framework to explore the dynamics of cost-associated partial cooperation, which remains relatively unexplored in ODE model-based studies. Our findings demonstrate that partial cooperation benefits ecosystems up to a certain intensity, beyond which costs become dominant, leading to system collapse via heteroclinic bifurcation. This outcome captures the cost-cooperation dilemma, providing insights for adopting sustainable strategies and resource management for species survival. We propose a novel mathematical approach to detect and track heteroclinic orbits in predator-prey systems. Moreover, we show that introducing fear of predation can protect the regime shift, even with a type-I functional response, challenging traditional ecological views. Although fear is known to resolve the "paradox of enrichment," our results suggest that certain levels of partial cooperation can reestablish this dynamic even at higher fear intensity. Finally, we validate the system's dynamical robustness across functional responses through structural sensitivity analysis.</description>

      <title>Generating fractal functions associated with Suzuki iterated function systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article constructs a fractal interpolation function, also referred to as $\alpha$-fractal function, using Suzuki-type generalized $\varphi$-contraction mappings (STGPC). The STGPC is a generalization of $\varphi$-contraction mappings. The process of constructing $\alpha$-fractal functions using the STGPC is detailed, and examples of STGPC are given. The FIF has broad applications in data analysis, finance and price prediction. We have included a case study analyzing the price volatility of spinach in the Azadpur vegetable market in New Delhi. The fractal analysis gives a unique perspective on understanding price fluctuations over a period. Finally, the box-dimensional analysis is presented to comprehend the complexity of price fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study criteria for the existence of a dense or comeager conjugacy class in the automorphism group of a given measure on the Cantor space. We concentrate on good measures, defined by Akin [\emph{Trans.\ Amer.\ Math.\ Soc.} \textbf{357} (2005), no. 7, 2681--2722], which we characterize as a particular subclass of ultrahomogeneous measures. We determine good measures with rational values on clopen sets whose automorphism group admits a comeager conjugacy class. Our approach uses the Fra\"{i}ss\'{e} theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.07270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An S-adic system is a symbolic dynamical system generated by iterating an infinite sequence of substitutions or morphisms, called a directive sequence. A finitary S-adic dynamical system is one where the directive sequence consists of morphisms selected from a finite set. We study eigenvalues and coboundaries for finitary recognizable S-adic dynamical systems, i.e., those where points can be uniquely desubstituted using the given sequence of morphisms. To do this we identify the notions of straightness and essential words, and use them to define a coboundary, inspired by of Host's formalism, which allows us to express necessary and sufficient conditions that a complex number must satisfy in order to be a continuous or measurable eigenvalue. We then apply our results to finitary directive sequences of substitutions of constant length, and show how to create constant-length $S$-adic shifts with non-trivial coboundaries. We show that in this case all continuous eigenvalues are rational and we give a complete description of the rationals that can be an eigenvalue, indicating how this leads to a Cobham-style result for these systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00679v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural stability of holomorphic functions has been the subject of much research in the last fifty years. Due to various technicalities, however, most of that work has focused on so-called finite-type functions (functions whose set of singular values has finite cardinality). Recent developments in the field go beyond this setting. In this paper we extend Eremenko and Lyubich's result on natural families of entire maps to the case where the set of singular values is not the entire complex plane, showing under this assumption that the set $M_f$ of entire functions quasiconformally equivalent to $f$ admits the structure of a complex manifold (of possibly infinite dimension). Moreover, we will consider functions with wandering domains -- another hot topic of research in complex dynamics. Given an entire function $f$ with a simply connected wandering domain $U$, we construct an analogue of the multiplier of a periodic orbit, called a distortion sequence, and show that, under some hypotheses, the distortion sequence moves analytically as $f$ moves within appropriate parameter families.</description>

Abstract: Using Marden's Theorem from geometric theory of polynomials, we show that for every triangle there is a unique ellipse such that the triangle is a billiard trajectory within that ellipse. Since $3$-periodic trajectories of billiards within ellipses are examples of the Poncelet polygons, our considerations provide a new insight into the relationship between Marden's Theorem and the Poncelet Porism, two gems of exceptional classical beauty. We also show that every parallelogram is a billiard trajectory within a unique ellipse. We prove a similar result for the self-intersecting polygonal lines consisting of two pairs of congruent sides, named "Darboux butterflies". In each of three considered cases, we effectively calculate the foci of the boundary ellipses.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we investigate the coboundaries of interval exchange transformations of 3 intervals (3-IETs). More precisely, we show that a differentiable function with absolutely continuous derivative with bounded variation, whose integral and integral of its derivative is 0, is a coboundary for typical 3-IET if and only if the values at the endpoints of the domain are zero. We also show the existence of rare counterexamples for both cases of possible values at the endpoints of the interval. We obtain our result by studying the properties of associated skew products.</description>

Abstract: We extend the key formula which intertwines multiplicative Markoff-Lagrange spectrum and symbolic dynamics. The proof uses complex analysis and elucidates the strategy of the problem. Moreover, the new method applies to a wide variety of polynomials possibly having multiple roots. We derive several consequences of this formula, which are expected on the Markoff-Lagrange spectrum.</description>

Abstract: We aim to establish Bowen's equations for upper capacity invariance pressure and Pesin-Pitskel invariance pressure of discrete-time control systems. We first introduce a new invariance pressure called induced invariance pressure on partitions that specializes the upper capacity invariance pressure on partitions, and then show that the two types of invariance pressures are related by a Bowen's equation. Besides, to establish Bowen's equation for Pesin-Pitskel invariance pressure on partitions we also introduce a new notion called BS invariance dimension on subsets. Moreover, a variational principle for BS invariance dimension on subsets is established.</description>

Abstract: Safety-critical failures often have fatal consequences in aerospace control. Control systems on aircraft, therefore, must ensure the strict satisfaction of safety constraints, preferably with formal guarantees of safe behavior. This paper establishes the safety-critical control of fixed-wing aircraft in collision avoidance and geofencing tasks. A control framework is developed wherein a run-time assurance (RTA) system modulates the nominal flight controller of the aircraft whenever necessary to prevent it from colliding with other aircraft or crossing a boundary (geofence) in space. The RTA is formulated as a safety filter using control barrier functions (CBFs) with formal guarantees of safe behavior. CBFs are constructed and compared for a nonlinear kinematic fixed-wing aircraft model. The proposed CBF-based controllers showcase the capability of safely executing simultaneous collision avoidance and geofencing, as demonstrated by simulations on the kinematic model and a high-fidelity dynamical model.</description>
