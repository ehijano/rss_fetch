      <title>Cross-Platform Neural Video Coding: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first show that current learning-based video codecs, specifically the SSF codec, are not suitable for real-world applications due to the mismatch between the encoder and decoder caused by floating-point round-off errors. To address this issue, we propose the static quantization of the hyper prior decoding path. The quantization parameters are determined through an exhaustive search of all possible combinations of observers and quantization schemes from PyTorch. For the SSF codec, when encoding and decoding on different machines, the proposed solution effectively mitigates the mismatch issue and enhances compression efficiency results by preventing severe image quality degradation. When encoding and decoding are performed on the same machine, it constrains the average BD-rate increase to 9.93% and 9.02% for UVG and HEVC-B sequences, respectively.</description>

      <title>Document Parsing Unveiled: Techniques, Challenges, and Prospects for Structured Information Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Document parsing is essential for converting unstructured and semi-structured documents-such as contracts, academic papers, and invoices-into structured, machine-readable data. Document parsing extract reliable structured data from unstructured inputs, providing huge convenience for numerous applications. Especially with recent achievements in Large Language Models, document parsing plays an indispensable role in both knowledge base construction and training data generation. This survey presents a comprehensive review of the current state of document parsing, covering key methodologies, from modular pipeline systems to end-to-end models driven by large vision-language models. Core components such as layout detection, content extraction (including text, tables, and mathematical expressions), and multi-modal data integration are examined in detail. Additionally, this paper discusses the challenges faced by modular document parsing systems and vision-language models in handling complex layouts, integrating multiple modules, and recognizing high-density text. It emphasizes the importance of developing larger and more diverse datasets and outlines future research directions.</description>

      <title>Less Cybersickness, Please: Demystifying and Detecting Stereoscopic Visual Inconsistencies in Virtual Reality Apps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09313v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quality of Virtual Reality (VR) apps is vital, particularly the rendering quality of the VR Graphical User Interface (GUI). Different from traditional 2D apps, VR apps create a 3D digital scene for users, by rendering two distinct 2D images for the user's left and right eyes, respectively. Stereoscopic visual inconsistency (denoted as "SVI") issues, however, undermine the rendering process of the user's brain, leading to user discomfort and even adverse health effects. Such issues commonly exist but remain underexplored. We conduct an empirical analysis on 282 SVI bug reports from 15 VR platforms, summarizing 15 types of manifestations. The empirical analysis reveals that automatically detecting SVI issues is challenging, mainly because: (1) lack of training data; (2) the manifestations of SVI issues are diverse, complicated, and often application-specific; (3) most accessible VR apps are closed-source commercial software. Existing pattern-based supervised classification approaches may be inapplicable or ineffective in detecting the SVI issues. To counter these challenges, we propose an unsupervised black-box testing framework named StereoID to identify the stereoscopic visual inconsistencies, based only on the rendered GUI states. StereoID generates a synthetic right-eye image based on the actual left-eye image and computes distances between the synthetic right-eye image and the actual right-eye image to detect SVI issues. We propose a depth-aware conditional stereo image translator to power the image generation process, which captures the expected perspective shifts between left-eye and right-eye images. We build a large-scale unlabeled VR stereo screenshot dataset with larger than 171K images from 288 real-world VR apps for experiments. After substantial experiments, StereoID demonstrates superior performance for detecting SVI issues in both user reports and wild VR apps.</description>

      <title>Movie Trailer Genre Classification Using Multimodal Pretrained Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for movie genre classification, capitalizing on a diverse set of readily accessible pretrained models. These models extract high-level features related to visual scenery, objects, characters, text, speech, music, and audio effects. To intelligently fuse these pretrained features, we train small classifier models with low time and memory requirements. Employing the transformer model, our approach utilizes all video and audio frames of movie trailers without performing any temporal pooling, efficiently exploiting the correspondence between all elements, as opposed to the fixed and low number of frames typically used by traditional methods. Our approach fuses features originating from different tasks and modalities, with different dimensionalities, different temporal lengths, and complex dependencies as opposed to current approaches. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art movie genre classification models in terms of precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP). To foster future research, we make the pretrained features for the entire MovieNet dataset, along with our genre classification code and the trained models, publicly available.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Movie Genres through Cross-Attention Fusion of Bi-Modal Synergy of Poster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Movie posters are not just decorative; they are meticulously designed to capture the essence of a movie, such as its genre, storyline, and tone/vibe. For decades, movie posters have graced cinema walls, billboards, and now our digital screens as a form of digital posters. Movie genre classification plays a pivotal role in film marketing, audience engagement, and recommendation systems. Previous explorations into movie genre classification have been mostly examined in plot summaries, subtitles, trailers and movie scenes. Movie posters provide a pre-release tantalizing glimpse into a film's key aspects, which can ignite public interest. In this paper, we presented the framework that exploits movie posters from a visual and textual perspective to address the multilabel movie genre classification problem. Firstly, we extracted text from movie posters using an OCR and retrieved the relevant embedding. Next, we introduce a cross-attention-based fusion module to allocate attention weights to visual and textual embedding. In validating our framework, we utilized 13882 posters sourced from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). The outcomes of the experiments indicate that our model exhibited promising performance and outperformed even some prominent contemporary architectures.</description>

      <title>ScreenWriter: Automatic Screenplay Generation and Movie Summarisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of creative video content has driven demand for textual descriptions or summaries that allow users to recall key plot points or get an overview without watching. The volume of movie content and speed of turnover motivates automatic summarisation, which is nevertheless challenging, requiring identifying character intentions and very long-range temporal dependencies. The few existing methods attempting this task rely heavily on textual screenplays as input, greatly limiting their applicability. In this work, we propose the task of automatic screenplay generation, and a method, ScreenWriter, that operates only on video and produces output which includes dialogue, speaker names, scene breaks, and visual descriptions. ScreenWriter introduces a novel algorithm to segment the video into scenes based on the sequence of visual vectors, and a novel method for the challenging problem of determining character names, based on a database of actors' faces. We further demonstrate how these automatic screenplays can be used to generate plot synopses with a hierarchical summarisation method based on scene breaks. We test the quality of the final summaries on the recent MovieSum dataset, which we augment with videos, and show that they are superior to a number of comparison models which assume access to goldstandard screenplays.</description>

      <title>GiVE: Guiding Visual Encoder to Perceive Overlooked Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models have advanced AI in applications like text-to-video generation and visual question answering. These models rely on visual encoders to convert non-text data into vectors, but current encoders either lack semantic alignment or overlook non-salient objects. We propose the Guiding Visual Encoder to Perceive Overlooked Information (GiVE) approach. GiVE enhances visual representation with an Attention-Guided Adapter (AG-Adapter) module and an Object-focused Visual Semantic Learning module. These incorporate three novel loss terms: Object-focused Image-Text Contrast (OITC) loss, Object-focused Image-Image Contrast (OIIC) loss, and Object-focused Image Discrimination (OID) loss, improving object consideration, retrieval accuracy, and comprehensiveness. Our contributions include dynamic visual focus adjustment, novel loss functions to enhance object retrieval, and the Multi-Object Instruction (MOInst) dataset. Experiments show our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Segmenting Watermarked Texts From Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Watermarking is a technique that involves embedding nearly unnoticeable statistical signals within generated content to help trace its source. This work focuses on a scenario where an untrusted third-party user sends prompts to a trusted language model (LLM) provider, who then generates a text from their LLM with a watermark. This setup makes it possible for a detector to later identify the source of the text if the user publishes it. The user can modify the generated text by substitutions, insertions, or deletions. Our objective is to develop a statistical method to detect if a published text is LLM-generated from the perspective of a detector. We further propose a methodology to segment the published text into watermarked and non-watermarked sub-strings. The proposed approach is built upon randomization tests and change point detection techniques. We demonstrate that our method ensures Type I and Type II error control and can accurately identify watermarked sub-strings by finding the corresponding change point locations. To validate our technique, we apply it to texts generated by several language models with prompts extracted from Google's C4 dataset and obtain encouraging numerical results. We release all code publicly at https://github.com/doccstat/llm-watermark-cpd.</description>

      <title>ByteNet: Rethinking Multimedia File Fragment Classification through Visual Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimedia file fragment classification (MFFC) aims to identify file fragment types, e.g., image/video, audio, and text without system metadata. It is of vital importance in multimedia storage and communication. Existing MFFC methods typically treat fragments as 1D byte sequences and emphasize the relations between separate bytes (interbytes) for classification. However, the more informative relations inside bytes (intrabytes) are overlooked and seldom investigated. By looking inside bytes, the bit-level details of file fragments can be accessed, enabling a more accurate classification. Motivated by this, we first propose Byte2Image, a novel visual representation model that incorporates previously overlooked intrabyte information into file fragments and reinterprets these fragments as 2D grayscale images. This model involves a sliding byte window to reveal the intrabyte information and a rowwise stacking of intrabyte ngrams for embedding fragments into a 2D space. Thus, complex interbyte and intrabyte correlations can be mined simultaneously using powerful vision networks. Additionally, we propose an end-to-end dual-branch network ByteNet to enhance robust correlation mining and feature representation. ByteNet makes full use of the raw 1D byte sequence and the converted 2D image through a shallow byte branch feature extraction (BBFE) and a deep image branch feature extraction (IBFE) network. In particular, the BBFE, composed of a single fully-connected layer, adaptively recognizes the co-occurrence of several some specific bytes within the raw byte sequence, while the IBFE, built on a vision Transformer, effectively mines the complex interbyte and intrabyte correlations from the converted image. Experiments on the two representative benchmarks, including 14 cases, validate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on different cases by up to 12.2%.</description>

      <title>Diff-Instruct*: Towards Human-Preferred One-step Text-to-image Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Diff-Instruct*(DI*), a data-free approach for building one-step text-to-image generative models that align with human preference while maintaining the ability to generate highly realistic images. We frame human preference alignment as online reinforcement learning using human feedback (RLHF), where the goal is to maximize the reward function while regularizing the generator distribution to remain close to a reference diffusion process. Unlike traditional RLHF approaches, which rely on the KL divergence for regularization, we introduce a novel score-based divergence regularization, which leads to significantly better performances. Although the direct calculation of this divergence remains intractable, we demonstrate that we can efficiently compute its \emph{gradient} by deriving an equivalent yet tractable loss function. Remarkably, with Stable Diffusion V1.5 as the reference diffusion model, DI* outperforms \emph{all} previously leading models by a large margin. When using the 0.6B PixelArt-$\alpha$ model as the reference diffusion, DI* achieves a new record Aesthetic Score of 6.30 and an Image Reward of 1.31 with only a single generation step, almost doubling the scores of the rest of the models with similar sizes. It also achieves an HPSv2 score of 28.70, establishing a new state-of-the-art benchmark. We also observe that DI* can improve the layout and enrich the colors of generated images.</description>

      <title>FairStream: Fair Multimedia Streaming Benchmark for Reinforcement Learning Agents</title>

Abstract: Multimedia streaming accounts for the majority of traffic in today's internet. Mechanisms like adaptive bitrate streaming control the bitrate of a stream based on the estimated bandwidth, ideally resulting in smooth playback and a good Quality of Experience (QoE). However, selecting the optimal bitrate is challenging under volatile network conditions. This motivated researchers to train Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents for multimedia streaming. The considered training environments are often simplified, leading to promising results with limited applicability. Additionally, the QoE fairness across multiple streams is seldom considered by recent RL approaches. With this work, we propose a novel multi-agent environment that comprises multiple challenges of fair multimedia streaming: partial observability, multiple objectives, agent heterogeneity and asynchronicity. We provide and analyze baseline approaches across five different traffic classes to gain detailed insights into the behavior of the considered agents, and show that the commonly used Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm is outperformed by a simple greedy heuristic. Future work includes the adaptation of multi-agent RL algorithms and further expansions of the environment.</description>

      <title>Kandinsky 3: Text-to-Image Synthesis for Multifunctional Generative Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models are popular for introducing image manipulation methods, such as editing, image fusion, inpainting, etc. At the same time, image-to-video (I2V) and text-to-video (T2V) models are also built on top of T2I models. We present Kandinsky 3, a novel T2I model based on latent diffusion, achieving a high level of quality and photorealism. The key feature of the new architecture is the simplicity and efficiency of its adaptation for many types of generation tasks. We extend the base T2I model for various applications and create a multifunctional generation system that includes text-guided inpainting/outpainting, image fusion, text-image fusion, image variations generation, I2V and T2V generation. We also present a distilled version of the T2I model, evaluating inference in 4 steps of the reverse process without reducing image quality and 3 times faster than the base model. We deployed a user-friendly demo system in which all the features can be tested in the public domain. Additionally, we released the source code and checkpoints for the Kandinsky 3 and extended models. Human evaluations show that Kandinsky 3 demonstrates one of the highest quality scores among open source generation systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, learned image compression methods have demonstrated superior rate-distortion performance compared to traditional image compression methods. Recent methods utilize convolutional neural networks (CNN), variational autoencoders (VAE), invertible neural networks (INN), and transformers. Despite their significant contributions, a main drawback of these models is their poor performance in capturing local redundancy. Therefore, to leverage global features along with local redundancy, we propose a CNN-based solution integrated with a feature encoding module. The feature encoding module encodes important features before feeding them to the CNN and then utilizes cross-scale window-based attention, which further captures local redundancy. Cross-scale window-based attention is inspired by the attention mechanism in transformers and effectively enlarges the receptive field. Both the feature encoding module and the cross-scale window-based attention module in our architecture are flexible and can be incorporated into any other network architecture. We evaluate our method on the Kodak and CLIC datasets and demonstrate that our approach is effective and on par with state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>OmniSep: Unified Omni-Modality Sound Separation with Query-Mixup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scaling up has brought tremendous success in the fields of vision and language in recent years. When it comes to audio, however, researchers encounter a major challenge in scaling up the training data, as most natural audio contains diverse interfering signals. To address this limitation, we introduce Omni-modal Sound Separation (OmniSep), a novel framework capable of isolating clean soundtracks based on omni-modal queries, encompassing both single-modal and multi-modal composed queries. Specifically, we introduce the Query-Mixup strategy, which blends query features from different modalities during training. This enables OmniSep to optimize multiple modalities concurrently, effectively bringing all modalities under a unified framework for sound separation. We further enhance this flexibility by allowing queries to influence sound separation positively or negatively, facilitating the retention or removal of specific sounds as desired. Finally, OmniSep employs a retrieval-augmented approach known as Query-Aug, which enables open-vocabulary sound separation. Experimental evaluations on MUSIC, VGGSOUND-CLEAN+, and MUSIC-CLEAN+ datasets demonstrate effectiveness of OmniSep, achieving state-of-the-art performance in text-, image-, and audio-queried sound separation tasks.

      <title>Audio-Visual Instance Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new multi-modal task, termed audio-visual instance segmentation (AVIS), which aims to simultaneously identify, segment and track individual sounding object instances in audible videos. To facilitate this research, we introduce a high-quality benchmark named AVISeg, containing over 90K instance masks from 26 semantic categories in 926 long videos. Additionally, we propose a strong baseline model for this task. Our model first localizes sound source within each frame, and condenses object-specific contexts into concise tokens. Then it builds long-range audio-visual dependencies between these tokens using window-based attention, and tracks sounding objects among the entire video sequences. Extensive experiments reveal that our method performs best on AVISeg, surpassing the existing methods from related tasks. We further conduct the evaluation on several multi-modal large models; however, they exhibits subpar performance on instance-level sound source localization and temporal perception. We expect that AVIS will inspire the community towards a more comprehensive multi-modal understanding.</description>

      <title>Joint Explicit and Implicit Cross-Modal Interaction Network for Anterior Chamber Inflammation Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06171v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uveitis demands the precise diagnosis of anterior chamber inflammation (ACI) for optimal treatment. However, current diagnostic methods only rely on a limited single-modal disease perspective, which leads to poor performance. In this paper, we investigate a promising yet challenging way to fuse multimodal data for ACI diagnosis. Notably, existing fusion paradigms focus on empowering implicit modality interactions (i.e., self-attention and its variants), but neglect to inject explicit modality interactions, especially from clinical knowledge and imaging property. To this end, we propose a jointly Explicit and implicit Cross-Modal Interaction Network (EiCI-Net) for Anterior Chamber Inflammation Diagnosis that uses anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) images, slit-lamp images, and clinical data jointly. Specifically, we first develop CNN-Based Encoders and Tabular Processing Module (TPM) to extract efficient feature representations in different modalities. Then, we devise an Explicit Cross-Modal Interaction Module (ECIM) to generate attention maps as a kind of explicit clinical knowledge based on the tabular feature maps, then integrated them into the slit-lamp feature maps, allowing the CNN-Based Encoder to focus on more effective informativeness of the slit-lamp images. After that, the Implicit Cross-Modal Interaction Module (ICIM), a transformer-based network, further implicitly enhances modality interactions. Finally, we construct a considerable real-world dataset from our collaborative hospital and conduct sufficient experiments to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed EiCI-Net compared with the state-of-the-art classification methods in various metrics.</description>

      <title>Veagle: Advancements in Multimodal Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lately, researchers in artificial intelligence have been really interested in how language and vision come together, giving rise to the development of multimodal models that aim to seamlessly integrate textual and visual information. Multimodal models, an extension of Large Language Models (LLMs), have exhibited remarkable capabilities in addressing a diverse array of tasks, ranging from image captioning and visual question answering (VQA) to visual grounding. While these models have showcased significant advancements, challenges persist in accurately interpreting images and answering the question, a common occurrence in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance the multimodal capabilities of existing models. In response to the limitations observed in current Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), our proposed model Veagle, incorporates a unique mechanism inspired by the successes and insights of previous works. Veagle leverages a dynamic mechanism to project encoded visual information directly into the language model. This dynamic approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of intricate details present in visual contexts. To validate the effectiveness of Veagle, we conduct comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets, emphasizing tasks such as visual question answering and image understanding. Our results indicate a improvement of 5-6 \% in performance, with Veagle outperforming existing models by a notable margin. The outcomes underscore the model's versatility and applicability beyond traditional benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Double Mixture: Towards Continual Event Detection from Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech event detection is crucial for multimedia retrieval, involving the tagging of both semantic and acoustic events. Traditional ASR systems often overlook the interplay between these events, focusing solely on content, even though the interpretation of dialogue can vary with environmental context. This paper tackles two primary challenges in speech event detection: the continual integration of new events without forgetting previous ones, and the disentanglement of semantic from acoustic events. We introduce a new task, continual event detection from speech, for which we also provide two benchmark datasets. To address the challenges of catastrophic forgetting and effective disentanglement, we propose a novel method, 'Double Mixture.' This method merges speech expertise with robust memory mechanisms to enhance adaptability and prevent forgetting. Our comprehensive experiments show that this task presents significant challenges that are not effectively addressed by current state-of-the-art methods in either computer vision or natural language processing. Our approach achieves the lowest rates of forgetting and the highest levels of generalization, proving robust across various continual learning sequences. Our code and data are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/status/Continual-SpeechED-6461.</description>

      <title>Images that Sound: Composing Images and Sounds on a Single Canvas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectrograms are 2D representations of sound that look very different from the images found in our visual world. And natural images, when played as spectrograms, make unnatural sounds. In this paper, we show that it is possible to synthesize spectrograms that simultaneously look like natural images and sound like natural audio. We call these visual spectrograms images that sound. Our approach is simple and zero-shot, and it leverages pre-trained text-to-image and text-to-spectrogram diffusion models that operate in a shared latent space. During the reverse process, we denoise noisy latents with both the audio and image diffusion models in parallel, resulting in a sample that is likely under both models. Through quantitative evaluations and perceptual studies, we find that our method successfully generates spectrograms that align with a desired audio prompt while also taking the visual appearance of a desired image prompt.

      <title>Frieren: Efficient Video-to-Audio Generation Network with Rectified Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation aims to synthesize content-matching audio from silent video, and it remains challenging to build V2A models with high generation quality, efficiency, and visual-audio temporal synchrony. We propose Frieren, a V2A model based on rectified flow matching. Frieren regresses the conditional transport vector field from noise to spectrogram latent with straight paths and conducts sampling by solving ODE, outperforming autoregressive and score-based models in terms of audio quality. By employing a non-autoregressive vector field estimator based on a feed-forward transformer and channel-level cross-modal feature fusion with strong temporal alignment, our model generates audio that is highly synchronized with the input video. Furthermore, through reflow and one-step distillation with guided vector field, our model can generate decent audio in a few, or even only one sampling step. Experiments indicate that Frieren achieves state-of-the-art performance in both generation quality and temporal alignment on VGGSound, with alignment accuracy reaching 97.22%, and 6.2% improvement in inception score over the strong diffusion-based baseline. Audio samples are available at http://frieren-v2a.github.io.</description>

      <title>MemeCLIP: Leveraging CLIP Representations for Multimodal Meme Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The complexity of text-embedded images presents a formidable challenge in machine learning given the need for multimodal understanding of multiple aspects of expression conveyed by them. While previous research in multimodal analysis has primarily focused on singular aspects such as hate speech and its subclasses, this study expands this focus to encompass multiple aspects of linguistics: hate, targets of hate, stance, and humor. We introduce a novel dataset PrideMM comprising 5,063 text-embedded images associated with the LGBTQ+ Pride movement, thereby addressing a serious gap in existing resources. We conduct extensive experimentation on PrideMM by using unimodal and multimodal baseline methods to establish benchmarks for each task. Additionally, we propose a novel framework MemeCLIP for efficient downstream learning while preserving the knowledge of the pre-trained CLIP model. The results of our experiments show that MemeCLIP achieves superior performance compared to previously proposed frameworks on two real-world datasets. We further compare the performance of MemeCLIP and zero-shot GPT-4 on the hate classification task. Finally, we discuss the shortcomings of our model by qualitatively analyzing misclassified samples. Our code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/SiddhantBikram/MemeCLIP.</description>
