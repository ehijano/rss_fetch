      <title>Geometry of color perception. Part 1: Structures and metrics of a homogeneous color space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first half of a two-part paper dealing with the geometry of color perception. Here we analyze in detail the seminal 1974 work by H.L. Resnikoff, who showed that there are only two possible geometric structures and Riemannian metrics on the perceived color space P compatible with the set of Schr\"odinger's axioms completed with the hypothesis of homogeneity. We recast Resnikoff's model into a more modern colorimetric setting, provide a much simpler proof of the main result of the original paper and motivate the need of psychophysical experiments to confute or confirm the linearity of background transformations, which act transitively on P. Finally, we show that the Riemannian metrics singled out by Resnikoff through an axiom on invariance under background transformations are not compatibles with the crispening effect, thus motivating the need of further research about perceptual color metrics.</description>

      <title>Restricted Repetitive Behaviors in Adolescent Males with Autism: Volatility in Brain Functional Connectivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies subtypes of restricted, repetitive and stereotypical behaviors (RRBs) in adolescent males with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) from the viewpoint of the dynamics of brain functional connectivities (FCs). Data from the ABIDE-II repository and Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) metrics are used to form two ASD groups with tightly controlled demographics; one comprises subjects with scores above threshold for the self-injurious behaviors (SIBs) subscale, and the other subjects with scores below threshold for SIBs, but above threshold for at least one of the other subscales (stereotyped, compulsive, ritualistic, insistence on sameness, restricted interests). The dynamics of the coherence for FCs across distinct frequency bands are compared against matched controls, using a novel volatility measure computed in time-frequency space. We find statistically significant differences, on average, in the volatility of a relatively small set of FCs, most mapping to either the default mode network or the cerebellum, in the mid- and high-frequency bands, and yielding higher volatility in subjects with high levels of SIBs. Results suggest a distinct underlying profile for SIBs involving multiple brain regions associated with rewards and emotions processing. The work contributes to the identification of neural substrates potentially underlying behavioral subtypes, and may help target interventions.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field-dependent Isotope Effect Supports Radical Pair Mechanism in Tubulin Polymerization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak magnetic fields and isotopes have been shown to influence biological processes; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood, particularly because the corresponding interaction energies are far below thermal energies, making classical explanations challenging or impossible. Microtubules, dynamic cytoskeletal fibers, offer an ideal system to test weak magnetic field effects due to their self-assembling capabilities, sensitivity to magnetic fields, and their central role in cellular processes. In this study, we use a combination of experiments and simulations to explore how nuclear spin dynamics affect microtubule polymerization by examining interactions between magnesium isotope substitution and weak magnetic fields. Our experiments reveal an isotope-dependent effect, which can be explained via a radical pair mechanism, explicitly arising from nuclear spin properties rather than isotopic mass differences. This nuclear spin-driven isotope effect is notably enhanced under an applied weak magnetic field of approximately 3 mT. Our theoretical model based on radical pairs achieves quantitative agreement with our experimental observations. These results establish a direct connection between quantum spin dynamics and microtubule assembly, providing new insights into how weak magnetic fields influence cellular and biomolecular functions.</description>

      <title>Brain states analysis of EEG predicts multiple sclerosis and mirrors disease duration and burden</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15665v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Any treatment of multiple sclerosis should preserve mental function, considering how cognitive deterioration interferes with quality of life. However, mental assessment is still realized with neuro-psychological tests without monitoring cognition on neurobiological grounds whereas the ongoing neural activity is readily observable and readable.
  Objectives: The proposed method deciphers electrical brain states which as multi-dimensional cognetoms quantitatively discriminate normal from pathological patterns in an EEG.
  Methods: Baseline recordings from a prior EEG study of 93 subjects, 37 with MS, were analyzed. Spectral bands served to compute cognetoms and categorize subsequent feature combination sets.
  Results: A significant correlation arose between brain states predictors, clinical data and disease duration. Using cognetoms and spectral bands, a cross-sectional comparison separated patients from controls with a precision of 82% while using bands alone arrived at 64%.
  Conclusions: Brain states analysis successfully distinguishes controls from patients with MS. The congruity with disease duration is a neurobiological indicator for disease accumulation over time. Our results imply that data-driven comparisons of EEG data may complement customary diagnostic methods in neurology and psychiatry. However, thinking ahead for quantitative monitoring of disease time course and treatment efficacy, we hope to have established the analytic principles applicable to longitudinal clinical studies.</description>

      <title>Topological Time Frequency Analysis of Functional Brain Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel topological framework for analyzing functional brain signals using time-frequency analysis. By integrating persistent homology with time-frequency representations, we capture multi-scale topological features that characterize the dynamic behavior of brain activity. This approach identifies 0D (connected components) and 1D (loops) topological structures in the signal's time-frequency domain, enabling robust extraction of features invariant to noise and temporal misalignments. The proposed method is demonstrated on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, showcasing its ability to discern critical topological patterns and provide insights into functional connectivity. This topological approach opens new avenues for analyzing complex brain signals, offering potential applications in neuroscience and clinical diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Cross-domain Fiber Cluster Shape Analysis for Language Performance Cognitive Score Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19001v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shape plays an important role in computer graphics, offering informative features to convey an object's morphology and functionality. Shape analysis in brain imaging can help interpret structural and functionality correlations of the human brain. In this work, we investigate the shape of the brain's 3D white matter connections and its potential predictive relationship to human cognitive function. We reconstruct brain connections as sequences of 3D points using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) tractography. To describe each connection, we extract 12 shape descriptors in addition to traditional dMRI connectivity and tissue microstructure features. We introduce a novel framework, Shape--fused Fiber Cluster Transformer (SFFormer), that leverages a multi-head cross-attention feature fusion module to predict subject-specific language performance based on dMRI tractography. We assess the performance of the method on a large dataset including 1065 healthy young adults. The results demonstrate that both the transformer-based SFFormer model and its inter/intra feature fusion with shape, microstructure, and connectivity are informative, and together, they improve the prediction of subject-specific language performance scores. Overall, our results indicate that the shape of the brain's connections is predictive of human language function.</description>

      <title>EEG Right &amp; Left Voluntary Hand Movement-based Virtual Brain-Computer Interfacing Keyboard Using Hybrid Deep Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00035v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs), particularly those based on electroencephalography (EEG), offer promising solutions for assisting individuals with motor disabilities. However, challenges in reliably interpreting EEG signals for specific tasks, such as simulating keystrokes, persist due to the complexity and variability of brain activity. Current EEG-based BMIs face limitations in adaptability, usability, and robustness, especially in applications like virtual keyboards, as traditional machine-learning models struggle to handle high-dimensional EEG data effectively. To address these gaps, we developed an EEG-based BMI system capable of accurately identifying voluntary keystrokes, specifically leveraging right and left voluntary hand movements. Using a publicly available EEG dataset, the signals were pre-processed with band-pass filtering, segmented into 22-electrode arrays, and refined into event-related potential (ERP) windows, resulting in a 19x200 feature array categorized into three classes: resting state (0), 'd' key press (1), and 'l' key press (2). Our approach employs a hybrid neural network architecture with BiGRU-Attention as the proposed model for interpreting EEG signals, achieving superior test accuracy of 90% and a mean accuracy of 91% in 10-fold stratified cross-validation. This performance outperforms traditional ML methods like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Naive Bayes, as well as advanced architectures such as Transformers, CNN-Transformer hybrids, and EEGNet. Finally, the BiGRU-Attention model is integrated into a real-time graphical user interface (GUI) to simulate and predict keystrokes from brain activity. Our work demonstrates how deep learning can advance EEG-based BMI systems by addressing the challenges of signal interpretation and classification.</description>
