      <title>The Griffiths phase and beyond: A large deviations study of the magnetic susceptibility of the two-dimensional bond-diluted Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Griffiths phase in systems with quenched disorder occurs below the ordering transition of the pure system down to the ordering transition of the actual disordered system. While it does not exhibit long-range order, large fluctuations in the disorder degrees of freedom result in exponentially rare, long-range ordered states and hence the occurrence of broad distributions in response functions. Inside the Griffiths phase of the two-dimensional bond-diluted Ising model the distribution of the magnetic susceptibility is expected to have such a broad, exponential tail. A large-deviations Monte Carlo algorithm is used to sample this distribution and the exponential tail is extracted over a wide range of the support down to very small probabilities of the order of $10^{-300}$. We study the behavior of the susceptibility distribution across the full phase diagram, from the paramagnetic state through the Griffiths phase to the ferromagnetically ordered system and down to the zero-temperature point. We extract the rate function of large-deviation theory as well as its finite-size scaling behavior and we reveal interesting differences and similarities between the cases. A connection between the fraction of ferromagnetic bonds in a given disorder sample and the size of the magnetic susceptibility is demonstrated numerically.</description>

      <title>A method for quantifying the generalization capabilities of generative models for solving Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For Ising models with complex energy landscapes, whether the ground state can be found by neural networks depends heavily on the Hamming distance between the training datasets and the ground state. Despite the fact that various recently proposed generative models have shown good performance in solving Ising models, there is no adequate discussion on how to quantify their generalization capabilities. Here we design a Hamming distance regularizer in the framework of a class of generative models, variational autoregressive networks (VAN), to quantify the generalization capabilities of various network architectures combined with VAN. The regularizer can control the size of the overlaps between the ground state and the training datasets generated by networks, which, together with the success rates of finding the ground state, form a quantitative metric to quantify their generalization capabilities. We conduct numerical experiments on several prototypical network architectures combined with VAN, including feed-forward neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and graph neural networks, to quantify their generalization capabilities when solving Ising models. Moreover, considering the fact that the quantification of the generalization capabilities of networks on small-scale problems can be used to predict their relative performance on large-scale problems, our method is of great significance for assisting in the Neural Architecture Search field of searching for the optimal network architectures when solving large-scale Ising models.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of emergent cluster states by measurement from symmetry-protected-topological states with large symmetry to subsystem cat state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose measurement-producing hierarchy emerging among correlated states by sequential subsystem projective measurements. We start from symmetry-protected-topological (SPT) cluster states with a large symmetry and apply sequential subsystem projective measurements to them and find that generalized cluster SPT states with a reduced symmetry appear in the subsystem of the unmeasured sites. That prescription finally produces Greenberger-Home-Zeilinger states with long-range order in the subsystem composed of periodic unmeasured sites of the original lattice. The symmetry-reduction hierarchical structure from a general large symmetric SPT cluster state is clearly captured by the measurement update flow in the efficient algorithm of stabilizer formalism. This approach is useful not only for the analytical search for the measured state but also for numerical simulation with a large system size. We also numerically verify the symmetry-reduction hierarchy by sequential subsystem projective measurements applied to large systems and large symmetric cluster SPT states.</description>

      <title>Higher-order topology protected by latent crystalline symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that rotation symmetry is not a necessary requirement for the existence of fractional corner charges in Cn-symmetric higher-order topological crystalline insulators. Instead, it is sufficient to have a latent rotation symmetry, which may be revealed upon performing an isospectral reduction on the system. We introduce the concept of a filling anomaly for latent crystalline symmetric systems, and propose modified topological invariants. The notion of higher- order topology in two dimensions protected by Cn symmetry is thus generalized to a protection by latent symmetry. Our claims are corroborated by concrete examples of models that show non-trivial corner charge in the absence of Cn-symmetry. This work extends the classification of topological crystalline insulators to include latent symmetries.</description>

      <title>Infection-induced Cascading Failures -- Impact and Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16767v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of epidemic spreading, many intricate dynamical patterns can emerge due to the cooperation of different types of pathogens or the interaction between the disease spread and other failure propagation mechanism. To unravel such patterns, simulation frameworks are usually adopted, but they are computationally demanding on big networks and subject to large statistical uncertainty. Here, we study the two-layer spreading processes on unidirectionally dependent networks, where the spreading infection of diseases or malware in one layer can trigger cascading failures in another layer and lead to secondary disasters, e.g., disrupting public services, supply chains, or power distribution. We utilize a dynamic message-passing method to devise efficient algorithms for inferring the system states, which allows one to investigate systematically the nature of complex intertwined spreading processes and evaluate their impact. Based on such dynamic message-passing framework and optimal control, we further develop an effective optimization algorithm for mitigating network failures.</description>

      <title>Grokking as a First Order Phase Transition in Two Layer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03789v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key property of deep neural networks (DNNs) is their ability to learn new features during training. This intriguing aspect of deep learning stands out most clearly in recently reported Grokking phenomena. While mainly reflected as a sudden increase in test accuracy, Grokking is also believed to be a beyond lazy-learning/Gaussian Process (GP) phenomenon involving feature learning. Here we apply a recent development in the theory of feature learning, the adaptive kernel approach, to two teacher-student models with cubic-polynomial and modular addition teachers. We provide analytical predictions on feature learning and Grokking properties of these models and demonstrate a mapping between Grokking and the theory of phase transitions. We show that after Grokking, the state of the DNN is analogous to the mixed phase following a first-order phase transition. In this mixed phase, the DNN generates useful internal representations of the teacher that are sharply distinct from those before the transition.</description>

      <title>Machine learning of (1+1)-dimensional directed percolation based on raw and shuffled configurations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11741v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) can process large sets of data generated from complex systems, which is ideal for classification tasks as often appeared in critical phenomena. Meanwhile ML techniques have been found effective in detecting critical points, or in a broader sense phase separation, and extracting critical exponents. But there are still many unsolved issues with the ML, one of which is the meaning of hidden variables of unsupervised learning. Some say that the hidden variables and the principal component may contain basic information regarding the order parameter of the system of interest, which sounds plausible but lacks evidence. This study aims at searching for evidence supporting the conjecture that the autoencoder's (AE) single latent variable and PCA's first principal component can only serve as signals related to particle density, which happens to be the order parameter of the non-equilibrium DP model. Indeed, in some phase transition (PT) models the order parameter is the particle density, whereas in some PT models it is not. Having conducted a certain degree of random shuffling on the DP configurations, which are then fed to the neural networks as input, we find that AE's single latent variable and PCA's first principal component can indeed represent particle density. It is found that shuffling does affect the size of maximum cluster in the system, which suggests that the second principal component of the PCA is related to the maximal cluster. This has been supported by changes in the correlation length of the transition system with variations in the shuffle ratio.</description>

      <title>Low-Temperature Transport Property of Spin-1/2 Random Heisenberg Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quenched disorders can strongly influence the physical properties of quantum many-body systems. The real-space strong-disorder renormalization group (SDRG) analysis has shown that the spin-1/2 random Heisenberg chain is controlled by the infinite-randomness fixed point (IRFP) and forms a random singlet (RS) ground state. Motivated by recent thermal transport experiments on the quasi-one-dimensional antiferromagnet copper benzoate [B. Y. Pan et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 129}, 167201 (2022)], we adapt the SDRG to study the low-temperature properties of the random Heisenberg chain by assuming that its low-energy excited states are captured by the parent Hamiltonian of the RS ground state as well. We find that while the specific heat coefficient and the uniform magnetic susceptibility scale as $C/T\sim T^{-\alpha_{c}}$ and $\chi\sim T^{-\alpha_{s}}$ with $0&lt;\alpha_{c,s}&lt;1$, indicating a divergent low-energy density of states, the thermal and the spin conductivities scale as $\kappa/T\sim T$ and $\sigma_{s}\sim T$, which implies a vanishing density of extended states in the low-energy limit. We believe that such a disparity in the thermodynamic and transport properties is a common feature of random systems controlled by the IRFP.</description>

      <title>Random-matrix models of monitored quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the competition between Haar-random unitary dynamics and measurements for unstructured systems of qubits. For projective measurements, we derive various properties of the statistical ensemble of Kraus operators analytically, including the purification time and the distribution of Born probabilities. The latter generalizes the Porter-Thomas distribution for random unitary circuits to the monitored setting and is log-normal at long times. We also consider weak measurements that interpolate between identity quantum channels and projective measurements. In this setting, we derive an exactly solvable Fokker-Planck equation for the joint distribution of singular values of Kraus operators, analogous to the Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar (DMPK) equation modelling disordered quantum wires. We expect that the statistical properties of Kraus operators we have established for these simple systems will serve as a model for the entangling phase of monitored quantum systems more generally.</description>
