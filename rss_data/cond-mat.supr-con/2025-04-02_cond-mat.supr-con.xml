      <title>A Clue on Small-Capacitance Josephson Junction: What to Expect from Cooper Pair Ideal Conductor and Ohmic Resistor in Parallel?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using analytical and Worldline Monte Carlo approaches, we investigate the effects induced by quantum phase fluctuations combined with quasiparticle subgap and shunt resistances on a small-capacitance Josephson junction. By using the linear response theory in the presence of two biasing schemes, we prove that the ideal conduction, foreseen in the pioneering papers on this topic, is not robust against either quantum phase fluctuations or dissipative effects. By including both of them in the Hamiltonian, we prove that an increase of the Ohmic dissipation strength induces a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition in thermodynamic equilibrium. Then we study charge and phase fluctuations at the thermodynamic equilibrium within the linear response theory. We find that the phase particle motion, in a quantum Josephson junction, does not change from diffusive to localized, resulting in an insulator-superconductor transition, as is commonly believed. At the transition, we prove that: i) the motion of the phase particle changes from ballistic to localized; ii) by turning on the coupling with the environment, a long-lived excitation at finite frequency emerges in the charge response function: it evolves first into a resonance and then disappears at the transition. Consequences beyond the linear response regime are investigated, leading to an alternative comprehensive physical picture for this system: we predict a transition from a dissipative quasiparticle current to a polaronic Cooper pair current.</description>

      <title>Single-gap two-band superconductivity well above the Pauli limit in non-centrosymmetric TaIr$_2$B$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-centrosymmetric superconducting materials represent an exciting class of novel superconductors featuring a variety of unconventional properties, including mixed-parity pairing and very high upper critical fields. Here, we present a comprehensive study of TaIr$_2$B$_2$ (with $T_c$ = 5.1 K), using a set of complementary experimental methods, including bulk- and surface-sensitive techniques. We provide evidence that this system is a two-band, yet it behaves as a single-gap superconductor with a strong coupling. The upper critical field of TaIr$_2$B$_2$ significantly exceeds the Pauli limit and exhibits a nearly linear temperature dependence down to the lowest temperatures. This behavior, rarely seen in superconductors, is discussed in terms of anti-symmetric spin-orbit interaction, two-band-, and strong-coupling effects, as well as disorder.</description>

      <title>Field free Josephson diode effect in Ising Superconductor/Altermagnet Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets (AMs) are an exotic class of antiferromagnet that exhibit spin-splitting even at the absence of net global magnetization and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects. In this work, we investigated theoretically, the supercurrent nonreciprocity in an Ising Superconductor/Altermagnet/Ising Superconductor (ISC/AM/ISC) Josephson junction which revealed asymmetric Josephson critical currents, $0 - \pi$ transitions and anomalous current-phase relationship (CPR). A strong Josephson diode efficiency (JDE) is observed due to the combined effects of AM strength and orientations in a conventional SC even in absence of SOC. However, it significantly enhances in presence of intrinsic SOC (ISOC), resulting in pronounced diode effect in both single and double band ISC/AM based Josephson junction. Additionally, it is observed that JDE is more prominent at higher AM strengths with intermediate orientations in all scenario. Notably, it is significantly suppressed for orientations $0^\circ$ and $45^\circ$. Our results also indicate that barrier transparency and AM lengths play a crucial role in optimizing the JDE. In a single-band ISC/AM system JDE persists for any AM length, while reduces at longer AM junction in case of a double-band ISC/AM system. Moreover, our results suggest that a diode efficiency of $\sim 52\%$ can be achieved in the proposed Josephson junction in both single and double band ISC/AM Josephson junction by considering strong AM strength. Furthermore, single band ISC offers wide AM orientation range in contrast to double band ISC for better tunability and optimization of JDE. Our findings highlight the impact of AM strength, orientation and ISOC on the JDE efficiency offering insights for superconducting diode design.</description>

      <title>Chiral superfluid helium-3 in the quasi-two-dimensional limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anisotropic pair breaking close to surfaces favors the chiral A phase of the superfluid $^3$He over the time-reversal invariant B phase. Confining the superfluid $^3$He into a cavity of height $D$ of the order of the Cooper pair size characterized by the coherence length $\xi_0$ - ranging between 16 nm (34 bar) and 77 nm (0 bar) - extends the surface effects over the whole sample volume, thus allowing stabilization of the A phase at pressures $P$ and temperatures $T$ where otherwise the B phase would be stable. In this Letter, the surfaces of such a confined sample are covered with a superfluid $^4$He film to create specular quasiparticle scattering boundary conditions, preventing the suppression of the superfluid order parameter. We show that the chiral A phase is the stable superfluid phase under strong confinement over the full $P$-$T$ phase diagram down to a quasi-two-dimensional limit $D / \xi_0 = 1$ , where $D = 80$ nm. The planar phase, which is degenerate with the chiral A phase in the weak-coupling limit, is not observed. The gap inferred from measurements over the wide pressure range from 0.2 to 21.0 bar leads to an empirical ansatz for temperature-dependent strong-coupling effects. We discuss how these results pave the way for the realization of the fully gapped two-dimensional $p_x + ip_y$ superfluid under more extreme confinement.</description>

      <title>Resolving phonon-mediated superconducting pairing symmetries from first-principles calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12991v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quest for topological superconductors triggers revived interests in resolving non-s-wave pairing channels mediated by phonons. While density functional theory and density functional perturbtaion theory have established a powerful framework to calculate electron-phonon couplings in real materials in a first-principles way, its application is largely limited to conventional s-wave superconductivity. Here, we formulate an efficient and simple-to-use algorithm for first-principles pairing channel analysis, and apply it to several representative material systems.</description>

      <title>Nanocryotron-driven Charge Configuration Memristor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.14586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cryo-computing - both classical and quantum, is severely limited by the absence of a suitable cryo-memory. The challenge both in terms of energy efficiency and speed have been known for decades, but so far conventional technologies have not been able to deliver adequate performance. Here we present a novel non-volatile memory device which incorporates a superconducting nanowire and an all-electronic charge configuration memristor (CCM) based on switching between charge-ordered states in a layered dichalcogenide material. We investigate the time-dynamics and current-voltage characteristics of such a device fabricated using a NbTiN nanowire and a 1T-TaS2 CCM. The observed dynamical response of the device is faithfully reproduced by modelling of the superconducting order parameter showing versatility of application. The inherent ultrahigh energy efficiency and speed of the device, which is compatible with single flux quantum logic, leads to a promising new memory concept for use in cryo-computing and quantum computing peripheral devices.</description>

      <title>Density Matrix Renormalization Group study of superconducting pairing near the quarter-filled Wigner crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charge ordering is often found in the phase diagram of unconventional superconductors in close proximity to the superconducting state. This has led to the suggestion that fluctuations of charge order can mediate superconducting pairing. While several mechanisms can lead to charge order, one common mechanism is the long-range Coulomb interaction, resulting in a Wigner crystal charge ordered state. For an electron density of 0.5 per site we investigate the extended Hubbard model on the two-dimensional square lattice using exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods. Our results show that the strength of pairing decreases with the nearest-neighbor Coulomb interaction strength $V$ and remains weaker than the tendency of pairing for non-interacting electrons.</description>
