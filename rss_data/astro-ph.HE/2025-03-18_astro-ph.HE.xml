      <title>Comprehensive Analysis of Constructing Hybrid Stars with an RG-consistent NJL Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the properties of hadronic and quark matter that would allow for a first order phase transition between them within neutron stars. To this end, we use a parameterizable Relativistic Mean-Field (RMF) description for the hadronic phase and a Renormalization Group-consistent Nambu-Jona-Lasino (RG-NJL) model for the quark phase. This also enables us to consider sequential phase transitions involving a two-flavor color-superconducting (2SC) and a color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase. We find large ranges for all parameters that facilitate a phase transition, even when constrained by current astrophysical data. We further attempt to filter out stars with a high chance of detectability by mass-radius measurement, i.e., stars with identical mass but different radii, so-called twin stars. However, we find that such configurations are outside the constrained parameter spaces. Instead, most of the mass-radius relations that feature a phase transition appear to be indistinguishable from a purely hadronic description.</description>

      <title>Exploring polarization and geometry in the X-ray pulsar 4U 1538-52</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observations of accreting X-ray pulsars (XRPs) continue to provide novel insights into the physics and geometry of these sources. We present the first X-ray polarimetric study of the persistent wind-fed XRP 4U 1538-52, based on five IXPE observations totaling 360 ks, conducted in March and October 2024. We detect marginally significant polarization in the combined data set in the full 2--8 keV energy band, with a polarization degree (PD) of 3.0+-1.1% and polarization angle (PA) of -18 degrees. The energy-resolved analysis shows a clear energy dependence of the polarization properties, with a remarkable ~70 degrees switch in PA between low and high energies. Similarly, the pulse phase-resolved spectro-polarimetric analysis reveals different signatures at low and high energies. At low (2--3 keV) energies, the PD ranges between ~2% and ~18%, with the PA varying between -16 and 70 degrees. At higher (4--8 keV) energies, the PD varies between ~3% and ~12%, with a drastically different PA behavior. Fitting the rotating vector model to the pulse phase dependence of the PA at the lower energies, we constrain the geometric configuration of the pulsar. The analysis favors a high spin-axis inclination of &gt;50 which agrees with both previous pulse-phase-dependent spectral fitting of the cyclotron line region and the known high orbital inclination of the binary system. The magnetic obliquity is estimated to be 30 degrees and the spin position angle to be 19 degrees. A sharp switch in PA around 3 keV presents a particular theoretical challenge, as it is not consistent with the right-angle switch that was only seen in one other pulsar Vela X-1.</description>

      <title>The emission geometry of pulsars with interpulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present polarization profiles of 23 pulsars exhibiting interpulse (IP) emissions using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST). By applying the rotating vector model (RVM), we measured the inclination and impact angles for 16 pulsars, allowing us to investigate their beam geometries. Our analysis indicates that for 5 pulsars, the IP emissions likely originate from the same magnetic pole as the main pulse (MP), whereas for the remaining 11 pulsars, the IP and MP emissions originate from opposite magnetic poles. For the 7 pulsars that do not conform to the RVM, we are unable to determine whether the IP emissions originate from the same or opposite magnetic pole as the MPs. By analyzing the beam configurations of pulsars, we found that the emission within the beam is not fully active across both longitude and latitude. Filling factors ranging from 0.27 to 0.99 were obtained for pulsars with opposite pole IP emissions, suggesting an underestimation of emission height when applying the geometrical method. The emissions for MPs and IPs occur at different heights in the pulsar magnetosphere, with the difference in emission height ranging from tens to thousands of kilometers. We also found that some pulsars have wide emission beams, indicating that radio emissions may occur in regions of high altitude within the pulsar magnetosphere.</description>

      <title>Constraints on LIGO/Virgo Compact Object Mergers from Late-time Radio Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from a search for radio afterglows of compact object mergers conducted with the Australian SKA Pathfinder. We used data from four epochs of the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey to search compact binary merger localization regions observed during the LIGO/Virgo O2, and O3 observing runs. Our investigation focused on eleven events (published in the GWTC-1, GWTC-2, and GWTC-3 catalogues of gravitational-wave events) with 90\% posterior localisations smaller than $150\,\deg^2$ and $\ge$99\% probabilities of being of astrophysical origin, to identify potential radio afterglow-like transients up to $\lesssim$1500 days post-merger. We identified candidate afterglow-type variable sources in the 90\% localisation for events -- GW190503, GW200202 and GW200208, which were ruled out as unlikely to be related to the corresponding GW event on further analysis. Since we find no likely candidate counterparts, we constrain the inclination angle and the circum-merger density at isotropic equivalent energies ranging from $2\times10^{51} -1\times10^{54}\rm \:erg$. These constraints are based on the assumption that the electron energy distribution in the associated jets follows a power-law index of $ p = 2.2$, with 1% of the shock energy in the magnetic field ($ \epsilon_B = 0.01$) and 10% in the electrons ($\epsilon_e = 0.1$). We discuss the detectability of late-time afterglows as a function of merger distance and inclination angles with millijansky surveys.</description>

      <title>Propagation Times and Energy Losses of Cosmic Protons and Antiprotons in Interplanetary Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the heliospheric modulation of cosmic rays in interplanetary space, focusing on their propagation times and energy losses over the solar cycle. To perform the calculations, we employed a data-driven model based on the stochastic method. Our model was calibrated using time-resolved and energy-resolved data from several missions including AMS-02, PAMELA, EPHIN/SOHO, BESS, and data from Voyager-1. This approach allows us to calculate probability density functions for the propagation time and energy losses of cosmic protons and antiprotons in the heliosphere. Furthermore, we explore the temporal evolution of these probabilities spanning from 1993 to 2018, covering a full 22-year cycle of magnetic polarity, which includes two solar minima and two magnetic reversals. Our calculations were carried out for cosmic protons and antiprotons, enabling us to investigate the role of charge-sign dependent effects in cosmic ray transport. These findings provide valuable insights into the physical processes of cosmic-ray propagation in the heliosphere and contribute to a deeper understanding of the solar modulation phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Core-collapse supernova explosions hindered by eV-mass sterile neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light sterile neutrinos, $\nu_s$, are often introduced to explain an anomalous deficit in the electron antineutrino flux from nuclear reactors. If they exist, sterile neutrinos would also be produced in collapsing massive stars through the active-sterile neutrino oscillation. In order to investigate the impacts of sterile neutrinos on supernova dynamics, we perform two-dimensional neutrino-radiation hydrodynamic simulations of stellar core-collapse coupled with the active-sterile oscillation. As the initial condition of our simulations, we adopt a blue supergiant model that is tuned to reproduce observational features of the SN 1987A progenitor to compare our models with observations of the event. It is found that the active-sterile oscillation reduces the $\nu_{e}$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ fluxes and decreases the explosion energy. We also find that, if the mixing angle $\theta$ and the mass difference $\delta m_\mathrm{s}^2$ between $\nu_e$ and $\nu_s$ are large enough, the star fails to explode. This suggests that these mixing parameters relevant to sterile neutrinos could be constrained by supernova explodability, though other uncertainties in supernova theory need to be addressed to refine them. In addition, we predict neutrino signals from a nearby supernova event and find that the neutrino event number can significantly decrease because the $\nu_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ fluxes are reduced. In particular, DUNE observations of $\nu_e$ will be useful to search for a signature of sterile neutrinos with a tiny mixing angle because a smaller mixing angle leads to a larger effect on the $\nu_e$ flux.</description>

      <title>Variations in the Radiation Intensity of Pulsar B0950+08: Nine Years of Monitoring at 110 MHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of variations in the emission intensity of the pulsar B0950+08 from 2014 to 2022 with scales from minutes to years was carried out. The observations were obtained in a round-the-clock daily survey conducted on the Large Phased Array (LPA) radio telescope. The high variability of emission is shown not only from pulse to pulse, but also at scales greater than 3 min. The average value of the estimated amplitude of these variations in 3.2 minutes is 25~Jy, the modulation index is 1. The average relative amplitude of the interpulse (IP) is $2.00 \pm 0.28\%$ of the main pulse. In individual pulses, the amplitude of the interpulse may exceed the amplitude of the main pulse (MP), but this is a rare event. Emission is observed in almost the entire period of the pulsar. For the first time, the relative amplitude of emission between the main pulse and the interpulse (emission bridge) was measured. When averaging about 10 hours, it varies from $0.8\%$ to $1.31\%$ with an average value of $1.04 \pm 0.28\%$.
  A high correlation was found between MP and IP amplitude variations both when averaging profiles over 3.2 minutes and when averaging over years. This correlation is due to refractive interstellar scintillation. The frequency scale of IP diffraction interstellar scintillation was measured for the first time and it was shown that the spectral forms for IP and MP are well correlated and have the same frequency scale. There are strong variations in the frequency scale of scintillation $f_{dif}$ from session to session (time interval from one day) on scales of 200-800 kHz. The refractive scale of scintillation for 1-2 days has been determined. A modulation of emission with a characteristic scale of about 130 days was detected, which, apparently, is also associated with refractive scintillation.</description>

      <title>gammapy_SyLC: A Package for Simulating and Fitting Variability in High-Energy Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the temporal variability of astrophysical sources is key to understanding the underlying physical processes driving their emissions. This work introduces a gammapy_SyLC, a Python package that offers tools to simulate and fit time-domain data, with a focus on Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) variability. The package was developed taking into account possible interactions with gammapy but does not directly depend on it. gammapy_SyLC incorporates optimized implementations of the Timmer &amp; Koenig and Emmanoulopoulos algorithms for light curve simulation, capable of generating synthetic lightcurves from specified PSDs and amplitude distribution models. It also provides functionalities for PSD fitting, histogram-based PDF interpolation, and Monte Carlo-based parameter estimation, making it a full-stack tool for investigating variable phenomena and specifically the long-term behavior of AGNs. To showcase its capabilities, the package was applied to gamma-ray light curves from the Fermi Large Area Telescope repository, reconstructing PSDs and PDFs and constraining variability models for observed sources.</description>

      <title>Galaxy scale consequences of tidal disruption events: extended emission line regions, extreme coronal lines and infrared-to-optical light echoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars in galactic centers are occasionally scattered so close to the central supermassive black hole that they are completely disrupted by tidal forces, initiating a transient accretion event. The aftermath of such a tidal disruption event (TDE) produces a bright-and-blue accretion flow which is known to persist for at least a decade (observationally) and can in principle produce ionizing radiation for hundreds of years. Tidal disruption events are known (observationally) to be overrepresented in galaxies which show extended emission line regions (EELRs), with no pre-TDE classical AGN activity, and to produce transient ``coronal lines'', such as [FeX] and [FeXIV]. Using coupled CLOUDY-TDE disk simulations we show that tidal disruption event disks produce a sufficient ionizing radiation flux over their lifetimes to power both EELR of radial extents of $r \sim 10^4$ light years, and coronal lines. EELRs are produced when the ionizing radiation interacts with low density $n_H \sim 10^1 - 10^3 \, {\rm cm}^{-3}$ clouds on galactic scales, while coronal lines are produced by high density $n_H \sim 10^6 - 10^8 \, {\rm cm}^{-3}$ clouds near the galactic center. High density gas in galactic centers will also result in the rapid switching on of narrow line features in post-TDE galaxies, and also various high-ionization lines which may be observed throughout the infrared with JWST. Galaxies with a higher intrinsic rate of tidal disruption events will be more likely to show macroscopic EELRs, which can be traced to originate from the previous tidal disruption event in that galaxy, which naturally explains why TDEs are more likely to be discovered in galaxies with EELRs. We further argue that a non-negligible fraction of so-called optically selected ``AGN'' are tidal disruption events.</description>

      <title>The EXOD search for faint transients in XMM-Newton observations. Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The XMM-Newton observatory has accumulated a vast archive of over 17,000 X-ray observations over the last 25 years. However, the standard data processing pipelines may fail to detect certain types of transient X-ray sources due to their short-lived or dim nature. Identifying these transient sources is important for understanding the full range of temporal X-ray behaviour, as well as understanding the types of sources that could be routinely detected by future missions such as Athena. This work aims to reprocess XMM-Newton archival observations using newly developed dedicated software in order to identify neglected and missed transient X-ray sources that were not detected by the existing pipeline. We use a new approach that builds upon previous methodologies, by transforming event lists into data cubes, which are then searched for transient variability in short time windows. Our method enhances the detection capabilities in the Poisson regime by accounting for the statistical properties of sparse count rates, and allowing for transient search in previously discarded periods of high background activity. Our reprocessing efforts identified 32,247 variable sources at the 3-sigma level and 4,083 sources at the 5-sigma level in 12,926 XMM archival observations. We highlight four noteworthy sources: A candidate quasi-periodic eruption (QPE), a new magnetar candidate, a previously undetected Galactic hard X-ray burst and a possible X-ray counterpart to a Galactic radio pulsar. Our method demonstrates a new, fast, and effective way to process event list data from XMM-Newton, which is efficient in finding rapid outburst-like or eclipsing behaviour. This technique can be adapted for use with future telescopes, such as Athena, and can be generalised to other photon counting instruments operating in the low-count Poisson regime.</description>

      <title>XL-Calibur measurements of polarised hard X-ray emission from the Crab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report measurements of the linear polarisation degree (PD) and angle (PA) for hard X-ray emission from the Crab pulsar and wind nebula. Measurements were made with the XL-Calibur ($\sim$15-80 keV) balloon-borne Compton-scattering polarimeter in July 2024. The polarisation parameters are determined using a Bayesian analysis of Stokes parameters obtained from X-ray scattering angles. Well-constrained ($\sim$8.5$\sigma$) results are obtained for the polarisation of the $\sim$19-64 keV signal integrated over all pulsar phases: PD=(25.1$\pm$2.9)% and PA=(129.8$\pm$3.2)$^\circ$. In the off-pulse (nebula-dominated) phase range, the PD is constrained at $\sim$4.5$\sigma$ and is compatible with the phase-integrated result. The PA of the nebular hard X-ray emission aligns with that measured by IXPE in the 2-8 keV band for the toroidal inner region of the pulsar wind nebula, where the hard X-rays predominantly originate. For the main pulsar peak, PD=(32.8$^{+18.2}_{-28.5}$)% and PA=(156.0 $\pm$ 21.7)$^\circ$, while for the second peak (inter-pulse), PD=(0.0$^{+33.6}_{-0.0}$)% and PA=(154.5 $\pm$ 34.5)$^\circ$. A low level of polarisation in the pulsar peaks likely does not favour emission originating from the inner regions of the pulsar magnetosphere. Discriminating between Crab pulsar emission models will require deeper observations, e.g. with a satellite-borne hard X-ray polarimeter.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate by three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of energy deposition into the envelope of a red supergiant (RSG) model the inflation of a Rayleigh-Taylor unstable envelope that forms a compact clumpy circumstellar material (CSM). Our simulations mimic vigorous core activity years to months before a core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosion that deposits energy to the outer envelope. The fierce core nuclear activity in the pre-CCSN explosion phase might excite waves that propagate to the envelope. The wave energy is dissipated where envelope convection cannot carry the energy. We deposit this energy into a shell in the outer envelope with a power of L(wave)=2.6e6Lo or L(wave)=5.2e5Lo for 0.32 year. The energy-deposition shell expands while its pressure is higher than its surroundings, but its density is lower. Therefore, this expansion is Rayleigh-Taylor unstable and develops instability fingers. Most of the inflated envelope does not reach the escape velocity in the year of simulation but forms a compact and clumpy CSM. The high density of the inflated envelope implies that if a companion is present in that zone, it will accrete mass at a very high rate and power a pre-explosion outburst.</description>

      <title>Origin of holes and rings in the Green Monster of Cassiopeia A: Insights from 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [Abridged] Cassiopeia A (Cas A) provides a unique opportunity to study supernova (SN) dynamics and interactions with the circumstellar medium (CSM). Recent JWST observations revealed the "Green Monster" (GM), a structure with a likely CSM origin. We investigate its pockmarked morphology, characterized by circular holes and rings, by examining the role of small-scale ejecta structures interacting with a dense circumstellar shell. We adopted a neutrino-driven SN model to trace the evolution of its explosion from core collapse to the age of the Cas A remnant using high-resolution 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Besides other processes, the simulations include self-consistent calculations of radiative losses, accounting for deviations from electron-proton temperature equilibration and ionization equilibrium, as well as the ejecta composition derived from the SN. The GM's morphology is reproduced by dense ejecta clumps and fingers interacting with an asymmetric, forward-shocked circumstellar shell. The clumps and fingers form by hydrodynamic instabilities growing at the interface between SN ejecta and shocked CSM. Radiative cooling accounting for effects of non-equilibrium of ionization enhances the ejecta fragmentation, forming dense knots and thin filamentary structures that penetrate the shell, producing a network of holes and rings with properties similar to those observed. The origin of the holes and rings in the GM can be attributed to the interaction of ejecta with a shocked circumstellar shell. By constraining the timing of this interaction and analyzing the properties of these structures, we provide a distinction of this scenario from an alternative hypothesis, which attributes these features to fast-moving ejecta knots penetrating the shell ahead of the forward shock.</description>

      <title>Association of 220 PeV Neutrino KM3-230213A with Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the KM3NeT Collaboration released the detection of a 220 PeV neutrino from the celestial coordinates RA=94.3\degree~ and Dec.=-7.8\degree~ on 13 February 2023 at 01:16:47 UTC \cite{KM3NeT:2025npi}. The source for this extra-ordinary cosmic neutrino, designated KM3-230213A, is not identified yet but there has been a speculation that it might be associated with a gamma-ray burst GRB~090401B \cite{Amelino-Camelia:2025lqn}. The purpose of this report is to search the association of this 220 PeV neutrino with potential GRB sources from a more general consideration of Lorentz invariance violation (LV) without fixed LV scale. We try to associate this extra-ordinary neutrino with potential GRBs within angular separation of 1\degree, 3\degree~ and 5\degree~ respectively and the results are listed in Table 1. We find the constraints $E_{\rm{LV}}\leq 5.3\times 10^{18}$~GeV for subluminal LV violation and $E_{\rm{LV}}\leq 5.6\times 10^{19}$~GeV for superluminal LV violation if KM3-230213A is a GRB neutrino.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Between Dark Matter-Black Hole Systems and Naked Singularities via Quasi-Periodic Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) are an important phenomenon commonly observed in the X-ray radiation of black holes and neutron stars, closely related to the dynamics of accretion disks around compact objects and general relativistic effects. The objective of this study is to use the QPO phenomenon to distinguish between dark matter-black hole systems and naked singularities, as well as to investigate the effects of different dark matter models (Cold Dark Matter, CDM, and Scalar Field Dark Matter, SFDM) on the accretion disk dynamics. By introducing a dark matter correction model within the framework of general relativity, we systematically investigate the differences in dragging effects, characteristic frequency distribution, and the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) radius between dark matter-black hole systems and naked singularities, while analyzing the potential coupling between QPO frequencies and dark matter distribution. The main results of this study are as follows: $\nu_r$ and $\nu_\theta$ in dark matter-black hole systems can be identified as HFQPOs, while for lower spins ($a &lt; 0.5$), $\nu_\text{nod}$ can be identified as LFQPOs, and for higher spins ($1 &gt; a \geq 0.5$), $\nu_\text{nod}$ falls within the HFQPO observation range. Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and Scalar Field Dark Matter (SFDM) modulate the accretion disk dynamics at the order of $10^{-6}$.</description>

      <title>Supernova Gamma-Ray Constraints from Heavy Sterile Neutrino Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heavy sterile neutrinos can be produced in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), which are superb particle generators because of their high densities and temperatures. If the sterile neutrinos are long-lived, these may be produced inside the supernova core and escape the stellar envelope, later decaying into SM particles like photons and neutrinos. In this work, we first improve the calculation of the $\gamma$-ray fluxes. We then revisit the bounds on the sterile neutrino parameter space from the non-observation of $\gamma$-rays from SN1987A by the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) and constraints from the diffuse $\gamma$-ray background arising from sterile neutrino decays. We find that the constraints arising from both the SMM data and the diffuse $\gamma$-ray background are weaker than those that have previously appeared in the literature. Finally, we study the sensitivity of several present and near-future $\gamma$-ray telescopes such as e-ASTROGAM and Fermi-LAT, assuming a nearby future galactic CCSN. We show that future observations can probe mixing angles as low as $|U_{\tau/\mu4}|^2\sim 5\times10^{-17}$.</description>

      <title>Energy transfer by feebly interacting particles in supernovae: the trapping regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feebly interacting particles, such as sterile neutrinos, dark photons, and axions, can be abundantly produced in the proto-neutron star (PNS) formed in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). These particles can decay into photons or charged leptons, depositing energy outside the PNS. Strong bounds on new particles can thus be derived from the observed luminosity of CCSNe, with even tighter bounds obtained from low-energy SNe observations. For the first time we highlight that, at sufficiently large couplings, particle production \textit{outside} the PNS must also be considered. Using the prototypical case of axions coupling to two photons, we show that at large couplings the energy transfer from PNS to its surroundings is diffusive rather than ballistic, substantially reducing the deposited energy. Our findings have implications for the parameter space of particles probed in beam dump experiments and for dark matter models involving a sub-GeV mediator.</description>

      <title>Deep Chandra observations of PLCKG287.0+32.9: a clear detection of a shock front in a heated former cool core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The massive, hot galaxy cluster PSZ2 G286.98+32.90 (hereafter PLCKG287, z=0.383) hosts a giant radio halo and two prominent radio relics which are signs of a disturbed dynamical state. However, despite optical and radio observations indicate a clear multiple merger, the X-ray emission of the cluster, derived from XMM-Newton observations, shows only moderate disturbance. We present new 200 ks Chandra observations of PLCKG287. We detect a shock front to the NW direction at a distance of ~390 kpc from the X-ray peak, characterized by a Mach number M~1.3, as well as a cold front at a distance of ~300 kpc from the X-ray peak, nested in the same direction of the shock in a typical configuration expected by a merger. We also find evidence for X-ray depressions to the E and W, that could be the signature of feedback from the active galactic nucleus (AGN). The radial profile of the thermodynamic quantities show a temperature and abundance peak in the cluster center, where also the pressure and entropy have a rapid increase. Based on these properties, we argue that PLCKG287 is what remains of a cool core after a heating event. We estimate that both the shock energy and the AGN feedback energy, implied by the analysis of the X-ray cavities, are sufficient to heat the core to the observed temperature of ~17 keV in the central ~160 kpc. We discuss the possible origin of the detected shock by investigating alternative scenarios of merger and AGN outburst, finding that they are both energetically viable. However, no single model seems able to explain all the X-ray features detected in this system. This suggests that the combined action of merger and central AGN feedback is likely necessary to explain the reheated cool core, the large-scale shock and the cold front. The synergy of these two processes may act in shaping the distribution of cool core and non cool core clusters. [Abridged]</description>

      <title>Gravitational instability in protoplanetary disk with cooling: 2D global analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-gravity is important in protoplanetary disks for planet formation through gravitational instability (GI). We study the cooling effect on GI in a thin two-dimensional protoplanetary disk. By solving the linear perturbation equations in global geometry, we obtain all the normal modes. Faster cooling leads to faster growth rate of GI with lower azimuthal wavenumber $m$. According to the spatial structure of normal modes at different mass-averaged Toomre number $\overline{Q}$ and dimensionless cooling timescale $\beta$, we identify three modes: local, transitional and global. The transitional modes are located in the outer disk while the other two modes in the inner disk. At $\beta\approx 1$ (the resonance of dynamical timescale and thermal timescale) the growth rate changes sharply and the transitional modes dominate. The disk $\alpha$ due to GI is much higher in the transitional modes than in the other two. Our result implies that the transitional modes at $\overline{Q}\approx 1$ and $\beta\approx 1$ can plausibly interpret the substructures and planet/brown dwarf formation in the outer disk.</description>

      <title>Over-Luminous Type Ia Supernovae and Standard Candle Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) serve as crucial cosmological distance indicators due to their empirical consistency in peak luminosity and characteristic light-curve decline rates. These properties facilitate them to be standardized candles for the determination of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) within late-time universe cosmology. Nevertheless, a statistically significant difference persists between $H_0$ values derived from early and late-time measurements, a phenomenon known as the Hubble tension. Furthermore, recent observations have identified a subset of over-luminous SNe Ia, characterized by peak luminosities exceeding the nominal range and faster decline rates. These discoveries raise questions regarding the reliability of SNe Ia as standard candles in measuring cosmological distances. In this article, we present the Bayesian analysis of eight over-luminous SNe Ia and show that they yield a lower $H_0$ estimates, exhibiting closer concordance with $H_0$ estimates derived from early-universe data. This investigation potentially represent a step toward addressing the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Delayed Thermal Relaxation of Rapidly Cooling Neutron Stars: Neucleon Superfluidity and Non-nucleon Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermal relaxation time of neutron stars, typically defined by a sudden drop in surface temperature, is usually on the order of 10 to 100 years. In this study, we investigate neutron star thermal relaxation by incorporating nucleon superfluidity and non-nucleonic particles, specifically considering hyperons as a representative case. We find that rapidly cooling neutron stars driven by neutron superfluidity and direct Urca processes demonstrate delayed thermal relaxation under specific physical conditions. The former acquires that the neutron $^3P_2$ critical temperature is small enough, whereas the latter depends on the presence of a small core that permits direct Urca processes. To explore these scenarios, we propose simple theoretical frameworks to describe these delayed thermal relaxation behaviors and discuss how an recently-established enhanced modified Urca rate influences the relaxation time. By confronting the theoretical results with the observation of Cassiopeia A, we can effectively constrain the maximum neutron $^3P_2$ critical temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming scientific research, with deep learning methods playing a central role in data analysis, simulations, and signal detection across particle, nuclear, and astroparticle physics. Within the JENA communities-ECFA, NuPECC, and APPEC-and as part of the EuCAIF initiative, AI integration is advancing steadily. However, broader adoption remains constrained by challenges such as limited computational resources, a lack of expertise, and difficulties in transitioning from research and development (R&amp;D) to production. This white paper provides a strategic roadmap, informed by a community survey, to address these barriers. It outlines critical infrastructure requirements, prioritizes training initiatives, and proposes funding strategies to scale AI capabilities across fundamental physics over the next five years.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic field solver for QED polarization in super-strong magnetic fields of magnetar and laser plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Super-strongly magnetized plasmas play a crucial role in extreme environments of magnetar and laboratory laser experiments, demanding comprehensive understanding of how quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects influence plasma behaviour. Earlier analytical and semi-analytical calculations have shown that QED effects can significantly modify the plasma polarization mode behaviour around magnetars using analytical and semi-analytical calculations. In this work, we present the first electromagnetic field solver that is valid beyond the Schwinger limit. QED vacuum polarization in super-strong magnetic fields are modeled with nonlinear Maxwell equations. We show that electromagnetic waves in simulations follow the analytical solutions well and reproduce the birefringence effects of electromagnetic wave modes between the $O$ and $X$ polarizations of perpendicular electromagnetic waves and those between $L$ and $R$ polarizations of parallel waves. This new framework can be applied to kinetic as well as in other types of computer simulations. The solver's key advantage lies in its versatility, allowing it to be used in gyro-motion, gyro-center, and gyro-kinetic simulations, which do not resolve the cyclotron motion, or in plasma studies with ground-level Landau quantization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current data on ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays suggest they are predominantly made of heavy nuclei. This indicates that the flux of neutrinos produced from proton collisions on the cosmic microwave background is small and hard to observe. Motivated by the recent extremely-high-energy muon event reported by KM3NeT, we explore the possibility of enhancing the energy-flux of cosmogenic neutrinos through nuclear photodisintegration in the presence of new physics. Specifically, we speculate that UHE neutrons may oscillate into a new state, dark (or mirror) neutron $n'$ that in turn decays injecting large amount of energy to neutrinos, $n\to n'\to \nu_\text{UHE}$. While this mechanism does not explain the tension between the KM3NeT event and null results from IceCube, it reconciles the experimental preference for a heavier cosmic ray composition with a large diffuse cosmogenic flux of UHE neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Axion-Photon Conversion Signals from Neutron Stars with Spacetime Curvature Accounted for in the Magnetosphere Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axions are a well-motivated dark matter candidate. They may be detectable from radio line emission due to resonant conversion in neutron star magnetospheres. While radio data collection for this signal has begun, further efforts are required to solidify the theoretical predictions for the resulting radio lines. Usually, the flat spacetime Goldreich-Julian model of the neutron star magnetosphere is used, while a Schwarzschild geometry is assumed for the ray tracing. We assess the impact of incorporating the spacetime curvature into the magnetosphere model. We examine a range of neutron star and axion masses and find an average difference of $37\%$ and $22\%$ in radiated power compared to the standard Goldreich-Julian magnetosphere model for a $1\mu eV$ and $10\mu eV$ mass axion, respectively, in the case of a $2.2M_\odot$ mass neutron star. A much lesser difference is found for lower-mass neutron stars, as in that case axion-photon conversion occurs further from the Schwarzschild radius.</description>

      <title>X-ray polarization of the magnetar 1E 1841-045</title>

Abstract: We report on IXPE and NuSTAR observations beginning forty days after the 2024 outburst onset of magnetar 1E 1841-045, marking the first IXPE observation of a magnetar in an enhanced state. Our spectropolarimetric analysis indicates that both a blackbody (BB) plus double power-law (PL) and a double blackbody plus power-law spectral model fit the phase-averaged intensity data well, with a hard PL tail ($\Gamma$=1.19 and 1.35, respectively) dominating above $\approx 5$ keV. For the former model, we find the soft PL (the dominant component at soft energies) exhibits a polarization degree (PD) of $\approx 30\%$ while the hard PL displays a PD of $\approx 40\%$. Similarly, the cool BB of the 2BB+PL model possesses a PD of $\approx 15\%$ and a hard PL PD of $\approx 57\%$. For both models, each component has a polarization angle (PA) compatible with celestial north. Model-independent polarization analysis supports these results, wherein the PD increases from$ \approx 15\%$ to $\approx 70\%$ in the 2-3 keV and 6-8 keV ranges, respectively, while the PA remains nearly constant. We find marginal evidence for phase-dependent variability of the polarization properties, namely a higher PD at phases coinciding with the hard X-ray pulse peak. We compare the hard X-ray PL to the expectation from resonant inverse Compton scattering (RICS) and secondary pair cascade synchrotron radiation from primary high-energy RICS photons; both present reasonable spectropolarimetric agreement with the data, albeit, the latter more naturally. We suggest that the soft PL X-ray component may originate from a Comptonized corona in the inner magnetosphere.</description>

      <title>Unusual X-ray Oxygen Line Ratios of SN 1987A Arising From the Absorption of Galactic Hot Interstellar Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent high-resolution X-ray spectroscopic studies have revealed unusual oxygen line ratios, such as the high O VII forbidden-to-resonance ratio, in several supernova remnants. While the physical origin is still under debate, for most of them, it has been suggested that this phenomenon arises from either charge exchange (CX) or resonant scattering (RS). In this work, we report the high O VII G-ratio ($\gtrsim1$) and high O VIII Ly$\beta$/Ly$\alpha$ ratio ($\gtrsim0.2$) found in multiepoch XMM-Newton RGS observations of SN 1987A. The line ratios cannot be fully explained by non-equilibrium ionization effects, CX, or RS. We suggest the absorption of foreground hot gas as the most likely origin, which plays the major role in modifying line fluxes and line ratios. Based on this scenario, we introduced two Gaussian absorption components at the O VII resonance line and the O VIII Ly$\alpha$ line and constrained the optical depth of the two lines as $\tau_{\rm OVII}\sim0.6$ and $\tau_{\rm OVIII}\sim0.2$. We estimated the temperature as $kT_{\rm e}\sim0.15$ keV and the oxygen column density as $N_{\rm O}\sim0.5\times10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ for the absorbing gas, which is consistent with the hot interstellar medium in the Galactic halo. Neglecting this absorption component may lead to an underestimation of the O abundance. We revised the O abundance of SN 1987A, which is increased by $\sim20\%$ compared with previous results. The N/O ratio by number of atoms is revised to be $\sim1.2$.</description>

      <title>Probing solar modulation of AMS-02 time-dependent D, $^3$He and $^4$He fluxes with modified force field approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The AMS-02 experiment recently published time-dependent fluxes of deuterons (D) from May 2011 to April 2021, divided into 33 periods of four Bartels rotations each. These temporal structures are associated with solar modulation. In this study, three modified force-field approximation are employed to examine the long-term behavior of cosmic-ray (CR) isotopes such as D, $^3$He, and $^4$He, as well as the ratios D/$^3$He and $^3$He/$^4$He. The solar modulation potential is rigidity-dependent for these modified force-field approximation models. Due to the unknown local interstellar spectrum (LIS) for these isotopes, we utilize the Non-LIS method for solar modulation. By fitting to the AMS-02 time-dependent fluxes, we derive the solar modulation parameters. Our findings prove the assumption in literature that all isotopes can be fitted using the same solar modulation parameters and it shown that the modified FFA models are validated parametrization for solar modulation. Based on these, we forecast the daily fluxes of D, $^3$He and $^4$He from 2011 to 2020.</description>

      <title>A Possible Four-Month Periodicity in the Activity of FRB 20240209A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients from distant galaxies. While most FRBs are singular events, repeaters emit multiple bursts, with only two-FRB 121102 and FRB 180916B-showing periodic activity (160 and 16 days, respectively). FRB 20240209A, discovered by CHIME-FRB, is localized to the outskirts of a quiescent elliptical galaxy (z = 0.1384). We discovered a periodicity of ~ 126 days in the activity of the FRB 20240209A, potentially adding to the list of extremely rare periodic repeating FRBs. We used auto-correlation and Lomb-Scargle periodogram analyses, validated with randomized control samples, to confirm the periodicity. The FRB's location in an old stellar population disfavors young progenitor models, instead pointing to scenarios involving globular clusters, late-stage magnetars, or low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). Though deep X-ray or polarimetric observations are not available, the localization of the FRB and a possible periodicity points to progenitors likely to be a binary involving a compact object and a stellar companion or a precessing or rotating old neutron star.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.04058v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The memo describes the methods used to track the long-term gain variations in the NuSTAR detectors. It builds on the analysis presented in Madsen et al. (2015) using the deployable calibration source to measure the gain drift in the NuSTAR CdZnTe detectors. This is intended to be a live document that is periodically updated as new entries are required in the NuSTAR gain CALDB files. This document covers analysis up through late-2024 and the gain v011 CALDB file released in version 20240226.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Ionization in the Central Molecular Zone by sub-GeV Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07515v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the anomalous ionization rate observed in the Central Molecular Zone can be attributed to MeV dark matter annihilations into $e^+e^-$ pairs for galactic dark matter profiles with slopes $\gamma&gt;1$. The low annihilation cross-sections required avoid cosmological constraints and imply no detectable inverse Compton, bremsstrahlung or synchrotron emissions in radio, X and gamma rays. The possible connection to the source of the unexplained 511 keV line emission in the Galactic Center suggests that both observations could be correlated and have a common origin.</description>

      <title>Impact of the relativistic Cowling approximation on shear and interface modes of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate shear and interface modes excited in neutron stars with an elastic crust in the full general relativistic framework and compare them to the results obtained within the relativistic Cowling approximation. We observe that the Cowling approximation has virtually no impact on the frequencies or the eigenfunctions of the shear modes; in contrast, the interface modes that arise due to the discontinuities of the shear modulus experience a considerable shift in frequency when applying the Cowling approximation . Furthermore, we extend a scheme based on the properties of the phase of amplitude ratios, which allows us to estimate the damping times of slowly damped modes; our extension can provide an estimation of the damping time even if the features of the amplitude ratio are incomplete or if some of them violate the underlying linearity assumption. The proposed scheme is also computationally less expensive and numerically more robust and we provide accurate estimates as well as lower bounds for damping times of shear and interface modes. We estimate the damping times also via the quadrupole formula and find that it provides good order-of-magnitude estimates.</description>

      <title>Boson star superradiance with spinning effects and in time domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superradiance, the process by which waves are amplified through energy and angular momentum transfer, can also occur in horizonless objects like boson stars, due to both the real space and internal field space rotations. In this work, we study superradiance in the frequency and time domains for static and spinning boson stars, constructed within general relativity and with a self-interacting complex scalar field as a matter source. Using linear perturbation theory and three dimensional nonlinear simulations, we calculate amplification factors and analyze energy and angular momentum transfer in scattering processes, with results showing consistency between approaches. Wave scattering inside a cavity containing a boson star is also examined, demonstrating the effects of confinement on amplification.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity reduction of binary neutron star initial data with the entropy based flux limiting scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The construction of high-resolution shock-capturing schemes is vital in producing highly accurate gravitational waveforms from neutron star binaries. The entropy based flux limiting (EFL) scheme is able to perform fast converging binary neutron star merger simulations reaching up to fourth-order convergence in the gravitational waveform phase. In these results the EFL method was used only in the dynamical evolution of initial data constructed with the Lorene library. Here, we extend the use of the EFL method to the construction of eccentricity reduced initial data for neutron star binaries and present several new BNS simulations resulting from such initial data and show for the first time up to optimal fifth-order convergence in the gravitational waveform phase.</description>

      <title>Spacetime curvature corrections for the Yukawa potential and its application for the Reissner-Nordstr\"om Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the influence of the spacetime curvature on the Yukawa potential, focusing on boson-boson interactions derived from the {\Phi^3} theory. Using the Bunch-Parker propagator expansion within Born's first approximation, we derive a Yukawa-like potential in a curved spacetime. We analyze the impact of the curvature on the propagator in momentum space, revealing modifications to the potential and showing that the corrections are determined by geometric quantities from Einstein's equations, like the Ricci scalar and tensor. We illustrate this using the Reissner-Nordstr\"om metric, highlighting the corrections' magnitude for specific parameters. Our results underscore the nuanced interplay between spacetime curvature and quantum interactions, providing insights into nucleon-nucleon systems in curved spacetimes or near strong gravitational fields.</description>
