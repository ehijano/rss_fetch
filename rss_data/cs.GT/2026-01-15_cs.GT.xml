      <title>On the Fair Allocation to Asymmetric Agents with Binary XOS Valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of allocating $m$ indivisible goods among $n$ agents, where each agent's valuation is fractionally subadditive (XOS). With respect to AnyPrice Share (APS) fairness, Kulkarni et al. (2024) showed that, when agents have binary marginal values, a $0.1222$-APS allocation can be found in polynomial time, and there exists an instance where no allocation is better than $0.5$-approximate APS. Very recently, Feige and Grinberg (2025) extended the problem to the asymmetric case, where agents may have different entitlements, and improved the approximation ratio to $1/6$ for general XOS valuations. In this work, we focus on the asymmetric setting with binary XOS valuations, and further improve the approximation ratio to $1/2$, which matches the known upper bound. We also present a polynomial-time algorithm to compute such an allocation. Beyond APS fairness, we also study the weighted maximin share (WMMS) fairness. Farhadi et al. (2019) showed that, a $1/n$-WMMS allocation always exists for agents with general additive valuations, and that this approximation ratio is tight. We extend this result to general XOS valuations, where a $1/n$-WMMS allocation still exists, and this approximation ratio cannot be improved even when marginal values are binary. This shows a sharp contrast to binary additive valuations, where an exact WMMS allocation exists and can be found in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Measuring the benefits of lying in MARA under egalitarian social welfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When some resources are to be distributed among a set of agents following egalitarian social welfare, the goal is to maximize the utility of the agent whose utility turns out to be minimal. In this context, agents can have an incentive to lie about their actual preferences, so that more valuable resources are assigned to them. In this paper we analyze this situation, and we present a practical study where genetic algorithms are used to assess the benefits of lying under different situations.</description>

      <title>A resource theory of gambling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Betting games provide a natural setting to capture how information yields strategic advantage. The Kelly criterion for betting, long a cornerstone of portfolio theory and information theory, admits an interpretation in the limit of infinitely many repeated bets. We extend Kelly's seminal result into the single-shot and finite-betting regimes, recasting it as a resource theory of adversarial information. This allows one to quantify what it means for the gambler to have more information than the odds-maker. Given a target rate of return, after a finite number of bets, we compute the optimal strategy which maximises the probability of successfully reaching the target, revealing a risk-reward trade-off characterised by a hierarchy of R\'enyi divergences between the true distribution and the odds. The optimal strategies in the one-shot regime coincide with strategies maximizing expected utility, and minimising hypothesis testing errors, thereby bridging economic and information-theoretic viewpoints. We then generalize this framework to a distributed side-information game, in which multiple players observe correlated signals about an unknown state. Recasting gambling as an adversarial resource theory provides a unifying lens that connects economic and information-theoretic perspectives, and allows for generalisation to the quantum domain, where quantum side-information and entanglement play analogous roles.</description>

      <title>A game-theoretic probability approach to loopholes in CHSH experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the CHSH inequality from an informational, timing-sensitive viewpoint using game-theoretic probability, which avoids assuming an underlying probability space. The locality loophole and the measurement-dependence (``freedom-of-choice'') loophole are reformulated as structural constraints in a sequential hidden-variable game between Scientists and Nature. We construct a loopholes-closed game with capital processes that test (i) convergence of empirical conditional frequencies to the CHSH correlations and (ii) the absence of systematic correlations between measurement settings and Nature's hidden-variable assignments, and prove that Nature cannot satisfy both simultaneously: at least one capital process must diverge. This yields an operational winning strategy for Scientists and a game-theoretic probabilistic interpretation of experimentally observed CHSH violations.</description>

      <title>Welfare Loss in Connected Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the allocation of indivisible items that form an undirected graph and investigate the worst-case welfare loss when requiring that each agent must receive a connected subgraph. Our focus is on both egalitarian and utilitarian welfare. Specifically, we introduce the concept of egalitarian (resp., utilitarian) price of connectivity, which captures the worst-case ratio between the optimal egalitarian (resp., utilitarian) welfare among all allocations and that among connected allocations. We provide tight or asymptotically tight bounds on the price of connectivity for several large classes of graphs in the case of two agents -- including graphs with vertex connectivity $1$ or $2$ and complete bipartite graphs -- as well as for paths, stars, and cycles in the general case where the number of agents can be arbitrary.</description>

      <title>Optimism Without Regularization: Constant Regret in Zero-Sum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16736v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the optimistic variant of Fictitious Play for learning in two-player zero-sum games. While it is known that Optimistic FTRL -- a regularized algorithm with a bounded stepsize parameter -- obtains constant regret in this setting, we show for the first time that similar, optimal rates are also achievable without regularization: we prove for two-strategy games that Optimistic Fictitious Play (using any tiebreaking rule) obtains only constant regret, providing surprising new evidence on the ability of non-no-regret algorithms for fast learning in games. Our proof technique leverages a geometric view of Optimistic Fictitious Play in the dual space of payoff vectors, where we show a certain energy function of the iterates remains bounded over time. Additionally, we also prove a regret lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ for Alternating Fictitious Play. In the unregularized regime, this separates the ability of optimism and alternation in achieving $o(\sqrt{T})$ regret.</description>
