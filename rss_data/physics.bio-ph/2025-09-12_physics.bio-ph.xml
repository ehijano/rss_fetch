      <title>Spontaneous elongation of 3D gastruloids from local cell polarity alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gastruloids are 3D stem cell aggregate models for early embryogenesis that provide a unique platform to study how collective cell dynamics drive tissue symmetry breaking and axial elongation. Using 3D light sheet imaging, we show that a pulse of Chiron, a Wnt activator, induces coherent alignment of cell polarity during elongation. While nuclear elongation occurs with or without treatment, only Chiron-treated gastruloids exhibit quasi-long-range alignment of nuclear axes, linking cell polarity coherence to tissue-scale remodeling. A minimal physical model of polarized cells, incorporating alignment-dependent torques and polarity-mediated adhesion, reproduces symmetry breaking and elongation, demonstrating that local cell polarity alignment alone can drive tissue-scale convergence-extension flows.</description>

      <title>Simulating Organogenesis in COMSOL Multiphysics: Tissue Patterning with Directed Cell Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a COMSOL Multiphysics implementation of a continuum model for directed cell migration, a key mechanism underlying tissue self-organization and morphogenesis. The model is formulated as a partial integro-differential equation (PIDE), combining random motility with non-local, density-dependent guidance cues to capture phenomena such as cell sorting and aggregation. Our framework supports simulations in one, two, and three dimensions, with both zero-flux and periodic boundary conditions, and can be reformulated in a Lagrangian setting to efficiently handle tissue growth and domain deformation. We demonstrate that COMSOL Multiphysics enables a flexible and accessible implementation of PIDEs, providing a generalizable platform for studying collective cell behavior and pattern formation in complex biological contexts.</description>

      <title>Joint Probability Distribution of mRNA and Protein Molecules in a Stochastic Gene Expression Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic modeling of gene expression is a classic problem in theoretical biophysics. However, models formulated via chemical master equation have long been considered analytically intractable unless burst approximation is applied. This article shows that general stochastic gene expression models with an arbitrary number of gene states admit direct analysis. Based on chemical master equation and high-dimensional binomial moment method, we derive recurrence relations for binomial moments in steady state, yielding analytical expressions to arbitrary order in a hierarchical manner. Subsequently, the joint probability mass function of mRNA and protein copy number can be reconstructed. An algorithm is developed for numerical computation. Particularly, explicit expressions for low-order cumulants are presented. Compared with models under burst approximation, the first-order cumulant remains exact, whereas the second-order cumulant typically differs. We estimate the difference between two second-order binomial moments using functional analysis, therefore evaluating the validity of burst approximation.</description>

      <title>Electrophoretic Beamforming in Molecular Communication: Toward Targeted Extracellular Vesicle Delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directing extracellular vesicles (EVs), such as exosomes and microvesicles, toward specific cells is an emerging focus in nanomedicine, owing to their natural role as carriers of proteins, RNAs, and drugs. EVs can be manipulated by external electric fields due to their intrinsic surface charge and biophysical properties. This study investigates the feasibility of using extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields to guide EV transport. A theoretical framework based on the Fokker-Planck equation was developed and numerically solved to model vesicle trajectories under time-harmonic drift. Computational simulations were conducted to systematically assess the influence of key electric field parameters, including phase, frequency, and intensity, on vesicle displacement and trajectory. The findings demonstrate that frequencies below 5 Hz combined with field strengths of 200-2000 V/m can induce substantial directional control of EV motion. Moreover, enhanced directivity was achieved through the application of multi-component electric fields. Overall, this work establishes a theoretical foundation for the external-field-based beamforming of nanoparticles within the framework of molecular communication.</description>

      <title>Coarsening model of chromosomal crossover placement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chromosomal crossovers play a crucial role in meiotic cell division, as they ensure proper chromosome segregation and increase genetic variability. Experiments have consistently revealed two key observations across species: (i) the number of crossovers per chromosome is typically small, but at least one, and (ii) crossovers on the same chromosome are subject to interference, i.e., they are more separated than expected by chance. These observations can be explained by a recently proposed coarsening model, where the dynamics of droplets associated with chromosomes designate crossovers. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the coarsening model, which we also extend by including material exchanges between droplets, the synaptonemal complex, and the nucleoplasm. We derive scaling laws for the crossover count, which allows us to analyze data across species. Moreover, our model provides a coherent explanation of experimental data across mutants, including the wild-type and zyp1-mutant of A. thaliana. Consequently, the extended coarsening model provides a solid framework for investigating the underlying mechanisms of crossover placement.</description>

      <title>Vortex triplets, symmetry breaking, and emergent nonequilibrium plastic crystals in an active-spinner fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of patterns and exotic nonequilibrium steady states in active-fluid systems continues to pose challenging problems -- theoretical, numerical, and experimental -- for statistical physicists and fluid dynamicists. We combine theoretical ideas from statistical mechanics and fluid mechanics to uncover a new type of self-assembled crystal of vortex triplets in an active-spinner fluid. We begin with the two-dimensional Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) model for a binary-fluid system of active rotors that has two important ingredients: a scalar order parameter field phi that distinguishes regions with clockwise (CW) and counter-clockwise (CCW) spinners; and an incompressible velocity field u. In addition to the conventional CHNS coupling between phi and u, this model has a torque-induced activity term, with coefficient tau, whose consequences we explore. We demonstrate that, if we increase the activity tau, it overcomes dissipation and this system displays a hitherto unanticipated emergent triangular crystal, with spinning vortex triplets at its vertices. We show that this is a nonequilibrium counterpart of an equilibrium plastic crystal. We characterise the statistical properties of this novel crystal and suggest possible experimental realisations of this new state of active matter.</description>

      <title>bioSBM: a random graph model to integrate epigenomic data in chromatin structure prediction</title>

Abstract: The spatial organization of chromatin within the nucleus plays a crucial role in gene expression and genome function. However, the quantitative relationship between this organization and nuclear biochemical processes remains under debate. In this study, we present a graph-based generative model, bioSBM, designed to capture long-range chromatin interaction patterns from Hi-C data and, importantly, simultaneously link these patterns to biochemical features. Applying bioSBM to Hi-C maps of the GM12878 lymphoblastoid cell line, we identified a latent structure of chromatin interactions, revealing 7 distinct communities that strongly align with known biological annotations. Additionally, we infer a linear transformation that maps biochemical observables, such as histone marks, to the parameters of the generative graph model, enabling accurate genome-wide predictions of chromatin contact maps on out-of-sample data, both within the same cell line, and on the completely unseen HCT116 cell line under RAD21 depletion. These findings highlight bioSBM's potential as a powerful tool for elucidating the relationship between biochemistry and chromatin architecture and predicting long-range genome organization from independent biochemical data.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Insights into the Chain-Length-Dependent Antifreeze Activity of Oligoprolines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) activity of polymers generally increases with chain length. However, for polyproline (PPro), a highly potent cryoprotectant, the IRI activity varies nonmonotonically with the degree of polymerization (DP), i.e., DP=8 (P8) &gt; DP=15 (P15) &gt; DP=3 (P3). Herein, we employ molecular dynamics simulations to reveal the microscopic mechanism behind this nonmonotonic effect in PPro. Our findings indicate that the population of the PPII helix structure, which increases with DP, is not the primary reason for this effect. Instead, both single-molecule conformation and multi-molecule aggregation play critical roles. At the single-molecule level, PPro exhibits two types of thermodynamically stable conformations:linear (L) and coil (C), with the latter demonstrating enhanced IRI potency due to its stronger hydrophobicity and ice-binding capability. Notably, P8 has a higher content of the C conformation compared to P15, accounting for its superior IRI activity. Aligning with the conventional understandings, P3's lowest activity stems from its excessively small volume/coverage area on the ice surface. At the multi-molecule level, P15 shows a significantly higher tendency to aggregate than P8, which limits the ability of PPro molecules to fully spread at the ice-water interface and reduces their effective coverage of the ice surface, thereby diminishing its effectiveness. And P15's aggregation becomes significantly pronounced at high concentrations, amplifying the nonmonotonic effect. This work provides an atomistic insight into the nonmonotonic relationship between IRI activity and DP in PPro, offering valuable insights for the rational design of novel biocompatible antifreeze polymers.</description>

      <title>Evaluating non-equilibrium trajectories via mean back relaxation: Dependence on length and time scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mean back relaxation (MBR) relates the value of a stochastic process at three different time points. It has been shown to detect broken detailed balance under certain conditions. For experiments of probe particles in living and passivated cells, MBR was found to be related to the so called effective energy, which quantifies the violation of the fluctuation dissipation theorem. In this manuscript, we discuss the dependence on the length and time parameters that enter MBR, both for cells as well as for a model system, finding qualitative agreement between the two. For the cell data, we extend the phenomenological relation between MBR and effective energy to a larger range of time parameters compared to previous work, allowing to test it in systems with limited resolution. We analyze the variance of back relaxation (VBR) in dependence of the mentioned parameters, relevant for the statistical error in MBR evaluation. For Gaussian systems, the variance is found analytically in terms of the mean squared displacement, and we determine its absolute minimum as a function of the length and time parameters. Comparing VBR from cell data to a Gaussian prediction demonstrates a non-Gaussian process.</description>
