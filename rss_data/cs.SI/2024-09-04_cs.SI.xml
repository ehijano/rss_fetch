      <title>Fair Railway Network Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When designing a public transportation network in a country, one may want to minimise the sum of travel duration of all inhabitants. This corresponds to a purely utilitarian view and does not involve any fairness consideration, as the resulting network will typically benefit the capital city and/or large central cities while leaving some peripheral cities behind. On the other hand, a more egalitarian view will allow some people to travel between peripheral cities without having to go through a central city. We define a model, propose algorithms for computing solution networks, and report on experiments based on real data.</description>

      <title>Wikipedia in Wartime: Experiences of Wikipedians Maintaining Articles About the Russia-Ukraine War</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How do Wikipedians maintain an accurate encyclopedia during an ongoing geopolitical conflict where state actors might seek to spread disinformation or conduct an information operation? In the context of the Russia-Ukraine War, this question becomes more pressing, given the Russian government's extensive history of orchestrating information campaigns. We conducted an interview study with 13 expert Wikipedians involved in the Russo-Ukrainian War topic area on the English-language edition of Wikipedia. While our participants did not perceive there to be clear evidence of a state-backed information operation, they agreed that war-related articles experienced high levels of disruptive editing from both Russia-aligned and Ukraine-aligned accounts. The English-language edition of Wikipedia had existing policies and processes at its disposal to counter such disruption. State-backed or not, the disruptive activity created time-intensive maintenance work for our participants. Finally, participants considered English-language Wikipedia to be more resilient than social media in preventing the spread of false information online. We conclude by discussing sociotechnical implications for Wikipedia and social platforms.</description>

      <title>A Topic-wise Exploration of the Telegram Group-verse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although currently one of the most popular instant messaging apps worldwide, Telegram has been largely understudied in the past years. In this paper, we aim to address this gap by presenting an analysis of publicly accessible groups covering discussions encompassing different topics, as diverse as Education, Erotic, Politics, and Cryptocurrencies. We engineer and offer an open-source tool to automate the collection of messages from Telegram groups, a non-straightforward problem. We use it to collect more than 50 million messages from 669 groups. Here, we present a first-of-its-kind, per-topic analysis, contrasting the characteristics of the messages sent on the platform from different angles -- the language, the presence of bots, the type and volume of shared media content. Our results confirm some anecdotal evidence, e.g., clues that Telegram is used to share possibly illicit content, and unveil some unexpected findings, e.g., the different sharing patterns of video and stickers in groups of different topics. While preliminary, we hope that our work paves the road for several avenues of future research on the understudied Telegram platform.</description>

      <title>Detecting Calls to Action in Multimodal Content: Analysis of the 2021 German Federal Election Campaign on Instagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the automated classification of Calls to Action (CTAs) within the 2021 German Instagram election campaign to advance the understanding of mobilization in social media contexts. We analyzed over 2,208 Instagram stories and 712 posts using fine-tuned BERT models and OpenAI's GPT-4 models. The fine-tuned BERT model incorporating synthetic training data achieved a macro F1 score of 0.93, demonstrating a robust classification performance. Our analysis revealed that 49.58% of Instagram posts and 10.64% of stories contained CTAs, highlighting significant differences in mobilization strategies between these content types. Additionally, we found that FDP and the Greens had the highest prevalence of CTAs in posts, whereas CDU and CSU led in story CTAs.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Like-Minded Peers to Overcome Friend Data Sparsity in Session-Based Social Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Session-based Social Recommendation (SSR) leverages social relationships within online networks to enhance the performance of Session-based Recommendation (SR). However, existing SSR algorithms often encounter the challenge of ``friend data sparsity''. Moreover, significant discrepancies can exist between the purchase preferences of social network friends and those of the target user, reducing the influence of friends relative to the target user's own preferences. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the concept of ``Like-minded Peers'' (LMP), representing users whose preferences align with the target user's current session based on their historical sessions. This is the first work, to our knowledge, that uses LMP to enhance the modeling of social influence in SSR. This approach not only alleviates the problem of friend data sparsity but also effectively incorporates users with similar preferences to the target user. We propose a novel model named Transformer Encoder with Graph Attention Aggregator Recommendation (TEGAARec), which includes the TEGAA module and the GAT-based social aggregation module. The TEGAA module captures and merges both long-term and short-term interests for target users and LMP users. Concurrently, the GAT-based social aggregation module is designed to aggregate the target users' dynamic interests and social influence in a weighted manner. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of our proposed model and ablation studies are done to illustrate the contributions of each component in TEGAARec.</description>

      <title>Language is Scary when Over-Analyzed: Unpacking Implied Misogynistic Reasoning with Argumentation Theory-Driven Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose misogyny detection as an Argumentative Reasoning task and we investigate the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to understand the implicit reasoning used to convey misogyny in both Italian and English. The central aim is to generate the missing reasoning link between a message and the implied meanings encoding the misogyny. Our study uses argumentation theory as a foundation to form a collection of prompts in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. These prompts integrate different techniques, including chain-of-thought reasoning and augmented knowledge. Our findings show that LLMs fall short on reasoning capabilities about misogynistic comments and that they mostly rely on their implicit knowledge derived from internalized common stereotypes about women to generate implied assumptions, rather than on inductive reasoning.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of drug trafficking: Results from a simple compartmental model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we propose a simple model for the emergence of drug dealers. For this purpose, we built a compartmental model considering four subpopulations, namely susceptibles, passive supporters, drug dealers and arrested drug dealers. The target is to study the influence of the passive supporters on the long-time prevalence of drug dealers. Passive supporters are people who are passively consenting to the drug trafficking cause. First we consider the model on a fully-connected newtork, in such a way that we can write a rate equation for each subpopulation. Our analytical and numerical results show that the emergence of drug dealers is a consequence of the rapid increase number of passive supporters. Such increase is associated with a nonequilibrium active-absorbing phase transition. After that, we consider the model on a two-dimensional square lattice, in order to compare the results in the presence of a simple social network with the previous results. The Monte Carlo simulation results suggest a similar behavior in comparison with the fully-connected network case, but the location of the critical point of the transition is distinct, due to the neighbors' correlations introduced by the presence of the lattice.</description>

      <title>Task-Oriented Communication for Graph Data: A Graph Information Bottleneck Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph data, essential in fields like knowledge representation and social networks, often involves large networks with many nodes and edges. Transmitting these graphs can be highly inefficient due to their size and redundancy for specific tasks. This paper introduces a method to extract a smaller, task-focused subgraph that maintains key information while reducing communication overhead. Our approach utilizes graph neural networks (GNNs) and the graph information bottleneck (GIB) principle to create a compact, informative, and robust graph representation suitable for transmission. The challenge lies in the irregular structure of graph data, making GIB optimization complex. We address this by deriving a tractable variational upper bound for the objective function. Additionally, we propose the VQ-GIB mechanism, integrating vector quantization (VQ) to convert subgraph representations into a discrete codebook sequence, compatible with existing digital communication systems. Our experiments show that this GIB-based method significantly lowers communication costs while preserving essential task-related information. The approach demonstrates robust performance across various communication channels, suitable for both continuous and discrete systems.</description>

      <title>Structural Measures of Resilience for Supply Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the structural factors that drive cascading failures in production networks, focusing on quantifying these risks with a topological resilience metric corresponding to the largest exogenous systemic shock that the production network can withstand, such that almost all of the network survives with high probability. We model failures using a node percolation process where systemic shocks cause suppliers to fail, leading to further breakdowns. We classify networks into two categories -- resilient and fragile -- based on their ability to handle shocks as the network grows large, and give bounds on their resilience. We show that the main factors affecting resilience are the number of raw products (primary sector), the number of final goods (final sector), and the source and supply dependencies. Further, we give methods to lower bound resilience based on bounding the cascade size with a linear program that can be efficiently calculated. We establish connections between our model, the independent cascade model, the Risk Exposure Index, and the Eisenberg-Noe contagion model. We give an almost linear-time deterministic algorithm to approximate the cascade size, which matches known lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. Finally, we design intervention algorithms and show that under reasonable assumptions, targeting nodes based on Katz centrality in the edge-reversed network is optimal. Finally, we account for network heterogeneities and validate our findings with real-world data.</description>

      <title>MeSH Concept Relevance and Knowledge Evolution: A Data-driven Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), one of the main knowledge organization systems in the biomedical domain, is constantly evolving following the latest scientific discoveries in health and life sciences. Previous research focused on quantifying information in MeSH using its hierarchical structure. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach based on information theory and network analyses to quantify the knowledge evolution in MeSH and the relevance of its individual concepts. Our approach leverages article annotations and their citation networks to compute the level of informativeness, usefulness, disruptiveness, and influence of MeSH concepts over time. The citation network includes the instances of MeSH concepts or MeSH headings, and the concept relevance is calculated individually. Then, this computation is propagated to the hierarchy to establish the relevance of a concept. We quantitatively evaluated our approach using changes in the MeSH terminology and showed that it effectively captures the evolution of the terminology. Moreover, we validated the ability of our framework to characterize retracted articles and showed that concepts used to annotate retracted articles differ substantially from those used to annotate non-retracted ones. The proposed framework provides an effective method to rank concept relevance and can be useful in maintaining evolving knowledge organization systems.</description>
