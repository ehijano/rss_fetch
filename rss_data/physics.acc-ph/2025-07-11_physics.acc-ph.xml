      <title>Single-particle Non-linear Beam Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation of single-particle dynamics in circular particle accelerators can be traced back to pioneering works in the 1950s. Traditionally, the design of new circular accelerators has focused on optimising linear dynamics, striving to minimise non-linear effects. When encountered, these effects were managed using suitable correction techniques. However, in recent years, this methodology has undergone significant reconsideration, leading to a more favourable view of non-linear beam dynamics. Notably, several new concepts have been promoted to improve the description and modelling of non-linear beam dynamics. Furthermore, new proposals have emerged that leverage the extensive potential of non-linear beam dynamics to enhance the control and manipulation of the characteristic features of charged particle beams. This article provides a detailed review and discussion of all these innovative approaches.</description>

      <title>Milestone toward an ECRIPAC accelerator demonstrator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Plasma ACcelerator (ECRIPAC) is an original accelerator concept proposed in the nineties for the generation of highly energetic pulsed ion beams, suitable for a wide array of applications. The initial studies on the subject were characterized by an important calculation mistake, leading to an incomplete and erroneous literature on the topic. Nevertheless, the simple and well mastered techniques involved in the system (radio frequency and magnetic field), together with the device compactness, are strong motivations for further studies on ECRIPAC. The working principle and physical theory behind the ECRIPAC accelerator concept are thoroughly reviewed in this paper, incorporating significant corrections to the existing literature on the subject, making this work a suitable reference for future studies. A detailed theoretical investigation of the stability condition for the ion acceleration is presented, highlighting more stringent limitations than previously anticipated. Next, the impact of several physical parameters on the accelerator design is analyzed. This study led to the design of a compact demonstrator device able to accelerate He2+ ions up to 9.5 MeV per nucleon inside a 1.8 m long accelerating cavity. Finally, the results of a Monte-Carlo simulation, developed to model the electron dynamics inside the system, are used to validate the theoretical framework of ECRIPAC.</description>

      <title>Collider-quality electron bunches from an all-optical plasma photoinjector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09557v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for generating collider-quality electron bunches using a plasma photoinjector. The approach leverages recently developed techniques for the spatiotemporal control of laser pulses to produce a moving ionization front in a nonlinear plasma wave. The moving ionization front generates an electron bunch with a current profile that balances the longitudinal electric field of an electron beam-driven plasma wave, creating a uniform accelerating field across the bunch. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of the ionization stage show the formation of an electron bunch with 220 pC charge and low emittance ($\epsilon_x = 171$ nm-rad, $\epsilon_y = 76$ nm-rad). Quasistatic PIC simulations of the acceleration stage show that the bunch is efficiently accelerated to 20 GeV over 2 meters with a final energy spread of less than 1\% and emittances of $\epsilon_x = 177$ nm-rad and $\epsilon_y = 82$ nm-rad. This high-quality electron bunch meets the requirements outlined by the Snowmass process for intermediate-energy colliders and compares favorably to the beam quality of proposed and existing accelerator facilities. The results establish the feasibility of plasma photoinjectors for future collider applications making a significant step towards the realization of high-luminosity, compact accelerators for particle physics research.</description>

      <title>Design of a Storage Ring based on a Fixed Field Alternating Gradient Configuration with an Internal Target for Heavy-Ion Beams with Stochastic Charge State Conversions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the general use of a heavy-ion accelerator, an accelerated beam impinged on a target is spoiled into a beam dump. To make more efficient use of the beam, recycling of the beam passed through the target is proposed in the framework of the so-called energy recovery internal target (ERIT). In the ERIT system, the target is irradiated inside the circulating beam by recovering the energy lost in the target using rf cavities. So far, such a system has been realized only for proton beams. Here, the ERIT system for heavy-ion beam is demonstrated for the first time. A challenging issue is the circulation of all ions with different atomic charge. An ion has a probability of equilibrated charge state distribution after passing through the target, independent of the initial charge state. This phenomenon of stochastic charge state conversion (SCSC) causes rapid beam-emittance growth. To solve this problem, we developed a method to match the closed orbits and betatron functions of the beams in different charge states at the target location in a ring based on a scaling fixed field alternating gradient (FFA) lattice structure. We present the design of such an FFA ring and show, through full 6D beam tracking simulations, that transverse emittance growth can be effectively suppressed even in the presence of SCSC.</description>

      <title>Estimation of superconducting cavity bandwidth and detuning using a Luenberger observer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enabled by progress in superconducting technology, several continuous wave linear accelerators are foreseen in the next decade. For these machines, it is of crucial importance to track the main cavity parameters, such as the resonator bandwidth and detuning. The bandwidth yields information on the superconducting state of the cavity. The detuning should be minimized to limit the required power to operate the cavity. The estimation of these parameters is commonly implemented in the digital electronics of the Low-Level RF control system to minimize the computation delay. In this proceeding, we present a way to compute the bandwidth and detuning using a Luenberger observer. In contrast to previous methods, a state observer yields estimations at the native control system sample rate without explicitly filtering the input signals. Additionally, the error convergence properties of the estimations can be controlled intuitively by adjusting gain parameters. Implementation considerations and test results on the derived observer are presented in the manuscript.</description>
