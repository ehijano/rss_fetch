      <title>Toward Understanding the Disagreement Problem in Neural Network Feature Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, neural networks have demonstrated their remarkable ability to discern intricate patterns and relationships from raw data. However, understanding the inner workings of these black box models remains challenging, yet crucial for high-stake decisions. Among the prominent approaches for explaining these black boxes are feature attribution methods, which assign relevance or contribution scores to each input variable for a model prediction. Despite the plethora of proposed techniques, ranging from gradient-based to backpropagation-based methods, a significant debate persists about which method to use. Various evaluation metrics have been proposed to assess the trustworthiness or robustness of their results. However, current research highlights disagreement among state-of-the-art methods in their explanations. Our work addresses this confusion by investigating the explanations' fundamental and distributional behavior. Additionally, through a comprehensive simulation study, we illustrate the impact of common scaling and encoding techniques on the explanation quality, assess their efficacy across different effect sizes, and demonstrate the origin of inconsistency in rank-based evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>VC Theory for Inventory Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in computational power and AI have increased interest in reinforcement learning approaches to inventory management. This paper provides a theoretical foundation for these approaches and investigates the benefits of restricting to policy structures that are well-established by decades of inventory theory. In particular, we prove generalization guarantees for learning several well-known classes of inventory policies, including base-stock and (s, S) policies, by leveraging the celebrated Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) theory. We apply the concepts of the Pseudo-dimension and Fat-shattering dimension from VC theory to determine the generalizability of inventory policies, that is, the difference between an inventory policy's performance on training data and its expected performance on unseen data. We focus on a classical setting without contexts, but allow for an arbitrary distribution over demand sequences and do not make any assumptions such as independence over time. We corroborate our supervised learning results using numerical simulations.
  Managerially, our theory and simulations translate to the following insights. First, there is a principle of "learning less is more" in inventory management: depending on the amount of data available, it may be beneficial to restrict oneself to a simpler, albeit suboptimal, class of inventory policies to minimize overfitting errors. Second, the number of parameters in a policy class may not be the correct measure of overfitting error: in fact, the class of policies defined by T time-varying base-stock levels exhibits a generalization error comparable to that of the two-parameter (s, S) policy class. Finally, our research suggests situations in which it could be beneficial to incorporate the concepts of base-stock and inventory position into black-box learning machines, instead of having these machines directly learn the order quantity actions.</description>

      <title>Geometric Neural Operators (GNPs) for Data-Driven Deep Learning of Non-Euclidean Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Geometric Neural Operators (GNPs) for accounting for geometric contributions in data-driven deep learning of operators. We show how GNPs can be used (i) to estimate geometric properties, such as the metric and curvatures, (ii) to approximate Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) on manifolds, (iii) learn solution maps for Laplace-Beltrami (LB) operators, and (iv) to solve Bayesian inverse problems for identifying manifold shapes. The methods allow for handling geometries of general shape including point-cloud representations. The developed GNPs provide approaches for incorporating the roles of geometry in data-driven learning of operators.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Optimization with Sparse Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications of large embedding models, we study differentially private (DP) optimization problems under sparsity of individual gradients. We start with new near-optimal bounds for the classic mean estimation problem but with sparse data, improving upon existing algorithms particularly for the high-dimensional regime. Building on this, we obtain pure- and approximate-DP algorithms with almost optimal rates for stochastic convex optimization with sparse gradients; the former represents the first nearly dimension-independent rates for this problem. Finally, we study the approximation of stationary points for the empirical loss in approximate-DP optimization and obtain rates that depend on sparsity instead of dimension, modulo polylogarithmic factors.</description>

      <title>A variational neural Bayes framework for inference on intractable posterior distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classic Bayesian methods with complex models are frequently infeasible due to an intractable likelihood. Simulation-based inference methods, such as Approximate Bayesian Computing (ABC), calculate posteriors without accessing a likelihood function by leveraging the fact that data can be quickly simulated from the model, but converge slowly and/or poorly in high-dimensional settings. In this paper, we propose a framework for Bayesian posterior estimation by mapping data to posteriors of parameters using a neural network trained on data simulated from the complex model. Posterior distributions of model parameters are efficiently obtained by feeding observed data into the trained neural network. We show theoretically that our posteriors converge to the true posteriors in Kullback-Leibler divergence. Our approach yields computationally efficient and theoretically justified uncertainty quantification, which is lacking in existing simulation-based neural network approaches. Comprehensive simulation studies highlight our method's robustness and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Molecular relaxation by reverse diffusion with time step prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular relaxation, finding the equilibrium state of a non-equilibrium structure, is an essential component of computational chemistry to understand reactivity. Classical force field methods often rely on insufficient local energy minimization, while neural network force field models require large labeled datasets encompassing both equilibrium and non-equilibrium structures. As a remedy, we propose MoreRed, molecular relaxation by reverse diffusion, a conceptually novel and purely statistical approach where non-equilibrium structures are treated as noisy instances of their corresponding equilibrium states. To enable the denoising of arbitrarily noisy inputs via a generative diffusion model, we further introduce a novel diffusion time step predictor. Notably, MoreRed learns a simpler pseudo potential energy surface instead of the complex physical potential energy surface. It is trained on a significantly smaller, and thus computationally cheaper, dataset consisting of solely unlabeled equilibrium structures, avoiding the computation of non-equilibrium structures altogether. We compare MoreRed to classical force fields, equivariant neural network force fields trained on a large dataset of equilibrium and non-equilibrium data, as well as a semi-empirical tight-binding model. To assess this quantitatively, we evaluate the root-mean-square deviation between the found equilibrium structures and the reference equilibrium structures as well as their DFT energies.</description>

      <title>Pixel-Wise Symbol Spotting via Progressive Points Location for Parsing CAD Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parsing Computer-Aided Design (CAD) drawings is a fundamental step for CAD revision, semantic-based management, and the generation of 3D prototypes in both the architecture and engineering industries. Labeling symbols from a CAD drawing is a challenging yet notorious task from a practical point of view. In this work, we propose to label and spot symbols from CAD images that are converted from CAD drawings. The advantage of spotting symbols from CAD images lies in the low requirement of labelers and the low-cost annotation. However, pixel-wise spotting symbols from CAD images is challenging work. We propose a pixel-wise point location via Progressive Gaussian Kernels (PGK) to balance between training efficiency and location accuracy. Besides, we introduce a local offset to the heatmap-based point location method. Based on the keypoints detection, we propose a symbol grouping method to redraw the rectangle symbols in CAD images. We have released a dataset containing CAD images of equipment rooms from telecommunication industrial CAD drawings. Extensive experiments on this real-world dataset show that the proposed method has good generalization ability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the information geometrical structure of a determinantal point process (DPP). It demonstrates that a DPP is embedded in the exponential family of log-linear models. The extent of deviation from an exponential family is analyzed using the $\mathrm{e}$-embedding curvature tensor, which identifies partially flat parameters of a DPP. On the basis of this embedding structure, the duality related to a marginal kernel and an $L$-ensemble kernel is discovered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly being used in metrology applications. However, for ML models to be credible in a metrology context they should be accompanied by principled uncertainty quantification. This paper addresses the challenge of uncertainty propagation through trained/fixed machine learning (ML) regression models. Analytical expressions for the mean and variance of the model output are obtained/presented for certain input data distributions and for a variety of ML models. Our results cover several popular ML models including linear regression, penalised linear regression, kernel ridge regression, Gaussian Processes (GPs), support vector machines (SVMs) and relevance vector machines (RVMs). We present numerical experiments in which we validate our methods and compare them with a Monte Carlo approach from a computational efficiency point of view. We also illustrate our methods in the context of a metrology application, namely modelling the state-of-health of lithium-ion cells based upon Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) data</description>

      <title>The Causal Chambers: Real Physical Systems as a Testbed for AI Methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In some fields of AI, machine learning and statistics, the validation of new methods and algorithms is often hindered by the scarcity of suitable real-world datasets. Researchers must often turn to simulated data, which yields limited information about the applicability of the proposed methods to real problems. As a step forward, we have constructed two devices that allow us to quickly and inexpensively produce large datasets from non-trivial but well-understood physical systems. The devices, which we call causal chambers, are computer-controlled laboratories that allow us to manipulate and measure an array of variables from these physical systems, providing a rich testbed for algorithms from a variety of fields. We illustrate potential applications through a series of case studies in fields such as causal discovery, out-of-distribution generalization, change point detection, independent component analysis, and symbolic regression. For applications to causal inference, the chambers allow us to carefully perform interventions. We also provide and empirically validate a causal model of each chamber, which can be used as ground truth for different tasks. All hardware and software is made open source, and the datasets are publicly available at causalchamber.org or through the Python package causalchamber.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding good low rank approximations of symmetric, positive-definite $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$. Chen-Epperly-Tropp-Webber showed, among many other things, that the randomly pivoted partial Cholesky algorithm that chooses the $i-$th row with probability proportional to the diagonal entry $A_{ii}$ leads to a universal contraction of the trace norm (the Schatten 1-norm) in expectation for each step. We show that if one chooses the $i-$th row with likelihood proportional to $A_{ii}^2$ one obtains the same result in the Frobenius norm (the Schatten 2-norm). Implications for the greedy pivoting rule and pivot selection strategies are discussed.</description>

      <title>Decomposing and Editing Predictions by Modeling Model Computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How does the internal computation of a machine learning model transform inputs into predictions? In this paper, we introduce a task called component modeling that aims to address this question. The goal of component modeling is to decompose an ML model's prediction in terms of its components -- simple functions (e.g., convolution filters, attention heads) that are the "building blocks" of model computation. We focus on a special case of this task, component attribution, where the goal is to estimate the counterfactual impact of individual components on a given prediction. We then present COAR, a scalable algorithm for estimating component attributions; we demonstrate its effectiveness across models, datasets, and modalities. Finally, we show that component attributions estimated with COAR directly enable model editing across five tasks, namely: fixing model errors, ``forgetting'' specific classes, boosting subpopulation robustness, localizing backdoor attacks, and improving robustness to typographic attacks. We provide code for COAR at https://github.com/MadryLab/modelcomponents .</description>

Abstract: We introduce a deterministic variational formulation for training Bayesian last layer neural networks. This yields a sampling-free, single-pass model and loss that effectively improves uncertainty estimation. Our variational Bayesian last layer (VBLL) can be trained and evaluated with only quadratic complexity in last layer width, and is thus (nearly) computationally free to add to standard architectures. We experimentally investigate VBLLs, and show that they improve predictive accuracy, calibration, and out of distribution detection over baselines across both regression and classification. Finally, we investigate combining VBLL layers with variational Bayesian feature learning, yielding a lower variance collapsed variational inference method for Bayesian neural networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.01884v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decision makers often aim to learn a treatment assignment policy under a capacity constraint on the number of agents that they can treat. When agents can respond strategically to such policies, competition arises, complicating estimation of the optimal policy. In this paper, we study capacity-constrained treatment assignment in the presence of such interference. We consider a dynamic model where the decision maker allocates treatments at each time step and heterogeneous agents myopically best respond to the previous treatment assignment policy. When the number of agents is large but finite, we show that the threshold for receiving treatment under a given policy converges to the policy's mean-field equilibrium threshold. Based on this result, we develop a consistent estimator for the policy gradient. In a semi-synthetic experiment with data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988, we demonstrate that this estimator can be used for learning capacity-constrained policies in the presence of strategic behavior.</description>

Abstract: We propose an optimization algorithm for Variational Inference (VI) in complex models. Our approach relies on natural gradient updates where the variational space is a Riemann manifold. We develop an efficient algorithm for Gaussian Variational Inference whose updates satisfy the positive definite constraint on the variational covariance matrix. Our Manifold Gaussian Variational Bayes on the Precision matrix (MGVBP) solution provides simple update rules, is straightforward to implement, and the use of the precision matrix parametrization has a significant computational advantage. Due to its black-box nature, MGVBP stands as a ready-to-use solution for VI in complex models. Over five datasets, we empirically validate our feasible approach on different statistical and econometric models, discussing its performance with respect to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Lasso, Transfer Lasso, and Beyond: An Asymptotic Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of the theoretical properties inherent in the Adaptive Lasso and the Transfer Lasso. The Adaptive Lasso, a well-established method, employs regularization divided by initial estimators and is characterized by asymptotic normality and variable selection consistency. In contrast, the recently proposed Transfer Lasso employs regularization subtracted by initial estimators with the demonstrated capacity to curtail non-asymptotic estimation errors. A pivotal question thus emerges: Given the distinct ways the Adaptive Lasso and the Transfer Lasso employ initial estimators, what benefits or drawbacks does this disparity confer upon each method? This paper conducts a theoretical examination of the asymptotic properties of the Transfer Lasso, thereby elucidating its differentiation from the Adaptive Lasso. Informed by the findings of this analysis, we introduce a novel method, one that amalgamates the strengths and compensates for the weaknesses of both methods. The paper concludes with validations of our theory and comparisons of the methods via simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Extending Mean-Field Variational Inference via Entropic Regularization: Theory and Computation</title>

Abstract: Variational inference (VI) has emerged as a popular method for approximate inference for high-dimensional Bayesian models. In this paper, we propose a novel VI method that extends the naive mean field via entropic regularization, referred to as $\Xi$-variational inference ($\Xi$-VI). $\Xi$-VI has a close connection to the entropic optimal transport problem and benefits from the computationally efficient Sinkhorn algorithm. We show that $\Xi$-variational posteriors effectively recover the true posterior dependency, where the dependence is downweighted by the regularization parameter. We analyze the role of dimensionality of the parameter space on the accuracy of $\Xi$-variational approximation and how it affects computational considerations, providing a rough characterization of the statistical-computational trade-off in $\Xi$-VI. We also investigate the frequentist properties of $\Xi$-VI and establish results on consistency, asymptotic normality, high-dimensional asymptotics, and algorithmic stability. We provide sufficient criteria for achieving polynomial-time approximate inference using the method. Finally, we demonstrate the practical advantage of $\Xi$-VI over mean-field variational inference on simulated and real data.</description>

      <title>The Use of Binary Choice Forests to Model and Estimate Discrete Choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01109</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.01109v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Problem definition. In retailing, discrete choice models (DCMs) are commonly used to capture the choice behavior of customers when offered an assortment of products. When estimating DCMs using transaction data, flexible models (such as machine learning models or nonparametric models) are typically not interpretable and hard to estimate, while tractable models (such as the multinomial logit model) tend to misspecify the complex behavior represeted in the data. Methodology/results. In this study, we use a forest of binary decision trees to represent DCMs. This approach is based on random forests, a popular machine learning algorithm. The resulting model is interpretable: the decision trees can explain the decision-making process of customers during the purchase. We show that our approach can predict the choice probability of any DCM consistently and thus never suffers from misspecification. Moreover, our algorithm predicts assortments unseen in the training data. The mechanism and errors can be theoretically analyzed. We also prove that the random forest can recover preference rankings of customers thanks to the splitting criterion such as the Gini index and information gain ratio. Managerial implications. The framework has unique practical advantages. It can capture customers' behavioral patterns such as irrationality or sequential searches when purchasing a product. It handles nonstandard formats of training data that result from aggregation. It can measure product importance based on how frequently a random customer would make decisions depending on the presence of the product. It can also incorporate price information and customer features. Our numerical experiments using synthetic and real data show that using random forests to estimate customer choices can outperform existing methods.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Algorithms for Causal Inference with Panel Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03489v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conducting causal inference with panel data is a core challenge in social science research. We adapt a deep neural architecture for time series forecasting (the N-BEATS algorithm) to more accurately impute the counterfactual evolution of a treated unit had treatment not occurred. Across a range of settings, the resulting estimator (``SyNBEATS'') significantly outperforms commonly employed methods (synthetic controls, two-way fixed effects), and attains comparable or more accurate performance compared to recently proposed methods (synthetic difference-in-differences, matrix completion). An implementation of this estimator is available for public use. Our results highlight how advances in the forecasting literature can be harnessed to improve causal inference in panel data settings.</description>

      <title>Learning Algorithm Generalization Error Bounds via Auxiliary Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalization error bounds are essential for comprehending how well machine learning models work. In this work, we suggest a novel method, i.e., the Auxiliary Distribution Method, that leads to new upper bounds on expected generalization errors that are appropriate for supervised learning scenarios. We show that our general upper bounds can be specialized under some conditions to new bounds involving the $\alpha$-Jensen-Shannon, $\alpha$-R\'enyi ($0&lt; \alpha &lt; 1$) information between a random variable modeling the set of training samples and another random variable modeling the set of hypotheses. Our upper bounds based on $\alpha$-Jensen-Shannon information are also finite. Additionally, we demonstrate how our auxiliary distribution method can be used to derive the upper bounds on excess risk of some learning algorithms in the supervised learning context {\blue and the generalization error under the distribution mismatch scenario in supervised learning algorithms, where the distribution mismatch is modeled as $\alpha$-Jensen-Shannon or $\alpha$-R\'enyi divergence between the distribution of test and training data samples distributions.} We also outline the conditions for which our proposed upper bounds might be tighter than other earlier upper bounds.</description>

      <title>Additive Covariance Matrix Models: Modelling Regional Electricity Net-Demand in Great Britain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07451v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Forecasts of regional electricity net-demand, consumption minus embedded generation, are an essential input for reliable and economic power system operation, and energy trading. While such forecasts are typically performed region by region, operations such as managing power flows require spatially coherent joint forecasts, which account for cross-regional dependencies. Here, we forecast the joint distribution of net-demand across the 14 regions constituting Great Britain's electricity network. Joint modelling is complicated by the fact that the net-demand variability within each region, and the dependencies between regions, vary with temporal, socio-economical and weather-related factors. We accommodate for these characteristics by proposing a multivariate Gaussian model based on a modified Cholesky parametrisation, which allows us to model each unconstrained parameter via an additive model. Given that the number of model parameters and covariates is large, we adopt a semi-automated approach to model selection, based on gradient boosting. In addition to comparing the forecasting performance of several versions of the proposed model with that of two non-Gaussian copula-based models, we visually explore the model output to interpret how the covariates affect net-demand variability and dependencies.

      <title>Precise Asymptotics for Spectral Methods in Mixed Generalized Linear Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11368v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a mixed generalized linear model, the objective is to learn multiple signals from unlabeled observations: each sample comes from exactly one signal, but it is not known which one. We consider the prototypical problem of estimating two statistically independent signals in a mixed generalized linear model with Gaussian covariates. Spectral methods are a popular class of estimators which output the top two eigenvectors of a suitable data-dependent matrix. However, despite the wide applicability, their design is still obtained via heuristic considerations, and the number of samples $n$ needed to guarantee recovery is super-linear in the signal dimension $d$. In this paper, we develop exact asymptotics on spectral methods in the challenging proportional regime in which $n, d$ grow large and their ratio converges to a finite constant. By doing so, we are able to optimize the design of the spectral method, and combine it with a simple linear estimator, in order to minimize the estimation error. Our characterization exploits a mix of tools from random matrices, free probability and the theory of approximate message passing algorithms. Numerical simulations for mixed linear regression and phase retrieval demonstrate the advantage enabled by our analysis over existing designs of spectral methods.</description>

Abstract: Developing a general algorithm that learns to solve tasks across a wide range of applications has been a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence. Although current reinforcement learning algorithms can be readily applied to tasks similar to what they have been developed for, configuring them for new application domains requires significant human expertise and experimentation. We present DreamerV3, a general algorithm that outperforms specialized methods across over 150 diverse tasks, with a single configuration. Dreamer learns a model of the environment and improves its behavior by imagining future scenarios. Robustness techniques based on normalization, balancing, and transformations enable stable learning across domains. Applied out of the box, Dreamer is the first algorithm to collect diamonds in Minecraft from scratch without human data or curricula. This achievement has been posed as a significant challenge in artificial intelligence that requires exploring farsighted strategies from pixels and sparse rewards in an open world. Our work allows solving challenging control problems without extensive experimentation, making reinforcement learning broadly applicable.</description>

      <title>Provable Reward-Agnostic Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18505v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) is a paradigm in which an RL agent learns to optimize a task using pair-wise preference-based feedback over trajectories, rather than explicit reward signals. While PbRL has demonstrated practical success in fine-tuning language models, existing theoretical work focuses on regret minimization and fails to capture most of the practical frameworks. In this study, we fill in such a gap between theoretical PbRL and practical algorithms by proposing a theoretical reward-agnostic PbRL framework where exploratory trajectories that enable accurate learning of hidden reward functions are acquired before collecting any human feedback. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that our algorithm requires less human feedback for learning the optimal policy under preference-based models with linear parameterization and unknown transitions, compared to the existing theoretical literature. Specifically, our framework can incorporate linear and low-rank MDPs with efficient sample complexity. Additionally, we investigate reward-agnostic RL with action-based comparison feedback and introduce an efficient querying algorithm tailored to this scenario.</description>

      <title>Hacking Task Confounder in Meta-Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Meta-learning enables rapid generalization to new tasks by learning knowledge from various tasks. It is intuitively assumed that as the training progresses, a model will acquire richer knowledge, leading to better generalization performance. However, our experiments reveal an unexpected result: there is negative knowledge transfer between tasks, affecting generalization performance. To explain this phenomenon, we conduct Structural Causal Models (SCMs) for causal analysis. Our investigation uncovers the presence of spurious correlations between task-specific causal factors and labels in meta-learning. Furthermore, the confounding factors differ across different batches. We refer to these confounding factors as ``Task Confounders". Based on these findings, we propose a plug-and-play Meta-learning Causal Representation Learner (MetaCRL) to eliminate task confounders. It encodes decoupled generating factors from multiple tasks and utilizes an invariant-based bi-level optimization mechanism to ensure their causality for meta-learning. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our work achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.</description>

      <title>Distributional Preference Learning: Understanding and Accounting for Hidden Context in RLHF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In practice, preference learning from human feedback depends on incomplete data with hidden context. Hidden context refers to data that affects the feedback received, but which is not represented in the data used to train a preference model. This captures common issues of data collection, such as having human annotators with varied preferences, cognitive processes that result in seemingly irrational behavior, and combining data labeled according to different criteria. We prove that standard applications of preference learning, including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), implicitly aggregate over hidden contexts according to a well-known voting rule called Borda count. We show this can produce counter-intuitive results that are very different from other methods which implicitly aggregate via expected utility. Furthermore, our analysis formalizes the way that preference learning from users with diverse values tacitly implements a social choice function. A key implication of this result is that annotators have an incentive to misreport their preferences in order to influence the learned model, leading to vulnerabilities in the deployment of RLHF. As a step towards mitigating these problems, we introduce a class of methods called distributional preference learning (DPL). DPL methods estimate a distribution of possible score values for each alternative in order to better account for hidden context. Experimental results indicate that applying DPL to RLHF for LLM chatbots identifies hidden context in the data and significantly reduces subsequent jailbreak vulnerability.

      <title>Convergence of Expectation-Maximization Algorithm with Mixed-Integer Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The convergence of expectation-maximization (EM)-based algorithms typically requires continuity of the likelihood function with respect to all the unknown parameters (optimization variables). The requirement is not met when parameters comprise both discrete and continuous variables, making the convergence analysis nontrivial. This paper introduces a set of conditions that ensure the convergence of a specific class of EM algorithms that estimate a mixture of discrete and continuous parameters. Our results offer a new analysis technique for iterative algorithms that solve mixed-integer non-linear optimization problems. As a concrete example, we prove the convergence of the EM-based sparse Bayesian learning algorithm in [1] that estimates the state of a linear dynamical system with jointly sparse inputs and bursty missing observations. Our results establish that the algorithm in [1] converges to the set of stationary points of the maximum likelihood cost with respect to the continuous optimization variables.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a framework for benchmarking optimizers according to multiple criteria over various test functions. Based on a recently introduced union-free generic depth function for partial orders/rankings, it fully exploits the ordinal information and allows for incomparability. Our method describes the distribution of all partial orders/rankings, avoiding the notorious shortcomings of aggregation. This permits to identify test functions that produce central or outlying rankings of optimizers and to assess the quality of benchmarking suites.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of the echo state property in quantum reservoir computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02686v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The echo state property (ESP) represents a fundamental concept in the reservoir computing (RC) framework that ensures output-only training of reservoir networks by being agnostic to the initial states and far past inputs. However, the traditional definition of ESP does not describe possible non-stationary systems in which statistical properties evolve. To address this issue, we introduce two new categories of ESP: $\textit{non-stationary ESP}$, designed for potentially non-stationary systems, and $\textit{subspace/subset ESP}$, designed for systems whose subsystems have ESP. Following the definitions, we numerically demonstrate the correspondence between non-stationary ESP in the quantum reservoir computer (QRC) framework with typical Hamiltonian dynamics and input encoding methods using non-linear autoregressive moving-average (NARMA) tasks. We also confirm the correspondence by computing linear/non-linear memory capacities that quantify input-dependent components within reservoir states. Our study presents a new understanding of the practical design of QRC and other possibly non-stationary RC systems in which non-stationary systems and subsystems are exploited.</description>

      <title>Causal Inference for Genomic Data with Multiple Heterogeneous Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the evolution of single-cell RNA sequencing techniques into a standard approach in genomics, it has become possible to conduct cohort-level causal inferences based on single-cell-level measurements. However, the individual gene expression levels of interest are not directly observable; instead, only repeated proxy measurements from each individual's cells are available, providing a derived outcome to estimate the underlying outcome for each of many genes. In this paper, we propose a generic semiparametric inference framework for doubly robust estimation with multiple derived outcomes, which also encompasses the usual setting of multiple outcomes when the response of each unit is available. To reliably quantify the causal effects of heterogeneous outcomes, we specialize the analysis to standardized average treatment effects and quantile treatment effects. Through this, we demonstrate the use of the semiparametric inferential results for doubly robust estimators derived from both Von Mises expansions and estimating equations. A multiple testing procedure based on Gaussian multiplier bootstrap is tailored for doubly robust estimators to control the false discovery exceedance rate. Applications in single-cell CRISPR perturbation analysis and individual-level differential expression analysis demonstrate the utility of the proposed methods and offer insights into the usage of different estimands for causal inference in genomics.</description>
