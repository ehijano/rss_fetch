      <title>Finite volume convergence analysis and error estimation for non-linear collisional induced breakage equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article focuses on the finite volume method (FVM) as an instrument tool to deal with the non-linear collisional-induced breakage equation (CBE) that arises in the particulate process. Notably, we consider the non-conservative approximation of the CBE. The analysis of weak convergence of the approximated solutions under a feasible stability condition on the time step is investigated for locally bounded breakage and collision kernels. Subsequently, explicit error estimation of the FVM solutions in uniform mesh having the kernels in the class of $W_{loc}^{1,\infty}$ space. It is also shown numerically for the first-order convergent scheme by taking numerical examples.</description>

      <title>A posteriori error estimates for the wave equation with mesh change in the leapfrog method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a fully computable a posteriori error estimator for a Galerkin finite element solution of the wave equation with explicit leapfrog time-stepping. Our discrete formulation accomodates both time evolving meshes and leapfrog based local time-stepping (Diaz &amp; Grote 2009), which overcomes the stringent stability restriction on the time-step due to local mesh refinement. Thus we incorporate adaptivity into fully explicit time integration with adaptive mesh change while retaining efficiency.
  The error analysis relies on elliptic reconstructors and abstract grid transfer operators, which allows for use-defined elliptic error estimators.
  Numerical results using the elliptic Babu\v{s}ka--Rheinboldt estimators illustrate the optimal rate of convergence with mesh size of the a posteriori error estimator.</description>

      <title>In search of rogue waves: a novel proposal distribution for parallelized rejection sampling of the truncated KdV Gibbs measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gibbs ensemble of the truncated KdV (TKdV) equation has been shown to accurately describe the anomalous wave statistics observed in laboratory experiments, in particular the emergence of extreme events. Here, we introduce a novel proposal distribution that facilitates efficient rejection sampling of the TKdV Gibbs measure. Within parameter regimes accessible to laboratory experiments and capable of producing extreme events, the proposal distribution generates 1--6 orders of magnitude more accepted samples than does a naive, uniform distribution. When equipped with the new proposal distribution, a simple rejection algorithm enjoys key advantages over a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, include better parallelization properties and generation of uncorrelated samples.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks with good lattice points set for solve low regularity PDEs and high dimensional PDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When dealing with a large number of points was required, the traditional uniform sampling approach for approximating integrals using the Monte Carlo method becomes inefficient. In this work, we leverage the good lattice point sets from number-theoretic methods for sampling purposes and develop a deep learning framework that integrates the good lattice point sets with Physics-Informed Neural Networks. This framework is designed to address low-regularity and high-dimensional problems. Furthermore, rigorous mathematical proofs are provided for our algorithm, demonstrating its validity. Lastly, in the experimental section, we employ numerical experiments involving the Poisson equation with low regularity, the two-dimensional inverse Helmholtz equation, and high-dimensional linear and nonlinear problems to illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm from a numerical perspective.</description>

      <title>Solving Diffusion and Wave Equations Meshlessly via Helmholtz Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, using the approximate particular solutions of Helmholtz equations, we solve the boundary value problems of Helmholtz equations by combining the methods of fundamental solutions (MFS) with the methods of particular solutions (MPS). Then the initial boundary value problems of the time dependent diffusion and wave equations are discretized numerically into a sequence of Helmholtz equations with the appropriate boundary value conditions, which is done by either using the Laplace transform or by using time difference methods. Then Helmholtz problems are solved consequently in an iterative manner, which leads to the solutions of diffusion or wave equations. Several numerical examples are presented to show the efficiency of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of dilute polymeric fluids with memory effects in the turbulent flow regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the numerical challenge of solving the Hookean-type time-fractional Navier--Stokes--Fokker--Planck equation, a history-dependent system of PDEs defined on the Cartesian product of two $d$-dimensional spaces in the turbulent regime. Due to its high dimensionality, the non-locality with respect to time, and the resolution required to resolve turbulent flow, this problem is highly demanding. To overcome these challenges, we employ the Hermite spectral method for the configuration space of the Fokker--Planck equation, reducing the problem to a purely macroscopic model. Considering scenarios for available analytical solutions, we prove the existence of an optimal choice of the Hermite scaling parameter. With this choice, the macroscopic system is equivalent to solving the coupled micro-macro system. We apply second-order time integration and extrapolation of the coupling terms, achieving, for the first time, convergence rates for the fully coupled time-fractional system independent of the order of the time-fractional derivative. Our efficient implementation of the numerical scheme allows turbulent simulations of dilute polymeric fluids with memory effects in two and three dimensions. Numerical simulations show that memory effects weaken the drag-reducing effect of added polymer molecules in the turbulent flow regime.</description>

      <title>A weighted scalar auxiliary variable method for solving gradient flows: bridging the nonlinear energy-based and Lagrange multiplier approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two primary scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approaches are widely applied for simulating gradient flow systems, i.e., the nonlinear energy-based approach and the Lagrange multiplier approach. The former guarantees unconditional energy stability through a modified energy formulation, whereas the latter preserves original energy stability but requires small time steps for numerical solutions. In this paper, we introduce a novel weighted SAV method which integrates these two approaches for the first time. Our method leverages the advantages of both approaches: (i) it ensures the existence of numerical solutions for any time step size with a sufficiently large weight coefficient; (ii) by using a weight coefficient smaller than one, it achieves a discrete energy closer to the original, potentially ensuring stability under mild conditions; and (iii) it maintains consistency in computational cost by utilizing the same time/spatial discretization formulas. We present several theorems and numerical experiments to validate the accuracy, energy stability and superiority of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>The Tempered Finite Element Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach -- the Tempered Finite Element Method (TFEM) -- that extends the Finite Element Method (FEM) to classes of meshes that include zero-measure or nearly degenerate elements for which standard FEM approaches do not allow convergence. First, we review why the maximum angle condition [2] is not necessary for FEM convergence and what are the real limitations in terms of meshes. Next, we propose a simple modification of the classical FEM for elliptic problems that provably allows convergence for a wider class of meshes including bands of caps that cause locking of the solution in standard FEM formulations. The proposed method is trivial to implement in an existing FEM code and can be theoretically analyzed. We prove that in the case of exactly zero-measure elements it corresponds to mortaring. We show numerically and theoretically that what we propose is functional and sound. The remainder of the paper is devoted to extensions of the TFEM method to linear elasticity, mortaring of non-conforming meshes, high-order elements, and advection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pole-swapping algorithms, generalizations of bulge-chasing algorithms, have been shown to be a viable alternative to the bulge-chasing QZ algorithm for solving the generalized eigenvalue problem for a matrix pencil A - {\lambda}B. It is natural to try to devise a pole-swapping algorithm that solves the standard eigenvalue problem for a single matrix A. This paper introduces such an algorithm and shows that it is competitive with Francis's bulge-chasing QR algorithm.</description>

      <title>Minimum-distortion continuous cartograms by numerically optimized meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for creating contiguous cartograms using meshes. We use numerical optimization to minimize cartographic error and distortion by transforming the mesh vertices. The vertices can either be optimized in the plane or optimized on the unit sphere and subsequently projected to the plane. We also present a hybrid "best of both worlds" method, where the vertices are optimized on the sphere while anticipating the distortion caused by the final projection to the plane. We show a significant improvement in the preservation of region shapes compared to existing automated methods. Outside the realm of cartograms, we apply this hybrid technique to optimized map projections, creating the Liquid Earth projection.</description>

      <title>Training Hamiltonian neural networks without backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks that synergistically integrate data and physical laws offer great promise in modeling dynamical systems. However, iterative gradient-based optimization of network parameters is often computationally expensive and suffers from slow convergence. In this work, we present a backpropagation-free algorithm to accelerate the training of neural networks for approximating Hamiltonian systems through data-agnostic and data-driven algorithms. We empirically show that data-driven sampling of the network parameters outperforms data-agnostic sampling or the traditional gradient-based iterative optimization of the network parameters when approximating functions with steep gradients or wide input domains. We demonstrate that our approach is more than 100 times faster with CPUs than the traditionally trained Hamiltonian Neural Networks using gradient-based iterative optimization and is more than four orders of magnitude accurate in chaotic examples, including the H\'enon-Heiles system.</description>

      <title>Constraining neutron star properties and dark matter admixture with the NITR-I equation of state: Insights from observations and universal relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent observational study has constrained the maximum mass of neutron stars (NSs), with particular attention to PSR J0952-0607 and the compact star remnant HESS J1731-347, especially in the low-mass regime. Building on our earlier work, which developed the NITR energy density functional (EDF) to reproduce the mass limit of PSR J0952-0607 but did not satisfy other observational constraints, this study introduces a refined EDF named ``NITR-I". NITR-I successfully reconciles the PSR J0952-0607 mass limit with observational data, including radius measurements from NICER+XMM and tidal deformability constraints from GW170817, demonstrating its robustness. The low-mass constraint associated with HESS J1731-347 indicates diverse NS compositions. Since NITR-I alone cannot satisfy this constraint, we explore the role of dark matter (DM) within NSs to bridge the gap. Incorporating DM, particularly at specific Fermi momentum values, enables the model to address this constraint. We further analyze the influence of DM on various NS properties, such as tidal deformability and non-radial $f$-mode oscillations, across multiple relativistic mean-field models. The presence of DM suggests a reduction in tidal deformability and shifts in oscillation frequencies, potentially offering detectable signatures in gravitational wave observations from neutron star mergers. Additionally, we investigate universal relations (URs) for DM-admixed NSs, focusing on correlations such as compactness versus tidal deformability and $f$-mode frequency versus tidal deformability. Canonical values for these properties are estimated using GW170817 data, offering further insights into the structure and composition of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Splitting scheme for gyro-kinetic equations with Semi-Lagrangian and Arakawa substeps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gyro-kinetic model is an approximation of the Vlasov-Maxwell system in a strongly magnetized magnetic field. We propose a new algorithm for solving it combining the Semi-Lagrangian (SL) method and the Arakawa (AKW) scheme with a time-integrator. Both methods are successfully used in practice for different kinds of applications, in our case, we combine them by first decomposing the problem into a fast (parallel) and a slow (perpendicular) dynamical system. The SL approach and the AKW scheme will be used to solve respectively the fast and the slow subsystems. Compared to the scheme in [1], where the entire model is solved using only the SL method, our goal is to replace the method used in the slow subsystem by the AKW scheme, in order to improve the conservation of the physical constants.</description>

      <title>Product kernels are efficient and flexible tools for high-dimensional scattered data interpolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work concerns the construction and characterization of product kernels for multivariate approximation from a finite set of discrete samples. To this end, we consider composing different component kernels, each acting on a low-dimensional Euclidean space. Due to Aronszajn (1950), the product of positive semi-definite kernel functions is again positive semi-definite, where, moreover, the corresponding native space is a particular instance of a tensor product, referred to as Hilbert tensor product. We first analyze the general problem of multivariate interpolation by product kernels. Then, we further investigate the tensor product structure, in particular for grid-like samples. We use this case to show that the product of positive definite kernel functions is again positive definite. Moreover, we develop an efficient computation scheme for the well-known Newton basis. Supporting numerical examples show the good performance of product kernels, especially for their flexibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03016v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a full discretization of a three-dimensional stochastic Allen-Cahn equation with multiplicative noise. The discretization combines the Euler scheme for temporal approximation and the finite element method for spatial approximation. A pathwise uniform convergence rate is derived, encompassing general spatial \( L^q \)-norms, by using discrete versions of deterministic and stochastic maximal \( L^p \)-regularity estimates. Additionally, the theoretical convergence rate is validated through numerical experiments. The primary contribution of this work is the introduction of a technique to establish the pathwise uniform convergence of finite element-based full discretizations for nonlinear stochastic parabolic equations within the framework of general spatial \( L^q \)-norms.</description>

      <title>A unified concept of the degree of ill-posedness for compact and non-compact linear operator equations in Hilbert spaces under the auspices of the spectral theorem</title>

Abstract: Covering ill-posed problems with compact and non-compact operators regarding the degree of ill-posedness is a never ending story written by many authors in the inverse problems literature. This paper tries to add a new narrative and some new facets with respect to this story under the auspices of the spectral theorem. The latter states that any self-adjoint and bounded operator is unitarily equivalent to a multiplication operator on some (semi-finite) measure space. We will exploit this fact and derive a distribution function from the corresponding multiplier, the growth behavior of which at zero allows us to characterize the degree of ill-posedness. We prove that this new concept coincides with the well-known one for compact operators (by means of their singular values), and illustrate the implications along examples including the Hausdorff moment operator and convolutions.</description>

      <title>High-performance computing for the BGK model of the Boltzmann equation with a meshfree Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present high-performance computing for the BGK model of the Boltzmann equation with a mesh-free method. For the numerical simulation of the BGK equation we use an Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method developed in previous work, where the approximation of spatial derivatives and the reconstruction of a function is based on the weighted least squares method. A Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is used to accelerate the code. The result is compared with sequential and parallel versions of the CPU code. Two and three-dimensional driven cavity problems are solved, where a speed-up of several orders of magnitude is obtained compared to a sequential CPU simulation.</description>

      <title>Single-Frequency Self-Alignment RF Resonant Beam for Information and Power Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to power attenuation, improving transmission efficiency in the radio-frequency (RF) band remains a significant challenge, which hinders advancements in various fields of the Internet of Things (IoT), such as wireless power transfer (WPT) and wireless communication. Array design and retro-directive beamforming (RD-BF) techniques offer simple and effective ways to enhance transmission efficiency. However, when the target is an array or in the near field, the RD-BF system (RD-BFS) cannot radiate more energy to the target due to phase irregularities in the target region, resulting in challenges in achieving higher efficiency. To address this issue, we propose the RF-based resonant beam system (RF-RBS), which adaptively optimizes phase and power distribution between transmitting and receiving arrays by leveraging the resonance mechanism to achieve higher transmission efficiency. We analyze the system structure and develop an analytical model to evaluate power flow and resonance establishment. Numerical analysis demonstrates that the proposed RF-RBS achieves self-alignment without beam control and provides higher transmission efficiency compared to RD-BFS, with improvements of up to 16%. This self-alignment capability allows the system to effectively transfer power and information across varying distances and offsets. The numerical results indicate the capability to transmit watt-level power and achieve 21 bps/Hz of downlink spectral efficiency in indoor settings, highlighting the advantages of RF-RBS in information and power transfer for mobile applications.</description>

      <title>Runge-Kutta Discontinuous Galerkin Method Based on Flux Vector Splitting with Constrained Optimization-based TVB(D)-minmod Limiter for Solving Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The flux vector splitting (FVS) method has firstly been incorporated into the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) framework for reconstructing the numerical fluxes required for the spatial semi-discrete formulation, setting it apart from the conventional DG approaches that typically utilize the Lax-Friedrichs flux scheme or classical Riemann solvers. The control equations of hyperbolic conservation systems are initially reformulated into a flux-split form. Subsequently, a variational approach is applied to this flux-split form, from which a DG spatial semi-discrete scheme based on FVS is derived. In order to suppress numerical pseudo-oscillations, the smoothness measurement function IS from the WENO limiter is integrated into the TVB(D)-minmod limiter, constructing an optimization problem based on the smoothness factor constraint, thereby realizing a TVB(D)-minmod limiter applicable to arbitrary high-order polynomial approximation. Subsequently, drawing on the ``reconstructed polynomial and the original high-order scheme's L2 -error constraint'' from the literature [1] , combined with our smoothness factor constraint, a bi-objective optimization problem is formulated to enable the TVB(D)-minmod limiter to balance oscillation suppression and high precision. As for hyperbolic conservation systems, limiters are typically required to be used in conjunction with local characteristic decomposition. To transform polynomials from the physical space to the characteristic space, an interpolation-based characteristic transformation scheme has been proposed, and its equivalence with the original moment characteristic transformation has been demonstrated in one-dimensional scenarios. Finally, the concept of ``flux vector splitting based on Jacobian eigenvalue decomposition'' has been applied to the conservative linear scalar transport equations and the nonlinear Burgers' equation.</description>

      <title>Convergence of a L2 regularized Policy Gradient Algorithm for the Multi Armed Bandit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06388v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although Multi Armed Bandit (MAB) on one hand and the policy gradient approach on the other hand are among the most used frameworks of Reinforcement Learning, the theoretical properties of the policy gradient algorithm used for MAB have not been given enough attention. We investigate in this work the convergence of such a procedure for the situation when a $L2$ regularization term is present jointly with the 'softmax' parametrization. We prove convergence under appropriate technical hypotheses and test numerically the procedure including situations beyond the theoretical setting. The tests show that a time dependent regularized procedure can improve over the canonical approach especially when the initial guess is far from the solution.</description>

      <title>Predicting effective quenching of stable pulses in slow-fast excitable media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14854v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a linear theory for the prediction of excitation wave quenching -- the construction of minimal perturbations which return stable excitations to quiescence -- for localized pulse solutions in models of excitable media. The theory accounts for an additional equivariance compared to the homogeneous ignition problem, and thus requires a reconsideration of heuristics for choosing optimal reference states from their group representation. We compare predictions made with the linear theory to direct numerical simulations across a family of perturbations and assess their accuracy for several models with distinct stable excitation structures. We find that the theory achieves qualitative predictive power with only the effort of continuing a scalar root, and achieves quantitative predictive power in many circumstances. Finally, we compare the computational cost of our prediction technique to other numerical methods for the determination of transitions in extended excitable systems.</description>

      <title>Statistical algorithms for low-frequency diffusion data: A PDE approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of making nonparametric inference in a class of multi-dimensional diffusions in divergence form, from low-frequency data. Statistical analysis in this setting is notoriously challenging due to the intractability of the likelihood and its gradient, and computational methods have thus far largely resorted to expensive simulation-based techniques. In this article, we propose a new computational approach which is motivated by PDE theory and is built around the characterisation of the transition densities as solutions of the associated heat (Fokker-Planck) equation. Employing optimal regularity results from the theory of parabolic PDEs, we prove a novel characterisation for the gradient of the likelihood. Using these developments, for the nonlinear inverse problem of recovering the diffusivity, we then show that the numerical evaluation of the likelihood and its gradient can be reduced to standard elliptic eigenvalue problems, solvable by powerful finite element methods. This enables the efficient implementation of a large class of popular statistical algorithms, including (i) preconditioned Crank-Nicolson and Langevin-type methods for posterior sampling, and (ii) gradient-based descent optimisation schemes to compute maximum likelihood and maximum-a-posteriori estimates. We showcase the effectiveness of these methods via extensive simulation studies in a nonparametric Bayesian model with Gaussian process priors, in which both the proposed optimisation and sampling schemes provide good numerical recovery.

      <title>Zeitlin's model for axisymmetric 3-D Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zeitlin's model is a spatial discretization for the 2-D Euler equations on the flat 2-torus or the 2-sphere. Contrary to other discretizations, it preserves the underlying geometric structure, namely that the Euler equations describe Riemannian geodesics on a Lie group. Here we show how to extend Zeitlin's approach to the axisymmetric Euler equations on the 3-sphere. It is the first discretization of the 3-D Euler equations that fully preserves the geometric structure, albeit restricted to axisymmetric solutions. Thus, this finite-dimensional model admits Riemannian curvature and Jacobi equations, which are discussed.</description>

      <title>Differentially private and decentralized randomized power method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The randomized power method has gained significant interest due to its simplicity and efficient handling of large-scale spectral analysis and recommendation tasks. As modern datasets contain sensitive private information, we need to give formal guarantees on the possible privacy leaks caused by this method. This paper focuses on enhancing privacy preserving variants of the method. We propose a strategy to reduce the variance of the noise introduced to achieve Differential Privacy (DP). We also adapt the method to a decentralized framework with a low computational and communication overhead, while preserving the accuracy. We leverage Secure Aggregation (a form of Multi-Party Computation) to allow the algorithm to perform computations using data distributed among multiple users or devices, without revealing individual data. We show that it is possible to use a noise scale in the decentralized setting that is similar to the one in the centralized setting. We improve upon existing convergence bounds for both the centralized and decentralized versions. The proposed method is especially relevant for decentralized applications such as distributed recommender systems, where privacy concerns are paramount.</description>
