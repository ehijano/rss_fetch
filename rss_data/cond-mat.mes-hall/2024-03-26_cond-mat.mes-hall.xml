      <title>Scaling tunnelling noise in the fractional quantum Hall effect tells about renormalization and breakdown of chiral Luttinger liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect provides a paradigmatic example of a topological phase of matter. FQH edges are theoretically described via models belonging to the class of chiral Luttinger liquid (CLL) theories [1 (Wen, 2007)]. These theories predict exotic properties of the excitations, such as fractional charge and fractional statistics. Despite theoretical confidence in this description and qualitative experimental confirmations, quantitative experimental evidence for CLL behaviour is scarce. In this work, we study tunnelling between edge modes in the quantum Hall regime at the filling factor $\nu=1/3$. We present measurements at different system temperatures and perform a novel scaling analysis of the experimental data, originally proposed in Ref. [2 (Schiller et al., 2022)]. Our analysis shows clear evidence of CLL breakdown - above a certain energy scale. In the low-energy regime, where the scaling behaviour holds, we extract the property called the scaling dimension and find it heavily renormalized compared to na\"ive CLL theory predictions. Our results show that decades-old experiments contain a lot of previously overlooked information that can be used to investigate the physics of quantum Hall edges. In particular, we open a road to quantitative experimental studies of (a) scaling dimension renormalization in quantum point contacts and (b) CLL breakdown mechanisms at an intermediate energy scale, much smaller than the bulk gap.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit proximity in MoS$_2$/bilayer graphene heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures provide a versatile platform for tailoring electronic properties through the integration of two-dimensional materials. Among these combinations, the interaction between bilayer graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) stands out due to its potential for inducing spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in graphene. Future devices concepts require the understanding the precise nature of SOC in TMD/bilayer graphene heterostructures and its influence on electronic transport phenomena. Here, we experimentally confirm the presence of two distinct types of SOC, Ising (1.55 meV) and Rashba (2.5 meV), in bilayer graphene when interfaced with molybdenum disulphide, recognized as one of the most stable TMDs. Furthermore, we reveal a non-monotonic trend in conductivity with respect to the electric displacement field at charge neutrality. This phenomenon is ascribed to the existence of single-particle gaps induced by the Ising SOC, which can be closed by a critical displacement field. Remarkably, our findings also unveil sharp peaks in the magnetoconductivity around the critical displacement field, challenging existing theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Superlattice induced electron percolation within a single Landau level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum Hall effect in a single Landau level in the presence of a square superlattice of $\delta$-function potentials. The interplay between the superlattice spacing $a_s$ and the magnetic length $\ell_B$ in clean system leads to three interesting characteristic regimes corresponding to $a_s \lt \ell_B$, $a_s \gg \ell_B$ and the intermediate one where $a_s \sim \ell_B$ . In the intermediate regime, the continuous magnetic translation symmetry breaks down to discrete lattice symmetry. In contrast, we show that in the other two regimes, the same is hardly broken in the topological band despite the presence of the superlattice. In the presence of weak disorder (white-noise) one typically expects a tiny fraction of extended states due to topological protection of the Landau level. Interestingly, we obtain a large fraction of extended states throughout the intermediate regime which maximizes at the special point $a_s = \sqrt{2\pi} \ell_B$. We argue the superlattice induced percolation phenomenon requires both the breaking of the time reversal symmetry and the continuous magnetic translational symmetry. It could have a direct implication on the integer plateau transitions in both continuous quantum Hall systems and the lattice based anomalous quantum Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Layer-selective spin-orbit coupling and strong correlation in bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and electron-electron interaction can mutually influence each other and give rise to a plethora of intriguing phenomena in condensed matter systems. In pristine bilayer graphene, which has weak SOC, intrinsic Lifshitz transitions and concomitant van-Hove singularities lead to the emergence of many-body correlated phases. Layer-selective SOC can be proximity induced by adding a layer of tungsten diselenide (WSe2) on its one side. By applying an electric displacement field, the system can be tuned across a spectrum wherein electronic correlation, SOC, or a combination of both dominates. Our investigations reveal an intricate phase diagram of proximity-induced SOC-selective bilayer graphene. Not only does this phase diagram include those correlated phases reminiscent of SOC-free doped bilayer graphene, but it also hosts unique SOC-induced states allowing a compelling measurement of valley g-factor and a seemingly impossible correlated insulator at charge neutrality, thereby showcasing the remarkable tunability of the interplay between interaction and SOC in WSe2 enriched bilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Enhanced mobility of ternary InGaAs quantum wells through digital alloying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High In content InGaAs quantum wells (In $\geq$ 75%) are potentially useful for topological quantum computing and spintronics applications. In high mobility InGaAs quantum wells, alloy disorder scattering is a limiting factor. In this report, we demonstrate that by growing the InGaAs quantum wells as a digital alloy, or a short period superlattice, we can reduce the alloy disorder scattering within the quantum well and increase the peak 2 K electron mobility to 545,000 cm^2/V s, which is the highest reported mobility for high In content InGaAs quantum wells to the best of the authors' knowledge. Our results demonstrate that the digital alloy approach can be used to increase the mobility of quantum wells in random alloy ternary materials.</description>

      <title>Magnon-microwave backaction noise evasion in cavity magnomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cavity magnomechanical systems, magnetic excitations couple simultaneously with mechanical vibrations and microwaves, combining the tunability of the magnetization, the long lifetimes of mechanical modes and the whole measurement toolbox of microwave systems. Such hybrid systems have been proposed for applications ranging from thermometry to entanglement generation. However, backaction noise can hinder the measurement of the mechanical vibrations, potentially rendering such applications infeasible. In this paper, we investigate the noise introduced in a mechanical mode of a cavity magnomechanical system in a one-tone drive scheme and propose a scheme for realizing backaction evasion measurements of the mechanical vibrations. Our proposal consists of driving the microwave cavity with two tones separated by twice the phonon frequency and with amplitudes balanced to generate equal numbers of coherent magnons. We demonstrate that different configurations of such a scheme are possible and show that drives centered around the lower frequency magnon-microwave polariton in a triple resonance scheme add the minimum imprecision noise in the measurement, even though such configuration is not the most robust to imperfections.</description>

      <title>Hot electron dynamics in a semiconductor nanowire under intense THz excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report THz-pump / mid-infrared probe near-field studies on Si-doped GaAs-InGaAs core-shell nanowires utilizing THz radiation from the free-electron laser FELBE. Upon THz excitation of free carriers, we observe a red shift of the plasma resonance in both amplitude and phase spectra, which we attribute to the heating up of electrons in the conduction band. The simulation of heated electron distributions anticipates a significant electron population in both L- and X-valleys. The two-temperature model is utilized for a quantitative analysis of the dynamics of the electron gas temperature under THz pumping at various power levels.</description>

      <title>Raman peak shift and broadening in crystalline nanoparticles with lattice impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of point-like lattice impurities on nanoparticle Raman spectra (RS) is studied using both numerical and analytical methods. Particular cases of replacement atoms of various masses, vacancies, and disorder in interatomic bonds are considered. It is shown that the disorder leads not only to the broadening of optical phonon lines but also to the shift of the corresponding Raman peak. The latter can be either positive (i.e., blueshift) or negative (redshift) depending on the type of impurities. Thus there is an additional contribution to the well-known redshift that occurs due to the size-quantization (confinement) effect. Considering nanometer-sized diamond particles as a representative example, we show that the broadening and the shift are, as a rule, of the same order of magnitude. The results are discussed in the framework of the self-consistent T-matrix approach. It is argued that both effects should be considered for accurate treatment of experimental Raman spectra. Simple recipes to do so are formulated for several important cases including NV centers in nanodiamonds.</description>

      <title>Nuclear spin-spin interactions in CdTe probed by zero and ultra-low-field optically detected NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is particularly relevant for studies of internuclear spin coupling at zero and ultra-low fields (ZULF), where spin-spin interactions dominate over Zeeman ones. Here we report on ZULF NMR in CdTe. In this semiconductor all magnetic isotopes have spin $I = 1/2$, so that internuclear interactions are never overshadowed by quadrupole effects. Our experiments rely on warm-up spectroscopy, a technique that combines optical pumping, additional cooling via adiabatic demagnetisation, and detection of the oscillating magnetic field-induced warm-up of the nuclear spin system via Hanle effect. We show that NMR spectra exhibit a rich fine structure, consistent with the low abundance of magnetic isotopes in CdTe, their zero quadrupole moments, as well as direct and indirect interactions between them. A model assuming that the electromagnetic radiation is absorbed by nuclear spin clusters composed of up to 5 magnetic isotopes allows us to reproduce the shape of a major part of the measured spectra.</description>

      <title>A direct demonstration of bulk-boundary correspondence in higher-order topological superconductors with chiral symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A higher-order topological superconductor can experience topological phase transitions driven by variations in a bulk parameter without closing the bulk gap. This presents a challenge in establishing a direct bulk-boundary correspondence, as conventional bulk invariants change only upon the closure of the bulk gap. Our study of two-dimensional higher-order phases in DIII and BDI symmetry classes, both characterized by chiral symmetry, demonstrates that Fermi level crossings facilitate a direct connection between the bulk Hamiltonian and Majorana zero modes at corners. These crossings, emerging as boundary conditions vary, can be identified from the bulk Hamiltonian. For both classes, we introduce a pair of topological invariants derived from these Fermi level crossings to characterize the higher-order topology. Phases in which at least one invariant assumes a nonzero value are anticipated to host Majorana corner modes. Moreover, these invariants may change with the closure of either bulk or edge gaps, thereby providing a clear and direct demonstration of bulk-boundary correspondence in higher-order phases. Our findings offer a promising framework for systematically exploring higher-order topology through boundary condition modulation.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature benchmarking of qubit control wires by primary electron thermometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-frequency qubit control wires require non-trivial thermal anchoring and low-pass filtering. The resulting electron temperature serves as a quality benchmark for these signal lines. In this technical note, we make use of a primary electron thermometry technique, using a Coulomb blockade thermometer, to establish the electron temperature in the millikelvin regime. The experimental four-probe measurement setup, the data analysis, and the measurement limitations are discussed in detail. We verify the results by also using another electron thermometry technique, based on a superconductor-insulator-normal metal junction. Our comparison of signal lines with QDevil's QFilter to unfiltered signal lines demonstrates that the filter significantly reduces both the rms noise and electron temperature, which is measured to be 22 $\pm$ 1 mK.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent quasi-particle $GW$ and hybrid functional calculations for Al/InAs/Al heterojunctions: band offset and spin-orbit coupling effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic structure of surfaces and interfaces plays a key role in the properties of quantum devices. Here, we study the electronic structure of realistic Al/InAs/Al heterojunctions using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) with hybrid functionals and state-of-the-art quasi-particle $GW$ (QS$GW$) calculations. We find a good agreement between QS$GW$ calculations and hybrid functional calculations which themselves compare favourably well with ARPES experiments. Our study confirm the need of well controlled quality of the interfaces to obtain the needed properties of InAs/Al heterojunctions. A detailed analysis of the effects of spin-orbit coupling on the spin-splitting of the electronic states show a linear scaling in $k$-space, related to the two-dimensional nature of some interface states. The good agreement by QS$GW$ and hybrid functional calculations open the door towards trust-able use of an effective approximation to QS$GW$ for studying very large heterojunctions.</description>

      <title>Negative electronic compressibility in charge islands in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the observation of negative electronic compressibility in twisted bilayer graphene for Fermi energies close to insulating states. To observe this negative compressibility, we take advantage of naturally occurring twist angle domains that emerge during the fabrication of the samples, leading to the formation of charge islands. We accurately measure their capacitance using Coulomb oscillations, from which we infer the compressibility of the electron gas. Notably, we not only observe the negative electronic compressibility near correlated insulating states at integer filling, but also prominently near the band insulating state at full filling, located at the edges of both the flat- and remote bands. Furthermore, the individual twist angle domains yield a well-defined carrier density, enabling us to quantify the strength of electronic interactions and verify the theoretical prediction that the inverse negative capacitance contribution is proportional to the average distance between the charge carriers. A detailed analysis of our findings suggests that Wigner crystallization is the most likely explanation for the observed negative electronic compressibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear spintronics, which combines nonlinear dynamics and spintronics, opens a new route for controlling spins and spin dynamics beyond conventional spintronics based on linear responses. Strongly correlated electron systems, which can have large nonlinear responses, are promising candidates for nonlinear spintronics. In this paper, we focus on the nonlinear Edelstein effect (NEE), a generalization of the Edelstein effect, and study the impact of electron correlations on the NEE by performing numerical calculations on a Hubbard model. We find that correlation effects can either enhance or suppress the nonlinear response. We show that the enhancement and suppression of the response are due to the real and imaginary components of the self-energy, respectively. Additionally, we have explored the relationship between the NEE and photomagnetic or optomagnetic effects. Our findings demonstrate that electron correlations can either enhance or suppress the optical spin injection, depending on the light frequency, while always strengthening the inverse Faraday effect.</description>

      <title>Convert laser light into single photons via interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser light possesses perfect coherence, but cannot be attenuated to single photons via linear optics. An elegant route to convert laser light into single photons is based on photon blockade in a cavity with a single atom in the strong coupling regime. However, the single-photon purity achieved by this method remains relatively low. Here we propose an interference-based approach where laser light can be transformed into single photons by destructively interfering with a weak but super-bunched incoherent field emitted from a cavity coupling to a single quantum emitter. We demonstrate this idea by measuring the reflected light of a laser field which drives a double-sided optical microcavity containing a single artificial atom-quantum dot (QD) in the Purcell regime. The reflected light consists of a superposition of the driving field with the cavity output field. We achieve the second-order autocorrelation g2(0)=0.030+-0.002 and the two-photon interference visibility 94.3%+-0.2. By separating the coherent and incoherent fields in the reflected light, we observe that the incoherent field from the cavity exhibits super-bunching with g2(0)=41+-2 while the coherent field remains Poissonian statistics. By controlling the relative amplitude of coherent and incoherent fields, we verify that photon statistics of reflected light is tuneable from perfect anti-bunching to super-bunching in agreement with our predictions. Our results demonstrate photon statistics of light as a quantum interference phenomenon that a single QD can scatter two photons simultaneously at low driving fields in contrast to the common picture that a single two-level quantum emitter can only scatter (or absorb and emit) single photons. This work opens the door to tailoring photon statistics of laser light via cavity or waveguide quantum electrodynamics and interference.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To achieve atomic-level characterization of the diamond (001) surface, persistent efforts have been made over the past few decades. The motivation behind the pursuit extends beyond investigating surface defects and adsorbates; it also involves unraveling the mystery of the smooth growth of diamond. However, the inherently low conductivity and the short C-C bonds render atomic resolution imaging exceptionally challenging. Here, we successfully overcame these challenges by employing non-contact atomic force microscopy with reactive Si tips. Atomic resolution imaging was achieved even at room temperature. With density-functional-theory calculations, we clarified that the critical factors for atomic resolution are in the formation of tilted C-Si bonds between scanning probes and surfaces, along with reordering of the surface C-C dimers. Implications of the findings extend beyond the realm of surface characterization. The present atomic-resolution microscopies drive future advancements in diamond technologies by providing avenues for identifying dopants and constructing artificial nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Theory of tunneling spectroscopy in $p$-wave altermagnet-superconductor hybrid structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the tunneling conductance of a junction consisting of a two-dimensional $p$-wave altermagnet (AM) and a superconductor (SC) for various pairing states. The zero bias conductance peaks arising from the dispersionless surface Andreev bound states (SABSs) in $d_{xy}$-wave and $p_{x}$-wave superconductor junctions are robust against varying the altermagnetic spin-splitting strength $\alpha _{y}$. Moreover, for chiral $p$- or chiral $d$-wave SCs, zero bias conductance shows a non-monotonic behavior as a function of $\alpha_{y}$ indicating the existence of the dispersive SABSs. Our obtained results of tunneling spectroscopy based on a $p$-wave AM serve as an effective way for the identification of the pairing states of unconventional superconductors. It is noted that our used Hamiltonian of AM is also available for persistent spin helix systems.</description>

      <title>Equality of magnetization and edge current for interacting lattice fermions at positive temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the bulk magnetization is equal to the edge current in the thermodynamic limit for a large class of models of lattice fermions with finite-range interactions satisfying local indistinguishability of the Gibbs state, a condition known to hold for sufficiently high temperatures. Our result implies that edge currents in such systems are determined by bulk properties and are therefore stable against large perturbations near the boundaries. Moreover, the equality persists also after taking the derivative with respect to the chemical potential. We show that this form of bulk-edge correspondence is essentially a consequence of homogeneity in the bulk and locality of the Gibbs state. An important intermediate result is a new version of Bloch's theorem for two-dimensional systems, stating that persistent currents vanish in the bulk.</description>

Abstract: Self-oscillations are the result of an efficient mechanism generating periodic motion from a constant power source. In quantum devices, these oscillations may arise due to the interaction between single electron dynamics and mechanical motion. We show that, due to the complexity of this mechanism, these self-oscillations may irrupt, vanish, or exhibit a bistable behaviour causing hysteresis cycles. We observe these hysteresis cycles and characterize the stability of different regimes in both single and double quantum dot configurations. In particular cases, we find these oscillations stable for over 20 seconds, many orders of magnitude above electronic and mechanical characteristic timescales, revealing the robustness of the mechanism at play.</description>

      <title>Probing type-II Ising pairing using the spin-mixing parameter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The immunity of Ising superconductors to external magnetic fields originates from a spin locking of the paired electrons to an intrinsic Zeeman-like field. The spin-momentum locking in non-centrosymmetric crystalline materials leads to type-I Ising pairing in which the direction of the intrinsic field can be deduced from the spin expectation values. Conversely, in centrosymmetric crystals the electron spins locked to the orbitals can form Ising type-II pairs consisting of spin-orbit split doublets. Due to time-reversal symmetry, the doublets are spin degenerate, making it difficult to read the spin polarization of bands and the direction of spin-orbit fields. Here we present an efficient approach to determine the direction of the intrinsic field using the spin-mixing parameter $b^2$. Using first principles calculations based on the density functional theory, we study monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide superconductors PdTe$_2$, NbTe$_2$, and TiSe$_2$ with the 1T structure. We calculate $b^2$ for individual Fermi pockets and provide a general picture of possible Ising type-II pairing within the full Brillouin zone. In order to complement our first principles results, we use group theory to provide a detailed picture of spin-orbit coupling and spin mixing in the relevant bands forming Fermi pockets. We demonstrate that contrary to the anticipated effects of spin-orbit locking, not every spin-orbit split spin doublet actively participates in Ising pairing. Finally, by connecting the spin-mixing parameter $b^2$ with the intrinsic out-of-plane Zeeman field we estimate the upper in-plane critical magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04039v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a time-dependent, surface Hamiltonian for the 3D compound samarium hexaboride based on the slave boson protocol linked version of the periodic Anderson model reported earlier. We show the possible access to the quantum anomalous Hall state due to the normal incidence of circularly polarized light on the surface of the compound in the high frequency limit within the framework of the Floquet theory. The chern number is found to be unity for the right-handed as well as the left-handed circularly polarized light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08556v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear temperature dependence of transport coefficients in metals is habitually ascribed to non-Fermi-liquid physics. Here we establish the T-linear behavior for 2D electron fluids, systems in which carrier collisions assist conduction, leading to resistance decreasing with temperature. This behavior originates from exotic hydrodynamics described by Fermi surface modulations evolving in space and time in an amoeba-like loop manner that features a large family of long-lived excitations manifest as multiple viscous modes. A cascade of these modes results in a linear T dependence that extends down to lowest temperatures, as well as a Kolmogorov-like fractional power -5/3 scaling of conductivity vs. wavenumber. These dependences provide a smoking gun for nonclassical hydrodynamics and are expected to be generic for strongly-correlated 2D systems with simple near-circular Fermi surfaces.</description>

      <title>Modulating dichroism and optical conductivity in bilayer graphene under intense electromagnetic field irradiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the impact of a strong perpendicular laser field on the electronic structure and optical conductivity of bilayer graphene. Employing the Floquet-Bloch theorem and a four-band Hamiltonian model, we calculate the optical conductivity, unveiling modified optical properties due to the altered band structure. We investigate the effects of both circularly and linearly polarized dressing fields on the electronic structure and optical conductivity in the system. Under linear polarization, we observe a notable anisotropy in the band dispersion and optical conductivity, resulting in linear dichroism. In the case of circular polarization, we anticipate the emergence of induced Berry curvature and circular dichroism, especially close to the dynamical gaps. When circularly polarized light is applied alongside a bias potential, the band structure differs for right-handed and left-handed polarization. In this case, the longitudinal optical conductivity remains the same for both, while the transversal optical conductivity exhibits distinct results. Furthermore, the induced Berry curvature and valley asymmetry introduce the potential for generating a valley-polarized current, enabling valley-selective pumping and leading to circular dichroism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigated the coupling between the exciton internal and center-of-mass motions in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides subjected to a periodic electrostatic potential. The coupling leads to the emergence of multiple absorption peaks in the exciton spectrum which are the hybridizations of 1s, 2s and 2p$\pm$ Rydberg states with different center-of-mass momentums. The energies and wave functions of hybrid states can be strongly modulated by varying the profile of the periodic electrostatic potential, which well reproduces the recent experimental observations. Combined with the electron-hole exchange interaction, non-degenerate valley-coherent bright excitons can be realized by applying an in-plane electric field, with the valley coherence determined by the field direction.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement on Fractal Landscapes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the interplay of fractal geometry and quantum entanglement by analyzing the von Neumann entropy (known as entanglement entropy) and the entanglement contour in the scaling limit. Focusing on free-fermion quantum models known for their simplicity and effectiveness in studying highly entangled quantum systems, we uncover intriguing findings. For gapless ground states exhibiting a finite density of states at the chemical potential, we reveal a super-area law characterized by the presence of a logarithmic divergence in the entanglement entropy. This extends the well-established super-area law observed on translationally invariant Euclidean lattices where the Gioev-Klich-Widom conjecture regarding the asymptotic behavior of Toeplitz matrices holds significant influence. Furthermore, we observe the emergence of a self-similar and universal pattern termed an ``entanglement fractal'' in the entanglement contour data as we approach the scaling limit. Remarkably, this pattern bears resemblance to intricate Chinese paper-cutting designs. We provide general rules to artificially generate this fractal, offering insights into the universal scaling of entanglement entropy. Building upon the insights gained from the entanglement fractal, we explicitly elucidate the origin of the logarithmic divergence on fractals where translation symmetry is broken and the Widom conjecture is inapplicable. For gapped ground states, we observe that the entanglement entropy adheres to a generalized area law, with its dependence on the Hausdorff dimension of the boundary between complementary subsystems.</description>

      <title>Validation Workflow for Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials for Complex Ceramics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The number of published Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) has increased significantly in recent years. These new data-driven potential energy approximations often lack the physics-based foundations that inform many traditionally-developed interatomic potentials and hence require robust validation methods for their applicability, accuracy, computational efficiency, and transferability to the intended applications. This work presents a sequential, three-stage workflow for MLIP validation: (i) preliminary validation, (ii) static property prediction, and (iii) dynamic property prediction. This material-agnostic procedure is demonstrated in a tutorial approach for the development of a robust MLIP for boron carbide (B4C), a widely employed, structurally complex ceramic that undergoes a deleterious deformation mechanism called "amorphization" under high-pressure loading. It is shown that the resulting B4C MLIP offers a more accurate prediction of properties compared to the available empirical potential.</description>

      <title>Minimal Fractional Topological Insulator in half-filled conjugate moir\'{e} Chern bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a "minimal" fractional topological insulator (mFTI), motivated by the recent experimental report on the signatures of FTI at total filling factor $\nu_{\rm tot} = 3$ in a transition metal dichalcogenide moir\'{e} system. The observed FTI at $\nu_{\rm tot} = 3$ is likely given by a topological state living in a pair of half-filled conjugate Chern bands with Chern numbers $C=\pm 1$ on top of another pair of fully-filled conjugate Chern bands. We propose the mFTI as a strong candidate topological state in the half-filled conjugate Chern bands. The mFTI is characterized by the following features: (1) It is a fully gapped topological order (TO) with 16 Abelian anyons if the electron is considered trivial (32 including electrons); (2) the minimally-charged anyon carries electric charge $e^\ast = e/2$, together with the fractional quantum spin-Hall conductivity, implying the robustness of the mFTI's gapless edge state whenever time-reversal symmetry and charge conversation are present; (3) the mFTI is "minimal" in the sense that it has the smallest total quantum dimension (a metric for the TO's complexity) within all the TOs that can potentially be realized at the same electron filling and with the same Hall transports; the mFTI is also the unique one that respects time-reversal symmetry. (4) the mFTI is the common descendant of multiple valley-decoupled "product TOs" with larger quantum dimensions. It can also be viewed as the result of gauging multiple symmetry-protected topological states. Similar mFTIs can be constructed for a pair of $1/q$-filled conjugate Chern bands. We classify the mFTIs via the stability of the gapless interfaces between them.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal dynamics and non-Hermitian skin effect of repulsively bound pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a Bose-Hubbard model coupled to an engineered environment which in the non-interacting limit is described by the celebrated Hatano-Nelson model. At strong interactions, two bosons occupying the same site form a so-called repulsively bound pair, or doublon. Using tensor-network simulations, we clearly identify a distinct doublon lightcone and show that the doublon inherits non-reciprocity from that of single particles. Applying the idea of reservoir engineering at the level of doublons, we introduce a new set of dissipators and we analytically show that then the doublon dynamics are governed by the Hatano-Nelson model. This brings about an interaction-induced non-Hermitian skin effect and non-reciprocal doublon motion. Combining features of the two models we study, we show that single particles and doublons can be made to spread with opposite directionality, opening intriguing possibilities for the study of dynamics in interacting non-reciprocal models.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Scientific Discovery with Generative Knowledge Extraction, Graph-Based Representation, and Multimodal Intelligent Graph Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), we have transformed a dataset comprising 1,000 scientific papers into an ontological knowledge graph. Through an in-depth structural analysis, we have calculated node degrees, identified communities and connectivities, and evaluated clustering coefficients and betweenness centrality of pivotal nodes, uncovering fascinating knowledge architectures. The graph has an inherently scale-free nature, is highly connected, and can be used for graph reasoning by taking advantage of transitive and isomorphic properties that reveal unprecedented interdisciplinary relationships that can be used to answer queries, identify gaps in knowledge, propose never-before-seen material designs, and predict material behaviors. We compute deep node embeddings for combinatorial node similarity ranking for use in a path sampling strategy links dissimilar concepts that have previously not been related. One comparison revealed structural parallels between biological materials and Beethoven's 9th Symphony, highlighting shared patterns of complexity through isomorphic mapping. In another example, the algorithm proposed a hierarchical mycelium-based composite based on integrating path sampling with principles extracted from Kandinsky's 'Composition VII' painting. The resulting material integrates an innovative set of concepts that include a balance of chaos/order, adjustable porosity, mechanical strength, and complex patterned chemical functionalization. We uncover other isomorphisms across science, technology and art, revealing a nuanced ontology of immanence that reveal a context-dependent heterarchical interplay of constituents. Graph-based generative AI achieves a far higher degree of novelty, explorative capacity, and technical detail, than conventional approaches and establishes a widely useful framework for innovation by revealing hidden connections.</description>
