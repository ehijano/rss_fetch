      <title>Guiding center Lagrangian and quasisymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A charged particle in a suitably strong magnetic field spirals along the field lines while slowly drifting transversely. This note provides a brief derivation of an effective Lagrangian formulation for the guiding center approximation that captures this dynamics without resolving the gyro motion. It also explains how the effective Lagrangian may, for special magnetic fields, admit a ``quasisymmetry'' which can give rise to a conserved quantity helpful for plasma confinement in fields lacking a geometric isometry. The aim of this note is to offer a pedagogical introduction and some perspectives on this well established subject.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of the latest caldera-forming eruption of Okmok volcano, Alaska</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 2050 14C yBP caldera-forming eruption of Okmok volcano, Alaska, had a global atmospheric impact. The associated global climate cooling was driven by the amount of sulfur injected into the stratosphere during the climactic phase of the eruption. This phase was dominated by pyroclastic density currents, which have complex emplacement dynamics precluding direct estimates of the sulfur stratospheric load. We simulated the dynamics of the climactic phase with the two-phase flow model MFIX-TFM under axisymmetric conditions with several combinations of mass eruption rate, jet water content, vent size, particle size and density, topography, and emission duration. Results suggest that a steady mass eruption rate of 1.2-3.9e11 kg/s is consistent with field observations. Minimal stratospheric injections occur during emission as most of the volcanic gas is injected into the stratosphere by the buoyant liftoff of dilute parts of the currents at the end of the eruption. Overall, 58-64 wt percent of the total amount of gas emitted reaches the stratosphere. Combined with petrological estimates of the degassed S, our results suggest that the eruption injected 11 to 20 Tg S into the stratosphere, consistent with the subsequent climate response and Greenland ice sheet deposition. Our results also show that the combination of the source Richardson number and the mass eruption rate is able to characterize the buoyant-collapse transition at Okmok. We extended this result to 141 runs from 10 published numerical studies of eruptive jets and found that this regime diagram is able to capture the first-order layout of the buoyant-collapse transition in all studies except one. An existing multivariate criterion yields the best predictions of this regime transition.</description>

      <title>Interacting internal waves explain global patterns of interior ocean mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Across the stable density stratification of the abyssal ocean, deep dense water is slowly propelled upward by sustained, though irregular, turbulent mixing. The resulting mean upwelling determines large-scale oceanic circulation properties like heat and carbon transport. In the ocean interior, this turbulent mixing is caused mainly by breaking internal waves: generated predominantly by winds and tides, these waves interact nonlinearly, transferring energy downscale, and finally become unstable, break and mix the water column. This paradigm, long parameterized heuristically, still lacks full theoretical explanation. Here, we close this gap using wave-wave interaction theory with input from both localized and global observations. We find near-ubiquitous agreement between first-principle predictions and observed mixing patterns in the global ocean interior. Our findings lay the foundations for a wave-driven mixing parameterization for ocean general circulation models that is entirely physics-based, which is key to reliably represent future climate states that could differ substantially from today's.</description>

      <title>DINOv2 Rocks Geological Image Analysis: Classification, Segmentation, and Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the interpretability, classification, and segmentation of CT-scan images of rock samples, with a particular focus on the application of DINOv2 within Geosciences. We compared various segmentation techniques to evaluate their efficacy, efficiency, and adaptability in geological image analysis. The methods assessed include the Otsu thresholding method, clustering techniques (K-means and fuzzy C-means), a supervised machine learning approach (Random Forest), and deep learning methods (UNet and DINOv2). We tested these methods using ten binary sandstone datasets and three multi-class calcite datasets. To begin, we provide a thorough interpretability analysis of DINOv2's features in the geoscientific context, discussing its suitability and inherent ability to process CT-scanned rock data. In terms of classification, the out-of-the-box DINOv2 demonstrates an impressive capability to perfectly classify rock images, even when the CT scans are out of its original training set. Regarding segmentation, thresholding and unsupervised methods, while fast, perform poorly despite image preprocessing, whereas supervised methods show better results. We underscore the computational demands of deep learning but highlight its minimal intervention, superior generalization, and performance without additional image preprocessing. Additionally, we observe a lack of correlation between a network's depth or the number of parameters and its performance. Our results show that a LoRA fine-tuned DINOv2 excels in out-of-distribution segmentation and significantly outperforms other methods in multi-class segmentation. By systematically comparing these methods, we identify the most efficient strategy for meticulous and laborious segmentation tasks. DINOv2 proves advantageous, achieving segmentations that could be described as "better than ground-truth" against relatively small training sets.</description>
