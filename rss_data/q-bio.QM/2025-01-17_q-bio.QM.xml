      <title>Interpretable Droplet Digital PCR Assay for Trustworthy Molecular Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate molecular quantification is essential for advancing research and diagnostics in fields such as infectious diseases, cancer biology, and genetic disorders. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) has emerged as a gold standard for achieving absolute quantification. While computational ddPCR technologies have advanced significantly, achieving automatic interpretation and consistent adaptability across diverse operational environments remains a challenge. To address these limitations, we introduce the intelligent interpretable droplet digital PCR (I2ddPCR) assay, a comprehensive framework integrating front-end predictive models (for droplet segmentation and classification) with GPT-4o multimodal large language model (MLLM, for context-aware explanations and recommendations) to automate and enhance ddPCR image analysis. This approach surpasses the state-of-the-art models, affording 99.05% accuracy in processing complex ddPCR images containing over 300 droplets per image with varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). By combining specialized neural networks and large language models, the I2ddPCR assay offers a robust and adaptable solution for absolute molecular quantification, achieving a sensitivity capable of detecting low-abundance targets as low as 90.32 copies/{\mu}L. Furthermore, it improves model's transparency through detailed explanation and troubleshooting guidance, empowering users to make informed decisions. This innovative framework has the potential to benefit molecular diagnostics, disease research, and clinical applications, especially in resource-constrained settings.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model is Secretly a Protein Sequence Optimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the protein sequence engineering problem, which aims to find protein sequences with high fitness levels, starting from a given wild-type sequence. Directed evolution has been a dominating paradigm in this field which has an iterative process to generate variants and select via experimental feedback. We demonstrate large language models (LLMs), despite being trained on massive texts, are secretly protein sequence optimizers. With a directed evolutionary method, LLM can perform protein engineering through Pareto and experiment-budget constrained optimization, demonstrating success on both synthetic and experimental fitness landscapes.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed deep learning for infectious disease forecasting</title>

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of contagious illnesses has become increasingly important to public health policymaking, and better prediction could prevent the loss of millions of lives. To better prepare for future pandemics, it is essential to improve forecasting methods and capabilities. In this work, we propose a new infectious disease forecasting model based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), an emerging area of scientific machine learning. The proposed PINN model incorporates dynamical systems representations of disease transmission into the loss function, thereby assimilating epidemiological theory and data using neural networks (NNs). Our approach is designed to prevent model overfitting, which often occurs when training deep learning models with observation data alone. In addition, we employ an additional sub-network to account for mobility, vaccination, and other covariates that influence the transmission rate, a key parameter in the compartment model. To demonstrate the capability of the proposed model, we examine the performance of the model using state-level COVID-19 data in California. Our simulation results show that predictions of PINN model on the number of cases, deaths, and hospitalizations are consistent with existing benchmarks. In particular, the PINN model outperforms the basic NN model and naive baseline forecast. We also show that the performance of the PINN model is comparable to a sophisticated Gaussian infection state space with time dependence (GISST) forecasting model that integrates the compartment model with a data observation model and a regression model for inferring parameters in the compartment model. Nonetheless, the PINN model offers a simpler structure and is easier to implement. Our results show that the proposed forecaster could potentially serve as a new computational tool to enhance the current capacity of infectious disease forecasting.</description>

      <title>Reward-Guided Controlled Generation for Inference-Time Alignment in Diffusion Models: Tutorial and Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This tutorial provides an in-depth guide on inference-time guidance and alignment methods for optimizing downstream reward functions in diffusion models. While diffusion models are renowned for their generative modeling capabilities, practical applications in fields such as biology often require sample generation that maximizes specific metrics (e.g., stability, affinity in proteins, closeness to target structures). In these scenarios, diffusion models can be adapted not only to generate realistic samples but also to explicitly maximize desired measures at inference time without fine-tuning. This tutorial explores the foundational aspects of such inference-time algorithms. We review these methods from a unified perspective, demonstrating that current techniques -- such as Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)-based guidance, value-based sampling, and classifier guidance -- aim to approximate soft optimal denoising processes (a.k.a. policies in RL) that combine pre-trained denoising processes with value functions serving as look-ahead functions that predict from intermediate states to terminal rewards. Within this framework, we present several novel algorithms not yet covered in the literature. Furthermore, we discuss (1) fine-tuning methods combined with inference-time techniques, (2) inference-time algorithms based on search algorithms such as Monte Carlo tree search, which have received limited attention in current research, and (3) connections between inference-time algorithms in language models and diffusion models.

      <title>Drug Resistance Predictions Based on a Directed Flag Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The continuous evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus poses a significant challenge to global public health. Of particular concern is the potential resistance to the widely prescribed drug PAXLOVID, of which the main ingredient nirmatrelvir inhibits the viral main protease (Mpro). Here, we developed CAPTURE (direCted flAg laPlacian Transformer for drUg Resistance prEdictions) to analyze the effects of Mpro mutations on nirmatrelvir-Mpro binding affinities and identify potential drug-resistant mutations. CAPTURE combines a comprehensive mutation analysis with a resistance prediction module based on DFFormer-seq, which is a novel ensemble model that leverages a new Directed Flag Transformer and sequence embeddings from the protein and small-molecule-large-language models. Our analysis of the evolution of Mpro mutations revealed a progressive increase in mutation frequencies for residues near the binding site between May and December 2022, suggesting that the widespread use of PAXLOVID created a selective pressure that accelerated the evolution of drug-resistant variants. Applied to mutations at the nirmatrelvir-Mpro binding site, CAPTURE identified several potential resistance mutations, including H172Y and F140L, which have been experimentally confirmed, as well as five other mutations that await experimental verification. CAPTURE evaluation in a limited experimental data set on Mpro mutants gives a recall of 57\% and a precision of 71\% for predicting potential drug-resistant mutations. Our work establishes a powerful new framework for predicting drug-resistant mutations and real-time viral surveillance. The insights also guide the rational design of more resilient next-generation therapeutics.</description>

      <title>Exact phylodynamic likelihood via structured Markov genealogy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider genealogies arising from a Markov population process in which individuals are categorized into a discrete collection of compartments, with the requirement that individuals within the same compartment are statistically exchangeable. When equipped with a sampling process, each such population process induces a time-evolving tree-valued process defined as the genealogy of all sampled individuals. We provide a construction of this genealogy process and derive exact expressions for the likelihood of an observed genealogy in terms of filter equations. These filter equations can be numerically solved using standard Monte Carlo integration methods. Thus, we obtain statistically efficient likelihood-based inference for essentially arbitrary compartment models based on an observed genealogy of individuals sampled from the population.</description>

      <title>FlowDock: Geometric Flow Matching for Generative Protein-Ligand Docking and Affinity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Powerful generative AI models of protein-ligand structure have recently been proposed, but few of these methods support both flexible protein-ligand docking and affinity estimation. Of those that do, none can directly model multiple binding ligands concurrently or have been rigorously benchmarked on pharmacologically relevant drug targets, hindering their widespread adoption in drug discovery efforts. In this work, we propose FlowDock, the first deep geometric generative model based on conditional flow matching that learns to directly map unbound (apo) structures to their bound (holo) counterparts for an arbitrary number of binding ligands. Furthermore, FlowDock provides predicted structural confidence scores and binding affinity values with each of its generated protein-ligand complex structures, enabling fast virtual screening of new (multi-ligand) drug targets. For the well-known PoseBusters Benchmark dataset, FlowDock outperforms single-sequence AlphaFold 3 with a 51% blind docking success rate using unbound (apo) protein input structures and without any information derived from multiple sequence alignments, and for the challenging new DockGen-E dataset, FlowDock outperforms single-sequence AlphaFold 3 and matches single-sequence Chai-1 for binding pocket generalization. Additionally, in the ligand category of the 16th community-wide Critical Assessment of Techniques for Structure Prediction (CASP16), FlowDock ranked among the top-5 methods for pharmacological binding affinity estimation across 140 protein-ligand complexes, demonstrating the efficacy of its learned representations in virtual screening. Source code, data, and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/BioinfoMachineLearning/FlowDock.</description>
