      <title>$K_s$-band photometry of the Extreme T Subdwarf CWISE J221706.28$-$145437.6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present deep $K_s$-band imaging of the extreme T subdwarf CWISE J221706.28$-$145437.6. Using the new photometry, we construct its spectral energy distribution and find this object exhibits exceptionally strong collision-induced absorption in the $H$ and $K$ band. The comparison with the nearest benchmark extreme T subdwarf WISEA J181006.18$-$101000.5 suggests the object would be cooler and more metal-poor than the benchmark.</description>

      <title>VLTI observations of the Orion Belt stars: I. eps Orionis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars play a decisive role in the evolution of the Universe. In order to constrain their current state and structure, we need sufficiently complex models, constrained by astrometric, interferometric, and spectroscopic observations. However, they are not available for distant stars. Instead, we focused on the nearest massive stars in the Orion Belt. We obtained VLTI interferometric observations of Orion Belt stars and calibrated visibility data from the GRAVITY and PIONIER instruments. Additionally, we obtained spectroscopic data from the CFHT and CTIO observatories. For modelling, we used a modified version of PHOEBE2, extended with new interferometric and spectroscopic modules. To describe non-spherical, rotating, or Roche-like stars, integrals over triangular meshes have to be computed, using extensive grids of synthetic spectra. For fitting, we used the simplex algorithm and chi2 mapping of the parameter space. In this paper, we present single-star models of the B0Ia supergiant eps Ori. Interferometric visibilities indicate that the star is not spherical but rotating close to its critical velocity. The preferred distance, d=(384+-8)pc, corresponds to the median of distances for the Orion OB1b association. We obtained the following parameters: m=(28.4+-2.0)Msol, R=(27.6+-1.5)Rsol, Teff=25000 K, i=45deg, longitude of the ascending node, Omega=300deg, and Prot=4.3+1.0d. This compromise model provides a reasonable fit to wind-free Balmer line profiles, but there is still some tension between interferometric and spectroscopic datasets, corresponding to a faster- vs. slower-rotating star. Our fast-rotating model implies that circumstellar matter should be naturally present, in the form of wind or disk, and contribute to continuum radiation. The fast rotation of eps Ori is compatible with a merger, formed from a multiple system of comparable mass, like del, zet or sig Ori.</description>

      <title>Post-AGB Binaries as Interacting Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present recent progress in our understanding of the physical interaction mechanisms at work in evolved binaries of low-to-intermediate initial mass, which are surrounded by a stable disc of gas and dust. These systems are known as post-asymptotic giant-branch (post-AGB) binaries, but recently, it has been shown that some systems are too low in luminosity and should be considered as post-red-giant branch (post-RGB) instead. While the systems are currently well within their Roche lobe, they still show signs of active ongoing interaction between the different building blocks. We end this contribution with some future research plans.</description>

      <title>Frequency separation ratios do not suppress magnetic activity effects in solar-like stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic activity effects are typically neglected in asteroseismic modelling of solar-type stars, presuming that these effects can be accounted for in the parametrisation of the surface effects. It was however demonstrated that magnetic activity can have a significant impact on the asteroseismic characterisation using both forward and inverse techniques. We investigated whether frequency separation ratios, which are commonly used to efficiently suppress surface effects, are also able to suppress magnetic activity effects. Based on GOLF and BiSON observations of the Sun-as-a-star, we performed asteroseismic characterisations using frequency separation ratios as constraints to measure the apparent temporal evolution of the stellar parameters and their correlation with the 10.7 cm radio flux. Frequency separation ratios do not suppress the effects of magnetic activity. Both $r_{01}$ and $r_{02}$ ratios exhibit a clear signature of the magnetic activity cycle. Consequently, when these ratios are employed as constraints in asteroseismic modelling, magnetic activity effects are propagated to the stellar characterisation. Additionally, most stellar parameters correlate with the activity cycle, unlike the direct fitting of individual frequencies. Magnetic activity effects significantly impact asteroseismic characterisation, regardless of whether forward modelling or inverse methods are used. Standard techniques to suppress surface effects have proven ineffective against magnetic activity influences and systematic uncertainties of 4.7%, 2.9%, and 1.0% should be considered for the stellar age, mass, and radius, respectively. In preparation for future space-based photometry missions, it is therefore essential to enhance our theoretical understanding of these effects and develop a modelling procedure capable of accounting for or efficiently suppressing them.</description>

      <title>Insights into Chromospheric Large-Scale Flows using Nobeyama 17 GHz Radio Observations I. The Differential Rotation Profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the differential rotation rate on the solar surface has long been studied using optical and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations, associating these measurements to specific atmospheric heights remains challenging due to the temperature-dependent emission of tracers observed in EUV wavelengths. Radio observations, being primarily influenced by coherent plasma processes and/or thermal bremsstrahlung, offer a more height-stable diagnostic and thus provide an independent means to test and validate rotational trends observed at other EUV wavelengths. We aim to characterize the differential rotation profile of the upper chromosphere using cleaned solar full-disc 17 GHz radio imaging from the Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH), spanning a little over two solar cycles (1992 - 2020). A tracer-independent method based on automated image correlation was employed on daily full-disc 17 GHz radio maps. Our results suggest that the upper chromosphere rotates significantly faster than the photosphere at all latitudes, with a relatively flatter latitudinal profile. A very weak anti-correlation between the equatorial rotation rate and solar activity is also observed. Our findings reaffirm the potential of radio observations to probe the dynamics of the solar chromosphere with reduced height ambiguity. The overlap of the equatorial rotation rate found in this study with that for $304$ {\AA} in the EUV regime lends additional support to the view that the equatorial rotation rates increase with height above the photosphere. Future coordinated studies at wavelengths with better-constrained height formation will be crucial for further understanding the complex dynamics of the solar atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Detecting and characterising the magnetic field of exoplanets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields play a crucial role in planetary evolution and habitability. While the intrinsic magnetic fields of solar system planets are relatively well understood, the magnetic properties of exoplanets remain largely unconstrained, despite their potential ubiquity. Detecting exoplanetary magnetic fields is essential to advancing our understanding of planetary habitability beyond the solar system. This paper focuses on two promising spectropolarimetric techniques for detecting magnetic fields in hot exoplanets: direct detection through polarization signatures in the He I 1083 nm triplet and indirect detection via star-planet magnetic interactions manifesting as stellar hot spots. The direct method is particularly suited to close-in gas giants, leveraging the Hanle and Zeeman effects to detect low-amplitude magnetic fields. The indirect method can apply to both giant and low-mass planets by identifying magnetic connectivity-induced features in the stellar atmosphere. Although the interpretation of current detections remain tentative, upcoming high-resolution spectropolarimetric capabilities in the UV and near-infrared, particularly with future missions like HWO, promise to enable definitive measurements of exoplanetary magnetic fields. These advancements will open new avenues for probing the magnetic environments of exoplanets and their implications for atmospheric retention and habitability.</description>

      <title>Langmuir Wave Excitation in Solar-wind Magnetic Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic holes are structures commonly observed in various space plasma environments throughout the solar system, including the solar wind. These structures are characterized by a localized decrease in magnetic field strength, coincident with an increase in plasma density. Previous observational studies in the solar wind link the presence of Langmuir waves to magnetic holes, suggesting a strong correlation between these phenomena. We develop a model based on magnetic-moment conservation and its violation to explain the excitation of Langmuir waves in magnetic holes. Our model illustrates that magnetic holes induce changes in the electron velocity distribution function that emit electrostatic Langmuir waves due to the bump-on-tail instability. Using data from the Solar Orbiter spacecraft, we provide a comprehensive analysis of this process and test our predictions with observations. The consistency between the model and observations indicates that our proposed process is a viable mechanism for producing Langmuir waves in magnetic holes in the solar wind.</description>

      <title>The 3D Cosmic Shoreline for Nurturing Planetary Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various ``cosmic shorelines" have been proposed to delineate which planets have atmospheres. The fates of individual planet atmospheres may be set by a complex sea of growth and loss processes, driven by unmeasurable environmental factors or unknown historical events. Yet, defining population-level boundaries helps illuminate which processes matter and identify high-priority targets for future atmospheric searches. Here, we provide a statistical framework for inferring the position, shape, and fuzziness of an instellation-based cosmic shoreline, defined in the three-dimensional space of planet escape velocity, planet bolometric flux received, and host star luminosity; explicitly including luminosity partially circumvents the need to estimate host stars' historical X-ray and extreme ultraviolet fluences. Using Solar System and exoplanet atmospheric constraints, under the restrictive assumption that one planar boundary applies across a wide parameter space, we find the critical flux threshold for atmospheres scales with escape velocity with a power-law index of $p=6.08^{+0.69}_{-0.48}$, steeper than the canonical literature slope of $p=4$, and scales with stellar luminosity with a power-law index of $q=1.25^{+0.31}_{-0.22}$, steep enough to disfavor atmospheres on Earth-sized planets out to the habitable zone for stars less luminous than $\log_{10} (L_\star/L_\odot) = -2.22 \pm 0.21$ (roughly spectral type M4.5V). If we relax the assumption that one power law must stretch from the hottest exoplanets to the coolest Solar System worlds, the narrower question of ``Which warm planets have thick CO$_2$ secondary atmospheres?" is still poorly constrained by data but should improve significantly with planned JWST observations.</description>

Abstract: Planets are complicated. Understanding how they work requires connecting individual objects to the context of broader populations. Exoplanets are easier to picture next to their closest Solar System archetypes, and planets in the Solar System are richer when seen alongside a growing community of known exoplanets in the Milky Way. The `exoatlas` toolkit provides a friendly Python interface for retrieving and working with populations of planets, aiming to simplify the process of placing worlds in context.</description>

      <title>Constraining nearby substellar companion architectures using High Contrast Imaging, Radial Velocity and Astrometry data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nearby stars offer prime opportunities for exoplanet discovery and characterization through various detection methods. By combining HCI, RV, and astrometry, it is possible to better constrain the presence of substellar companions, as each method probes different regions of their parameter space. A detailed census of planets around nearby stars is essential to guide the selection of targets for future space missions seeking to identify Earth-like planets and potentially habitable worlds. In addition, the detection and characterisation of giant planets and brown dwarfs is crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of planetary systems. We aim to constrain the possible presence of substellar companions for 7 nearby M-dwarf stars using a combination of new SPHERE/H2 HCI and archival RV and astrometric data. We investigate how combining these techniques improves the detection constraints for giant planets and brown dwarfs compared to using each method individually. For each star and each data set, we compute the mass limits as a function of semi-major axis or projected separation using standard techniques. We then use a Monte Carlo approach to assess the completeness of the companion mass / semi-major axis parameter space probed by the combination of the three methods, as well as by the three methods independently. Our combined approach significantly increases the fraction of detectable companions. Although no new companion was detected, we could place stronger constraints on potential substellar companions. The combination of HCI, RV and astrometry provides significant improvements in the detection of substellar companions over a wider parameter space. Applying this approach to larger samples and lower-mass companions will help constraining the search space for future space missions aimed at finding potentially habitable or even inhabited planets.</description>

      <title>Spherically Symmetric Accretion with Self-Gravity: Analytical Formulae and Numerical Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spherically symmetric accretion incorporating self-gravity constitutes a three-point boundary value problem (TPBVP) governed by constraints at the outer boundary, sonic point, and accretor surface. Previous studies have two limitations: either employing an incorrect formula for self-gravity potential in analytical treatments, or introducing additional input parameters in numerical implementations to circumvent solving the full TPBVP. To address these issues, we present a self-consistent TPBVP formulation, solved using the relaxation method. We also derive approximate analytical formulae that enable rapid estimates of self-gravity effects. Our analysis identifies a dimensionless parameter $\beta \equiv 2G \bar{\rho} r_\mathrm{out}^2/a_\mathrm{out}^2$ that characterizes the strength of self-gravity, where $\bar{\rho}$ and $r_\mathrm{out}$ are the mean density and outer radius of the flow, respectively, and $a_\mathrm{out}$ is the adiabatic sound speed of the external medium. For practical estimation, $\bar{\rho}$ may be approximated by the external medium density $\rho_\mathrm{out}$. We identify an upper limit for $\beta$, beyond which steady accretion becomes unsustainable -- a behavior consistent with classical gravitational instability that previous studies failed to capture. The accretion rate enhancement decreases monotonically as the adiabatic index $\gamma$ increases. For $\gamma=5/3$, self-gravity ceases to augment the accretion rate. These theoretical predictions are validated by our numerical solutions. We further apply our results to two astrophysical scenarios: hyper-Eddington accretion onto supermassive black hole seeds in the early Universe, where self-gravity is significant; and accretion onto stellar-mass objects embedded in active galactic nuclei (AGN) disks, where self-gravity is non-negligible under certain conditions and should be evaluated using $\beta$.</description>

      <title>The ESO SupJup Survey VIII. Chemical fingerprints of young L dwarf twins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The potentially distinct formation pathways of exoplanets and brown dwarfs may be imprinted in their elemental and isotopic ratios. This work is part of the ESO SupJup Survey, which aims to disentangle the formation pathways of super-Jupiters and brown dwarfs through the analysis of their chemical and isotopic ratios. In this study, we characterize the atmospheres of two young L4 dwarfs, 2MASS J03552337+1133437 (2M0355) and 2MASS J14252798-3650229 (2M1425), in the AB Doradus Moving Group. This involved constraining their chemical composition, $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO ratio, pressure-temperature profile, surface gravity, and rotational velocity. We have obtained high-resolution CRIRES+ K-band spectra of these brown dwarfs, which we analyzed with an atmospheric retrieval pipeline. Atmospheric models were generated with the radiative transfer code petitRADTRANS, for which we employed a free and equilibrium chemistry approach, which we coupled with the PyMultiNest sampling algorithm to determine the best fit. We report robust detections of $^{13}$CO (13.4 &amp; 8.0 $\sigma$) and HF (11.6 &amp; 15.8 $\sigma$) in 2M0355 and 2M1425, respectively. The objects have similar overall atmospheric properties, including $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO isotope ratios of $95.5\substack{+6.8 \\ -6.4}$ for 2M0355 and $109.6\substack{+10.6 \\ -9.6}$ for 2M1425. In both brown dwarfs, we find only tentative hints of H$_2^{18}$O (1.1 &amp; 3.0 $\sigma$), with lower limits of H$_2^{16}$O/H$_2^{18}$O $\sim$ 1000. Both objects appear to be close to chemical equilibrium, considering the main spectral contributors. Future studies will put them into the context of other objects observed as part of the ESO SupJup Survey.</description>

      <title>Massive Interacting Binaries Enhance Feedback in Star-Forming Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new framework to incorporate feedback from massive interacting binaries in simulations of star cluster formation. Our new feedback model adds binary stellar evolution to the cluster formation code Torch, and couples it in AMUSE to the pre-existing modules for collisional stellar dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, and mechanical and radiative feedback. Our model accounts for the effects of mass transfer on the stars' mass loss rates, their radiation spectra, and the timing of core-collapse supernovae. It also injects mass lost through non-conservative mass transfer and common envelope ejection into the interstellar medium. We demonstrate the use of our feedback model through simulations of isolated binaries in a gaseous medium, and of embedded clusters of massive binaries. Feedback from interacting binaries efficiently couples with the surrounding interstellar medium. It increases the size of HII regions, increases the kinetic and thermal energy of the gas, and increases the pressure within HII regions compared to models that use single star stellar evolution. Those differences arise from the ionizing radiation, which increases by three orders of magnitude, resulting in HII regions that expand due to thermal pressure rather than radiation pressure. The effects of stellar dynamics and the gravitational potential of the background gas cause the evolution of individual binaries to deviate from the predictions made by secular evolution, impacting the subsequent feedback from the binary. We conclude that massive interacting binaries are an important source of feedback in cluster-forming regions, and must be considered when studying the emerging timescales of young star clusters.</description>

      <title>SPACE-SUIT: An Artificial Intelligence Based Chromospheric Feature Extractor and Classifier for SUIT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope(SUIT) onboard Aditya-L1 is an imager that observes the solar photosphere and chromosphere through observations in the wavelength range of 200-400 nm. A comprehensive understanding of the plasma and thermodynamic properties of chromospheric and photospheric morphological structures requires a large sample statistical study, necessitating the development of automatic feature detection methods. To this end, we develop the feature detection algorithm SPACE-SUIT: Solar Phenomena Analysis and Classification using Enhanced vision techniques for SUIT, to detect and classify the solar chromospheric features to be observed from SUIT's Mg II k filter. Specifically, we target plage regions, sunspots, filaments, and off-limb structures. SPACE uses YOLO, a neural network-based model to identify regions of interest. We train and validate SPACE using mock-SUIT images developed from Interface Region Imaging Spectrometer(IRIS) full-disk mosaic images in Mg II k line, while we also perform detection on Level-1 SUIT data. SPACE achieves an approximate precision of 0.788, recall 0.863 and MAP of 0.874 on the validation mock SUIT FITS dataset. Given the manual labeling of our dataset, we perform "self-validation" by applying statistical measures and Tamura features on the ground truth and predicted bounding boxes. We find the distributions of entropy, contrast, dissimilarity, and energy to show differences in the features. These differences are qualitatively captured by the detected regions predicted by SPACE and validated with the observed SUIT images, even in the absence of labeled ground truth. This work not only develops a chromospheric feature extractor but also demonstrates the effectiveness of statistical metrics and Tamura features for distinguishing chromospheric features, offering independent validation for future detection schemes.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Subsurface Flows in Solar Active Regions During the May 2024 Storm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In May 2024, the Sun exhibited intense magnetic activity, marked by numerous high-intensity flares resulting from the interaction and merging of NOAA ARs 13664 and 13668 in the southern hemisphere and AR 13663 in the northern hemisphere. Notably, AR 13664 displayed an extended lifetime, remaining visible after a full solar rotation and continuing to produce significant flaring activity. In this study, we investigate the evolution of sub-photospheric plasma flows associated with these ARs during their disk passage using ring-diagram analysis of SDO/HMI Dopplergrams. We analyze flow divergence, vorticity, and kinetic helicity across depths from the surface to 25 Mm, revealing pronounced temporal and depth-dependent variations. Our observations indicate that the majority of flares occur on the days when the Normalized Helicity Gradient Variance, a measure of kinetic helicity spread, peaks or on the following day. Furthermore, we examine the relationship between subsurface flow dynamics and surface magnetic properties of these complex active regions to understand the interaction between them.</description>

      <title>A New Determination of the Mass of NGC 3603-A1: the Most Massive Binary Known?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The star NGC 3603-A1 has long been known to be a very massive binary, consisting of a pair of O2-3If*/WN5-6 stars, which show Wolf-Rayet-like emission due to their luminosities being near the Eddington limit. The system has been poorly characterized until now, due to the difficulties of obtaining reliable radial velocities from broad, blended emission lines and the extreme crowding in the cluster. However, previously unpublished archival HST/STIS spectra revealed that some of the upper Balmer lines (seen in absorption) are well separated at favorable orbital phases, prompting us to obtain our own carefully-timed new HST/STIS spectra, which we have analyzed along with the older data. Radial velocities measured from these spectra allow us to obtain an orbit for this 3.77298 day system. We also used archival STIS imaging of the cluster to obtain a more accurate light curve for this eclipsing system, which we then modeled, yielding the orbital inclination and providing values for the stellar radii and temperatures. Together, these data show that the NGC 3603-A1 system consists of a 93.3+/-11.0 Mo O3If*/WN6 primary with an effective temperature of 37,000 K, and a 70.4+/-9.3 Mo O3If*/WN5 secondary that is slightly hotter, 42,000 K. Although a more massive binary is known in the LMC, NGC 3603-A1 is as massive as any binary known in our own Galaxy for which a direct measurement of its mass has been made. The secondary has been spun up by mass accretion from the primary, and we discuss the evolutionary status of this intriguing system.</description>

      <title>A kinematically constrained kick distribution for isolated neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnitudes of the velocity kicks that neutron stars (NSs) obtain at their formation have long been a topic of discussion. In previous work, a novel method was proposed to determine kicks based on the eccentricity of Galactic trajectories. We applied this method to the isolated pulsars with known parallax in order to kinematically constrain the NS natal kick distribution. We assumed the velocity vectors of the pulsars to be distributed isotropically in the local standard of rest frame, and for each pulsar we sampled 100 velocities taking into account this assumption. These velocity vectors were used to trace back the trajectories of the NSs through the Galaxy and estimate their eccentricity. Then, we simulated kicked objects in order to evaluate the relationship between kick magnitude and Galactic eccentricity, which was used to infer the kicks corresponding to the estimated eccentricities. The resulting kick distributions indeed show a bimodal structure for young pulsars and our fits resemble the ones from literature well. However, for older pulsars the bimodality vanishes and instead we find a log-normal kick distribution peaking at ~200 km/s and a median of ~400 km/s. We also compare our methods to literature that suggests natal kicks are significantly higher and follow a Maxwellian with $\sigma=265$ km/s. We cannot reproduce these results using their sample and distance estimates, and instead find kicks that are consistent with our proposed distribution. We conclude that our kinematically constrained kick distribution is well-described by a log-normal distribution with $\mu=6.38$ and $\sigma=1.01$, normalised between 0 and 1000 km/s. This analysis reveals no evidence for bimodality in the larger sample, and we suggest that the bimodality found by existing literature may be caused by their relatively small sample size.</description>
