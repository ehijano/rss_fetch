      <title>On a generalisation of Cameron's base size conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08705v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G\leqslant {\rm Sym}(\Omega)$ be a finite transitive permutation group with point stabiliser $H$. A base for $G$ is a subset of $\Omega$ whose pointwise stabiliser is trivial, and the minimal cardinality of a base is called the base size of $G$, denoted by $b(G, \Omega)$. Equivalently, $b(G, \Omega)$ is the minimal positive integer $k$ such that $G$ has a regular orbit on the Cartesian product $\Omega^k$. A well-known conjecture of Cameron from the 1990s asserts that if $G$ is an almost simple primitive group and $H$ is a so-called non-standard subgroup, then $b(G, \Omega) \leqslant 7$, with equality if and only if $G$ is the Mathieu group ${\rm M}_{24}$ in its natural action of degree $24$. This conjecture was settled in a series of papers by Burness et al. (2007-11).
  In this paper, we complete the proof of a natural generalisation of Cameron's conjecture. Our main result states that if $G$ is an almost simple group and $H_1, \ldots, H_k$ are any core-free non-standard maximal subgroups of $G$ with $k \geqslant 7$, then $G$ has a regular orbit on $G/H_1 \times \cdots \times G/H_k$, noting that Cameron's original conjecture corresponds to the special case where the $H_i$ are pairwise conjugate subgroups. In addition, we show that the same conclusion holds with $k \geqslant 6$, unless $G = {\rm M}_{24}$ and each $H_i$ is isomorphic to ${\rm M}_{23}$. For example, this means that if $G$ is a simple exceptional group of Lie type and $H_1, \ldots, H_6$ are proper subgroups of $G$, then there exist elements $g_i \in G$ such that $\bigcap_i H_i^{g_i} = 1$. By applying recent work in a joint paper with Burness, we may assume $G$ is a group of Lie type and our proof uses probabilistic methods based on fixed point ratio estimates.</description>

      <title>Alexander-Markov correspondence for doodles on closed surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce twisted virtual doodles, defined as stable equivalence classes of immersed circles on closed surfaces that may be non-orientable. These objects admit planar representative diagrams, considered up to a suitable set of Reidemeister-type moves. To develop the associated braid-theoretic framework, we define twisted virtual twin groups as natural extensions of virtual twin groups, and establish Alexander- and Markov-type theorems in this set-up. This shows that twisted virtual doodles unify and extend both classical and virtual doodle theories. We further investigate the structure of the pure twisted virtual twin group, providing a presentation and deriving several structural and combinatorial properties. In particular, we obtain two interesting decompositions of the twisted virtual twin group and its pure subgroup, from which it follows that both groups have trivial center and are residually finite as well as Hopfian.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the largest commutative (full and partial) transformation semigroups of certain types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a finite set. Let $\mathcal{T}(X)$ be the transformation semigroup on $X$ and let $\mathcal{P}(X)$ be the partial transformation semigroup on $X$. This paper is a contribution to the problem of characterizing the largest commutative subsemigroups of $\mathcal{T}(X)$ (respectively, $\mathcal{P}(X)$). In the process of looking for these semigroups, we also characterize the largest commutative subsemigroups of idempotents of $\mathcal{T}(X)$ (respectively, $\mathcal{P}(X)$); as well as the largest commutative subsemigroups of $\mathcal{T}(X)$ (respectively, $\mathcal{P}(X)$) that contain a unique idempotent. We also provide an alternative way to determine the largest commutative nilpotent subsemigroups of $\mathcal{T}(X)$ (which were previously characterized by Cain, Malheiro and the present author); and we describe the largest commutative nilpotent subsemigroups of $\mathcal{P}(X)$.
  These results allow us to make conclusions regarding the clique numbers of the commuting graphs of $\mathcal{T}(X)$ and of $\mathcal{P}(X)$. We also determine their girths and knit degrees.</description>

      <title>Finite groups in which every irreducible character has either $p'$-degree or $p'$-codegree</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an irreducible complex character $\chi$ of a finite group $G$, the codegree of $\chi$ is defined by $|G:\ker(\chi)|/\chi(1)$, where $\ker(\chi)$ is the kernel of $\chi$. Given a prime $p$, we provide a classification of finite groups in which every irreducible complex character has either $p'$-degree or $p'$-codegree.</description>

      <title>The hyperbolic cover of an elliptic Weyl group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study in detail the hyperbolic covers $\tilde{W}$ and $\hat{W}$ of an elliptic Weyl system introduced by Saito. We show that they are isomorphic and also isomorphic to an extended Coxeter system of star type. For $\tilde{c}$ a Coxeter transformation in $\tilde{W}$ we can conclude the Hurwitz transitivity of the braid group action on the set of reduced reflection factorizations of $\tilde{c}$ from the Hurwitz transitivity in extended Coxeter systems of star type. This then enables us to establish for a weighted projective line $\mathbb{X}$ of tubular type an order preserving bijection between the poset of thick subcategories of $\mathrm{coh}(\mathbb{X})$ generated by an exceptional sequence and the poset $[\mathrm{id}, \tilde{c}]$ ordered by the absolute order. In an Appendix, we study the hyperbolic cover of a Coxeter system.</description>

      <title>On the intersections of Sylow subgroups in almost simple groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19745v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite almost simple group and let $H$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$. As a special case of a theorem of Zenkov, there exist $x,y \in G$ such that $H \cap H^x \cap H^y = 1$. In fact, if $G$ is simple, then a theorem of Mazurov and Zenkov reveals that $H \cap H^x = 1$ for some $x \in G$. However, it is known that the latter property does not extend to all almost simple groups. For example, if $G = S_8$ and $p=2$, then $H \cap H^x \ne 1$ for all $x \in G$. Further work of Zenkov in the 1990s shows that such examples are rare (for instance, there are no such examples if $p \geqslant 5$) and he reduced the classification of all such pairs to the situation where $p=2$ and $G$ is an almost simple group of Lie type defined over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ and either $q=9$ or $q$ is a Mersenne or Fermat prime. In this paper, by adopting a probabilistic approach based on fixed point ratio estimates, we complete Zenkov's classification.</description>

      <title>An explicit algorithm for the Higman Embedding Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04347v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm which for any recursive group $G$, given by its effectively enumerable generators and recursively enumerable relations, outputs an explicit embedding of $G$ into a finitely presented group directly written by its generators and defining relations. This is the explicit analogue of the remarkable Higman Embedding Theorem stating that a finitely generated group $G$ is embeddable into a finitely presented group if and only if $G$ is recursive. The constructed finitely presented group can even be chosen to be $2$-generator. This algorithm has already been applied, for example, to the additive group of rational numbers $\mathbb Q$, which clearly is recursive. The question on explicit embedding of $\mathbb Q$ into a finitely presented group was mentioned in the literature by Johnson, de la Harpe, Bridson and others. The suggested method can be used to solve the problem of embeddings for some other recursive groups, also. The embedding algorithm is built using conventional free constructions, including free products with amalgamation, HNN-extensions, and also their modifications, such as the auxiliary $*$-constructions. We also analyze the steps of original Higman embedding to clearly indicate which of its parts are not explicit.</description>

      <title>First-order theory of torsion-free Tarski monsters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop methods to control the first-order theory of groups arising as certain direct limits of torsion-free hyperbolic groups, answering several questions in the literature. We construct simple torsion-free Tarski monsters $\Gamma$ (non-abelian groups whose non-trivial, proper subgroups are infinite cyclic) that are $\exists \forall \exists$-elementarily embedded into $\Gamma \ast \Z$. In particular, such $\Gamma$ have the same two-quantifier theory as $\Gamma*\Z$, and hence the same positive theory as a non-abelian free group. All previously known examples of groups with the same positive theory as the free group admit a non-elementary action on a hyperbolic space, while our examples cannot act on a hyperbolic space with a loxodromic element. Along the way, we solve the one-quantifier Knight conjecture for random quotients of arbitrary torsion-free, non-elementary, hyperbolic groups in the few-relator model.</description>

      <title>On the Coarse Lusternik-Schnirelmann Category of Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a coarse analog of the classical Lusternik-Schnirelmann category which we denote by $\text{c-cat}$, defined for metric spaces in the coarse homotopy category. This provides a new tool for studying large-scale topological properties of groups and spaces. We establish that $\text{c-cat}$ is a coarse homotopy invariant and prove a lower-bound $\text{p-cat}(\Gamma)\leq \text{c-cat}(\Gamma)$ for geometrically finite groups $\Gamma$, where $\text{p-cat}$ denotes the proper LS-category introduced in 1992 by Ayala and co-authors. We also prove an upper bound $\text{c-cat}(\Gamma) \leq \text{asdim}(\Gamma)$ for bicombable 1-ended groups which are semistable at $\infty$.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical N\'eron--Ogg--Shafarevich Criterion via Orbital Arboreal Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a non-archimedean local field and $\varphi:\mathbb{P}^1\to\mathbb{P}^1$ a rational endomorphism of degree $d\ge2$ defined over $K$. In the tame case ($p \nmid d$) we give a concise local criterion for strict good reduction on the natural residual 'etale locus: there exists a nonempty open $U_k\subset\mathbb{P}^1_k\setminus \mathrm{PC}(\tilde\varphi)$ such that for every $x\in\mathbb{P}^1(\mathcal{O}_K)$ with $\bar x\in U_k$ the reduced level-$1$ fiber has degree $d$ and is 'etale; equivalently, the fiber polynomial has unit leading coefficient and unit discriminant. In particular, all backward preimage extensions $K(X_n(x))/K$ are unramified for all $n\ge1$. This work provides an orbital refinement of the pointwise criterion of Benedetto, framing it in terms of a canonical, orbit-invariant Galois object. We provide complete proofs and explicit examples over $\mathbb{Q}_p$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main drawback of using generative AI models for advanced mathematics is that these models are not logical reasoning engines. However, Large Language Models, and their refinements, can pick up on patterns in higher mathematics that are difficult for humans to see. By putting the design of generative AI models to their advantage, mathematicians may use them as powerful interactive assistants that can carry out laborious tasks, generate and debug code, check examples, formulate conjectures and more. We discuss how generative AI models can be used to advance mathematics research. We also discuss their integration with Computer Algebra Systems and formal proof assistants such as Lean.</description>
