      <title>A Dichotomy for $k$-automatic expansions of Presburger Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k\ge 2$ and let $X$ be a subset of the natural numbers that is $k$-automatic and not eventually periodic. We show that a dichotomy holds: either all $k$-automatic subsets are definable in the expansion of Presburger arithmetic in which we adjoin the predicate $X$, or $(\mathbb{N},+,X)=(\mathbb{N},+,k^{\mathbb{N}})$.</description>

      <title>Elementarity of Subgroups and Complexity of Theories for Profinite Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although $S_\infty$ (the group of all permutations of $\mathbb{N}$) is size continuum, both it and its closed subgroups can be presented as the set of paths through a countable tree. The subgroups of $S_\infty$ that can be presented this way with finite branching trees are exactly the profinite ones. We use these tree presentations to find upper bounds on the complexity of the existential theories of profinite subgroups of $S_\infty$, as well as to prove sharpness for these bounds. These complexity results enable us to distinguish a simple subclass of profinite groups, those with \emph{orbit independence}, for which we find an upper bound on the complexity of the entire first order theory. Additionally, given a profinite subgroup $G$ of $S_\infty$ and a Turing ideal $I$ we define $G_I$ to be the set of elements in $G$ whose Turing degree lies in $I$. We examine to what extent and under what conditions $G_I$ will be an elementary subgroup of $G$. In particular, we construct a profinite group whose subgroup of computable elements is not elementary even for existential formulas.</description>

      <title>On a cofinal Reinhardt embedding without Powerset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10698v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a positive answer to the question of Matthews whether $\mathsf{ZF}^-$ is consistent with a non-trivial cofinal Reinhardt elementary embedding $j\colon V\to V$. The consistency follows from $\mathsf{ZFC} + I_0$, and more precisely, it is witnessed by Schlutzenberg's model of $\mathsf{ZF}$ with an elementary embedding $k\colon V_{\lambda+2}\to V_{\lambda+2}$.</description>

      <title>Transposition of variables is hard to describe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The function $p_{xy}$ that interchanges two logical variables $x,y$ in formulas is hard to describe in the following sense. Let $F$ denote the Lindenbaum-Tarski formula-algebra of a finite-variable first order logic, endowed with $p_{xy}$ as a unary function. Each equational axiom system for the equational theory of $F$ has to contain, for each finite $n$, an equation that contains together with $p_{xy}$ at least $n$ algebraic variables, and each of the operations $\exists, =, \lor$. This solves a problem raised by Johnson [J. Symb. Logic] more than 50 years ago: the class of representable polyadic equality algebras of a finite dimension $\alpha\ge 3$ cannot be axiomatized by adding finitely many equations to the equational theory of representable cylindric algebras of dimension $\alpha$. Consequences for proof systems of finite-variable logic and for defining equations of polyadic equality algebras are given.
  The proof uses a family of nonrepresentable polyadic equality algebras ${\cal A}_n$ that are more and more nearly representable as $n$ increases: their $n$-generated subalgebras as well as their proper reducts are representable. The lattice of subvarieties of $RPEA_{\alpha}$ is investigated and new open problems are asked about the interplay between the transposition operations and about generalizability of the results to infinite dimensions.</description>

      <title>2-Coherent Internal Models of Homotopical Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The program of internal type theory seeks to develop the categorical model theory of dependent type theory using the language of dependent type theory itself. In the present work we study internal homotopical type theory by relaxing the notion of a category with families (cwf) to that of a wild, or precoherent higher cwf, and determine coherence conditions that suffice to recover properties expected of models of dependent type theory. The result is a definition of a split 2-coherent wild cwf, which admits as instances both the syntax and the "standard model" given by a universe type. This will allow us to give a straightforward internalization of the notion of a 2-coherent reflection of homotopical type theory in itself: namely as a 2-coherent wild cwf morphism from the syntax to the standard model. Our theory also easily specializes to give definitions of "low-dimensional" higher cwfs, and conjecturally includes the container higher model as a further instance.</description>
