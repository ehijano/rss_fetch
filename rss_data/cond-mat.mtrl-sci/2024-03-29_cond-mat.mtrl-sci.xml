      <title>A fundamental correlative spectroscopic study on LixNiO2 and NaNiO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intimate correlation between the local atomic arrangement and electronic states in Li-ion battery cathode materials plays a crucial role in determining their electrochemical properties, including capacity, cycling stability, and rate capability. Despite almost 30 years of research efforts on high performance cathodes based on Ni rich layered oxides, there is still no consensus on LiNiO2 local atomic and electronic structure. Ni sites could be either Jahn-Teller distorted or bond disproportionated and the role of Ni and oxygen in the charge compensation mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we compare the local and electronic structure of LiNiO2 and NaNiO2, a long-range Jahn-Teller system, using a novel approach which aims at correlating the results from bulk spectroscopy techniques, particularly under operando conditions, obtained on standard samples to ensure sample interoperability and enhance the reliability and robustness of our results. Despite being a site-selective and local technique, XAS is unable to discriminate between the proposed scenarios, as confirmed also by theoretical calculations. On the contrary, Raman spectroscopy show local structural differences between monoclinic distorted NaNiO2 and rhombohedral LiNiO2. Additionally, HAXPES confirms the presence of multiple formal oxidation states for Ni, and RIXS data provides evidence of 3d8 states, confirming the negative charge transfer character of Ni and some degree of bond disproportionation in LiNiO2. Regarding the charge compensation mechanism, XRS and RIXS support the participation of oxygen holes in the redox activity, while Raman spectroscopy does not detect molecular oxygen. By combing several high-fidelity spectroscopy datasets, this study shows the value of correlative characterization workflows to provide insights into complex structural-electrochemical relationships.</description>

      <title>Phase-space representation of coherent states generated through SUSY QM for tilted anisotropic Dirac materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the electron interaction within tilted anisotropic Dirac materials when subjected to external electric and magnetic fields possessing translational symmetry. Specifically, we focus on a distinct non-zero electric field magnitude, enabling the separation of the differential equation system inherent in the eigenvalue problem. Subsequently, employing supersymmetric quantum mechanics facilitates the determination of eigenstates and eigenvalues corresponding to the Hamiltonian operator. To delve into a semi-classical analysis of the system, we identify a set of coherent states. Finally, we assess the characteristics of these states using fidelity and the phase-space representation through the Wigner function.</description>

      <title>MaterialsMap: A CALPHAD-Based Tool to Design Composition Pathways through feasibility map for Desired Dissimilar Materials, demonstrated with RSW Joining of Ag-Al-Cu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assembly of dissimilar metals can be achieved by different methods, for example, casting, welding, and additive manufacturing (AM). However, undesired phases formed in liquid-phase assembling processes due to solute segregation during solidification diminish mechanical and other properties of the processed parts. In the present work, an open-source software named MaterialsMap, has been developed based on the CALculation of Phase Diagrams (CALPHAD) approach. The primary objective of MaterialsMap is to facilitate the design of an optimal composition pathway for assembling dissimilar alloys with liquid-phases based on the formation of desired and undesired phases along the pathway. In MaterialsMap, equilibrium thermodynamic calculations are used to predict equilibrium phases formed at slow cooling rate, while Scheil-Gulliver simulations are employed to predict non-equilibrium phases formed during rapid cooling. By combining these two simulations, MaterialsMap offers a thorough guide for understanding phase formation in various manufacturing processes, assisting users in making informed decisions during material selection and production. As a demonstration of this approach, a compositional pathway was designed from pure Al to pure Cu through Ag using MaterialsMap. The design was experimentally verified using resistance spot welding (RSW).</description>

      <title>Rydberg exciton states and near-infrared light-emitting diode in monolayer MoTe2 devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons, or bound electron-hole pairs, play a crucial role in the optical response of monolayer, 2H-phase transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). They hold significant promise for the development of novel quantum opto-electronic devices due to their large binding energies and strong spin-orbit coupling. Among the monolayer TMDs, MoTe2 stands out because of its bandgap in the near-infrared (NIR) regime. Here, we report the experimental observation of NIR Rydberg excitons and conduction band-split charged excitons, in high-quality, boron nitride (BN)-encapsulated monolayer MoTe2 devices, probed by photoluminescence and electroluminescence spectroscopy. By employing a graphite bottom gate, we successfully modulate the emission intensity of various excitonic species. Additionally, our device fabrication process within an argon-filled glove box ensures clean TMD/metal electrode interfaces, enabling the construction of p-n junctions near the electrodes. Our work significantly advances our understanding of excitons in monolayer TMDs and contributes to the application of MoTe2 in NIR quantum opto-electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Prediction and identification of point defect fingerprints in the X-ray photoelectron spectra of TiN$_x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of selected N and Ti point defects in $B$1 TiN on N 1s and Ti 2p$_{3/2}$ binding energies (BE) by experiments and ab initio calculations. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of Ti-deficient TiN films reveal additional N 1s spectral components at lower binding energies. Ab initio calculations predict that these components are caused by either Ti vacancies, which induce a N 1s BE shift of $-0.53$ eV in its first N neighbors, and/or N tetrahedral interstitials, which have their N 1s BE shifted by $-1.18$ eV and also shift BE of their first N neighbors by $-0.53$ eV. However, the {\it ab initio} calculations also reveal that the tetrahedral N interstitial is unstable at room temperature. We, therefore, unambiguously attribute the detected signal to Ti vacancies. Furthermore, the vacancy concentration in Ti-deficient TiN was quantified with XPS supported by ab initio calculations. The largest BE shifts of $-1.53$, $-1.80$ and $-2.28$ eV for Ti 2p$_{3/2}$ electrons are predicted for the Ti tetrahedral, split (10$\overline{1}$)-aligned and split (111)-aligned interstitial atoms, respectively, and we, therefore, propose XPS could detect them. Other defects such as N vacancy or N split (10$\overline{1}$)-aligned interstitial introduce smaller N 1s and Ti 2p$_{3/2}$ BE shifts and are unlikely to be detectable experimentally. Our work highlights the potential of ab initio-guided XPS measurements in detecting and quantifying point defects in $B$1 TiN.</description>

      <title>High Mobility Charge Transport in a Multicarrier Altermagnet CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A newly identified magnetic phase called altermagnet is being actively studied because of its unprecedented spin-dependent phenomena. Among the candidate materials, CrSb has a particularly high transition temperature and a large spin-splitting energy, but its transport properties have remained unexplored. In this study, we report the magnetotransport properties of CrSb measured on single crystals. We found that the Hall resistivity shows a nonlinear dependence on the magnetic field at low temperatures. From symmetry-based considerations, however, this behavior can not be attributed to an anomalous Hall effect, but to a multicarrier effect. A multicarrier fitting to the in-plane conductivity tensor revealed that there are carriers with high mobilities in CrSb, probably because of the presence of Weyl points in the electronic structure.</description>

      <title>Impact of a $MoS_2$ monolayer on the nanoscale thermoelastic response of silicon heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the thermoelastic response of a nanostructure is crucial for the choice of materials and interfaces in electronic devices with improved and tailored transport properties, at the length scales of the present technology. Here we show how the deposition of a $MoS_2$ monolayer can strongly modify the nanoscale thermoelastic dynamics of silicon substrates close to their interface. We achieve this result by creating a transient grating with extreme ultraviolet light, using ultrashort free-electron laser pulses, whose $\approx$84 nm period is comparable to the size of elements typically used in nanodevices, such as electric contacts and nanowires. The thermoelastic response, featured by coherent acoustic waves and an incoherent relaxation, is tangibly modified by the presence of monolayer $MoS_2$. Namely, we observed a major reduction of the amplitude of the surface mode, which is almost suppressed, while the longitudinal mode is basically unperturbed, aside from a faster decay of the acoustic modulations. We interpret this behavior as a selective modification of the surface elasticity and we discuss the conditions to observe such effect, which might be of immediate relevance for the design of Si-based nanoscale devices.</description>

      <title>Tuning the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect from large to zero in the two ferromagnetic states of the layered SmMn2Ge2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity in a ferromagnetic metal is completely determined by its band structure. Since the spin orientation direction is an important band structure tuning parameter, it is highly desirable to study the anomalous Hall effect in a system with multiple spin reorientation transitions. We study a layered tetragonal room temperature ferromagnet SmMn2Ge2, which gives us the opportunity to measure magneto-transport properties where the long c-axis and the short a-axis can both be magnetically easy axes depending on the temperature range we choose. We show a moderately large completely intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) up to room temperature when the crystal is magnetized along c-axis. Interestingly, the AHC can be tuned to completely extrinsic with extremely large values when the crystal is magnetized along a-axis irrespective of whether the a-axis is magnetically easy or hard axis. The first principles calculations show that nodal line states originate from Mn-d orbitals just below the Fermi energy (EF) in the electronic band structure when the spins are oriented along the c-axis. Intrinsic AHC originates form the Berry curvature effect of the gapped nodal lines in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. AHC almost vanishes when the spins are aligned along the a-axis because nodal line states shift above EF and become unoccupied states.</description>

      <title>Chirality-Induced Magnet-Free Spin Generation in a Semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrical generation and transduction of polarized electron spins in semiconductors are of central interest in spintronics and quantum information science. While spin generation in semiconductors has been frequently realized via electrical injection from a ferromagnet, there are significant advantages in nonmagnetic pathways of creating spin polarization. One such pathway exploits the interplay of electron spin with chirality in electronic structures or real space. Here, utilizing chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), we demonstrate efficient creation of spin accumulation in n-doped GaAs via electric current injection from a normal metal (Au) electrode through a self-assembled monolayer of chiral molecules ({\alpha}-helix L-polyalanine, AHPA-L). The resulting spin polarization is detected as a Hanle effect in the n-GaAs, which is found to obey a distinct universal scaling with temperature and bias current consistent with chirality-induced spin accumulation. The experiment constitutes a definitive observation of CISS in a fully nonmagnetic device structure and demonstration of its ability to generate spin accumulation in a conventional semiconductor. The results thus place key constraints on the physical mechanism of CISS and present a new scheme for magnet-free semiconductor spintronics.</description>

      <title>Combine Influences of Nanoparticulate Hematite Thin Film Thickness, Roughness, and Weight on Its Photoelectrochemical Performance and Viscous/ Thermal Characteristics of Source Precursor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective of this work was to investigate the photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of nanoparticulate hematite thin film photoelectrodes prepared by a soft-chemistry route. Two cost-effective thin film fabrication techniques were employed to deposit the hematite film. First, the film was deposited on conducting glass substrates by dip coating of the organic precursor containing fatty acid derivatives of iron salts. Process parameters such as the concentration of iron oleic acid derivative precursor solution, the thickness of the organic film, before annealing and the number of deposited layers along with their weight and roughness were studied. In the second approach, the influence of the spin coating process on film formation and respective photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance have been discussed. It was found that the PEC performance of spin-coated samples was lower than that of dip coated samples due to the effect of films rough and smooth characteristics. It is found that the rough surface of the photoelectrode is a prerequisite to achieving good photocurrent values. Here, three-layer samples with roughness between 600nm to 800nm and bulk thickness up to 700nm provided photocurrent densities of 0.6mA/cm2. In part 2 of the manuscript, we have elaborately discussed the roughness and smooth behavior of thin films using X-ray reflectometry technique. Followed by this, a detailed account of the viscous and thermal properties of the fatty acid derivatives of iron precursor have been discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We grew (Hg,Re)Ba2Ca2Cu3O8+{\delta} ((Hg,Re)1223) single crystals with good reproducibility via the single-step flux method using monoxides as raw materials. A double-sealing method using a thick-walled quartz tube and a stainless-steel container was adopted for explosion protection. The maximum crystal size was approximately 1 mm x 1 mm in the ab plane and 0.04 mm in thickness. The crystal was square-shaped, reflecting the tetragonal crystal structure of (Hg,Re)1223. Magnetic susceptibility measurements indicated a critical temperature of 130 K. The in-plane resistivity exhibited a linear temperature dependence, indicating that the sample was close to optimal doping level. The out-of-plane resistivity was also measured, and the anisotropy parameter was 250-650 at 300 K.</description>

      <title>Challenges in extracting nonlinear current-induced phenomena in Ca2RuO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An appealing direction to change the properties of strongly correlated materials is to induce nonequilibrium steady states by the application of a direct current. While access to these novel states is of high scientific interest, Joule heating due to current flow often constitutes a hurdle to identify nonthermal effects. The biggest challenge usually resides in measuring accurately the temperature of a sample subjected to direct current, and to use probes that give direct information of the material. In this work, we exploit the simultaneous measurement of electrical transport and magnetisation to probe non-equilibrium steady states in Ca2RuO4. In order to reveal non-thermal current-induced effects, we employ a simple model of Joule self-heating to remove the effects of heating and discuss the importance of temperature inhomogeneity within the sample. Our approach provides a solid basis for investigating current-induced phenomena in highly resistive materials.</description>

      <title>The role of chemo-mechanical modelling in the development of battery technology -- a perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the race to reduce global CO2 emissions and achieve net-zero, chemomechanics must play a critical role in the technological development of current and next-generation batteries to improve their energy storage capabilities and their lifetime. Many degradation processes arise through mechanics via the development of diffusion-induced stress and volumetric strains within the various constituent materials in a battery. From particle cracking in lithium-ion batteries to lithium dendrite-based fracture of solid electrolytes in solid-state batteries, it is clear that significant barriers exist in the development of these energy storage systems, where chemomechanics plays a central part. To accelerate technological and scientific advances in this area, multi-scale and highly coupled multiphysics modelling must be carried out that includes mechanics-based phenomena. In this perspective article, we provide an introduction to chemomechanical modelling, the various physical problems that it addresses, and the issues that need to be resolved in order to expand its use within the field of battery technology.</description>

      <title>Infrared Reflection Absorption Spectroscopy Setup with Incidence Angle Selection for Surfaces of Non-Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared Reflection Absorption Spectroscopy (IRAS) on dielectric single crystals is challenging because the optimal incidence angles for light-adsorbate interaction coincide with regions of low IR reflectivity. Here, we introduce an optimized IRAS setup that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio for non-metals. This is achieved by maximizing light throughput, and by selecting optimal incidence angles that directly impact the peak heights in the spectra. The setup uses a commercial FTIR spectrometer and is usable in ultra-high vacuum (UHV). Specifically, the design features sample illumination and collection mirrors with a high numerical aperture inside the UHV system, and an adjustable aperture to select the incidence angle range on the sample. This is important for p-polarized measurements on dielectrics, because the peaks in the spectra reverse direction at the Brewster angle (band inversion). The system components are connected precisely via a single flange, ensuring long-term stability. We studied the signal-to-noise (SNR) variation in p-polarized IRAS spectra for one monolayer of CO on TiO2(110) as a function of incidence angle range, where a maximum signal-to-noise ratio of 70 was achieved at 4 cm-1 resolution in five minutes measurement time. The capabilities for s-polarization are demonstrated by measuring one monolayer D2O adsorbed on a TiO2(110) surface, where a SNR of 65 was achieved at a delta_R/R0 peak height of 1.4x10-4 in twenty minutes.</description>

      <title>Kitaev Interactions Through an Extended Superexchange Pathway in the jeff = 1/2 Ru3+ Honeycomb Magnet, RuP3SiO11</title>

Abstract: Magnetic materials are composed of the simple building blocks of magnetic moments on a crystal lattice that interact via short-range magnetic exchange interactions. Yet from these simple building blocks emerges a remarkable diversity of magnetic states. Some of these, such as ferromagnetism, are familiar in our everyday lives, while others reveal the deep quantum mechanical origins of magnetism. A prime example of the latter are quantum spin liquid (QSL) states in which -- unlike in a ferromagnet where magnetic moments are driven by their exchange interactions to adopt long-range order -- magnetic moments remain disordered at low temperatures but are simultaneously correlated over long length scales through quantum entanglement. A particularly promising theoretical model of a QSL is the Kitaev model, composed of unusual bond-dependent exchange interactions between magnetic moments on a honeycomb lattice. However, the Kitaev QSL is extremely challenging to realise experimentally as it is unstable to competing exchange interactions and crystal lattice perturbations that inevitably arise in real materials. This makes it essential to understand the relationship between the structure and interactions that may give rise to Kitaev interactions in new candidate materials. Here we show that the material requirements for the Kitaev QSL survive for an extended pseudo-edge-sharing superexchange pathway of Ru3+ 4d5 octahedra within the honeycomb layers of the inorganic framework solid, RuP3SiO11. Through materials synthesis and structural characterisation, resonant inelastic X-ray and neutron scattering experiments, we confirm the requisite jeff = 1/2 state of Ru3+ in RuP3SiO11 and resolve the hierarchy of exchange interactions that provide experimental access to an otherwise unexplored region of the extended Kitaev phase diagram.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting diode effects have recently attracted much attention for their potential applications in superconducting logic circuits. Several mechanisms such as magneto-chiral effects, finite momentum Cooper pairing, asymmetric edge currents have been proposed to give rise to a supercurrent diode effect in different materials. In this work, we establish the presence of a large intrinsic Josephson diode effect in a type-II Dirac semimetal $1T-PtTe_2$ facilitated by its helical spin-momentum locking and distinguish it from other extrinsic effects. The magnitude of the Josephson diode effect is shown to be directly correlated to the large second-harmonic component of the supercurrent that is induced by the significant contribution of the topological spin-momentum locked states that promote coherent Andreev processes in the junction. We denote such junctions, where the relative phase between the two harmonics corresponding to charge transfers of $2e$ and $4e$ can be tuned by a magnetic field, as second order ${\phi}_0$-junctions. The direct correspondence between the second harmonic supercurrent component and the diode effect in $1T-PtTe_2$ junctions makes topological semimetals with high transparency an ideal platform to study and implement the Josephson diode effect, while also enabling further research on higher order supercurrent transport in Josephson junctions.</description>

      <title>Strain distribution in WS2 monolayers detected through Polarization-resolved Second Harmonic Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) graphene and graphene-related materials (GRMs) show great promise for future electronic devices. Nevertheless, GRMs result distinct properties under the influence of the substrate that serves as support through uneven compression/ elongation of GRMs surface atoms. Strain in GRM monolayers is the most common feature that alters the interatomic distances, band structure, providing a new degree of freedom that allows regulation of their electronic properties and introducing the field of straintronics. Having an all-optical detection, a minimally invasive tool that rapidly probes strain in large areas of GRM monolayers, would be of great importance in the research and development of novel 2D devices. Here, we use Polarization-resolved Second Harmonic Generation (P-SHG) optical imaging to identify strain distribution, induced in a single layer of WS2 placed on a pre-patterned Si/SiO2 substrate with cylindrical wells. By fitting the P-SHG data pixel-by-pixel, we produce spatially resolved images of the crystal armchair direction. In regions where the WS2 monolayer conforms to the pattern topography, a distinct cross-shaped pattern is evident in the armchair image owing to strain. The presence of strain in these regions is independently confirmed using a combination of atomic force microscopy and Raman mapping.</description>

      <title>Giant High-order Nonlinear and Nonreciprocal Electrical Transports Induced by Valley Flipping in Bernal Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the electrical transport properties of the mini-valley polarized state proposed recently in slightly doped Bernal Bilayer Graphene (BLG) in large electric displacement fields. By minimizing the Hartree-Fock energy functional, we first confirm the appearance of mini-valley polarized phase. At the low carrier doping regime, the 1-pocket state will be stabilized where only one of the trigonal-wrapping-induced Fermi pockets near the atomic-valley center is filled. Then we study the electrical transport of the 1-pocket state by solving the Boltzmann equation. We find that the valley polarization could be easily flopped by an in-plane electrical field, which will lead to hysteresis loop in the direct current (DC) $I-V$ curves. Such irreversible current responses in the DC limit will directly induce strong nonlinear and nonreciprocal alternating current (AC) responses, which has been already observed in the recent experiments on BLG.</description>

      <title>Impact of Resin Molecular Weight on Drying Kinetics and Sag of Coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The work herein investigates the impact of resin molecular weight and solvent choice on drying kinetics and sag velocity in polymer films. These films, ranging in thickness from ~60 micrometer to ~120 micrometer were formulated with 45% by weight polymer resin in one of two solvent packages with different relative evaporation rates (RER). Gravimetry was initially used to track drying kinetics and a one-dimensional diffusion model was utilized to compute the apparent solvent diffusivity. In addition, the film thickness was tracked with optical profilometry. Results from these measurements showed that for fixed molecular weight the drying kinetics increased by approximately two-fold for the high RER solvent, whereas the apparent diffusivity tended to increase with increasing polymer molecular weight. Films formulated from higher molecular weight resins had greater initial viscosities and thicknesses for identical draw down blade clearance. By extension, the higher apparent diffusivities at greater molecular weights were attributed to effects of prolonged evaporation times for the thicker films. The sag velocity was measured through the thickness of the film for these systems at a 5 degree incline using the Variable Angle Inspection Microscope (VAIM). Measurements showed an increase in sag velocity for thinner and less viscous films, which was somewhat surprising both because a thinner film will experience lower gravitational stress and quicker drying times as compared to a thicker film. From these data we conclude that formulating a coating with higher molecular weight resin, although likely to increase drying time, will tend to deter sag because of the large impact of viscosity on these phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structurally anisotropic materials are ubiquitous in several application fields, yet their accurate optical characterization remains challenging due to the lack of general models linking their scattering coefficients to the macroscopic transport observables, and the need to combine multiple measurements to retrieve their direction-dependent values. Here, we present an improved method for the experimental determination of light transport tensor coefficients from the diffusive rates measured along all three directions, based on transient transmittance measurements and a generalized Monte Carlo model. We apply our method to the characterization of light transport properties in two common anisotropic materials - polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tape and paper - highlighting the magnitude of systematic deviations that are typically incurred when neglecting anisotropy.</description>

Abstract: Excitons in van der Waals heterostructures based on atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides are considered as potential candidates for the formation of a superfluid state in two-dimensional systems. A number of studies reported observations of ultrafast nondiffusive propagation of excitons in van der Waals heterostructures, which was considered by their authors as possible evidence of collective effects in excitonic systems. In this paper, after a brief analysis of exciton propagation regimes in two-dimensional semiconductors, an alternative model of ultrafast exciton transport is proposed, based on the formation of waveguide modes in van der Waals heterostructures and the radiation transfer by these modes.</description>

      <title>Reference Energies for Double Excitations: Improvement and Extension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of photochemistry, the significance of double excitations (also known as doubly-excited states), where two electrons are concurrently elevated to higher energy levels, lies in their involvement in key electronic transitions essential in light-induced chemical reactions as well as their challenging nature from the computational theoretical chemistry point of view. Based on state-of-the-art electronic structure methods (such as high-order coupled-cluster, selected configuration interaction, and multiconfigurational methods), we improve and expand our prior set of accurate reference excitation energies for electronic states exhibiting a substantial amount of double excitations [http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b01205; Loos et al. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2019, 15, 1939]. This extended collection encompasses 47 electronic transitions across 26 molecular systems that we separate into two distinct subsets: (i) 28 "genuine" doubly-excited states where the transitions almost exclusively involve doubly-excited configurations and (ii) 19 "partial" doubly-excited states which exhibit a more balanced character between singly- and doubly-excited configurations. For each subset, we assess the performance of high-order coupled-cluster (CC3, CCSDT, CC4, and CCSDTQ) and multiconfigurational methods (CASPT2, CASPT3, PC-NEVPT2, and SC-NEVPT2). Using as a probe the percentage of single excitations involved in a given transition ($\%T_1$) computed at the CC3 level, we also propose a simple correction that reduces the errors of CC3 by a factor of 3, for both sets of excitations. We hope that this more complete and diverse compilation of double excitations will help future developments of electronic excited-state methodologies.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores methods to enhance the reproducibility of Josephson junctions, crucial elements in superconducting quantum technologies, when employing the Dolan technique in 30 kV e-beam processes. The study explores the influence of dose distribution along the bridge area on reproducibility, addressing challenges related to fabrication sensitivity. Experimental methods include E-beam lithography, with electron trajectory simulations shedding light on backscattered electron behavior. We demonstrate the fabrication of different junction geometries, revealing that some geometries significantly improve reproducibility by resulting in a more homogeneous dose distribution over the junction area.</description>

Abstract: A scalable platform to synthesize ultrathin heavy metals may enable high efficiency charge-to-spin conversion for next-generation spintronics. Here we report centimeter-scale synthesis of air-stable, epitaxially registered monolayer Pb underneath bilayer graphene on SiC (0001) by confinement heteroepitaxy (CHet). Diffraction, spectroscopy, and microscopy reveal CHet-based Pb intercalation predominantly exhibits a mottled hexagonal superstructure due to an ordered network of Frenkel-Kontorova-like domain walls. The system's air stability enables ex-situ spin torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) measurements that demonstrate charge-to-spin conversion in graphene/Pb/ferromagnet heterostructures with a 1.5x increase in the effective field ratio compared to control samples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simple Landau theory of plastic-to-crystal phase transitions in which the key components are a multipole-moment order parameter that describes the orientational ordering of the constituent molecules, coupling between such order parameter and elastic strains, and the thermal expansion of the solid. We illustrate the theory with the simplest non-trivial model in which the orientational ordering is described by a quadrupole moment, and use such model to calculate barocaloric effects in plastic crystals that are driven by hydrostatic pressure. The model captures main features of plastic-to-crystal phase transitions, namely the large volume and entropy changes at the transition, as well as the linear dependence of the transition temperature with pressure. We quantify the temperature regions in the barocaloric response associated with the individual plastic and crystal phases, and those involving the phase transition. Our model is in overall agreement with previous experiments in powdered samples of fullerite C$_{60}$, and predicts peak isothermal entropy changes of $\sim90 \,{\rm J K^{-1} kg^{-1}}$ and peak adiabatic temperature changes of $\sim35 \,{\rm K}$ using $0.60\,$GPa at $265\,$K in fullerite single crystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bulk PbSnSe has a two-phase region or miscibility gap as the crystal changes from a Van der Waals-bonded orthorhombic 2D layered structure in SnSe-rich compositions to the related 3D-bonded rocksalt structure in PbSe-rich compositions with large contrast in the electrical, optical, and thermal properties across this transition. With an aim to understand and harness this transition in thin films devices, we epitaxially integrate PbSnSe on GaAs by molecular beam epitaxy using an in-situ PbSe surface treatment and show a significantly reduced two-phase region by stabilizing the Pnma layered structure out to Pb$_{0.45}$Sn$_{0.55}$Se, beyond the bulk-limit of Pb$_{0.25}$Sn$_{0.75}$Se. Pushing further, we directly access metastable two-phase epitaxial films of layered and rocksalt grains that are nearly identical in composition around Pb$_{0.5}$Sn$_{0.5}$Se and entirely circumvent the miscibility gap. We present microstructural evidence for an incomplete displacive transformation from rocksalt to layered structure in these films that we speculate occurs during the sample cool down to room temperature after synthesis. In situ temperature-cycling experiments on a Pb$_{0.58}$Sn$_{0.42}$Se rocksalt film reproduce characteristic attributes of a displacive transition and show a modulation in electronic properties. We find well-defined orientation relationships between the phases formed and reveal unconventional strain relief mechanisms involved in the crystal structure transformation, using transmission electron microscopy. Overall, our work adds a scalable thin film integration route to harnessing the dramatic contrast in material properties in PbSnSe across a potentially ultrafast structural transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12776v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental observations of opposite Chern numbers in $R$-type twisted MoTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ homobilayers, we perform large-scale density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations with machine learning force fields to investigate moir\'e band topology from large to small twist angles in both materials. We find that the Chern numbers of the moir\'e frontier bands change sign as a function of twist angle, and this change is driven by the competition between moir\'{e} ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity. Our large-scale calculations, enabled by machine learning methods, reveal crucial insights into interactions across different scales in twisted bilayer systems. The interplay between atomic-level relaxation effects and moir\'e-scale electrostatic potential variation opens new avenues for the design of intertwined topological and correlated states, including the possibility of mimicking higher Landau-level physics in the absence of a magnetic field.</description>

To facilitate rapid ion transport crucial for fast charging and discharging, it is essential to understand point defects within these conductors. In this study, we investigate the heterogeneity of defect distribution in Li$_3$OCl solid ion conductor, quantifying the defect formation energy (DFE) of lithium vacancies and interstitials as a function of distance from the surface through first-principles simulations. Our results reveal that the surface DFE is consistently lower than bulk except for one surface termination, indicating significant defect aggregation at surfaces. This difference can cause the defect density to be up to 14 orders of magnitude higher at surfaces compared to the bulk. Moreover, we unveil the transition in DFE when moving from the surface to the bulk through the DFE function, which exhibits an exponentially decaying relationship. Incorporating this exponential trend, we develop a revised model for the average behavior of defects that offers a more accurate description of the influence of grain size. Surface effects dominate for grain sizes $\lesssim$ 1 $\mu$m, highlighting the importance of surface defect engineering and the DFE function for accurately capturing ion transport in devices. We further explore the kinetics of defect redistribution by calculating the migration barriers for defect movement between bulk and surfaces. We find a highly asymmetric energy landscape for the lithium vacancies, exhibiting lower migration barriers for movement towards the surface compared to the bulk, while interstitial defects exhibit comparable kinetics between surface and bulk regions. These insights underscore the importance of considering both thermodynamic and kinetic factors in the design of solid ion conductors.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and Kinetics of Silicate Glasses submitted to Binary Ion Exchange: Equilibrium Conditions and Interdiffusion Kinetics</title>

Abstract: Ion exchange processes between an ions reservoir and a solid matrix are modeled under the assumption that near interface volumes achieve equilibrium in a much faster time than the overall process time, while in the bulk of the solid matrix, ions are transported by an interdiffusion kinetic process. Ion exchange equilibrium conditions are established within the framework of classical thermodynamics. The result is defined in terms of the chemical potentials of exchanging ionic species. The proposed original derivation is performed making use of the thermodynamics of subsystems. This result is fundamental for the development of the equilibrium theory to determine near-surface equilibrium concentrations and ion exchange isotherms. Interaction energies of the exchanging ions in the glass can be determined from the thermodynamic factor n, which is a parameter of the ion exchange isotherm. The kinetics of the ion exchange process in silicate glass are discussed to find connections with the near-surface equilibrium condition. The resulting flux equation for the incoming ions in the glass is written in the form of a Fick equation with a variable, concentration-dependent, interdiffusion coefficient incorporating the thermodynamic factor n. It has been found that the thermodynamic factor of the interdiffusion coefficient is related to the interaction energy of the exchanging ions in the glass allowing a new approach to the interpretation of past experimental results. Surface concentration has been found substantially connected to the second parameter of the ion-exchange isotherm which is the equilibrium constant K and significatively influenced by the chemical composition of the ions reservoir.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for Carbon Dioxide Adsorption Prediction in Aluminium-Exchanged Zeolites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to efficiently predict adsorption properties of zeolites can be of large benefit in accelerating the design process of novel materials. The existing configuration space for these materials is wide, while existing molecular simulation methods are computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a model which is 4 to 5 orders of magnitude faster at adsorption properties compared to molecular simulations. To validate the model, we generated datasets containing various aluminium configurations for the MOR, MFI, RHO and ITW zeolites along with their heat of adsorptions and Henry coefficients for CO$_2$, obtained from Monte Carlo simulations. The predictions obtained from the Machine Learning model are in agreement with the values obtained from the Monte Carlo simulations, confirming that the model can be used for property prediction. Furthermore, we show that the model can be used for identifying adsorption sites. Finally, we evaluate the capability of our model for generating novel zeolite configurations by using it in combination with a genetic algorithm.</description>

      <title>Dipolar Weyl semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In time-reversal symmetry-broken Weyl semimetals, Weyl points act as monopoles and antimonopoles of the Berry curvature, with a monopole-antimonopole pair producing a net zero Berry flux. The two-dimensional (2D) planes that separate a monopole-antimonopole pair of Weyl points carry quantized Berry flux. In this work, we introduce a class of symmetry-protected Weyl semimetals which host monopole-antimonopole pairs of Weyl points that generate a quantized dipolar Berry flux. Consequently, topologically distinct 2D planes coexist in the Brillouin zone, carrying either quantized monopolar or dipolar flux. We construct a topological invariant -- the staggered Chern number -- to measure the quantized dipolar flux and employ it to topologically distinguish between various Weyl points. Finally, through a minimal two-band model, we investigate physical signatures of bulk topology, including surface Fermi arcs, zero-energy hinge states, and response to insertion of a $\pi$-flux vortex.</description>

      <title>RASCBEC: RAman Spectroscopy Calculation via Born Effective Charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We advance the algorithm for ab initio calculations of Raman spectra for large systems via applying external electric field, and complement it by a code implementation we name RASCBEC. With the RASCBEC code, we have successfully benchmark crystalline materials and compute Raman spectra of large molecules, and amorphous oxides. Our results demonstrate a remarkable level of agreement with the results from other commonly used codes as well as the experimental data. The electric field approach for Raman spectra calculation is designed to overcome the computational challenges associated with the conventional approach, which requires the calculation of the macroscopic dielectric tensor at numerous molecular geometries. The key innovation in our approach lies in obtaining the first-order derivatives with respect to the external electric field directly from VASP (the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package), as the Born Effective Charge (BEC). The RASCBEC code not only significantly reduces computational time, up to a factor of $N/8$, compared to the conventional approach, where $N$ is the total count of atoms within the simulation box. But also maintains the same level of accuracy, employing first-order numerical derivatives that avoid the numerical noise associated with algorithms requiring second-order derivatives, as seen in other electric field-based methods. This advantage makes RASCBEC particularly beneficial for large molecules and expansive amorphous systems.</description>

      <title>Topology of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ nanosheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02792v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the quantum spin-Hall edge channels of two-dimensional colloidal nanocrystals of the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ were observed directly. Motivated by this development, we reconsider the four-band effective model which has been traditionally employed in the past to describe thin nanosheets of this material. Derived from a three-dimensional $\boldsymbol{k} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \boldsymbol{p}$ model, it physically describes the top and bottom electronic surface states at the $\Gamma$ point that become gapped due to the material's small thickness. However, we find that the four-band model for the surface states alone, as derived directly from the three-dimensional theory, is inadequate for the description of thin films of a few quintuple layers and even yields an incorrect topological invariant within a significant range of thicknesses. To address this limitation we propose an eight-band model which, in addition to the surface states, also incorporates the set of bulk states closest to the Fermi level. We find that the eight-band model not only captures most of the experimental observations, but also agrees with previous first-principles calculations of the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ invariant in thin films of varying thickness. The band inversion around the $\Gamma$ point, which endows the surface-like bands with topology, is shown to be enabled by the presence of the additional bulk-like states without requiring any reparametrization of the resulting effective Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibilities for spin-singlet superconductivity in newly discovered altermagnets. Investigating $d$-wave altermagnets, we show that finite-momentum superconductivity can easily emerge in altermagnets even though they have no net magnetization, when the superconducting order parameter also has $d$-wave symmetry with nodes coinciding with the altermagnet nodes. Additionally, we find a rich phase diagram when both altermagnetism and an external magnetic field are considered, including superconductivity appearing at high magnetic fields from a parent zero-field normal state.</description>

      <title>Tensorial properties via the neuroevolution potential framework: Fast simulation of infrared and Raman spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infrared and Raman spectroscopy are widely used for the characterization of gases, liquids, and solids, as the spectra contain a wealth of information concerning in particular the dynamics of these systems. Atomic scale simulations can be used to predict such spectra but are often severely limited due to high computational cost or the need for strong approximations that limit application range and reliability. Here, we introduce a machine learning (ML) accelerated approach that addresses these shortcomings and provides a significant performance boost in terms of data and computational efficiency compared to earlier ML schemes. To this end, we generalize the neuroevolution potential approach to enable the prediction of rank one and two tensors to obtain the tensorial neuroevolution potential (TNEP) scheme. We apply the resulting framework to construct models for the dipole moment, polarizability, and susceptibility of molecules, liquids, and solids, and show that our approach compares favorably with several ML models from the literature with respect to accuracy and computational efficiency. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the TNEP approach to the prediction of infrared and Raman spectra of liquid water, a molecule (PTAF-), and a prototypical perovskite with strong anharmonicity (BaZrO3). The TNEP approach is implemented in the free and open source software package GPUMD, which makes this methodology readily available to the scientific community.</description>

      <title>Quantized plastic deformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In engineering crystal plasticity inelastic mechanisms correspond to tensorial zero-energy valleys in the space of macroscopic strains. The flat nature of such valleys is in contradiction with the fact that plastic slips, mimicking lattice-invariant shears, are inherently discrete. A reconciliation has recently been achieved in the mesoscopic tensorial model (MTM) of crystal plasticity, which introduces periodically modulated energy valleys while also capturing in a geometrically exact way the crystallographically-specific aspects of plastic slips. In this paper, we extend the MTM framework, which in its original form had the appearance of a discretized nonlinear elasticity theory, by explicitly introducing the concept of plastic deformation. The ensuing model contains a novel matrix-valued spin variable, representing the quantized plastic distortion, whose rate-independent evolution can be described by a discrete (quasi-)automaton. The proposed reformulation of the MTM leads to a considerable computational speedup associated with the use of a robust and efficient hybrid Gauss-Newton--Cauchy energy minimization algorithm. To illustrate the effectiveness of the new approach, we present a detailed case-study focusing on the aspects of crystal plasticity that are beyond reach for the classical continuum theory. Thus, we provide compelling evidence that the re-formulated MTM is fully adequate to deal with the intermittency of plastic response under quasi-static loading. In particular, our numerical experiments show that the statistics of dislocational avalanches, associated with plastic yield in 2D square crystals, exhibits a power-law tail with a critical exponent matching the value predicted by general theoretical considerations and also independently observed in discrete-dislocation-dynamics (DDD) simulations.</description>

      <title>A-15 type superconducting hydride $La_4H_{23}$: Nanograined structure with low strain, strong electron-phonon interaction, and moderate level of nonadiabaticity</title>

Abstract: For seven decades by A-15 superconductors we meant metallic $A_3B$ alloys (where A is a transition metal, and B is groups IIIB and IVB element) discovered by Hardy and Hulm (Phys. Rev. 89, 884 (1953)). Nb3Ge exhibited the highest superconducting transition temperature, $T_c = 23 K$, among these alloys. One of these alloys, $Nb_3Sn$, is primary material in modern applied superconductivity. Recently Guo et al (arXiv:2307.13067) extended the family of superconductors where the metallic ions arranged in the beta tungsten (A-15) sublattice by observation of $T_{c,zero} = 81 K$ in $La_4H_{23}$ phase compressed at $P = 118 GPa$. Despite the $La_4H_{23}$ has much lower $T_c$ in comparison with near-room-temperature superconducting $LaH_{10}$ phase ($T_{c,zero} = 250 K$ at $P = 200 GPa$) discovered by Drozdov et al (Nature 569, 531 (2019)), the $La_4H_{23}$ holds the record high $T_c$ within A-15 family. Cross et al (Phys. Rev. B 109, L020503 (2024)) confirmed the high-temperature superconductivity in the compressed $La_4H_{23}$. In this paper, we analyzed available experimental data measured in $La_4H_{23}$ and found that this superconductor exhibits nanograined structure, 5.5 nm &lt; D &lt; 35 nm, low crystalline strain &lt; 0.003, high electron-phonon coupling constant, 1.5 &lt; $\lambda_{e-ph}$ &lt; 2.55, and moderate level of the nonadiabaticity $\Theta_{D}/T_{F}$. We found that derived $\Theta_{D}/T_{F}$ and $T_c/T_F$ values for the $La_4H_{23}$ phase are similar to the ones in cuprates, pnictides, and near-room-temperature superconductors $H_3S$ and $LaH_{10}$, which implies that the $La_4H_{23}$ phase falls to unconventional superconductors band in the Uemura plot.</description>

      <title>Origin of competing charge density waves in kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding competing charge density wave (CDW) orders in the bilayer kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ remains a challenge. Experimentally, upon cooling, short-range CDW order with the wave vector $\mathbf{q}_{2}=(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2})$ is observed, which is subsequently suppressed by the condensation of the long-range CDW order $\mathbf{q}_{3}=(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3})$ at lower temperature. In conflict with these observations, theoretical calculations overestimate the transition temperature by a few thousand Kelvin and incorrectly predict the $\mathbf{q}_{2}$ CDW order to be the ground state. Here, we develop a theory of CDW order in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ based on anharmonic phonon-phonon calculations combined with density functional theory. We predict a temperature-driven phase transition from the high-temperature $\mathbf{q}_{2}$ CDW to the low-temperature $\mathbf{q}_{3}$ CDW order, fully explaining experimental observations. Additionally, we clarify that both multi-phonon effects and semi-core electron states play a crucial role in stabilizing the $\mathbf{q}_{3}$ order. Finally, we construct a phase diagram of the competing CDWs in the lattice parameter space and demonstrate that the out-of-plane lattice parameter plays a pivotal role in manipulating the competing CDWs in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$, motivating us to propose compressive bi-axial strain as an experimental protocol to stabilize the $\mathbf{q}_{2}$ CDW order. Our work provides a full theory of CDWs in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$, rationalizing experimental observations and resolving ealier discrepancies between theory and experiment. Overall, our work contributes to the wider effort of understanding CDWs in the kagome metal family.</description>
