      <title>Accurate background velocity model building method based on iterative deep learning in sparse transform domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whether it is oil and gas exploration or geological science research, it is necessary to accurately grasp the structural information of underground media. Full waveform inversion is currently the most popular seismic wave inversion method, but it is highly dependent on a high-quality initial model. Artificial intelligence algorithm deep learning is completely data-driven and can get rid of the dependence on the initial model. However, the prediction accuracy of deep learning algorithms depends on the scale and diversity of training data sets. How to improve the prediction accuracy of deep learning without increasing the size of the training set while also improving computing efficiency is a worthy issue to study. In this paper, an iterative deep learning algorithm in the sparse transform domain is proposed based on the characteristics of deep learning: first, based on the computational efficiency and the effect of sparse transform, the cosine transform is selected as the sparse transform method, and the seismic data and the corresponding velocity model are cosine transformed to obtain their corresponding sparse expressions, which are then used as the input data and corresponding label data for deep learning; then we give an iterative deep learning algorithm in the cosine transform domain, that is, after obtaining the seismic data residuals and velocity model residuals of the previous round of test results, they are used again as new input data and label data, and re-trained in the cosine domain to obtain a new network, and the prediction results of the previous round are corrected, and then the cycle is repeated until the termination condition is reached. The algorithm effect was verified on the SEG/EAGE salt model and the seabed sulfide physical model site data.</description>

      <title>Changes in seismicity in a volcanically active region, on the eastern side of Izu Peninsula, Japan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Izu-Tobu region, on the eastern side of Izu Peninsula, in Japan, is volcanically and seismically active. In this region, earthquake swarms of ordinary earthquakes frequently occur at shallow depths, which is considered to be associated with magma intrusion. Beneath ordinary earthquakes, low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs) are infrequently observed. We conducted a timeseries analysis of both types of earthquakes during the time period 2005-2020, using a variant of the Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence model. For this analysis, we used the Japan Meteorological Agency catalog of ordinary earthquakes and the catalog of LFEs produced using the matched filter method. The observed result, which was common to both types of earthquakes, showed a significant change in seismicity, which became quiet, with the inflection point falling sometime between late 2009 and mid-2013, during which two out of three pronounced earthquake swarms occurred. We associated this seismic quiescence with changes in background rate to be low, where background rate, by removing the triggering effect of aftershocks, was interpreted as having been caused directly by the magma source, which can vary with time. We used surface displacement data obtained from the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan, and observed that the uplift due to magma intrusion was significant during the 1970s-1990s whereas it was in abatement or unobservable during the studied period (2005-2020). We also found that the seismic quiescence occurred without significant crustal movement during the studied period. Our implication from this finding is that magma source, which caused magma intrusion into the Izu-Tobu region, is in a transition phase, becoming less active, compared with the magma source during the 1970s-1990s.</description>

      <title>Svalbard Marginal Ice Zone 2024 Campaign -- Cruise Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupling of weather, sea-ice, ocean, and wave forecasting systems has been a long-standing research focus to improve Arctic forecasting system and their realism and is also a priority of international initiatives such as the WMO research project PCAPS. The goal of the Svalbard Marginal Ice Zone 2024 Campaign was to observe and better understand the complex interplay between atmosphere, waves, and sea-ice in the winter Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) in order to advance the predictive skill of coupled Arctic forecasting systems. The main objective has been to set up a network of observations with a spatial distribution that allows for a representative comparison between in situ observations and gridded model data. The observed variables include air and surface temperature, sea-ice drift, and wave energy spectra. With the support of the Norwegian Coast Guard, we participated in the research cruise with KV Svalbard from 4. April - 21.April 2024. In total 34 buoys were deployed in the Marginal Ice Zone north of the Svalbard Archipelago. The first part of the report describes the instruments and their calibration (Section 2), and the second part briefly describes the weather, sea ice, and wave conditions during the campaign.</description>

      <title>A sufficient condition for inviscid shear instability: Hurdle theorem and its application to alternating jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08027v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple method to identify unstable parameter regions in general inviscid unidirectional shear flow stability problems. The theory is applicable to a wide range of basic flows, including those that are non-monotonic. We illustrate the method using a model of Jupiter's alternating jet streams based on the quasi-geostrophic equation. The main result is that the flow is unstable if there is an interval in the flow domain for which the reciprocal Rossby Mach number (a quantity defined in terms of the zonal flow and potential vorticity distribution), surpasses a certain threshold or `hurdle'. The hurdle height approaches unity when we can take the hurdle width to greatly exceeds the atmosphere's intrinsic deformation length, as holds on gas giants. In this case, the Kelvin-Arnol'd sufficient condition of stability accurately detects instability. These results improve the theoretical framework for explaining the stable maintenance of Jupiter and Saturn's jets over decadal timescales.</description>
