      <title>Field-assisted self-assembly at fluid-fluid interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-assembly of particles at fluid-fluid interfaces is a ubiquitous phenomenon. Over the years scientists have tried to modulate and direct self-assembly processes using various intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. This review article presents the situation where self-assembly of mesoscopic particles at interfaces is controlled by external fields, namely, electric, and magnetic fields. By controlling the shape and size of the particles, the attractive forces can be tuned. Moreover, strength and direction of external fields also play important roles in deciding the final assembled structure. These systems hold great potential in novel designs for drug delivery, catalysis and other transport phenomena</description>

      <title>Hermitian and non-Hermitian topology in active matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-propulsion is a quintessential aspect of biological systems, which can induce nonequilibrium phenomena that have no counterparts in passive systems. Motivated by biophysical interest together with recent advances in experimental techniques, active matter has been a rapidly developing field in physics. Meanwhile, over the past few decades, topology has played a crucial role to understand certain robust properties appearing in condensed matter systems. For instance, the nontrivial topology of band structures leads to the notion of topological insulators, where one can find robust gapless edge modes protected by the bulk band topology. We here review recent progress in an interdisciplinary area of research at the intersection of these two fields. Specifically, we give brief introductions to active matter and band topology in Hermitian systems, and then explain how the notion of band topology can be extended to nonequilibrium (and thus non-Hermitian) systems including active matter. We review recent studies that have demonstrated the intimate connections between active matter and topological materials, where exotic topological phenomena that are unfeasible in passive systems have been found. A possible extension of the band topology to nonlinear systems is also briefly discussed. Active matter can thus provide an ideal playground to explore topological phenomena in qualitatively new realms beyond conservative linear systems.</description>

      <title>When Knots are Plectonemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport of DNA polymers through nanoscale pores is central to many biological processes, from bacterial gene exchange to viral infection. In single-molecule nanopore sensing, the detection of nucleic acid and protein analytes relies on the passage of a long biopolymer through a nanoscale aperture. Understanding the dynamics of polymer translocation through nanopores, especially the relation between ionic current signal and polymer conformations is thus essential for the successful identification of targets. Here, by analyzing ionic current traces of dsDNA translocation, we reveal that features up to now uniquely associated with knots are instead different structural motifs: plectonemes. By combining experiments and simulations, we demonstrate that such plectonemes form because of the solvent flow that induces rotation of the helical DNA fragment in the nanopore, causing torsion propagation outwards from the pore. Molecular dynamic simulations reveal that plectoneme initialization is dominated by the applied torque while the translocation time and size of the plectonemes depend on the coupling of torque and pulling force, a mechanism that might also be relevant for in vivo DNA organization. Experiments with nicked DNA constructs show that the number of plectonemes depends on the rotational constraints of the translocating molecules. Thus, our work introduces plectonemes as essential structural features that must be considered for accurate analysis of polymer transport in the nanopore.</description>

      <title>Propulsion Contribution from Individual Filament in Flagellar Bundle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flagellated microorganisms overcome the low-Reynolds-number time reversibility by rotating helical flagella. For peritrichous bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, the randomly distributed flagellar filaments align along the same direction to form a bundle, facilitating complex locomotive strategies. To understand the process of flagella bundling, especially the propulsion force, we develop a multi-functional macroscopic experimental system and employ advanced numerical simulations for verification. Flagella arrangements and phase differences between helices are investigated, revealing the variation in propulsion contribution from the individual helix. Numerically, we build a time-dependent model to match the bundling process and study the influence of hydrodynamic interactions. Surprisingly, it is found that the total propulsion generated by a bundle of two filaments is constant at various phase differences between the helices. However, the difference between the propulsion from each helix is significantly affected by the phase difference, and only one of the helices is responsible for the total propulsion at a phase difference equals to pi. Through our experimental and computational results, we provide a new model considering the propulsion contribution of each filament to better understand microbial locomotion mechanisms, especially on the wobbling behavior of the cell. Our work also sheds light on the design and control of artificial microswimmers.</description>

      <title>Defect interactions in the non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computational study of the pairwise interactions between defects in the recently introduced non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard model. The evolution of a defect pair exhibits dependence upon their corresponding topological charges, initial separation, and the non-reciprocity coupling constant $\alpha$. We find that the stability of isolated topologically neutral targets significantly affects the pairwise defect interactions. At large separations, defect interactions are negligible and a defect pair is stable. When positioned in relatively close proximity, a pair of oppositely charged spirals or targets merge to form a single target. At low $\alpha$, like-charged spirals form rotating bound pairs, which are however torn apart by spontaneously formed targets at high $\alpha$. Similar preference for charged or neutral solutions is also seen for a spiral target pair where the spiral dominates at low $\alpha$, but concedes to the target at large $\alpha$. Our work sheds light on the complex phenomenology of non-reciprocal active matter systems when their collective dynamics involves topological defects.</description>

      <title>Trapped Stresses in Simple Yield Stress Materials Influence Their Rheology and Cause Delayed Yielding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simple yield stress materials are composed of soft particles, bubbles, or droplets with purely repulsive forces. The constituent elements are typically too large to undergo thermal fluctuations, suggesting that the material internal structure, and therefore its rheology, should not change over time. Here, we explore the rheology of Carbopol, a prototypical simple yield stress material, and reveal that gradual, spontaneous relaxation of residual stresses, induced when loading the sample into rheometer, results in a small yet significant reduction in the material dynamic yield stress. This relaxation process can lead to a non-monotonic creep deformation rate under constant stress, culminating in delayed fluidization of the material. These findings highlight that yield stress is not merely a static material property but a function of the material internal stress state.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Water Behavior and Its Impact on Adsorption: A case study with CNTs and Diclofenac</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water is a fundamental component of life, playing a critical role in regulating metabolic processes and facilitating the dissolution and transport of essential molecules. However, the presence of emerging contaminants, such as pharmaceuticals, poses significant challenges to water quality and safety. Nanomaterials-based technologies arise as a promising tool to remove those contaminants from water. Nevertheless, interfacial water plays a major role in the adsorption of chemical compounds in the nanomaterials - as it plays in biological processes such as protein folding, enzyme activity, and drug delivery. To understand this role, in this study we employ Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the adsorption dynamics of potassium diclofenac (K-DCF) on single-walled (SWCNT) and double-walled (DWCNT) carbon nanotubes, considering both dry and wet conditions. Our findings reveal that the structuring of water molecules around CNTs creates hydration layers that significantly influence the accessibility of active sites and the interaction strength between contaminants and adsorbents. Our analysis indicates higher energy barriers for adsorption in DWCNTs compared to SWCNTs, which is attributed to stronger water-surface interactions. This research highlights the importance of understanding nanoscale water behavior for optimizing the design and functionality of nanomaterials for water purification. These findings can guide the development of more efficient and selective nanomaterials, enhancing contaminant removal and ensuring safer water resources, while also contributing to a deeper understanding of fundamental biological interactions.</description>

      <title>Phase separation of chemokinetic active particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) is a well-studied nonequilibrium collective phenomenon observed in active particles. Recently, there has been growing interest in how coupling the self-propulsion of active particles to chemical degrees of freedom affects MIPS. Previous studies have shown that incorporating chemotaxis and the production or consumption of chemicals by active particles results in various pattern formations, such as arrested phase separation and traveling waves. In this study, we demonstrate that similar phenomena can be induced when active particles consume chemicals and exhibit chemokinesis, where higher chemical concentrations enhance self-propulsion without causing alignment with the chemical gradient. We discover that MIPS is intensified if chemical consumption is proportional to particle density but is suppressed if chemical consumption is closely tied to particle motion. This leads to a wider range of collective behaviors, including arrested phase separation and oscillating patterns. Our findings are based on a hydrodynamic theory derived from a particle-based model via standard methods.</description>

      <title>Structural relaxation and delayed yielding in cyclically sheared Cu-Zr metallic glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The yielding transition, structural relaxation, and mechanical properties of metallic glasses subjected to repeated loading are examined using molecular dynamics simulations. We consider a poorly-annealed Cu-Zr amorphous alloy periodically deformed in a wide range of strain amplitudes at room temperature. It is found that low-amplitude cyclic loading leads to a logarithmic decay of the potential energy, and lower energy states are attained when the strain amplitude approaches a critical point from below. Moreover, the potential energy after several thousand loading cycles is a linear function of the peak value of the stress overshoot during startup continuous shear deformation of the annealed sample. We show that the process of structural relaxation involves collective, irreversible rearrangements of groups of atoms whose spatial extent is most pronounced at the initial stage of loading and higher strain amplitudes. At the critical amplitude, the glass becomes mechanically annealed for a number of transient cycles and then yields via formation of a shear band. The yielding transition is clearly marked by abrupt changes in the potential energy, storage modulus, and fraction of atoms with large nonaffine displacements.</description>

      <title>Lattice polymers near a permeable interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the localisation of lattice polymer models near a permeable interface in two dimensions. Localisation can arise due to an interaction between the polymer and the interface, and can be altered by a preference for the bulk solvent on one side or by the application of a force to manipulate the polymer. Different combinations of these three effects give slightly different statistical mechanical behaviours. The canonical lattice model of polymers is the self-avoiding walk which we mainly study with Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the phase diagram and critical phenomena. For comparison, a solvable directed walk version is also defined and the phase diagrams are compared for each case. We find broad agreement between the two models, and most minor differences can be understood as due to the different entropic contributions. In the limit where the bulk solvent on one side is overwhelmingly preferred we see how the localisation transition transforms to the adsorption transition; the permeable interface becomes effectively an impermeable surface.</description>

      <title>The structure-dynamics feedback mechanism governs the glassy dynamics in epithelial monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The glassy dynamics in confluent epithelial monolayers is crucial for several biological processes, such as wound healing, embryogenesis, cancer progression, etc. Several experiments have indicated that, unlike particulate systems, the glassy dynamics in these systems correlates with the static properties and shows a readily-found sub-Arrhenius relaxation. However, whether the statics-dynamics correlation is only qualitative or can provide quantitative predictions and what leads to the sub-Arrhenius relaxation remains unclear. We apply a particular analytical theory of glassy dynamics, the mode-coupling theory (MCT) that predicts dynamics using static properties alone as input, to the confluent systems. We demonstrate the remarkable applicability of MCT in simulations of the Vertex model and experiments on Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells and show the quantitative nature of the structure-dynamics correlation in these systems. Our results elucidate that the structure-dynamics feedback mechanism of MCT, and not the barrier crossing mechanism, dominates the glassy dynamics in these systems where the relaxation time diverges as a power law with a universal exponent of $3/2$. This slower-than-exponential divergence naturally explains the sub-Arrhenius relaxation dynamics in these systems. The quantitative nature of the structure-dynamics correlation also suggests the possibility of describing various complex biological processes, such as cell division and apoptosis, via the static properties of the systems, such as cell shape or shape variability.</description>

      <title>Force Propagation in Active Cytoskeletal Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04217v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In biological systems, molecular-scale forces and motions are pivotal for enabling processes like motility, shape change, and replication. These forces and motions are organized, amplified, and transmitted across macroscopic scales by active materials such as the cytoskeleton, which drives micron-scale cellular movement and re-organization. Despite the integral role of active materials, understanding how molecular-scale interactions alter macroscopic structure and force propagation remains elusive. This knowledge gap presents challenges to the harnessing and regulation of such dynamics across diverse length scales. Here, we demonstrate how mediating the bundling of microtubules can shift active matter between a global force-transmitting phase and a local force-dissipating phase. A fivefold increase in microtubule effective length results in the transition from local to global phase with a hundredfold increase in velocity autocorrelation. Through theory and simulation, we identify signatures of a percolation-driven transition between the two phases. This provides evidence for how force propagation can be generated when local molecular interactions reach a sufficient length scale. We show that force propagation in the active matter system enables material transport. Consequently, we demonstrate that the global phase is capable of facilitating millimeter-scale human cell transport and manipulation, as well as powering the movement of aqueous droplets. These findings underscore the potential for designing active materials capable of force organization and transmission. Our results lay the foundation for further exploration into the organization and propagation of forces/stresses in biological systems, thereby paving the way for the engineering of active materials in synthetic biology and soft robotics.</description>

      <title>Clustering of negative topological charge precedes plastic failure in 3D glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15359v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deformation mechanism in amorphous solids subjected to external shear remains poorly understood because of the absence of well-defined topological defects mediating the plastic deformation. The notion of soft spots has emerged as a useful tool to characterize the onset of irreversible rearrangements and plastic flow, but these entities are not clearly defined in terms of geometry and topology. In this study, we unveil the phenomenology of recently discovered, precisely defined topological defects governing the microscopic mechanical and yielding behavior of a model 3D glass under shear deformation. We identify the existence of vortex-like and anti-vortex-like topological defects within the 3D non-affine displacement field. The number density of these defects exhibits a significant anti-correlation with the plastic events, with defect proliferation-annihilation cycles matching the alternation of elastic-like segments and catastrophic plastic drops, respectively. Furthermore, we observe collective annihilation of these point-like defects via plastic events, with large local topological charge fluctuations in the vicinity of regions that feature strong non-affine displacements. We reveal that plastic yielding is driven by several large sized clusters of net negative topological charge, the massive annihilation of which triggers the onset of plastic flow. These findings suggest a geometric and topological characterization of soft spots and pave the way for the mechanistic understanding of topological defects as mediators of plastic deformation in glassy materials.</description>

      <title>Rheo-SINDy: Finding a Constitutive Model from Rheological Data for Complex Fluids Using Sparse Identification for Nonlinear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14980v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rheology plays a pivotal role in understanding the flow behavior of fluids by discovering governing equations that relate deformation and stress, known as constitutive equations. Despite the importance of these equations, current methods for deriving them lack a systematic methodology, often relying on sense of physics and incurring substantial costs. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel method named Rheo-SINDy, which employs the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm for discovering constitutive models from rheological data. Rheo-SINDy was applied to five distinct scenarios, four with well-established constitutive equations and one without predefined equations. Our results demonstrate that Rheo-SINDy successfully identified accurate models for the known constitutive equations and derived physically plausible approximate models for the scenario without established equations. Notably, the identified approximate models can accurately reproduce nonlinear shear rheological properties, especially at steady state, including shear thinning. These findings validate the robustness of Rheo-SINDy in handling data complexities and underscore its efficacy as a tool for advancing the development of data-driven approaches in rheology.</description>

      <title>Impact of non-reciprocal interactions on colloidal self-assembly with tunable anisotropy</title>

Abstract: Non-reciprocal (NR) effective interactions violating Newton's third law occur in many biological systems, but can also be engineered in synthetic, colloidal systems. Recent research has shown that such NR interactions can have tremendous effects on the overall collective behaviour and pattern formation, but can also influence aggregation processes on the particle scale. Here we focus on the impact of non-reciprocity on the self-assembly of an (originally passive) colloidal system with anisotropic interactions whose character is tunable by external fields. In the absence of non-reciprocity, that is, under equilibrium conditions, the colloids form aggregates with extremely long life times [Kogler et al., Soft Matter 11, 7356 (2015)], indicating kinetic trapping. Here we study, based on Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulations in 2D, a NR version of this model consisting of two species with reciprocal isotropic, but NR anisotropic interactions. We find that NR induces an effective propulsion of particle pairs and small aggregates forming at initial stages of self-assembly, an indication of the NR-induced non-equilibrium. The shape and stability of these initial clusters strongly depends on the degree of anisotropy. At longer times we find, for weak NR interactions, large (even system-spanning) clusters where single particles can escape and enter at the boundaries, in stark contrast to the small rigid aggregates appearing at the same time in the passive case. In this sense, weak NR shortcuts the aggregation. Increasing the degree of NR (and thus, propulsion), we even observe large-scale phase separation if the interactions are weakly anisotropic. In contrast, system with strong NR and anisotropy remain essentially disordered. Overall, NR interactions are shown to destabilize the rigid aggregates interrupting self-assembly in the passive case, helping the system to overcome kinetic barriers.</description>
