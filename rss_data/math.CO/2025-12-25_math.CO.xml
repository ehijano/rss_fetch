      <title>Is there a smooth lattice polytope which does not have the integer decomposition property?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Tadao Oda's famous question on lattice polytopes which was originally posed at Oberwolfach in 1997 and, although simple to state, has remained unanswered. The question is motivated by a discussion of the two-dimensional case - including a proof of Pick's Theorem, which elegantly relates the area of a lattice polygon to the number of lattice points it contains in its interior and on its boundary.</description>

      <title>Total colouring of circulant graphs $C_{n}(1, 3)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Total colouring of 4-regular circulant graphs is an interesting but challenging topic, and has attracted much attention. However, it still remains an open question to determine the total chromatic numbers of $C_{n}(1, 3)$, a subclass of 4-regular circulant graphs, even after many efforts. In this paper, we investigate the total colouring of these graphs and determine their total chromatic numbers. Our results show that the total chromatic numbers of $C_{n}(1, 3)$ are 6 for $n=7,8,12,13,17$, and 5 for all others.</description>

      <title>Spectral extremal problems for $(a,b,k)$-critical and fractional $(a,b,k)$-critical graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A factor of a graph is essentially a specific type spanning subgraph. The study of characterizing the existence of $[a, b]$-factors based on eigenvalue conditions can be traced back to the work of Brouwer and Haemers (2005) on perfect matchings. With the advancement of graphs factor theory, the related spectral extremal problems, particularly the study of $[a,b]$-factors and fractional $[a,b]$-factors, have been widely studied by scholars. Our work is motivated by research related to the $[a,b]$-factors and fractional $[a,b]$-factors, and explores their generalizations: $(a,b,k)$-critical graphs and fractional $(a,b,k)$-critical graphs. A graph $G$ is called an $(a,b,k)$-critical (a fractional $(a,b,k)$-critical) graph if after deleting any $k$ vertices of $G$ the remaining graph of $G$ has an $[a,b]$-factor (a fractional $[a,b]$-factor). In this paper, we establish spectral radius conditions for a graph to be $(a,b,k)$-critical or fractional $(a,b,k)$-critical. When $k=0$, our results also resolve some open problems concerning $[a, b]$-factors and fractional $[a, b]$-factors.</description>

      <title>Categorification of Chromatic, Dichromatic and Penrose Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses ways to categorify chromatic, dichromatic and Penrose polynomials, including categorifications of integer evaluations of chromatic polynomials.
  We show that with an appropriate choice of variables the coefficients of the Potts partition function at different energy levels are given by Euler characteristics of appropriate parts of a bigraded homology theory associated with the model. In the case of the dichromatic polynomial for graphs, we show that the two variable polynomial can be seen as a sum of powers of one variable multiplied by coefficients that are "impropriety" coloring polynomials for the underlying graph. An impropriety polynomial $C_{G}^{i}(n)$ counts the number of colorings in $n$ colors of the graph that are not proper at a given number $i$ of edges in the graph. The last section of the paper categorifies coloring evaluations rather than coloring polynomials. We then obtain a range of possible chain complexes and homology theories such that the chromatic evaluation is equal to the Euler characteristic of the homology. The freedom of choice in making such chain complexes is related to possible associative algebra structures on the set of colors.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the degenerate three-variable Hermite-based Apostol{Frobenius-type poly-Genocchi polynomials by integrating the modified degenerate polyexponential function with three-variable Hermite polynomials and Frobenius polynomials. We investigate several fundamental properties of these polynomials and derive a variety of identities and formulas, including explicit formulas, addition formula and expression in polynomial form. Moreover, we establish meaningful connections between these polynomials and the r-Whitney numbers of both the first and second kinds.</description>

      <title>Extending Results on Wilf-Equivalence of Partial Shuffles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2020, Bloom and Sagan defined subsets of the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$ called partial shuffles, and proved a formula for the Schur expansion of the pattern quasisymmetric function associated with a partial shuffle. In their proof, they establish that any two partial shuffles of the same size are Wilf-equivalent. We give an alternative proof of this fact, using an iterative approach. We also show that Wilf-equivalence is preserved on including a decreasing pattern in partial shuffles, and we provide some enumerative results for avoidance classes whose bases consist of a partial shuffle and a decreasing permutation.</description>

      <title>Linear varieties and matroids with applications to the Cullis' determinant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $V$ be a vector space of rectangular $n\times k$ matrices annihilating the Cullis' determinant. We show that $\dim(V) \le (n-1)k$, extending Dieudonn{\'{e}}'s result on the dimension of vector spaces of square matrices annihilating the ordinary determinant.
  Furthermore, for certain values of $n$ and $k$, we explicitly describe such vector spaces of maximal dimension. Namely, we establish that if $k$ is odd, $n \ge k + 2$ and $\dim(V) = (n-1)k$, then $V$ is equal to the space of all $n\times k$ matrices $X$ such that alternating row sum of $X$ is equal to zero.
  Our proofs rely on the following observations from the matroid theory that have an independent interest. First, we provide a notion of matroid corresponding to a given linear variety. Second, we prove that if the linear variety is transformed by projections and restrictions, then the behaviour of the corresponding matroid is expressed in the terms of matroid contraction and restriction. Third, we establish that if $M$ is a matroid, $I^*$ its coindependent set $M|S$ and its restriction on a set $S$, then the union of $I^*\setminus S$ with every cobase of $M|S$ is coindependent set of $M$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we give explicit error bounds for the asymptotic expansion of the shifted distinct partition function $q(n +s)$ for any nonnegative integer $s$. Then based on this refined asymptotic formula, we give the exact thresholds of $n$ for the inequalities derived from the invariants of the quartic binary form, the double Tur\'{a}n inequalities, the Laguerre inequalities and their corresponding companion versions.</description>

      <title>Choosability of multipartite hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $k$-uniform hypergraph (or $k$-graph) $H = (V, E)$ is $k$-partite if $V$ can be partitioned into $k$ sets $V_1, \ldots, V_k$ such that each edge in $E$ contains precisely one vertex from each $V_i$. We show that $k$-partite $k$-graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$ are $q$-choosable for $q \geq \left(\frac{4}{5}(k-1 + o(1))\Delta/\log \Delta\right)^{1/(k-1)}$. Our proof yields an efficient randomized algorithm for finding such a coloring, which shows that the conjectured algorithmic barrier for coloring pseudorandom $k$-graphs does not apply to $k$-partite $k$-graphs.</description>

      <title>Perfect codes and regular sets in vertex-transitive graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subset \( C \) of the vertex set \( V \) of a graph \( \Gamma = (V,E) \) is termed an $(r,s)$-regular set if each vertex in \( C \) is adjacent to exactly \( r \) other vertices in \( C \), while each vertex not in \( C \) is adjacent to precisely \( s \) vertices in \( C \). A specific case, known as a $(0,1)$-regular set, is referred to as a perfect code. In this paper, we will delve into $(r,s)$-regular sets in the context of vertex-transitive graphs. It is noteworthy that any vertex-transitive graph can be represented as a coset graph \( \Cos(G,H,U) \). When examining a group \( G \) and a subgroup \( H \) of \( G \), a subgroup \( A \) that encompasses \( H \) is identified as an $(r,s)$-regular set related to the pair \( (G,H) \) if there exists a coset graph \( \Cos(G,H,U) \) such that the set of left cosets of \( H \) in \( A \) forms an $(r,s)$-regular set within this graph. In this paper, we present both a necessary and sufficient condition for determining when a normal subgroup \( A \) that includes \( H \) as a normal subgroup qualifies as an $(r,s)$-regular set for the pair \( (G,H) \). Furthermore, if \( A \) is a normal subgroup of \( G \) containing \( H \), we establish a relationship between \( A \) being a perfect code of \( (G,H) \) and the quotient \( N_A(H)/H \) being a perfect code of \(( N_G(H)/H, {1_{N_{G}(H)/H}}) \).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a non-negative integer $k$, a vertex cut in a graph is $k$-degenerate if it induces a $k$-degenerate subgraph. We show that a graph of order $n$ at least $2k+2$ without a $k$-degenerate cut has the size at least $\frac{1}{2}\left(k+\Omega\left(\sqrt{k}\right)\right)n$ and that a graph of order $n$ at least $5$ without a $2$-degenerate cut has the size at least $\frac{27n-35}{10}$. For $k\geq 2$, we show that a connected graph $G$ of order $n$ at least $k+6$ and size $m$ at most $\frac{k+3}{2}n+\frac{k-1}{2}$ has a minimum $k$-degenerate cut.</description>

      <title>Independence Complexes of Hexagonal Grid Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The independence complex of a graph is a simplicial complex whose faces correspond to the independent sets of $G$. While independence complexes have been studied extensively for many graph classes, including square grid graphs, relatively little is known about planar hexagonal grid graphs.
  In this article, we study the topology of the independence complexes of hexagonal grid graphs $H_{1 \times m \times n}$. For $ m=1, 2, 3$ and $n\geq 1$, we determine their homotopy types. In particular, we show that the independence complex of the hexagonal line tiling $H_{1 \times 1 \times n}$ is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of two $n$-spheres, and for $m=2$ and $m=3$, we obtain recursive descriptions that completely determine the spheres appearing in the homotopy type. Our proofs rely on link and deletion operations, the fold lemma, and a detailed analysis of induced subgraphs.</description>

      <title>Towards a General Framework for Predicting and Explaining the Hardness of Graph-based Combinatorial Optimization Problems using Machine Learning and Association Rule Mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces GCO-HPIF, a general machine-learning-based framework to predict and explain the computational hardness of combinatorial optimization problems that can be represented on graphs. The framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, a dataset is created comprising problem-agnostic graph features and hardness classifications of problem instances. Machine-learning-based classification algorithms are trained to map graph features to hardness categories. In the second stage, the framework explains the predictions using an association rule mining algorithm. Additionally, machine-learning-based regression models are trained to predict algorithmic computation times. The GCO-HPIF framework was applied to a dataset of 3287 maximum clique problem instances compiled from the COLLAB, IMDB, and TWITTER graph datasets using five state-of-the-art algorithms, namely three exact branch-and-bound-based algorithms (Gurobi, CliSAT, and MOMC) and two graph-neural-network-based algorithms (EGN and HGS). The framework demonstrated excellent performance in predicting instance hardness, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.9921, a minority-class F1 score of 0.878, and an ROC-AUC score of 0.9083 using only three graph features. The best association rule found by the FP-Growth algorithm for explaining the hardness predictions had a support of 0.8829 for hard instances and an overall accuracy of 87.64 percent, underscoring the framework's usefulness for both prediction and explanation. Furthermore, the best-performing regression model for predicting computation times achieved a percentage RMSE of 5.12 and an R2 value of 0.991.</description>

      <title>On the Girth of Graph Lifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The size of the smallest $k$-regular graph of girth at least $g$ is denoted by the well-studied function $n(k,g)$. We introduce an analogous function $n(H,g)$, defined as the smallest size graph of girth at least $g$ that is a lift (or cover) of the, possibly non-regular, graph $H$. We prove that the two main combinatorial bounds on $n(k,g)$ -- the Moore lower bound and the Erd\"{o}s-Sachs upper bound -- carry over to the new lift setting.
  We also consider two other functions: i) The smallest size graph of girth at least $g$ sharing a universal cover with $H$. We prove that it is the same as $n(H,g)$ up to a multiplicative constant. ii) The smallest size graph of girth least $g$ with a prescribed degree distribution. We discuss this known generalization and argue that the new suggested definitions are superior.
  We conclude with experimental results for a specific base graph, followed by conjectures and open problems for future research.</description>

      <title>Necklaces over a group with identity product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08937v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address two variants of the classical necklace counting problem from enumerative combinatorics. In both cases, we fix a finite group $\mathcal{G}$ and a positive integer $n$. In the first variant, we count the ``identity-product $n$-necklaces'' -- that is, the orbits of $n$-tuples $\left(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\right) \in \mathcal{G}^n$ that satisfy $a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n = 1$ under cyclic rotation. In the second, we count the orbits of all $n$-tuples $\left(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\right) \in \mathcal{G}^n$ under cyclic rotation and left multiplication (i.e., the operation of $\mathcal{G}$ on $\mathcal{G}^n$ given by $h \cdot \left(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\right) = \left(ha_1, ha_2, \ldots, ha_n\right)$). We prove bijectively that both answers are the same, and express them as a sum over divisors of $n$.
  Consequently, we generalize the first problem to $n$-necklaces whose product of entries lies in a given subset of $\mathcal{G}$ (closed under conjugation), and we connect a particular case to the enumeration of irreducible polynomials over a finite field with given degree and second-highest coefficient $0$.</description>

      <title>Permanental Analog of the Rank-Nullity Theorem for Symmetric Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01344v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rank of an n x n matrix A is equal to the size of its largest square submatrix with a nonzero determinant, and it can be computed in O(n^2.37) time. Analogously, the size of the largest square submatrix with nonzero permanent is defined as the permanental rank. Computing the permanent or the coefficients of the permanental polynomial is #P-complete. The permanental nullity is defined as the multiplicity of zero as a root of the permanental polynomial. We establish a permanental analog of the rank-nullity theorem, showing that the sum of the permanental rank and the permanental nullity equals n for symmetric nonnegative matrices, positive semidefinite matrices, and adjacency matrices of balanced signed graphs. Using this theorem, we can compute the permanental nullity for symmetric nonnegative matrices and adjacency matrices of balanced signed graphs in polynomial time. For symmetric matrices with entries in {0, plus or minus 1}, we also provide a complete characterization of when the permanental rank-nullity identity holds.</description>

      <title>Awesome graph parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, we denote by $\alpha(G)$ the size of a maximum independent set and by $\omega(G)$ the size of a maximum clique in $G$. Our paper lies on the edge of two lines of research, related to $\alpha$ and $\omega$, respectively. One of them studies $\alpha$-variants of graph parameters, such as $\alpha$-treewidth or $\alpha$-degeneracy. The second line deals with graph classes where some parameters are bounded by a function of $\omega(G)$. A famous example of this type is the family of $\chi$-bounded classes, where the chromatic number $\chi(G)$ is bounded by a function of $\omega(G)$.
  A Ramsey-type argument implies that if the $\alpha$-variant of a graph parameter $\rho$ is bounded by a constant in a class $\mathcal{G}$, then $\rho$ is bounded by a function of $\omega$ in $\mathcal{G}$. If the reverse implication also holds, we say that $\rho$ is awesome. Otherwise, we say that $\rho$ is awful. In the present paper, we identify a number of awesome and awful graph parameters, derive some algorithmic applications of awesomeness, and propose a number of open problems related to these notions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_d$ be real numbers, and let $S$ be the set of integers $s$ so that $||\alpha_i s||_{\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}}&gt;\delta$ for some $i$ and some fixed $\delta&gt;0$. We prove $S$ is not \enquote{$2$-large}, i.e. there is a $2$-coloring of $\mathbb{N}$ that avoids arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions with common differences in $S$.</description>

      <title>The intersection cohomology Hodge module of toric varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04767v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Hodge filtration of the intersection cohomology Hodge module for toric varieties. More precisely, we study the cohomology sheaves of the graded de Rham complex of the intersection cohomology Hodge module and give a precise formula relating it with the stalks of the intersection cohomology as a constructible complex. The main idea is to use the Ishida complex in order to compute the higher direct images of the sheaf of reflexive differentials.</description>

      <title>$k$-Homogeneous Equiangular Tight Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider geometric and combinatorial characterizations of equiangular tight frames (ETFs), with the former concerning homogeneity of the vector and line symmetry groups and the latter the matroid structure. We introduce the concept of the bender of a frame, which is the collection of short circuits, which in turn are the dependent subsets of frame vectors of minimum size. We also show that ETFs with $k$-homogeneous line symmetry groups have benders which are $k$-designs. Paley ETFs are a known class of ETFs constructed using number theory. We determine the line and vector symmetry groups of all Paley ETFs and show that they are $2$-homogeneous. We additionally characterize all $k$-homogeneous ETFs for $k\geq 3$. Finally, we revisit David Larson's AMS Memoirs \emph{Frames, Bases, and Group Representations} coauthored with Deguang Han and \emph{Wandering Vectors for Unitary Systems and Orthogonal Wavelets} coauthored with Xingde Dai with a modern eye and focus on finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>p-complete square-free Word-representation of Word-representable Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A graph G(V, E) is word-representable if there exists a word w over V such that distinct letters x and y alternate in w iff $xy \in E$. We introduce p-complete squares and p-complete square-free word-representable graphs. A word is p-complete square-free if no induced subword over any subset of letters contains a square XX with $|X| \ge p$. A graph is p-complete square-free if it admits such a representation. We define p-complete square-free uniform word-representations and study their properties. We show that any graph admitting such a representation forbids Kp as an induced subgraph and that the recognition problem is NP-hard for arbitrary p. For p=1 and 2, we give complete characterisations. We prove that every $K_p$-free circle graph admits a p-complete square-free uniform representation and that any 3-complete square-free uniform word-representable graph has representation number at most three. We present a constructive method for generating new examples for p=3.</description>

      <title>New Obstacles to Multiple Recurrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21680v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there is a set which is not a set of multiple recurrence despite being a set of recurrence for nil-Bohr sets. This answers Huang, Shao, and Ye's \enquote{higher-order} version of Katznelson's Question on Bohr recurrence and topological recurrence in the negative. Equivalently, we construct a set $S$ so that there is a finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$ without three-term arithmetic progressions with common differences in $S$, but so that $S$ lacks the usual polynomial obstacles to arithmetic progressions.</description>

      <title>Freidel-Maillet type equations on fused K-matrices over the positive part of $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The positive part $U_q^+$ of the quantized enveloping algebra $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$ has a reflection equation presentation of Freidel-Maillet type, due to Baseilhac 2021. This presentation involves a K-matrix of dimension $2 \times 2$. Under an embedding of $U_q^+$ into a $q$-shuffle algebra due to Rosso 1995, this K-matrix can be written in closed form using a PBW basis for $U_q^+$ due to Terwilliger 2019. This PBW basis, together with two PBW bases due to Damiani 1993 and Beck 1994, can be obtain from a uniform approach by Ruan 2025. Following a natural fusion technique, we will construct fused K-matrices of arbitary meaningful dimension in closed form using the uniform approach. We will also show that any pair of these fused K-matrices satisfy Freidel-Maillet type equations.</description>
