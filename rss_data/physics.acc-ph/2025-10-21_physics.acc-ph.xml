      <title>Testing the DAE LLRF system with a PIP-II SSR2 Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PIP-II linac is an international collaboration project with in kind contributions of key subsystems from multiple countries including India (DAE). In the research and development phase of the project, the LLRF and resonance control systems were jointly developed by BARC and Fermilab and were delivered to Fermilab for testing and validation. Initial testing of the LLRF system was carried out using Fermilabs analog cavity emulator. Following successful emulator testing, the LLRF system was deployed at STC on a PIP-II 325 MHz SSR2 cavity. The cavity was operated in both SEL and GDR modes at a gradient of 5 MV/m. The results of the testing are presented here.</description>

      <title>TCLK Must Stay! CAMAC Must Go! How Does Fermilab Move Forward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current Timing System at Fermilab has been around for 40 years and currently relies on 7 CAMAC crates and over 100 CAMAC cards to produce the Tevatron Clock (TCLK). Thanks to the ingenuity of those before us, this has allowed Fermilab the flexibility to change the timing and Events for its accelerator as beamlines and projects have changed over the years. With the advent of the Proton Improvement Plan-II (PIP-II), the Timing System at Fermilab is being reimagined into a single chassis with even greater flexibility and functionality for decades to come while tackling the ever-challenging task of maintaining backwards compatibility.</description>

      <title>Probing Flying-Focus Wakefields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flying-focus wakefields, which can propagate with a tunable velocity along the optical axis, are promising solutions to electron dephasing in laser-wakefield accelerators. This is accomplished by a combination of spatio-temporal couplings and focusing with an axiparabola, a specialized optical element which produces a quasi-Bessel beam. If implemented, dephasingless acceleration would allow for a hitherto unachievable mixture of high acceleration gradients and long acceleration lengths. Here, we conduct an in-depth study of the structure and behavior of such a flying-focus wakefield, through a combination of direct imaging and simulations. We show the stability of the wakefield structures, explore how the wakefield evolves with changes of density, study the effects of ionization on the wakefield structure with a variety of gases, and analyze the importance of the focusing position. These insights shed light onto this novel wakefield regime and bring understanding that is important to the realization of dephasingless acceleration.</description>

      <title>FCC-ee Lessons from SuperKEKB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07448v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SuperKEKB has achieved significantly higher specific luminosity than its predecessor KEKB, and it has proven a much more sustainable machine. It has successfully demonstrated several key design elements of FCC-ee. The design luminosity has not yet been reached, however. This observation is often (mistakenly) used to put into question the reliability of the FCC-ee design luminosity. In this note we review the accomplishments, challenges and obstacles of SuperKEKB, and compare these with the FCC-ee design.</description>

      <title>Low-impedance stripline kicker for the transverse instability suppression system of the synchrotron radiation facility "SKIF" light source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Construction of the new fourth generation synchrotron radiation facility (SRF) "SKIF" near Novosibirsk is nearing completion. "SKIF" uniqueness is ultra-low 75 pm natural emittance at 400 mA beam current and 3 GeV beam energy.
  Collective effects (beam interaction with the vacuum chamber) are the main obstacles of achieving such emittance and beam current. To suppress these effects the storage ring will be equipped with a bunch-by-bunch feedback system. Important components of the feedback system are a stripline (fast) kicker and a beam position monitor.
  The paper describes design of the low-impedance stripline kicker for SRF "SKIF" storage ring, optimized for the manufacturing and for the uniformity of the imparted transverse kick. The kicker qualities such as S-parameters, imparted transverse momentum, transfer and beam impedances are presented. The chosen length of the stripline kicker allows its use as a beam position monitor.</description>

      <title>Diffraction by Circular and Triangular Apertures as a Diagnostic Tool of Twisted Matter Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study diffraction of twisted matter waves (electrons and light ions carrying orbital angular momentum $\ell/\hbar=0,\pm1,\pm2,\ldots$ by circular and triangular apertures. Within the scalar Kirchhoff-Fresnel framework, circular apertures preserve cylindrical symmetry and produce ringlike far-field profiles whose radii and widths depend on $|\ell|$ but are insensitive to its sign. In contrast, equilateral triangles break axial symmetry and yield structured patterns that encode both the magnitude and the sign of $\ell$. A transparent Fraunhofer mapping links detector coordinates to the Fourier plane, explaining the $(|\ell|+1)$-lobe rule and the sign-dependent rotation of the pattern. We validate these results for both ideal Bessel beams and localized Laguerre-Gaussian packets, and we cross-check them by split-step Fourier propagation of the time-dependent Schr"odinger equation. From these analyses we extract practical design rules (Fraunhofer distance, lattice pitch, detector sampling) relevant to OAM diagnostics with moderately relativistic electrons with $E_{\rm kin}\sim0.1$ to $5$ MeV and light ions with $E_{\rm kin}\sim0.1$ to $1$ MeV/u. Our results establish triangular diffraction as a simple, passive, and robust method for reading out the OAM content of structured quantum beams.</description>
