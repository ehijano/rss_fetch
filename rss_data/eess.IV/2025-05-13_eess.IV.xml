      <title>PC-SRGAN: Physically Consistent Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network for General Transient Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learning, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), has revolutionised Super Resolution (SR). However, generated images often lack physical meaningfulness, which is essential for scientific applications. Our approach, PC-SRGAN, enhances image resolution while ensuring physical consistency for interpretable simulations. PC-SRGAN significantly improves both the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio and the Structural Similarity Index Measure compared to conventional methods, even with limited training data (e.g., only 13% of training data required for SRGAN). Beyond SR, PC-SRGAN augments physically meaningful machine learning, incorporating numerically justified time integrators and advanced quality metrics. These advancements promise reliable and causal machine-learning models in scientific domains. A significant advantage of PC-SRGAN over conventional SR techniques is its physical consistency, which makes it a viable surrogate model for time-dependent problems. PC-SRGAN advances scientific machine learning, offering improved accuracy and efficiency for image processing, enhanced process understanding, and broader applications to scientific research. The source codes and data will be made publicly available at https://github.com/hasan-rakibul/PC-SRGAN upon acceptance of this paper.</description>

      <title>Reproducing and Improving CheXNet: Deep Learning for Chest X-ray Disease Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning for radiologic image analysis is a rapidly growing field in biomedical research and is likely to become a standard practice in modern medicine. On the publicly available NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset, containing X-ray images that are classified by the presence or absence of 14 different diseases, we reproduced an algorithm known as CheXNet, as well as explored other algorithms that outperform CheXNet's baseline metrics. Model performance was primarily evaluated using the F1 score and AUC-ROC, both of which are critical metrics for imbalanced, multi-label classification tasks in medical imaging. The best model achieved an average AUC-ROC score of 0.85 and an average F1 score of 0.39 across all 14 disease classifications present in the dataset.</description>

      <title>HistDiST: Histopathological Diffusion-based Stain Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining is the cornerstone of histopathology but lacks molecular specificity. While Immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides molecular insights, it is costly and complex, motivating H&amp;E-to-IHC translation as a cost-effective alternative. Existing translation methods are mainly GAN-based, often struggling with training instability and limited structural fidelity, while diffusion-based approaches remain underexplored. We propose HistDiST, a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) based framework for high-fidelity H&amp;E-to-IHC translation. HistDiST introduces a dual-conditioning strategy, utilizing Phikon-extracted morphological embeddings alongside VAE-encoded H&amp;E representations to ensure pathology-relevant context and structural consistency. To overcome brightness biases, we incorporate a rescaled noise schedule, v-prediction, and trailing timesteps, enforcing a zero-SNR condition at the final timestep. During inference, DDIM inversion preserves the morphological structure, while an eta-cosine noise schedule introduces controlled stochasticity, balancing structural consistency and molecular fidelity. Moreover, we propose Molecular Retrieval Accuracy (MRA), a novel pathology-aware metric leveraging GigaPath embeddings to assess molecular relevance. Extensive evaluations on MIST and BCI datasets demonstrate that HistDiST significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 28% improvement in MRA on the H&amp;E-to-Ki67 translation task, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing true IHC semantics.</description>

      <title>Missing Data Estimation for MR Spectroscopic Imaging via Mask-Free Deep Learning Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) is a powerful tool for non-invasive mapping of brain metabolites, providing critical insights into neurological conditions. However, its utility is often limited by missing or corrupted data due to motion artifacts, magnetic field inhomogeneities, or failed spectral fitting-especially in high resolution 3D acquisitions. To address this, we propose the first deep learning-based, mask-free framework for estimating missing data in MRSI metabolic maps. Unlike conventional restoration methods that rely on explicit masks to identify missing regions, our approach implicitly detects and estimates these areas using contextual spatial features through 2D and 3D U-Net architectures. We also introduce a progressive training strategy to enhance robustness under varying levels of data degradation. Our method is evaluated on both simulated and real patient datasets and consistently outperforms traditional interpolation techniques such as cubic and linear interpolation. The 2D model achieves an MSE of 0.002 and an SSIM of 0.97 with 20% missing voxels, while the 3D model reaches an MSE of 0.001 and an SSIM of 0.98 with 15% missing voxels. Qualitative results show improved fidelity in estimating missing data, particularly in metabolically heterogeneous regions and ventricular regions. Importantly, our model generalizes well to real-world datasets without requiring retraining or mask input. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness and broad applicability of mask-free deep learning for MRSI restoration, with strong potential for clinical and research integration.</description>

      <title>Uni-AIMS: AI-Powered Microscopy Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic solution for the intelligent recognition and automatic analysis of microscopy images. We developed a data engine that generates high-quality annotated datasets through a combination of the collection of diverse microscopy images from experiments, synthetic data generation and a human-in-the-loop annotation process. To address the unique challenges of microscopy images, we propose a segmentation model capable of robustly detecting both small and large objects. The model effectively identifies and separates thousands of closely situated targets, even in cluttered visual environments. Furthermore, our solution supports the precise automatic recognition of image scale bars, an essential feature in quantitative microscopic analysis. Building upon these components, we have constructed a comprehensive intelligent analysis platform and validated its effectiveness and practicality in real-world applications. This study not only advances automatic recognition in microscopy imaging but also ensures scalability and generalizability across multiple application domains, offering a powerful tool for automated microscopic analysis in interdisciplinary research.</description>

      <title>Whitened CLIP as a Likelihood Surrogate of Images and Captions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Likelihood approximations for images are not trivial to compute and can be useful in many applications. We examine the use of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) to assess the likelihood of images and captions. We introduce \textit{Whitened CLIP}, a novel transformation of the CLIP latent space via an invertible linear operation. This transformation ensures that each feature in the embedding space has zero mean, unit standard deviation, and no correlation with all other features, resulting in an identity covariance matrix. We show that the whitened embeddings statistics can be well approximated as a standard normal distribution, thus, the log-likelihood is estimated simply by the square Euclidean norm in the whitened embedding space. The whitening procedure is completely training-free and performed using a pre-computed whitening matrix, hence, is very fast. We present several preliminary experiments demonstrating the properties and applicability of these likelihood scores to images and captions.</description>

      <title>Skull stripping with purely synthetic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While many skull stripping algorithms have been developed for multi-modal and multi-species cases, there is still a lack of a fundamentally generalizable approach. We present PUMBA(PUrely synthetic Multimodal/species invariant Brain extrAction), a strategy to train a model for brain extraction with no real brain images or labels. Our results show that even without any real images or anatomical priors, the model achieves comparable accuracy in multi-modal, multi-species and pathological cases. This work presents a new direction of research for any generalizable medical image segmentation task.</description>

      <title>Metrics that matter: Evaluating image quality metrics for medical image generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating generative models for synthetic medical imaging is crucial yet challenging, especially given the high standards of fidelity, anatomical accuracy, and safety required for clinical applications. Standard evaluation of generated images often relies on no-reference image quality metrics when ground truth images are unavailable, but their reliability in this complex domain is not well established. This study comprehensively assesses commonly used no-reference image quality metrics using brain MRI data, including tumour and vascular images, providing a representative exemplar for the field. We systematically evaluate metric sensitivity to a range of challenges, including noise, distribution shifts, and, critically, localised morphological alterations designed to mimic clinically relevant inaccuracies. We then compare these metric scores against model performance on a relevant downstream segmentation task, analysing results across both controlled image perturbations and outputs from different generative model architectures. Our findings reveal significant limitations: many widely-used no-reference image quality metrics correlate poorly with downstream task suitability and exhibit a profound insensitivity to localised anatomical details crucial for clinical validity. Furthermore, these metrics can yield misleading scores regarding distribution shifts, e.g. data memorisation. This reveals the risk of misjudging model readiness, potentially leading to the deployment of flawed tools that could compromise patient safety. We conclude that ensuring generative models are truly fit for clinical purpose requires a multifaceted validation framework, integrating performance on relevant downstream tasks with the cautious interpretation of carefully selected no-reference image quality metrics.</description>

      <title>Multi-Plane Vision Transformer for Hemorrhage Classification Using Axial and Sagittal MRI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying brain hemorrhages from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a critical task for healthcare professionals. The diverse nature of MRI acquisitions with varying contrasts and orientation introduce complexity in identifying hemorrhage using neural networks. For acquisitions with varying orientations, traditional methods often involve resampling images to a fixed plane, which can lead to information loss. To address this, we propose a 3D multi-plane vision transformer (MP-ViT) for hemorrhage classification with varying orientation data. It employs two separate transformer encoders for axial and sagittal contrasts, using cross-attention to integrate information across orientations. MP-ViT also includes a modality indication vector to provide missing contrast information to the model. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated with extensive experiments on real world clinical dataset consists of 10,084 training, 1,289 validation and 1,496 test subjects. MP-ViT achieved substantial improvement in area under the curve (AUC), outperforming the vision transformer (ViT) by 5.5% and CNN-based architectures by 1.8%. These results highlight the potential of MP-ViT in improving performance for hemorrhage detection when different orientation contrasts are needed.</description>

      <title>GAN-based synthetic FDG PET images from T1 brain MRI can serve to improve performance of deep unsupervised anomaly detection models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background and Objective. Research in the cross-modal medical image translation domain has been very productive over the past few years in tackling the scarce availability of large curated multimodality datasets with the promising performance of GAN-based architectures. However, only a few of these studies assessed task-based related performance of these synthetic data, especially for the training of deep models. Method. We design and compare different GAN-based frameworks for generating synthetic brain [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET images from T1 weighted MRI data. We first perform standard qualitative and quantitative visual quality evaluation. Then, we explore further impact of using these fake PET data in the training of a deep unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) model designed to detect subtle epilepsy lesions in T1 MRI and FDG PET images. We introduce novel diagnostic task-oriented quality metrics of the synthetic FDG PET data tailored to our unsupervised detection task, then use these fake data to train a use case UAD model combining a deep representation learning based on siamese autoencoders with a OC-SVM density support estimation model. This model is trained on normal subjects only and allows the detection of any variation from the pattern of the normal population. We compare the detection performance of models trained on 35 paired real MR T1 of normal subjects paired either on 35 true PET images or on 35 synthetic PET images generated from the best performing generative models. Performance analysis is conducted on 17 exams of epilepsy patients undergoing surgery. Results. The best performing GAN-based models allow generating realistic fake PET images of control subject with SSIM and PSNR values around 0.9 and 23.8, respectively and in distribution (ID) with regard to the true control dataset. The best UAD model trained on these synthetic normative PET data allows reaching 74% sensitivity. Conclusion. Our results confirm that GAN-based models are the best suited for MR T1 to FDG PET translation, outperforming transformer or diffusion models. We also demonstrate the diagnostic value of these synthetic data for the training of UAD models and evaluation on clinical exams of epilepsy patients. Our code and the normative image dataset are available.</description>

Abstract: Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) event camera models are important tools for predicting camera response, optimizing biases, and generating realistic simulated datasets. Existing DVS models have been useful, but have not demonstrated high realism for challenging HDR scenes combined with adequate computational efficiency for array-level scene simulation. This paper reports progress towards a physically realistic and computationally efficient DVS model based on large-signal differential equations derived from circuit analysis, with parameters fitted from pixel measurements and circuit simulation. These are combined with an efficient stochastic event generation mechanism based on first-passage-time theory, allowing accurate noise generation with timesteps greater than 1000x longer than previous methods</description>

      <title>Ophora: A Large-Scale Data-Driven Text-Guided Ophthalmic Surgical Video Generation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07449v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ophthalmic surgery, developing an AI system capable of interpreting surgical videos and predicting subsequent operations requires numerous ophthalmic surgical videos with high-quality annotations, which are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns and labor consumption. Text-guided video generation (T2V) emerges as a promising solution to overcome this issue by generating ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. In this paper, we present Ophora, a pioneering model that can generate ophthalmic surgical videos following natural language instructions. To construct Ophora, we first propose a Comprehensive Data Curation pipeline to convert narrative ophthalmic surgical videos into a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising over 160K video-instruction pairs, Ophora-160K. Then, we propose a Progressive Video-Instruction Tuning scheme to transfer rich spatial-temporal knowledge from a T2V model pre-trained on natural video-text datasets for privacy-preserved ophthalmic surgical video generation based on Ophora-160K. Experiments on video quality evaluation via quantitative analysis and ophthalmologist feedback demonstrate that Ophora can generate realistic and reliable ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. We also validate the capability of Ophora for empowering downstream tasks of ophthalmic surgical workflow understanding. Code is available at https://github.com/mar-cry/Ophora.</description>

      <title>Breast Cancer Classification in Deep Ultraviolet Fluorescence Images Using a Patch-Level Vision Transformer Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) aims to completely remove malignant lesions while maximizing healthy tissue preservation. Intraoperative margin assessment is essential to achieve a balance between thorough cancer resection and tissue conservation. A deep ultraviolet fluorescence scanning microscope (DUV-FSM) enables rapid acquisition of whole surface images (WSIs) for excised tissue, providing contrast between malignant and normal tissues. However, breast cancer classification with DUV WSIs is challenged by high resolutions and complex histopathological features. This study introduces a DUV WSI classification framework using a patch-level vision transformer (ViT) model, capturing local and global features. Grad-CAM++ saliency weighting highlights relevant spatial regions, enhances result interpretability, and improves diagnostic accuracy for benign and malignant tissue classification. A comprehensive 5-fold cross-validation demonstrates the proposed approach significantly outperforms conventional deep learning methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 98.33%.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Sparse Attention Framework for Computationally Efficient Classification of Biological Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SparseAttnNet, a new hierarchical attention-driven framework for efficient image classification that adaptively selects and processes only the most informative pixels from images. Traditional convolutional neural networks typically process the entire images regardless of information density, leading to computational inefficiency and potential focus on irrelevant features. Our approach leverages a dynamic selection mechanism that uses coarse attention distilled by fine multi-head attention from the downstream layers of the model, allowing the model to identify and extract the most salient k pixels, where k is adaptively learned during training based on loss convergence trends. Once the top-k pixels are selected, the model processes only these pixels, embedding them as words in a language model to capture their semantics, followed by multi-head attention to incorporate global context. For biological cell images, we demonstrate that SparseAttnNet can process approximately 15% of the pixels instead of the full image. Applied to cell classification tasks using white blood cells images from the following modalities: optical path difference (OPD) images from digital holography for stain-free cells, images from motion-sensitive (event) camera from stain-free cells, and brightfield microscopy images of stained cells, For all three imaging modalities, SparseAttnNet achieves competitive accuracy while drastically reducing computational requirements in terms of both parameters and floating-point operations per second, compared to traditional CNNs and Vision Transformers. Since the model focuses on biologically relevant regions, it also offers improved explainability. The adaptive and lightweight nature of SparseAttnNet makes it ideal for deployment in resource-constrained and high-throughput settings, including imaging flow cytometry.</description>

      <title>ABS-Mamba: SAM2-Driven Bidirectional Spiral Mamba Network for Medical Image Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate multi-modal medical image translation requires ha-rmonizing global anatomical semantics and local structural fidelity, a challenge complicated by intermodality information loss and structural distortion. We propose ABS-Mamba, a novel architecture integrating the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for organ-aware semantic representation, specialized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for preserving modality-specific edge and texture details, and Mamba's selective state-space modeling for efficient long- and short-range feature dependencies. Structurally, our dual-resolution framework leverages SAM2's image encoder to capture organ-scale semantics from high-resolution inputs, while a parallel CNNs branch extracts fine-grained local features. The Robust Feature Fusion Network (RFFN) integrates these epresentations, and the Bidirectional Mamba Residual Network (BMRN) models spatial dependencies using spiral scanning and bidirectional state-space dynamics. A three-stage skip fusion decoder enhances edge and texture fidelity. We employ Efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA+) fine-tuning to enable precise domain specialization while maintaining the foundational capabilities of the pre-trained components. Extensive experimental validation on the SynthRAD2023 and BraTS2019 datasets demonstrates that ABS-Mamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering high-fidelity cross-modal synthesis that preserves anatomical semantics and structural details to enhance diagnostic accuracy in clinical applications.

      <title>StableMotion: Repurposing Diffusion-Based Image Priors for Motion Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present StableMotion, a novel framework leverages knowledge (geometry and content priors) from pretrained large-scale image diffusion models to perform motion estimation, solving single-image-based image rectification tasks such as Stitched Image Rectangling (SIR) and Rolling Shutter Correction (RSC). Specifically, StableMotion framework takes text-to-image Stable Diffusion (SD) models as backbone and repurposes it into an image-to-motion estimator. To mitigate inconsistent output produced by diffusion models, we propose Adaptive Ensemble Strategy (AES) that consolidates multiple outputs into a cohesive, high-fidelity result. Additionally, we present the concept of Sampling Steps Disaster (SSD), the counterintuitive scenario where increasing the number of sampling steps can lead to poorer outcomes, which enables our framework to achieve one-step inference. StableMotion is verified on two image rectification tasks and delivers state-of-the-art performance in both, as well as showing strong generalizability. Supported by SSD, StableMotion offers a speedup of 200 times compared to previous diffusion model-based methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a diffusion model that integrates a representation-conditioning mechanism, where the representations derived from a Vision Transformer (ViT) are used to condition the internal process of a Transformer-based diffusion model. This approach enables representation-conditioned data generation, addressing the challenge of requiring large-scale labeled datasets by leveraging self-supervised learning on unlabeled data. We evaluate our method through a zero-shot classification task for hematoma detection in brain imaging. Compared to the strong contrastive learning baseline, DINOv2, our method achieves a notable improvement of +6.15% in accuracy and +13.60% in F1-score, demonstrating its effectiveness in image classification.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Monocular Height Estimation via Sparse LiDAR-Guided Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monocular height estimation (MHE) from very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery via deep learning is notoriously challenging due to the lack of sufficient structural information. Conventional digital elevation models (DEMs), typically derived from airborne LiDAR or multi-view stereo, remain costly and geographically limited. Recently, models trained on synthetic data and refined through domain adaptation have shown remarkable performance in MHE, yet it remains unclear how these models make predictions or how reliable they truly are. In this paper, we investigate a state-of-the-art MHE model trained purely on synthetic data to explore where the model looks when making height predictions. Through systematic analyses, we find that the model relies heavily on shadow cues, a factor that can lead to overestimation or underestimation of heights when shadows deviate from expected norms. Furthermore, the inherent difficulty of evaluating regression tasks with the human eye underscores additional limitations of purely synthetic training. To address these issues, we propose a novel correction pipeline that integrates sparse, imperfect global LiDAR measurements (ICESat-2) with deep-learning outputs to improve local accuracy and achieve spatially consistent corrections. Our method comprises two stages: pre-processing raw ICESat-2 data, followed by a random forest-based approach to densely refine height estimates. Experiments in three representative urban regions -- Saint-Omer, Tokyo, and Sao Paulo -- reveal substantial error reductions, with mean absolute error (MAE) decreased by 22.8\%, 6.9\%, and 4.9\%, respectively. These findings highlight the critical role of shadow awareness in synthetic data-driven models and demonstrate how fusing imperfect real-world LiDAR data can bolster the robustness of MHE, paving the way for more reliable and scalable 3D mapping solutions.</description>

      <title>Language-Driven Dual Style Mixing for Single-Domain Generalized Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalizing an object detector trained on a single domain to multiple unseen domains is a challenging task. Existing methods typically introduce image or feature augmentation to diversify the source domain to raise the robustness of the detector. Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based augmentation techniques have been proven to be effective, but they require that the detector's backbone has the same structure as the image encoder of VLM, limiting the detector framework selection. To address this problem, we propose Language-Driven Dual Style Mixing (LDDS) for single-domain generalization, which diversifies the source domain by fully utilizing the semantic information of the VLM. Specifically, we first construct prompts to transfer style semantics embedded in the VLM to an image translation network. This facilitates the generation of style diversified images with explicit semantic information. Then, we propose image-level style mixing between the diversified images and source domain images. This effectively mines the semantic information for image augmentation without relying on specific augmentation selections. Finally, we propose feature-level style mixing in a double-pipeline manner, allowing feature augmentation to be model-agnostic and can work seamlessly with the mainstream detector frameworks, including the one-stage, two-stage, and transformer-based detectors. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across various benchmark datasets, including real to cartoon and normal to adverse weather tasks. The source code and pre-trained models will be publicly available at https://github.com/qinhongda8/LDDS.</description>

      <title>Apple's Synthetic Defocus Noise Pattern: Characterization and Forensic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: iPhone portrait-mode images contain a distinctive pattern in out-of-focus regions simulating the bokeh effect, which we term Apple's Synthetic Defocus Noise Pattern (SDNP). If overlooked, this pattern can interfere with blind forensic analyses, especially PRNU-based camera source verification, as noted in earlier works. Since Apple's SDNP remains underexplored, we provide a detailed characterization, proposing a method for its precise estimation, modeling its dependence on scene brightness, ISO settings, and other factors. Leveraging this characterization, we explore forensic applications of the SDNP, including traceability of portrait-mode images across iPhone models and iOS versions in open-set scenarios, assessing its robustness under post-processing. Furthermore, we show that masking SDNP-affected regions in PRNU-based camera source verification significantly reduces false positives, overcoming a critical limitation in camera attribution, and improving state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>Efficient Bilinear Attention-based Fusion for Medical Visual Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21000v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) has attracted growing interest at the intersection of medical image understanding and natural language processing for clinical applications. By interpreting medical images and providing precise answers to relevant clinical inquiries, MedVQA has the potential to support diagnostic decision-making and reduce workload across various fields like radiology. While recent approaches rely heavily on unified large pre-trained Visual-Language Models, research on more efficient fusion mechanisms remains relatively limited in this domain. In this paper, we introduce a fusion model, OMniBAN, that integrates Orthogonality loss, Multi-head attention, and a Bilinear Attention Network to achieve high computational efficiency as well as solid performance. We conduct comprehensive experiments and demonstrate how bilinear attention fusion can approximate the performance of larger fusion models like cross-modal Transformer. Our results show that OMniBAN requires fewer parameters (approximately 2/3 of Transformer-based Co-Attention) and substantially lower FLOPs (approximately 1/4), while achieving comparable overall performance and even slight improvements on closed-ended questions on two key MedVQA benchmarks. This balance between efficiency and accuracy suggests that OMniBAN could be a viable option for real-world medical image question answering, where computational resources are often constrained.</description>

      <title>From Spaceborne to Airborne: SAR Image Synthesis Using Foundation Models for Multi-Scale Adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The availability of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery has increased considerably in recent years, with datasets commercially available. However, the acquisition of high-resolution SAR images in airborne configurations, remains costly and limited. Thus, the lack of open source, well-labeled, or easily exploitable SAR text-image datasets is a barrier to the use of existing foundation models in remote sensing applications. In this context, synthetic image generation is a promising solution to augment this scarce data, enabling a broader range of applications. Leveraging over 15 years of ONERA's extensive archival airborn data from acquisition campaigns, we created a comprehensive training dataset of 110 thousands SAR images to exploit a 3.5 billion parameters pre-trained latent diffusion model \cite{Baqu2019SethiR}. In this work, we present a novel approach utilizing spatial conditioning techniques within a foundation model to transform satellite SAR imagery into airborne SAR representations. Additionally, we demonstrate that our pipeline is effective for bridging the realism of simulated images generated by ONERA's physics-based simulator EMPRISE \cite{empriseem_ai_images}. Our method explores a key application of AI in advancing SAR imaging technology. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce this approach in the literature.</description>

      <title>Sparse Reconstruction of Optical Doppler Tomography with Alternative State Space Model and Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical coherence Doppler tomography (ODT) is an emerging blood flow imaging technique. The fundamental unit of ODT is the 1D depth-resolved trace named raw A-scans (or A-line). A 2D ODT image (B-scan) is formed by reconstructing a cross-sectional flow image via Doppler phase-subtraction of raw A-scans along B-line. To obtain a high-fidelity B-scan, densely sampled A-scans are required currently, leading to prolonged scanning time and increased storage demands. Addressing this issue, we propose a novel sparse ODT reconstruction framework with an Alternative State Space Attention Network (ASSAN) that effectively reduces raw A-scans needed. Inspired by the distinct distributions of information along A-line and B-line, ASSAN applies 1D State Space Model (SSM) to each A-line to learn the intra-A-scan representation, while using 1D gated self-attention along B-line to capture the inter-A-scan features. In addition, an effective feedforward network based on sequential 1D convolutions along different axes is employed to enhance the local feature. In validation experiments on real animal data, ASSAN shows clear effectiveness in the reconstruction in comparison with state-of-the-art reconstruction methods.</description>

      <title>MAPL: Memory Augmentation and Pseudo-Labeling for Semi-Supervised Anomaly Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06198v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large unlabeled data and difficult-to-identify anomalies are the urgent issues need to overcome in most industrial scene. In order to address this issue, a new meth-odology for detecting surface defects in in-dustrial settings is introduced, referred to as Memory Augmentation and Pseudo-Labeling(MAPL). The methodology first in-troduces an anomaly simulation strategy, which significantly improves the model's ability to recognize rare or unknown anom-aly types by generating simulated anomaly samples. To cope with the problem of the lack of labeling of anomalous simulated samples, a pseudo-labeler method based on a one-classifier ensemble was employed in this study, which enhances the robustness of the model in the case of limited labeling data by automatically selecting key pseudo-labeling hyperparameters. Meanwhile, a memory-enhanced learning mechanism is introduced to effectively predict abnormal regions by analyzing the difference be-tween the input samples and the normal samples in the memory pool. An end-to-end learning framework is employed by MAPL to identify the abnormal regions directly from the input data, which optimizes the ef-ficiency and real-time performance of de-tection. By conducting extensive trials on the recently developed BHAD dataset (in-cluding MVTec AD [1], Visa [2], and MDPP [3]), MAPL achieves an average im-age-level AUROC score of 86.2%, demon-strating a 5.1% enhancement compared to the original MemSeg [4] model.

      <title>Generalized Compressed Sensing for Image Reconstruction with Diffusion Probabilistic Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17456v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the problem of selecting a small set of linear measurements for reconstructing high-dimensional signals. Well-established methods for optimizing such measurements include principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA) and compressed sensing (CS) based on random projections, all of which rely on axis- or subspace-aligned statistical characterization of the signal source. However, many naturally occurring signals, including photographic images, contain richer statistical structure. To exploit such structure, we introduce a general method for obtaining an optimized set of linear measurements for efficient image reconstruction, where the signal statistics are expressed by the prior implicit in a neural network trained to perform denoising (known as a ``diffusion model''). We demonstrate that the optimal measurements derived for two natural image datasets differ from those of PCA, ICA, or CS, and result in substantially lower mean squared reconstruction error. Interestingly, the marginal distributions of the measurement values are asymmetrical (skewed), substantially more so than those of previous methods. We also find that optimizing with respect to perceptual loss, as quantified by structural similarity (SSIM), leads to measurements different from those obtained when optimizing for MSE. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating the specific statistical regularities of natural signals when designing effective linear measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the transformative potential of Generative AI (Gen-AI) technologies, particularly large language models, within the building industry. By leveraging these advanced AI tools, the study explores their application across key areas such as automated compliance checking and building design assistance. The research highlights how Gen-AI can automate labor-intensive processes, significantly improving efficiency and reducing costs in building practices. The paper first discusses the two widely applied fundamental models-Transformer and Diffusion model-and summarizes current pathways for accessing Gen-AI models and the most common techniques for customizing them. It then explores applications for text generation, such as compliance checking, control support, data mining, and building simulation input file editing. Additionally, it examines image generation, including direct generation through diffusion models and indirect generation through language model-supported template creation based on existing Computer-Aided Design or other design tools with rendering. The paper concludes with a comprehensive analysis of the current capabilities of Gen-AI in the building industry, outlining future directions for research and development, with the goal of paving the way for smarter, more effective, and responsive design, construction, and operational practices.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Wide-Angle Image Using Narrow-Angle View of the Same Scene</title>

Abstract: A common dilemma while photographing a scene is whether to capture it at a wider angle, allowing more of the scene to be covered but in less detail or to click in a narrow angle that captures better details but leaves out portions of the scene. We propose a novel method in this paper that infuses wider shots with finer quality details that is usually associated with an image captured by the primary lens by capturing the same scene using both narrow and wide field of view (FoV) lenses. We do so by training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based model to learn to extract the visual quality parameters from a narrow-angle shot and to transfer these to the corresponding wide-angle image of the scene using residual connections and an attention-based fusion module. We have mentioned in details the proposed technique to isolate the visual essence of an image and to transfer it into another image. We have also elaborately discussed our implementation details and have presented the results of evaluation over several benchmark datasets and comparisons with contemporary advancements in the field.</description>
