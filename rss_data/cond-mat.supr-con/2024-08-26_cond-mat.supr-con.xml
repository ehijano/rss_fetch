      <title>Revaluation of the lower critical field in superconducting H$_3$S and LaH$_{10}$ (Nature Comm. 13, 3194, 2022)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our paper [1], we studied the magnetic response of H$_3$S and LaH$_{10}$ superconductors to an applied magnetic field using Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) magnetometry. Hirsch, in his comment [2], highlighted an inconsistency in the data averaging procedure while questioning whether high-Tc hydrides are superconductors at all. We accept the criticism regarding our method of extracting the penetration field HP from the original data. Our SQUID magnet becomes noisy at high magnetic fields, which necessitated the smoothing of a small portion of the data. To eliminate any data processing issues, we have performed an alternative data analysis that does not require data smoothing to estimate the penetration field Hp values. The formulation of the analysis is identical to the one widely used for determining critical currents in superconductors3. Recently, it has been shown to work effectively for extracting Hp and the lower critical field Hc1 from DC magnetization data4. The Hp values of the present analysis are consistent with those published in our original work1. We wish to emphasize very clearly that the criticism pertains to the secondary issue of determining Ginzburg-Landau parameters for these hydride superconductors and does not undermine the validity of the existence of hydride superconductivity. Indeed, as part of our paper1, we also published m(H) curves demonstrating the virgin curve (about which the analysis issues were raised) followed by magnetic hysteretic loops that have the classic form of the hysteresis curves of superconductors. Above Tc, in both H$_3$S and LaH$_{10}$, the hysteresis is absent. We make all the data available so that readers can judge for themselves.</description>

      <title>Investigating the role of anion polarizability in Fe-based superconductors via light-matter interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polarizability of nearby ions may have a significant impact on electron interactions in solids, but only limited experimental data are available to support this picture. In this work, using a highly simplified description of the prototypical FeAs superconducting layer, we show how external optical excitation of the As 4p-5s splitting can lead to a significant modulation of the polarization-mediated effective interactions between carriers. Our results suggest that even perturbative external fields, approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than the internal field generated by charge carriers, might enable the exploration of the role of the anion's polarizability in determining the correlated physics, although more detailed modeling is needed to decide optimal ways to achieve this.</description>

      <title>Closing in on possible scenarios for infinite-layer nickelates: comparison of dynamical mean-field theory with angular-resolved photoemission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conflicting theoretical scenarios for infinite-layer nickelate superconductors have been hotly debated, particularly regarding whether {only} a single Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ band is relevant at low energies besides electron pockets or whether multi-orbital physics including Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ is instead essential. The first scenario has emerged from density-functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) calculations. Comparing the previous DFT+DMFT spectra to recent angular-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments, we find excellent agreement for both the Fermi surface and the strongly renormalized quasi-particle bands, supporting the first scenario. Our key findings further suggest that the "waterfalls" observed in ARPES might emerge from the quasi-particle--to--Hubbard-band crossover, and that additional spectral weight close to the $A$-pocket likely originates from the Ni-3$d_{xy}$ orbital.</description>

      <title>Eliminating Surface Oxides of Superconducting Circuits with Noble Metal Encapsulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lifetime of superconducting qubits is limited by dielectric loss, and a major source of dielectric loss is the native oxide present at the surface of the superconducting metal. Specifically, tantalum-based superconducting qubits have been demonstrated with record lifetimes, but a major source of loss is the presence of two-level systems (TLSs) in the surface tantalum oxide. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for avoiding oxide formation by encapsulating the tantalum with noble metals that do not form native oxide. By depositing a few nanometers of Au or AuPd alloy before breaking vacuum, we completely suppress tantalum oxide formation. Microwave loss measurements of superconducting resonators reveal that the noble metal is proximitized, with a superconducting gap over 80% of the bare tantalum at thicknesses where the oxide is fully suppressed. We find that losses in resonators fabricated by subtractive etching are dominated by oxides on the sidewalls, suggesting total surface encapsulation by additive fabrication as a promising strategy for eliminating surface oxide TLS loss in superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Search for inhomogeneous Meissner screening in Nb induced by low-temperature surface treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirical surface treatments, such as low-temperature baking (LTB) in a gaseous atmosphere or in vacuum, are important for the surface preparation of Nb superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities. These treatments inhomogeneously dope the first $\sim$50 nm of Nb's subsurface and are expected to impart depth-dependent characteristics to its Meissner response; however, direct evidence supporting this remains elusive, suggesting the effect is subtle. In this work, we revisit the Meissner profile data for several LTB treatments obtained from low-energy muon spin rotation (LE-$\mu$SR) experiments [A. Romanenko et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 104, 072601 (2014) and R. M. L. McFadden et al., Phys. Rev. Appl. 19, 044018 (2023)], and search for signatures of inhomogeneous field screening. Using a generalized London expression with a recently proposed empirical model for a depth-dependent magnetic penetration depth $\lambda(z)$, we obtain improved fits to the Meissner data, revealing that the presence of a non-superconducting surface "dead layer" $d \geq 25$ nm is a strong indicator of a reduced supercurrent density at shallow subsurface depths. Our analysis supports the notion that vacuum annealing at 120 $^{\circ}$C for 48 h induces a depth-dependent Meissner response, which has consequences for Nb's ability to maintain a magnetic-flux-free state. Evidence of similar behavior from a "nitrogen infusion" treatment is less compelling. Suggestions for further investigation into the matter are provided.</description>

      <title>Topological p-wave Superconductors with Disorder and Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: interacting and disordered topological phases of coupled Kitaev wires, which may support further realistic applications of Majorana fermions. We develop a variety of analytical, mathematical and numerical methods for one and two-coupled wires, associated with a topological marker accessible from real-space correlation functions on the wire(s). We verify the stability of the topological superconducting phase and quantify disorder effects close to the quantum phase transitions, e.g. through two-point correlation functions or using a renormalization group (RG) analysis of disorder. We show for the first time that the double critical Ising (DCI) phase -- a fractional Majorana liquid characterized by a pair of half central charges and topological numbers -- is stabilized by strong interactions against disorder which respects the inversion symmetry between the wires (ie. parity conservation on each wire). In the presence of an inter-wire hopping term, the DCI phase turns into a protected topological phase with a bulk gap. We study the localization physics developing along the critical line for weaker interactions.</description>

      <title>Hole doping and electronic correlations in Cr-substituted BaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09014v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity (SC) is absent in Cr-substituted BaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ (CrBFA), a well-established but poorly understood topic. Additionally, the suppression of the spin density wave transition temperature ($T_{\text{SDW}}$) in CrBFA and Mn-substituted BaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ (MnBFA) coincides as a function of Cr/Mn content, despite the distinct electronic effects of these substitutions. In this work, we employ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and combined density functional theory plus dynamical mean field theory calculations (DFT+DMFT) to address the evolution of the Fermi surface (FS) and electronic correlations in CrBFA. Our findings reveal that incorporating Cr leads to an effective hole doping of the states near the FS, which is well described within the virtual crystal approximation (VCA). We analyzed the electronic band spectra with main $d_{yz}$-orbital character and found a fractional scaling of the imaginary part of self-energy as a function of the binding energy, a signature property of Hund's correlations. We conclude that CrBFA is a correlated electron system and the changes in the FS as a function of Cr are unrelated to the suppression of $T_{\text{SDW}}$. We suggest that the absence of SC is primarily due to the competition between Cr local moments and the Fe-derived itinerant spin fluctuations.</description>
