      <title>Computing transcendence and linear relations of 1-periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 1-period is a complex number given by the integral of a univariate algebraic function, where all data involved -- the integrand and the domain of integration -- are defined over algebraic numbers. We give an algorithm that, given a finite collection of 1-periods, computes the space of all linear relations among them with algebraic coefficients. In particular, the algorithm decides whether a given 1-period is transcendental, and whether two 1-periods are equal. This resolves, in the case of 1-periods, a problem posed by Kontsevich and Zagier, asking for an algorithm to decide equality of periods. The algorithm builds on the work of Huber and W\"ustholz, who showed that all linear relations among 1-periods arise from 1-motives; we make this perspective effective by reducing the problem to divisor arithmetic on curves and providing the theoretical foundations for a practical and fully explicit algorithm. To illustrate the broader applicability of our methods, we also give an algorithmic classification of autonomous first-order (non-linear) differential equations.</description>

      <title>Exploration of offsets of Cayley ovals and their singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore offsets of Cayley ovals, by networking with different kinds of software. Using their specific abilities, algebraic, geometric, dynamic, we conjecture interesting properties of the offsets. For a given progenitor (the given plane curve whose offsets are studied), changes in the offset distance induce great changes in the shape and the topology of the offset. Such a study has been performed in the past for classical curves, and recently for non classical ones.Here we relate to Cayley ovals; despite them being non singular, their offsets have intriguing properties, cusps, and self-intersections. We begin with a short study of envelopes of families of circles with constant radius centered on the oval (these constructs are often studied together with offsets, but they are different objects). Then we study the offsets, which are defined as geometric loci. Both approaches are supported by the automated methods provided by the software.</description>

      <title>On endomorphisms of varieties which are injective on open subsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider conditions under which endomorphisms of varieties become automorphisms. For example, there is a remarkable theorem, called Ax-Grothendieck theorem, which states that any injective endomorphism of a variety is bijective. Over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, bijectivity of endomorphisms of varieties implies that the endomorphisms are automorphisms, thus Ax-Grothendieck theorem gives one of the conditions we considering. There is also a conjecture, called Miyanishi conjecture, which claims that for any endomorphism of a variety over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, if it is injective outside a closed subset of codimension at least $2$, then it is an automorphism. Recently, I. Biswas and N. Das prove that any endomorphism which satisfies the conditions of Miyanishi conjecture induces an automorphism of the singular locus of the variety with some conditions. In this paper, we prove that Miyanishi conjecture holds for any threefold which satisfies the conditions of I. Biswas and N. Das. For higher dimensional varieties, we also observe how divisorial contractions affect endomorphisms by using minimal model program theory. We can prove that Miyanishi conjecture holds for any open subset of a projective variety which has a sequence of divisorial contractions to the canonical model or a birationally superrigid Mori fiber space.</description>

Abstract: Let $R$ be the field of real Puiseux series. It is a real closed field. We construct the first examples of smooth intersections of two quadrics in $\mathbb{P}_R^5$ and smooth cubic hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{P}_R^4$ which are not stably rational but for which the space $X(R)$ of $R$-points is semi-algebraically connected. The question of constructing such examples over the field of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ remains open.</description>

      <title>Computing phylogenetic invariants for time-reversible models: from TN93 to its submodels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic invariants are equations that vanish on algebraic varieties associated with Markov processes that model molecular substitutions on phylogenetic trees. For practical applications, it is essential to understand these equations across a wide range of substitution models. Recent work has shown that, for equivariant models, phylogenetic invariants can be derived from those of the general Markov model by restricting to the linear space defined by the model (namely, the space of mixtures of distributions on the model). Following this philosophy, we describe the space of mixtures and phylogenetic invariants for time-reversible models that are not equivariant. Specifically, we study two submodels of the Tamura-Nei nucleotide substitution model (Felsenstein 81 and 84) using an orthogonal change of basis recently introduced for algebraic time-reversible models.
  For tripods, we prove that the algebraic variety of each submodel coincides with the variety of Tamura-Nei intersected with the linear space of the submodel. In the case of quartets, we show that it is an irreducible component of this intersection. Moreover, we demonstrate that it suffices to consider only the binomial equations defining the linear space, which correspond to the natural symmetries of the model in the new coordinates. For each submodel, we explicitly provide equations defining a local complete intersection that characterizes the phylogenetic variety on a dense open subset containing the biologically relevant points.</description>

      <title>\'{E}tale coverings in codimension 1 with applications to Mori Dream Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04784</link>
      <description>arXiv:1902.04784v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to developing relations between Galois \'etale coverings in codimension 1 and \'etale fundamental groups in codimension 1 of algebraic varieties, aimed to studying the topology of Mori dream spaces. In particular, the universal \'etale covering in codimension 1 of a non-degenerate toric variety and a canonical Galois \'etale covering in codimension 1 of a Mori dream space (MDS) are exhibited. Sufficient conditions for the latter being either still a MDS or the universal \'etale covering in codimension 1 are given. As an application, a canonical toric embedding of K3 universal coverings, of Enriques surfaces which are Mori dream, is described.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the real numbers with $\Z/2-$coefficients, we compute the $C_2$-equivariant Borel motivic cohomology ring, the Bredon motivic cohomology groups and prove that the Bredon motivic cohomology ring of the real numbers is a proper subring in the $RO(C_2\times C_2)$-graded Bredon cohomology ring of a point.
  This generalizes Voevodsky's computation of the motivic cohomology ring of the real numbers to the $C_2$-equivariant setting. These computations are extended afterwards to any real closed field.</description>

Abstract: We show that birational hyper-K\"ahler varieties of $K3^{[n]}$-type are derived equivalent, establishing the D-equivalence conjecture in these cases. The Fourier-Mukai kernels of our derived equivalences are constructed from projectively hyperholomorphic bundles, following ideas of Markman. Our method also proves a stronger version of the D-equivalence conjecture for hyper-K\"ahler varieties of $K3^{[n]}$-type with Brauer classes.</description>

Abstract: The Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg theorem implies the existence of a spectral sequence computing the Hochschild homology of a variety in terms of the cohomology of differential forms. When the base field $k$ has characteristic $p&gt;0$, we show that the differentials in this spectral sequence are zero before page $p$; when the variety admits a lift to $W_2(k)$, we give a formula for the differential on page $p$. The formula involves the Bockstein associated to the lift and a $p$th power operation for the Atiyah class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $K$-theoretic enumerative geometry of cyclic Nakajima quiver varieties, with particular focus on $\text{Hilb}^{m}([\mathbb{C}^{2}/\mathbb{Z}_{l}])$, the equivariant Hilbert scheme of points on $\mathbb{C}^2$. The direct sum over $m$ of the equivariant $K$-theories of these varieties is known to be isomorphic to the ring symmetric functions in $l$ colors, with structure sheaves of torus fixed points identified with wreath Macdonald polynomials. Using properties of wreath Macdonald polynomials and the recent identification of the Maulik-Okounkov quantum affine algebra for cyclic quivers with the quantum toroidal algebras of type $A$, we derive an explicit formula for the generating function of capped vertex functions of $\text{Hilb}^{m}([\mathbb{C}^{2}/\mathbb{Z}_{l}])$ with descendants given by exterior powers of the $0$th tautological bundle. We also sharpen the large framing vanishing results of Okounkov, providing a class of descendants and cyclic quiver varieties for which the capped vertex functions are purely classical.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathscr{C}$ be a symmetric tensor category of moderate growth, and let $\mathcal{H}\subseteq\mathcal{G}$ be algebraic groups in $\mathscr{C}$. We prove that the homogeneous space $\mathcal{G}/\mathcal{H}$ exists and is of finite type when $\mathscr{C}$ satisfies (GR) and (MN1-2), which are conjecturally equivalent to incompressibility. A key tool is the introduction of a Frobenius kernel of an group scheme. We further show that while $\mathcal{G}_0/\mathcal{H}_0$ and $(\mathcal{G}/\mathcal{H})_0$ need not be the same, they are close enough, so that $\mathcal{G}/\mathcal{H}$ is quasi-affine/affine/proper if and only if $\mathcal{G}_0/\mathcal{H}_0$ is.</description>

Abstract: We study projective models of generalized Kummer fourfolds via O'Grady's theta groups and the classical Coble cubic. More precisely, we establish a duality between two singular models of the generalized Kummer fourfold of a Jacobian abelian surface. We also give projective models for singular Jacobian Kummer varieties of arbitrary dimension. Along the way, we also construct a first non-natural involution on the Hilbert square of a Jacobian surface. In the appendix, we study singularities of secants of arbitrary varieties at identifiable points, following Choi, Lacini, Park and Sheridan.</description>

Abstract: The quantum groups of finite and affine type $A$ admit geometric realizations in terms of partial flag varieties of finite and affine type $A$. Recently, the quantum group associated to partial flag varieties of finite type $B/C$ is shown to be a coideal subalgebra of the quantum group of finite type $A$. In this paper we study the structures of Schur algebras and Lusztig algebras associated to (four variants of) partial flag varieties of affine type $C$. We show that the quantum groups arising from Lusztig algebras and Schur algebras via stabilization procedures are (idempotented) coideal subalgebras of quantum groups of affine $\mathfrak{sl}$ and $\mathfrak{gl}$ types, respectively. In this way, we provide geometric realizations of eight quantum symmetric pairs of affine types. We construct monomial and canonical bases of all these quantum (Schur, Lusztig, and coideal) algebras. For the idempotented coideal algebras of affine $\mathfrak{sl}$ type, we establish the positivity properties of the canonical basis with respect to multiplication, comultiplication and a bilinear pairing. In particular, we obtain a new and geometric construction of the idempotented quantum affine $\mathfrak{gl}$ and its canonical basis.</description>

      <title>Monodromy representations of $p$-adic differential equations in families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.00593v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a relative version of the local monodromy theorem for ordinary differential equations on an annulus over a mixed-characteristic nonarchimedean field, and give several applications in $p$-adic cohomology and $p$-adic Hodge theory. These include a simplified proof of the semistable reduction theorem for overconvergent $F$-isocrystals, a relative version of Berger's theorem that de Rham representations are potentially semistable, and a multivariate version of the local monodromy theorem in the style of Drinfeld's lemma on fundamental groups.</description>

      <title>Singularities of orbit closures in loop spaces of symmetric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20006v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the singularities of closures of Iwahori orbits on loop spaces of symmetric varieties extending the celebrated work of Lusztig-Vogan to the affine setting. We show that the IC-complexes of orbit closures (with possible non-trivial coefficients) are pointwise pure and satisfy a parity vanishing property. We apply those geometric results to study the affine Lusztig-Vogan modules and obtain fundational results about them including the positivity properties of the affine Kazhdan-Lusztig-Vogan polynomials. Along the way, we construct conical transversal slices inside loop spaces of symmetric varieties generalizing the work of Mars-Springer in the finite dimensional setting. Our results answer a question of Lusztig.
  We deduce results for singularities of spherical orbit closures and provide applications to relative Langlands duality including the positivity for the relative Kostka-Foulkes polynomials and the formality conjecture.</description>

      <title>Non-Perturbative Corrections to 3d BPS Indices and Topological Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a 3d gauged linear sigma model parametrized by a Kahler manifold X, the 3d BPS index defines a q-series that can be analytically continued in the Kahler modulus by standard methods. It is argued that an SL(2,Z)-transform of the Birkhoff connection matrix captures non-perturbative corrections to the 3d GLSM. As an application, a 3d lift of the standard 2d GLSM for the resolved conifold is shown to provide a world-volume dual for the non-perturbative topological string on the resolved conifold. The perturbative 3d BPS index computes the Gopakumar-Vafa partition function, while the analytic continuation matches existing proposals for a non-perturbative completion of the topological string.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20669v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an alternative proof of the Kulikov-Persson-Pinkham Theorem for a projective degeneration of K-trivial smooth surfaces. After running the Minimal Model Program, the obtained minimal dlt model has mild singularities which we resolve via Brieskorn's simultaneous resolutions and toric resolutions.</description>
