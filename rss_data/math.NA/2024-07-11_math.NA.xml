      <title>Approximating and preconditioning the stiffness matrix in the GoFD approximation of the fractional Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the finite difference approximation of the fractional Laplacian the stiffness matrix is typically dense and needs to be approximated numerically. The effect of the accuracy in approximating the stiffness matrix on the accuracy in the whole computation is analyzed and shown to be significant. Four such approximations are discussed. While they are shown to work well with the recently developed grid-over finite difference method (GoFD) for the numerical solution of boundary value problems of the fractional Laplacian, they differ in accuracy, economics to compute, performance of preconditioning, and asymptotic decay away from the diagonal line. In addition, two preconditioners based on sparse and circulant matrices are discussed for the iterative solution of linear systems associated with the stiffness matrix. Numerical results in two and three dimensions are presented.</description>

      <title>Weak baselines and reporting biases lead to overoptimism in machine learning for fluid-related partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most promising applications of machine learning (ML) in computational physics is to accelerate the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). The key objective of ML-based PDE solvers is to output a sufficiently accurate solution faster than standard numerical methods, which are used as a baseline comparison. We first perform a systematic review of the ML-for-PDE solving literature. Of articles that use ML to solve a fluid-related PDE and claim to outperform a standard numerical method, we determine that 79% (60/76) compare to a weak baseline. Second, we find evidence that reporting biases, especially outcome reporting bias and publication bias, are widespread. We conclude that ML-for-PDE solving research is overoptimistic: weak baselines lead to overly positive results, while reporting biases lead to underreporting of negative results. To a large extent, these issues appear to be caused by factors similar to those of past reproducibility crises: researcher degrees of freedom and a bias towards positive results. We call for bottom-up cultural changes to minimize biased reporting as well as top-down structural reforms intended to reduce perverse incentives for doing so.</description>

      <title>Monolithic Multigrid Preconditioners for High-Order Discretizations of Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces and assesses the efficiency of a monolithic $ph$MG multigrid framework designed for high-order discretizations of stationary Stokes systems using Taylor-Hood and Scott-Vogelius elements. The proposed approach integrates coarsening in both approximation order ($p$) and mesh resolution ($h$), to address the computational and memory efficiency challenges that are often encountered in conventional high-order numerical simulations. Our numerical results reveal that $ph$MG offers significant improvements over traditional spatial-coarsening-only multigrid ($h$MG) techniques for problems discretized with Taylor-Hood elements across a variety of problem sizes and discretization orders. In particular, the $ph$MG method exhibits superior performance in reducing setup and solve times, particularly when dealing with higher discretization orders and unstructured problem domains. For Scott-Vogelius discretizations, while monolithic $ph$MG delivers low iteration counts and competitive solve phase timings, it exhibits a discernibly slower setup phase when compared to a multilevel (non-monolithic) full-block-factorization (FBF) preconditioner where $ph$MG is employed only for the velocity unknowns. This is primarily due to the setup costs of the larger mixed-field relaxation patches with monolithic $ph$MG versus the patch setup costs with a single unknown type for FBF.</description>

      <title>Formulation and analysis of a DPG discretization for a simplified electrochemical model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simplified model consisting on two linear elliptic boundary-value problems that represent a single step and single fixed-point iteration in an electrochemical battery model. The main variables are the concentration and the electric potential, whose equation is assigned a Robin BC with a very important physical interpretation. The solvability of both equations is studied in different funcional settings, to finally prove the well-posedness of a broken mixed variational formulation. The latter formulation opens the opportunity of performing discretization and numerical solution via the Discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) method, which guarantees discrete stability thanks to optimal test functions. With only the usual assumptions on the data and the discretization, we show that the method herein proposed is convergent. This analytical effort complements other recent works on batttery multiphysics, that have been more modeling and computing oriented, and establishes the DPG approach as a valuable tool to contribute toward an efficient analysis and design of batteries.</description>

      <title>Hopf algebra structures for the backward error analysis of ergodic stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While backward error analysis does not generalise straightforwardly to the strong and weak approximation of stochastic differential equations, it extends for the sampling of ergodic dynamics. The calculation of the modified equation relies on tedious calculations and there is no expression of the modified vector field, in opposition to the deterministic setting. We uncover in this paper the Hopf algebra structures associated to the laws of composition and substitution of exotic aromatic S-series, relying on the new idea of clumping. We use these algebraic structures to provide the algebraic foundations of stochastic numerical analysis with S-series, as well as an explicit expression of the modified vector field as an exotic aromatic B-series.</description>

      <title>A preconditioner for the grad-div stabilized equal-order finite elements discretizations of the Oseen problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper considers grad-div stabilized equal-order finite elements (FE) methods for the linearized Navier-Stokes equations. A block triangular preconditioner for the resulting system of algebraic equations is proposed which is closely related to the Augmented Lagrangian (AL) preconditioner. A field-of-values analysis of a preconditioned Krylov subspace method shows convergence bounds that are independent of the mesh parameter variation. Numerical studies support the theory and demonstrate the robustness of the approach also with respect to the viscosity parameter variation, as is typical for AL preconditioners when applied to inf-sup stable FE pairs. The numerical experiments also address the accuracy of grad-div stabilized equal-order FE method for the steady state Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>A Finite Element Method by Patch Reconstruction for the Quad-Curl Problem Using Mixed Formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07629v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a high order reconstructed discontinuous approximation (RDA) method for solving a mixed formulation of the quad-curl problem in two and three dimensions. This mixed formulation is established by adding an auxiliary variable to control the divergence of the field. The approximation space for the original variables is constructed by patch reconstruction with exactly one degree of freedom per element in each dimension and the auxiliary variable is approximated by the piecewise constant space. We prove the optimal convergence rate under the energy norm and also suboptimal $L^2$ convergence using a duality approach. Numerical results are provided to verify the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Machine learning of discrete field theories with guaranteed convergence and uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a method based on Gaussian process regression to identify discrete variational principles from observed solutions of a field theory. The method is based on the data-based identification of a discrete Lagrangian density. It is a geometric machine learning technique in the sense that the variational structure of the true field theory is reflected in the data-driven model by design. We provide a rigorous convergence statement of the method. The proof circumvents challenges posed by the ambiguity of discrete Lagrangian densities in the inverse problem of variational calculus. Moreover, our method can be used to quantify model uncertainty in the equations of motions and any linear observable of the discrete field theory. This is illustrated on the example of the discrete wave equation and Schr\"odinger equation. The article constitutes an extension of our previous article arXiv:2404.19626 for the data-driven identification of (discrete) Lagrangians for variational dynamics from an ode setting to the setting of discrete pdes.</description>

      <title>Explicit inverse of symmetric, tridiagonal near Toeplitz matrices Part II: with weakly diagonally dominant Toeplitz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide explicit formulas for the exact inverses of the symmetric tridiagonal near-Toeplitz matrices characterized by weak diagonal dominance in the Toeplitz part. Furthermore, these findings extend to scenarios where the corners of the near Toeplitz matrices lack diagonal dominance ($|\widetilde{b}| &lt; 1$). Additionally, we compute the row sums and traces of the inverse matrices, thereby deriving upper bounds for their infinite norms. To demonstrate the practical applicability of our theoretical results, we present numerical examples addressing numerical solution of the Fisher problem using the fixed point method. Our findings reveal that the convergence rates of fixed-point iterations closely align with the expected rates, and there is minimal disparity between the upper bounds and the infinite norm of the inverse matrix. Specifically, this observation holds true for $|b| = 2$ with $|\widetilde{b}| \geq 1$. In other cases, there exists potential to enhance the obtained upper bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Error control by means of a posteriori error estimators or indica-tors and adaptive discretizations, such as adaptive mesh refinement, have emerged in the late seventies. Since then, numerous theoretical developments and improvements have been made, as well as the first attempts to introduce them into real-life industrial applications. The present introductory chapter provides an overview of the subject, highlights some of the achievements to date and discusses possible perspectives.</description>

      <title>Optimal sampling for least squares approximation with general dictionaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of approximating an unknown function in a nonlinear model class from point evaluations. When obtaining these point evaluations is costly, minimising the required sample size becomes crucial. Recently, an increasing focus has been on employing adaptive sampling strategies to achieve this. These strategies are based on linear spaces related to the nonlinear model class, for which the optimal sampling measures are known. However, the resulting optimal sampling measures depend on an orthonormal basis of the linear space, which is known rarely. Consequently, sampling from these measures is challenging in practice. This manuscript presents a sampling strategy that iteratively refines an estimate of the optimal sampling measure by updating it based on previously drawn samples. This strategy can be performed offline and does not require evaluations of the sought function. We establish convergence and illustrate the practical performance through numerical experiments. Comparing the presented approach with standard Monte Carlo sampling demonstrates a significant reduction in the number of samples required to achieve a good estimation of an orthonormal basis.</description>

      <title>Generic Numerical Analysis of Stochastic Reaction Diffusion Model with applications in excitable media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic reaction-diffusion model driven by a multiplicative noise is examined. We construct the gradient discretisation method (GDM), an abstract framework combining several numerical method families. The paper provides the discretisation and proves the convergence of the approximate schemes using a compactness argument that works under natural assumptions on data. We also investigate, using a finite volume method, known as the hybrid mixed mimetic (HMM) approach, the effects of multiplicative noise on the dynamics of the travelling waves in the excitable media displayed by the model. Particularly, we consider how sufficiently high noise can cause waves to backfire or fail to propagate.</description>

      <title>Two Nitsche-based mixed finite element discretizations for the seepage problem in Richards' equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes two algorithms to impose seepage boundary conditions in the context of Richards' equation for groundwater flows in unsaturated media. Seepage conditions are non-linear boundary conditions, that can be formulated as a set of unilateral constraints on both the pressure head and the water flux at the ground surface, together with a complementarity condition: these conditions in practice require switching between Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions on unknown portions on the boundary. Upon realizing the similarities of these conditions with unilateral contact problems in mechanics, we take inspiration from that literature to propose two approaches: the first method relies on a strongly consistent penalization term, whereas the second one is obtained by an hybridization approach, in which the value of the pressure on the surface is treated as a separate set of unknowns. The flow problem is discretized in mixed form with div-conforming elements so that the water mass is preserved. Numerical experiments show the validity of the proposed strategy in handling the seepage boundary conditions on geometries with increasing complexity.</description>

      <title>Stable Weight Updating: A Key to Reliable PDE Solutions Using Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Deep learning techniques, particularly neural networks, have revolutionized computational physics, offering powerful tools for solving complex partial differential equations (PDEs). However, ensuring stability and efficiency remains a challenge, especially in scenarios involving nonlinear and time-dependent equations. Methodology: This paper introduces novel residual-based architectures, namely the Simple Highway Network and the Squared Residual Network, designed to enhance stability and accuracy in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). These architectures augment traditional neural networks by incorporating residual connections, which facilitate smoother weight updates and improve backpropagation efficiency. Results: Through extensive numerical experiments across various examples including linear and nonlinear, time-dependent and independent PDEs we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed architectures. The Squared Residual Network, in particular, exhibits robust performance, achieving enhanced stability and accuracy compared to conventional neural networks. These findings underscore the potential of residual-based architectures in advancing deep learning for PDEs and computational physics applications.</description>

      <title>Bilinear optimal control for chemotaxis model: The case of two-sidedly degenerate diffusion with Volume-Filling Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an optimal control problem for a coupled non-linear system of reaction-diffusion equations with degenerate diffusion, consisting of two partial differential equations representing the density of cells and the concentration of the chemotactic agent. By controlling the concentration of the chemical substrates, this study can guide the optimal growth of cells. The novelty of this work lies on the direct and dual models that remain in a weak setting, which is uncommon in the recent literature for solving optimal control systems. Moreover, it is known that the adjoint problems offer a powerful approach to quantifying the uncertainty associated with model inputs. However, these systems typically lack closed-form solutions, making it challenging to obtain weak solutions. For that, the well-posedness of the direct problem is first well guaranteed. Then, the existence of an optimal control and the first-order optimality conditions are established. Finally, weak solutions for the adjoint system to the non-linear degenerate direct model, are introduced and investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of mini-batch gradient descent to semiflows. Given a loss function, we introduce a continuous version of mini-batch gradient descent by randomly selecting sub-loss functions over time, defining a piecewise flow. We prove that, under suitable assumptions on the gradient flow, the mini-batch descent flow trajectory closely approximates the original gradient flow trajectory on average. Additionally, we propose a randomized minimizing movement scheme that also approximates the gradient flow of the loss function. We illustrate the versatility of this approach across various problems, including constrained optimization, sparse inversion, and domain decomposition. Finally, we validate our results with several numerical examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1910.14376v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we propose a discretization of the second boundary condition for the Monge-Ampere equation arising in geometric optics and optimal transport. The discretization we propose is the natural generalization of the popular Oliker-Prussner method proposed in 1988. For the discretization of the differential operator, we use a discrete analogue of the subdifferential. Existence, unicity and stability of the solutions to the discrete problem are established. Convergence results to the continuous problem are given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1911.00260v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the convergence of a damped Newton's method for the nonlinear system resulting from a discretization of the second boundary value problem for the Monge-Ampere equation. The boundary condition is enforced through the use of the notion of asymptotic cone. The differential operator is discretized based on a discrete analogue of the subdifferential.</description>

      <title>Reduced basis approximation of parametric eigenvalue problems in presence of clusters and intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss reduced order models for the approximation of parametric eigenvalue problems. In particular, we are interested in the presence of intersections or clusters of eigenvalues. The singularities originating by these phenomena make it hard a straightforward generalization of well known strategies normally used for standards PDEs. We investigate how the known results extend (or not) to higher order frequencies.</description>

      <title>A localized orthogonal decomposition strategy for hybrid discontinuous Galerkin methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate and analyze a multiscale method for an elliptic problem with an oscillatory coefficient based on a skeletal (hybrid) formulation. More precisely, we employ hybrid discontinuous Galerkin approaches and combine them with the localized orthogonal decomposition methodology to obtain a coarse-scale skeletal method that effectively includes fine-scale information. This work is the first step in reliably merging hybrid skeletal formulations and localized orthogonal decomposition to unite the advantages of both strategies. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Building hierarchies of semiclassical Jacobi polynomials for spectral methods in annuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss computing with hierarchies of families of (potentially weighted) semiclassical Jacobi polynomials which arise in the construction of multivariate orthogonal polynomials. In particular, we outline how to build connection and differentiation matrices with optimal complexity and compute analysis and synthesis operations in quasi-optimal complexity. We investigate a particular application of these results to constructing orthogonal polynomials in annuli, called the generalised Zernike annular polynomials, which lead to sparse discretisations of partial differential equations. We compare against a scaled-and-shifted Chebyshev--Fourier series showing that in general the annular polynomials converge faster when approximating smooth functions and have better conditioning. We also construct a sparse spectral element method by combining disk and annulus cells, which is highly effective for solving PDEs with radially discontinuous variable coefficients and data.</description>

      <title>Convolution quadratures based on block generalized Adams methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a family of convolution quadratures, a numerical technique for efficient evaluation of convolution integrals. We employ the block generalized Adams method to discretize the underlying initial value problem, departing from the well-established approaches that rely on linear multistep formulas or Runge-Kutta methods. The convergence order of the proposed convolution quadrature can be dynamically controlled without requiring grid point adjustments, enhancing exibility. Through strategic selection of the local interpolation polynomial and block size, the method achieves high-order convergence for calculation of convolution integrals with hyperbolic kernels. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis for the proposed convolution quadrature and numerically validate our theoretical findings for various convolution integrals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The iterative rational Krylov algorithm (IRKA) is a commonly used fixed-point iteration developed to minimize the $\mathcal{H}_2$ model order reduction error. In this work, IRKA is recast as a Riemannian gradient descent method with a fixed step size over the manifold of rational functions having fixed degree. This interpretation motivates the development of a Riemannian gradient descent method utilizing as a natural extension variable step size and line search. Comparisons made between IRKA and this extension on a few examples demonstrate significant benefits.</description>

      <title>Iterative methods of linearized moment equations for rarefied gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the iterative methods for large moment systems derived from the linearized Boltzmann equation. By Fourier analysis, it is shown that the direct application of the block symmetric Gauss-Seidel (BSGS) method has slower convergence for smaller Knudsen numbers. Better convergence rates for dense flows are then achieved by coupling the BSGS method with the micro-macro decomposition, which treats the moment equations as a coupled system with a microscopic part and a macroscopic part. Since the macroscopic part contains only a small number of equations, it can be solved accurately during the iteration with a relatively small computational cost, which accelerates the overall iteration. The method is further generalized to the multiscale decomposition which splits the moment system into many subsystems with different orders of magnitude. Both one- and two-dimensional numerical tests are carried out to examine the performances of these methods. Possible issues regarding the efficiency and convergence are discussed in the conclusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Domain Decomposition (DD) algorithm on non--overlapping domains, we compare couplings of different discretisation models, such as Finite Element (FEM) and Reduced Order (ROM) models for separate subcomponents. In particular, we consider an optimisation-based DD model where the coupling on the interface is performed using a control variable representing the normal flux. We use iterative gradient-based optimisation algorithms to decouple the subdomain state solutions as well as to locally generate ROMs on each subdomain. Then, we consider FEM or ROM discretisation models for each of the DD problem components, namely, the triplet state1-state2-control. On the backward-facing step Navier-Stokes (NS) problem, we investigate the efficacy of the presented couplings in terms of optimisation iterations, optimal functional values and relative errors.</description>

      <title>Enhanced and Generalized One-Step Neville Algorithm: Fractional Powers and Access to the Convergence Rate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recursive Neville algorithm allows one to calculate interpolating functions recursively. Upon a judicious choice of the abscissas used for the interpolation (and extrapolation), this algorithm leads to a method for convergence acceleration. For example, one can use the Neville algorithm in order to successively eliminate inverse powers of the upper limit of the summation from the partial sums of a given, slowly convergent input series. Here, we show that, for a particular choice of the abscissas used for the extrapolation, one can replace the recursive Neville scheme by a simple one-step transformation, while also obtaining access to subleading terms for the transformed series after convergence acceleration. The matrix-based, unified formulas allow one to estimate the rate of convergence of the partial sums of the input series to their limit. In particular, Bethe logarithms for hydrogen are calculated to 100 decimal digits. Generalizations of the method to series whose remainder terms can be expanded in terms of inverse factorial series, or series with half-integer powers, are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: In this contribution, we provide convergence rates for a finite volume scheme of the stochastic heat equation with multiplicative Lipschitz noise and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions (SHE). More precisely, we give an error estimate for the $L^2$-norm of the space-time discretization of SHE by a semi-implicit Euler scheme with respect to time and a TPFA scheme with respect to space and the variational solution of SHE. The only regularity assumptions additionally needed is spatial regularity of the initial datum and smoothness of the diffusive term.</description>

      <title>Vanilla Feedforward Neural Networks as a Discretization of Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.10909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has made significant applications in the field of data science and natural science. Some studies have linked deep neural networks to dynamic systems, but the network structure is restricted to the residual network. It is known that residual networks can be regarded as a numerical discretization of dynamic systems. In this paper, we back to the classical network structure and prove that the vanilla feedforward networks could also be a numerical discretization of dynamic systems, where the width of the network is equal to the dimension of the input and output. Our proof is based on the properties of the leaky-ReLU function and the numerical technique of splitting method to solve differential equations. Our results could provide a new perspective for understanding the approximation properties of feedforward neural networks.</description>

      <title>Modeling and simulations of high-density two-phase flows using projection-based Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17933v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately modeling the dynamics of high-density ratio ($\mathcal{O}(10^5)$) two-phase flows is important for many applications in material science and manufacturing. In this work, we consider numerical simulations of molten metal undergoing microgravity oscillations. Accurate simulation of the oscillation dynamics allows us to characterize the interplay between the two fluids' surface tension and density ratio, which is an important consideration for terrestrial manufacturing applications. We present a projection-based computational framework for solving a thermodynamically-consistent Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes equations for two-phase flows under these large density ratios. A modified version of the pressure-decoupled solver based on the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition presented in Khanwale et al. [$\textit{A projection-based, semi-implicit time-stepping approach for the Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes equations on adaptive octree meshes.}$, Journal of Computational Physics 475 (2023): 111874] is used. We present a comprehensive convergence study to investigate the effect of mesh resolution, time-step, and interfacial thickness on droplet-shape oscillations. We deploy our framework to predict the oscillation behavior of three physical systems exhibiting very large density ratios ($10^4-10^5:1$) that have previously never been performed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a complete solution to the problem of infinite quantum signal processing for the class of Szeg\H{o} functions, which are functions that satisfy a logarithmic integrability condition and include almost any function that allows for a quantum signal processing representation. We do so by introducing a new algorithm called the Riemann-Hilbert-Weiss algorithm, which can compute any individual phase factor independent of all other phase factors. Our algorithm is also the first provably stable numerical algorithm for computing phase factors of any arbitrary Szeg\H{o} function. The proof of stability involves solving a Riemann-Hilbert factorization problem in nonlinear Fourier analysis using elements of spectral theory.</description>

      <title>A third-order finite difference weighted essentially non-oscillatory scheme with shallow neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the finite difference weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme based on the neural network for hyperbolic conservation laws. We employ the supervised learning and design two loss functions, one with the mean squared error and the other with the mean squared logarithmic error, where the WENO3-JS weights are computed as the labels. Each loss function consists of two components where the first component compares the difference between the weights from the neural network and WENO3-JS weights, while the second component matches the output weights of the neural network and the linear weights. The former of the loss function enforces the neural network to follow the WENO properties, implying that there is no need for the post-processing layer. Additionally the latter leads to better performance around discontinuities. As a neural network structure, we choose the shallow neural network (SNN) for computational efficiency with the Delta layer consisting of the normalized undivided differences. These constructed WENO3-SNN schemes show the outperformed results in one-dimensional examples and improved behavior in two-dimensional examples, compared with the simulations from WENO3-JS and WENO3-Z.</description>
