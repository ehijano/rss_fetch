      <title>A note on purely infinite corona algebras and extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a separable nuclear C*-algebra, and $\mathcal{B}$ be a nonunital separable simple $\mathcal{Z}$-stable C*-algebra. Continuing the work from Gabe-Lin-Ng, we classify all essential extensions, with large complement, of the form $$0 \rightarrow \mathcal{B} \rightarrow \mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathcal{A} \rightarrow 0,$$ for the following cases: i. $\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{B})$ is properly infinite, and the extension is full. ii. $\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{B})$ is purely infinite (though not necessarily simple). We also have some more general results.</description>

      <title>Voltage quantum graphs and a Gross-Tucker theorem for quantum graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A voltage graph is a finite directed graph whose edges are labeled by elements of a finite group $G$. A classical construction of Gross and Tucker associates to every voltage graph with vertex set $V$ a so-called derived graph with vertex set $V \times G$. We generalize their construction to quantum graphs and finite abelian groups. Remarkably, the construction can produce true quantum graphs starting from a classical voltage graph. In this case the obtained quantum graph is quantum isomorphic to a classical graph. As a main result we also prove a quantum version of the Gross-Tucker theorem which characterizes precisely which graphs can be written as derived graphs of voltage graphs.</description>

      <title>Quantum deformations of the arc length metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a q-deformation of the arc length metric on the unit circle. This q-deformation arises naturally from the Dirac operator by replacing the standard integers by their q-deformed analogues. Nonetheless, we show that the corresponding metric structure only makes sense at the level of quantum metric spaces as introduced by Marc Rieffel. This means that the quantum metric we obtain on the continuous functions on the circle does not arise from a classical metric on the circle. In the special case where q equals one we recover the usual arc length metric and we show that our family of quantum metric spaces depend continuously on the deformation parameter with respect to David Kerr's complete Gromov-Hausdorff distance.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative partial isometries, manageability, and C*-algebraic quantum groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.01995v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalizing the notion of a multiplicative unitary (in the sense of Baaj-Skandalis), which plays a fundamental role in the theory of locally compact quantum groups, we develop in this paper the notion of a multiplicative partial isometry. The axioms include the pentagon equation, but more is needed. Under suitable conditions (such as the "manageability"), it is possible to construct from it a pair of C*-algebras having the structure of a C*-algebraic quantum groupoid of separable type.

The axioms include the pentagon equation, but more is needed. Under the "manageability" condition on a multiplicative partial isometry (modified from the Woronowicz's condition for a multiplicative unitary), it is possible to construct from it a pair of C*-algebras having almost the structure of a C*-algebraic quantum groupoid of separable type.</description>

      <title>Parabolic noncommutative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce to spectral noncommutative geometry the notion of tangled spectral triple, which encompasses the anisotropies arising in parabolic geometry as well as the parabolic commutator bounds arising in so-called "bad Kasparov products". Tangled spectral triples incorporate anisotropy by replacing the unbounded operator in a spectral triple that mimics a Dirac operator with several unbounded operators mimicking directional Dirac operators. We allow for varying and dependent orders in different directions, controlled by using the tools of tropical combinatorics. We study the conformal equivariance of tangled spectral triples as well as how they fit into $K$-homology by means of producing higher order spectral triples. Our main examples are hypoelliptic spectral triples constructed from Rockland complexes on parabolic geometries; we also build spectral triples on nilpotent group $C^*$-algebras from the dual Dirac element and crossed product spectral triples for parabolic dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Free Independence is not definable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Free independence is an important tool for studying the structure of operator algebras. It is natural to ask from the model-theoretic standpoint whether free independence is captured well in first-order model theory via the notion of a definable set. We prove that pairs of freely independent elements do not form a definable set in the sense of continuous model theory, relative to the theory of both C$^*$-probability spaces and tracial von Neumann algebras.</description>
