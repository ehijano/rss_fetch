      <title>The status of the quantum PCP conjecture (games version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In classical complexity theory, the two definitions of probabilistically checkable proofs -- the constraint satisfaction and the nonlocal games version -- are computationally equal in power. In the quantum setting, the situation is far less clear. The result MIP* = RE of Ji et. al. (arXiv:2001.04383) and refinements by Natarajan and Zhang (arXiv:2302.04322) show that multiprover interactive proof systems with polylogarithmically long messages can solve any decision problem in RE, including undecidable problems like the halting problem. These results show that any connection between the "constraint satisfaction" or "Hamiltonian" quantum PCP conjecture and nonlocal games must involve restricting the players in the game to be computationally efficient. This note contains two main results: (1) we give a "quantum games PCP for AM" in the form of a new construction of a succinct MIP* protocol with efficient provers for the canonical AM-complete problem, and (2) we explain an error in the energy amplification procedure of Natarajan and Vidick (arXiv:1710.03062) which invalidates their claim to have constructed a quantum games PCP for a QMA-complete problem. In surveying the obstacles remaining towards a quantum games PCP for QMA, we highlight the importance and challenge of understanding gap amplification for Hamiltonians even when locality is replaced by much weaker constraints, such as bounds on the "Pauli spectrum" of the Hamiltonian. We hope these questions will motivate progress towards new "baby versions" of Hamiltonian quantum PCP conjecture.</description>

      <title>A proof of Ollinger's conjecture: undecidability of tiling the plane with a set of $8$ polyominoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a proof of Ollinger's conjecture that the problem of tiling the plane with translated copies of a set of $8$ polyominoes is undecidable. The techniques employed in our proof include a different orientation for simulating the Wang tiles in polyomino and a new method for encoding the colors of Wang tiles.</description>

      <title>The Expressive Power of Transformers with Chain of Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07923v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent theoretical work has identified surprisingly simple reasoning problems, such as checking if two nodes in a graph are connected or simulating finite-state machines, that are provably unsolvable by standard transformers that answer immediately after reading their input. However, in practice, transformers' reasoning can be improved by allowing them to use a "chain of thought" or "scratchpad", i.e., generate and condition on a sequence of intermediate tokens before answering. Motivated by this, we ask: Does such intermediate generation fundamentally extend the computational power of a decoder-only transformer? We show that the answer is yes, but the amount of increase depends crucially on the amount of intermediate generation. For instance, we find that transformer decoders with a logarithmic number of decoding steps (w.r.t. the input length) push the limits of standard transformers only slightly, while a linear number of decoding steps, assuming a slight generalization to standard pre-norm, adds a clear new ability (under standard complexity conjectures): recognizing all regular languages. Our results also imply that linear steps keep transformer decoders within context-sensitive languages, and polynomial steps with generalized pre-norm make them recognize exactly the class of polynomial-time solvable problems -- the first exact characterization of a type of transformers in terms of standard complexity classes. Together, our results provide a nuanced framework for understanding how the length of a transformer's chain of thought or scratchpad impacts its reasoning power.</description>
