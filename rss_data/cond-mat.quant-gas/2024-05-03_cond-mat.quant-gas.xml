      <title>Tomography of a single-atom-resolved detector in the presence of shot-to-shot number fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tomography of single-particle-resolved detectors is of primary importance for characterizing particle correlations with applications in quantum metrology, quantum simulation and quantum computing. However, it is a non-trivial task in practice due to the unavoidable presence of noise that affects the measurement but does not originate from the detector. In this work, we address this problem for a three-dimensional single-atom-resolved detector where shot-to-shot atom number fluctuations are a central issue to perform a quantum detector tomography. We overcome this difficulty by exploiting the parallel measurement of counting statistics in sub-volumes of the detector, from which we evaluate the effect of shot-to-shot fluctuations and perform a local tomography of the detector. In addition, we illustrate the validity of our method from applying it to Gaussian quantum states with different number statistics. Finally, we show that the response of Micro-Channel Plate detectors is well-described from using a binomial distribution with the detection efficiency as a single parameter.</description>

      <title>On degenerate perturbation theory for the Floquet-Hilbert space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider construction of effective Hamiltonians for periodically driven interacting systems in the case of resonant driving. The standard high-frequency expansion is not expected to converge due to the resonant creation of collective excitations, and one option is to resort to the application of degenerate perturbation theory (DPT) in the extended Floquet-Hilbert space. We propose an extension of DPT whereby the degenerate subspace includes not only the degenerate levels of interest but rather all the states of the system. The resulting approach, which we call extended DPT (EDPT), is shown to resemble a high-frequency expansion, provided the quasienergy matrix is constructed such that each $m$th diagonal block contains energies reduced to the $m$th Floquet zone. The proposed theory is applied to a driven Bose-Hubbard model and is shown to yield more accurate quasienergy spectra than the conventional DPT. The computational complexity of EDPT is intermediate between DPT and the numerically exact approach, thus providing a practical compromise between accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Breaking and trapping Cooper pairs by Rydberg-molecule spectroscopy in atomic Fermi superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a spectroscopic probe of the breaking and localization of Cooper pairs in an atomic Fermi superfluid interacting with a Rydberg impurity. This is achieved by monitoring the formation of diatomic and triatomic ultralong-range molecular species in the superfluid across the BCS - Bose Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover. The triatomic Rydberg molecule in the BEC regime heralds the trapping of a tightly-bound Cooper pair, reminiscent of pion capture in nuclear matter, while the breaking of a Cooper pair on the BCS side by a diatomic Rydberg molecule is evocative of binary-star tidal disruption by a black hole. Spectroscopy of the Fermi superfluid and Rydberg molecules allows for an estimation of the Cooper-pair size while the Rydberg molecule binding energies discern many-body pairing effects.</description>

      <title>Optical Manipulation of Spin States in Ultracold Magnetic Atoms via an Inner-Shell Hz Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lanthanides, like erbium and dysprosium, have emerged as powerful platforms for quantum-gas research due to their diverse properties, including a significant large spin manifold in their absolute ground state. However, effectively exploiting the spin richness necessitates precise manipulation of spin populations, a challenge yet to be fully addressed in this class of atomic species. In this work, we present an all-optical method for deterministically controlling the spin composition of a dipolar bosonic erbium gas, based on a clock-like transition in the telecom window at 1299 nm. The atoms can be prepared in just a few tens of microseconds in any spin-state composition using a sequence of Rabi-pulse pairs, selectively coupling Zeeman sublevels of the ground state with those of the long-lived clock-like state. Finally, we demonstrate that this transition can also be used to create spin-selective light shifts, thus fully suppressing spin-exchange collisions. These experimental results unlock exciting possibilities for implementing advanced spin models in isolated, clean and fully controllable lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Observation of an inverse turbulent-wave cascade in a driven quantum gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observe an inverse turbulent-wave cascade, from small to large lengthscales, in a homogeneous 2D Bose gas driven isotropically on a lengthscale much smaller than its size. Starting with an equilibrium condensed gas, at long drive times we observe a nonthermal steady state. At increasing lengthscales, starting from the forcing one, the steady-state momentum distribution features in turn: (i) a power-law spectrum, with an exponent close to the analytical result for a particle cascade in weak-wave turbulence, and (ii) a spectrum intriguingly reminiscent of a nonthermal fixed point associated with universal coarsening in an isolated 2D gas. In further experiments, based on anisotropic driving, we also reveal the qualitative picture of the cascade-formation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Localized and extended phases in square moir\'e patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random defects do not constitute the unique source of electron localization in two dimensions. Lattice quasidisorder generated from two inplane superimposed rotated, main and secondary, square lattices, namely monolayers where moir\'e patterns are formed, leads to a sharp localized to delocalized single-particle transition. This is demostrated here for both, discrete and continuum models of moir\'e patterns that arise as the twisting angle $\theta$ between main and secondary lattices is varied in the interval $[0, \pi/4]$. Localized to delocalized transition is recognized as the moir\'e patterns depart from being perfect square crystals to non-crystalline structures. Extended single-particle states were found for rotation angles associated with Pythagorean triples that produce perfectly periodic structures. Conversely, angles not arising from such Pythagorean triples lead to non-commensurate or quasidisordered structures, thus originating localized states. These conclusions are drawn from a stationary analysis where the standard IPR parameter measuring localization allowed us to detect the transition. While both, ground state and excited states were analyzed for the discrete model, where the secondary lattice was considered as a perturbation of the main one, the sharp transition was tracked back for the fundamental state in the continuous scenario where the secondary lattice is not a perturbation any more.</description>

      <title>Observation of chiral edge transport in a rapidly-rotating quantum gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10468v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The frictionless, directional propagation of particles at the boundary of topological materials is one of the most striking phenomena in transport. These chiral edge modes lie at the heart of the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects, and their extraordinary robustness against noise and disorder reflects the quantization of Hall conductivity in these systems. Despite their central importance, controllable injection of edge modes, and direct imaging of their propagation, structure, and dynamics, is challenging. Here, we demonstrate the distillation of individual chiral edge states in a rapidly-rotating bosonic superfluid confined by an optical boundary. Tuning the wall sharpness, we reveal the smooth crossover between soft wall behaviour in which the propagation speed is proportional to wall steepness, and the hard wall regime exhibiting chiral free particles. From the skipping motion of atoms along the boundary, we spectroscopically infer the energy gap between the ground and first excited edge bands, and reveal its evolution from the bulk Landau level splitting for a soft boundary, to the hard wall limit.</description>
