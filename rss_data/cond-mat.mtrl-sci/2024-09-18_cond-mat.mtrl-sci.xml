      <title>Growth-Induced Unconventional Magnetic Anisotropy in Co/Fullerene (C60) Bilayer Systems; Insights from a Two-Grain Stoner-Wohlfarth Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic spintronics has drawn the interest of the science community due to various applications in spin-valve devices. However, an efficient room-temperature Organic Spin Valve device has not been experimentally realized due to the complicated spin transport at the metal-organic interfaces. The present study focuses on a comprehensive understanding of the interfacial properties essential for advancing device performance and functionality. The structural and magnetic properties of the ultra-thin Cobalt (Co) films deposited on the fullerene (C60) layer are studied to investigate the origin of magnetic anisotropy in the metal-organic bilayer structures. Due to the mechanical softness of C60, penetration of ferromagnetic Co atoms inside the C60 film is confirmed by the X-ray reflectivity and Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy measurements. Grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering and atomic force microscopy provided information regarding the structural and morphological properties of the Co/C60 bilayers, angular dependent Magneto-optic Kerr effect measurements with varying Co layer thickness provided information about the growth-induced uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. In contrast to the inorganic silicon substrates, magnetic anisotropy in Co film tends to develop at 25 {\AA} thickness on the C60 layer, which further increases with the thickness of Cobalt. The anomalous behavior in coercivity and remanence variation along the nominal hard axis is explained by a two-grain Stoner-Wohlfarth model with intergranular exchange coupling. It is further confirmed by a non-uniform spatial distribution of magnetic domains investigated through Kerr microscopy. These anomalies could be attributed to the distribution of magneto-crystalline anisotropy and inhomogeneous strain caused by the formation of a diffused layer at the Co/C60 interface.</description>

      <title>Single-atom-resolved vibrational spectroscopy of a dislocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonon resistance from dislocation scattering is often divided into short-range core interactions and long-range strain field interactions. Using electron energy-loss spectroscopy on a GaN dislocation, we report observations of vibrational modes localized at specific core atoms (short-range) and strain-driven phonon energy shifts around the dislocation (long-range). Ab initio calculations support these findings and draw out additional details. This study reveals atomically resolved vibrational spectra of dislocations, thus offering insights for engineering improved material functionalities.</description>

      <title>Interfacial spin-orbitronic effects controlled with different oxidation levels at the Co|Al interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions are key interactions in modern spintronics. These interactions are thought to be dominated by the oxidation of the Co|Al interface in the archetypal Platinum-Cobalt-Aluminum oxide system. Here, we observe a double sign change in the anisotropy and about threefold variation in interfacial chiral interaction, influenced not only by the oxidation, but also by the metallic Al thickness. Contrary to previous assumptions about negligible spin-orbit effects at light metal interfaces, we not only observe strong PMA with fully oxidized Al, decreasing and turning negative (in-plane) with less oxygen at the Co|Al interface, we also observe that the magnetic anisotropy reverts to positive (out-of-plane) values at fully metallic Co|Al interface. These findings suggest modification in Co d band via Co|Al orbital hybridization, an effect supported by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and ab initio theory calculations, highlighting the key impact of strain on interfacial mechanisms at fully metallic Co|Al interface.</description>

      <title>Exploring the relation between transonic dislocation glide and stacking fault width in FCC metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theory predicts limiting gliding velocities that dislocations cannot overcome. Computational and recent experiments have shown that these limiting velocities are soft barriers and dislocations can reach transonic speeds in high rate plastic deformation scenarios. In this paper we systematically examine the mobility of edge and screw dislocations in several face centered cubic (FCC) metals (Al, Au, Pt, and Ni) in the extreme large-applied-stress regime using MD simulations. Our results show that edge dislocations are more likely to move at transonic velocities due to their high mobility and lower limiting velocity than screw dislocations. Importantly, among the considered FCC metals, the dislocation core structure determines the dislocation's ability to reach transonic velocities. This is likely due to the variation in stacking fault width (SFW) due to relativistic effects near the limiting velocities.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Origin and Nature of the Buried Metal-Substrate Interface Layer in Ta/Sapphire Superconducting Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite constituting a smaller fraction of the qubits electromagnetic mode, surfaces and interfaces can exert significant influence as sources of high-loss tangents, which brings forward the need to reveal properties of these extended defects and identify routes to their control. Here, we examine the structure and composition of the metal-substrate interfacial layer that exists in Ta/sapphire-based superconducting films. Synchrotron-based X-ray reflectivity measurements of Ta films, commonly used in these qubits, reveal an unexplored interface layer at the metal-substrate interface. Scanning transmission electron microscopy and core-level electron energy loss spectroscopy identified an approximately 0.65 \ \text{nm} \pm 0.05 \ \text{nm} thick intermixing layer at the metal-substrate interface containing Al, O, and Ta atoms. Density functional theory (DFT) modeling reveals that the structure and properties of the Ta/sapphire heterojunctions are determined by the oxygen content on the sapphire surface prior to Ta deposition, as discussed for the limiting cases of Ta films on the O-rich versus Al-rich Al2O3 (0001) surface. By using a multimodal approach, integrating various material characterization techniques and DFT modeling, we have gained deeper insights into the interface layer between the metal and substrate. This intermixing at the metal-substrate interface influences their thermodynamic stability and electronic behavior, which may affect qubit performance.</description>

      <title>Growth and Spectroscopic Properties of Pr$^{3+}$ Doped Lu$_2$S$_3$ SingleCrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the first time Lu$_2$S$_3$ (undoped and Pr-doped) single crystals were successfully grown from melt using micro-pulling-down (mPD) technique. Customization of halide mPD apparatus allowed us to grow rod-shaped (\O 2 mm and length around 20 mm) crystals of Lu$_2$S$_3$ with high melting temperature (~1750 $^\circ$C). X-ray powder diffraction revealed that the grown crystals exhibit the {\epsilon}-Lu$_2$S$_3$ crystal structure ($\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ type, space group R-3c). Optical and scintillation properties of both the undoped and Pr$^{3+}$ doped Lu$_2$S$_3$ were investigated. Fast 5d-4f Pr$^{3+}$ luminescence was observed in both photoluminescence and radioluminescence spectra. The presented technology is an effective tool for the exploration of a large family of high-melting sulfides. Such materials show promise for application as scintillators, active laser media, and optoelectronic components.</description>

      <title>Swift heavy ions in polyethylene: simulation of damage formation along the path</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results of atomic-level simulations of damage formation along the paths of swift heavy ions (SHI) decelerated in the electronic stopping regime in amorphous polyethylene. The applied model combines the Monte-Carlo code TREKIS-3, which describes excitation of the electronic and atomic systems around the ion trajectory, with molecular dynamics simulations of the response of the atomic system to the excitation. The simulation results were used to reconstruct the damage configuration, shape and size of the damaged region. We demonstrated that the positions of the maximum energy loss and maximum damage on the ion trajectory do not coincide, being separated by more than 10 micrometers. The difference between the thresholds of damage production by ions with energies realizing the opposite shoulders of the Bragg curve of the electronic stopping was found. We also analyzed the spatial distribution of chemically active fragments of polyethylene chains formed around the ion trajectory as a function of SHI energy.</description>

      <title>Observation of hydrostatic-pressure-modulated giant caloric effect and electronic topological transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase transition is a fundamental phenomenon in condensed matter physics, in which states of matter transform to each other with various critical behaviors under different conditions. The magnetic martensitic transformation features significant multi-caloric effects that benefit the solid-state cooling or heat pumping. Meanwhile, the electronic topological transition (ETT) driven by pressure has been rarely reported in martensitic systems. Here, the modulation effects of hydrostatic pressure on phase transitions in a magnetic martensitic alloy are reported. Owing to the huge volume expansion during the transition, the martensitic transition temperature is driven from 339 to 273 K by pressure within 1 GPa, resulting in highly tunable giant baro- and magneto-caloric effects (BCE and MCE) in a wide working temperature range. Interestingly, an ETT was further induced by pressure in the martensite phase, with a sudden drop of the measured saturation magnetization around 0.6 GPa. First-principles calculations reveal a sharp change in the density of states (DOS) due to the orbit shift around the Fermi level at the same pressure and reproduce the experimental observation of magnetization. Besides, the ETT is accompanied by remarkable changes in the lattice parameters and the unit-cell orthorhombicity. The study provides insight into pressure-modulated exotic phase-transition phenomena in magnetic martensitic systems.</description>

      <title>Observation of atomically displacive transformation out of the boundary-reconstructive phase competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the phase transitions, diverse states evolve with multiplex phenomena arising from the critical competition. In this study, a displacive martensitic transformation with a lattice shear distortion was unexpectedly observed at the reconstructive phase boundary that usually connects multiple phases without crystallographic relation, in a Ni-Co-Mn-V all-d-metal alloy system. Experiments and theoretical calculations suggest that the parent phase becomes increasingly unstable when approaching the phase boundary. The lattice-distorted transformation with moderate first-order nature survives due to the critical phase competition from the structural frustration, in which the comparable energy and the diminished formation preference of different phases emerge. In this critical state, the phase selection including the martensitic phase transformation can be tuned by external fields such as rapid cooling, annealing and magnetic field. Our research reveals a novel manner to destabilize the parent phase, through which one could attain new functional materials based on the phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Magneto transport and first principle study of strong topological insulator gray Arsenic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we report the synthesis of a single crystalline gray Arsenic (As) via the Bismuth flux method. The as-grown sample has a Rhombohedral structure as the most stable one. Its XRD (X-ray Diffractometry) pattern ensures a single phase of the grown crystal with space group R-3m. The observed sharp XRD peaks on mechanically exfoliated thin flakes ensured the high crystallinity with growth direction along the c-axis. The EDAX (Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis) endorses the stoichiometric purity of the as-grown As single crystal. To study the vibrational mode, the Raman spectra are recorded, which show peaks at 196.2 cm-1 and 255.74 cm-1, identified as Eg and A1g modes by DFT calculations. The sample is further characterized by electronic and magneto-transport measurements. The resistivity vs temperature measurement illustrates its metallic nature in the temperature range of 2K to 300K. The measured residual resistivity ratio of the sample is 180, which endorses the high quality of the as-synthesized As single crystal. The RH measurement elucidates huge observed magnetoresistance (MR), along with SdH oscillations, which indicate the presence of topological surface states. The topological nature of As is also confirmed by first principle calculations. Not only orbit projected bands show signatures of band inversion but also the Z2invariant value(1,111) calculated by Wilson loop method affirms As to be a strong topological insulator (TI).</description>

      <title>A High-Dimensional Neural Network Potential for Co$_3$O$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Co$_3$O$_4$ spinel is an important material in oxidation catalysis. Its properties under catalytic conditions, i.e., at finite temperatures, can be studied by molecular dynamics simulations, which critically depend on an accurate description of the atomic interactions. Due to the high complexity of Co$_3$O$_4$, which is related to the presence of multiple oxidation states of the cobalt ions, to date \textit{ab initio} methods have been essentially the only way to reliably capture the underlying potential energy surface, while more efficient atomistic potentials are very challenging to construct. Consequently, the accessible length and time scales of computer simulations of systems containing Co$_3$O$_4$ are still severely limited. Rapid advances in the development of modern machine learning potentials (MLPs) trained on electronic structure data now make it possible to bridge this gap. In this work, we employ a high-dimensional neural network potential (HDNNP) to construct a MLP for bulk Co$_3$O$_4$ spinel based on density functional theory calculations. After a careful validation of the potential, we compute various structural, vibrational, and dynamical properties of the Co$_3$O$_4$ spinel with a particular focus on its temperature-dependent behavior, including the thermal expansion coefficient.</description>

      <title>Data-driven stochastic 3D modeling of the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase in battery cathodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A stochastic 3D modeling approach for the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase in hierarchically structured cathodes of lithium-ion batteries is presented. The binder-conductive additive phase of these electrodes consists of carbon black, polyvinylidene difluoride binder and graphite particles. For its stochastic 3D modeling, a three-step procedure based on methods from stochastic geometry is used. First, the graphite particles are described by a Boolean model with ellipsoidal grains. Second, the mixture of carbon black and binder is modeled by an excursion set of a Gaussian random field in the complement of the graphite particles. Third, large pore regions within the mixture of carbon black and binder are described by a Boolean model with spherical grains. The model parameters are calibrated to 3D image data of cathodes in lithium-ion batteries acquired by focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy. Subsequently, model validation is performed by comparing model realizations with measured image data in terms of various morphological descriptors that are not used for model fitting. Finally, we use the stochastic 3D model for predictive simulations, where we generate virtual, yet realistic, image data of nanoporous binder-conductive additives with varying amounts of graphite particles. Based on these virtual nanostructures, we can investigate structure-property relationships. In particular, we quantitatively study the influence of graphite particles on effective transport properties in the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase, which have a crucial impact on electrochemical processes in the cathode and thus on the performance of battery cells.</description>

      <title>Structure evolution path of ferroelectric hafnium zirconium oxide nanocrystals under in-situ biasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluorite-type $\mathrm{HfO_2}$-based ferroelectric (FE) oxides have rekindled interest in FE memories due to their compatibility with silicon processing and potential for high-density integration. The polarization characteristics of FE devices are governed by the dynamics of metastable domain structure evolution. Insightful design of FE devices for encoding and storage necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the internal structural evolution. Here, we demonstrate the evolution of domain structures through a transient polar orthorhombic (O)-$Pmn2_1$-like configuration via $in$-$situ$ biasing on $\mathrm{TiN/Hf_{0.5}Zr_{0.5}O_2/TiN}$ capacitors within spherical aberration-corrected transmission electron microscope, combined with theoretical calculations. Furthermore, it is directly evidenced that the non-FE O-$Pbca$ transforms into the FE O-$Pca2_1$ phase under electric field, with the polar axis of the FE-phase aligning towards the bias direction through ferroelastic transformation, thereby enhancing FE polarization. As cycling progresses further, however, the polar axis collapses, leading to FE degradation. These novel insights into the intricate structural evolution path under electrical field cycling facilitate optimization and design strategies for $\mathrm{HfO_2}$-based FE memory devices.</description>

      <title>Giant magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy in Fe--Co alloy under uniaxial compression: first-principles prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uniaxially strained Fe--Co disordered alloys have emerged as promising candidates for cost-effective rare-earth-free permanent magnets due to their high magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE). Using first-principles, fully relativistic calculations within the coherent potential approximation and PBE exchange-correlation potential, we explore the MAE of tetragonal Fe--Co alloys under uniaxial compression. Our results reveal a previously uncharted high-MAE region, distinct from known structures and accessible through uniaxial compression.</description>

      <title>Electronic vs. phononic thermal transport in Cr-doped V2O3 thin films across the Mott transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the thermal conductivity of chromium doped V2O3 is crucial for optimizing the design of selectors for memory and neuromorphic devices. We utilized the time-domain thermoreflectance technique to measure the thermal conductivity of chromium doped V2O3 across varying concentrations, spanning the doping induced metal-insulator transition. In addition, different oxygen stoichiometries and film thicknesses were investigated in their crystalline and amorphous phases. Chromium doping concentration (0%-30%) and the degree of crystallinity emerged as the predominant factors influencing the thermal properties, while the effect of oxygen flow (600-1400 ppm) during deposition proved to be negligible. Our observations indicate that even in the metallic phase of V2O3, the lattice contribution is the dominant factor in thermal transport with no observable impact from the electrons on heat transport. Finally, the thermal conductivity of both amorphous and crystalline V2O3 was measured at cryogenic temperatures (80-450 K). Our thermal conductivity measurements as a function of temperature reveal that both phases exhibit behavior similar to amorphous materials, indicating pronounced phonon scattering effects in the crystalline phase of V2O3.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet cross-luminescence in ternary chlorides of alkali and alkaline-earth metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After the discovery of a cross-luminescence (CL) in BaF2 in 1982, a large number of CL scintillators were investigated. However, no CL scintillator superior to BaF2 has been discovered, and the research of CL scintillators has subsided. Recent technological development in medical imaging and high-energy physics created a new demand for ultra-fast scintillators further supported by the development of UV-sensitive semiconductor photodetectors. As a consequence, renewed interest in CL scintillators appeared. To satisfy the requirements of fast timing applications high photo-detection efficiency, e. i. a good spectral match between the scintillator and photodetector must be achieved. Cesium-based ternary chlorides could provide a red-shift (~1.5 eV) of CL towards the sensitive region of the photodetector (PMT or SiPM) while keeping light output and timing characteristics comparable to BaF2.</description>

      <title>Probing band topology in ABAB and ABBA stacked twisted double bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted graphene moire superlattice has been demonstrated as an exotic platform for investigating correlated states and nontrivial topology. Among the moire family, twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) is a tunable flat band system expected to show stacking-dependent topological properties. However, electron correlations and the band topology are usually intertwined in the flat band limit, rendering the unique topological property due to stacking still elusive. Focusing on a large-angle TDBG with weak electron correlations, here we probe the Landau level (LL) spectra in two differently stacked TDBG, i.e. ABBA- and ABAB-TDBG, to unveil their distinct topological properties. For ABBA-TDBG, we observe non-trivial topology at zero electric displacement filed, evident from both the emergence of Chern bands from half fillings and the closure of gap at CNP above a critical magnetic field. For ABAB-TDBG, by contrast, we find that the moire band is topologically trivial, supported by the absence of LLs from half fillings and the persistence of the gap at CNP above the critical magnetic fields. In addition, we also observe an evolution of the trivial-to-nontrivial topological transition at finite D fields, confirmed by the emerged Landau fans originating from quarter filling v = 1. Our result demonstrates, for the first time, the unique stacking-dependent topology in TDBG, offering a promising avenue for future investigations on topological states in correlated systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phosphorene, a puckered two-dimensional allotrope of phosphorus, has sparked considerable interest in recent years due to its potential especially for optoelectronic applications with its layer-number-dependant direct band gap and strongly bound excitons. However, detailed experimental characterization of its intrinsic defects as well as its defect creation characteristics under electron irradiation are scarce. Here, we report on the creation and stability of a variety of defect configurations under 60 kV electron irradiation in mono- and bilayer phosphorene including the first experimental reports of stable adatom-vacancy-complexes. Displacement cross section measurements in bilayer phosphorene yield a value of 7.7 +- 1.4 barn with an estimated lifetime of adatom-vacancy-complexes of 19.9 +- 0.7 s, while some are stable for up to 68 s under continuous electron irradiation. Surprisingly, ab initio-based simulations indicate that the complexes should readily recombine, even in structures strained by up to 3 %. The presented results will help to improve the understanding of the wide variety of defects in phosphorene, their creation, and their stability, which may enable new pathways for defect engineered phosphorene devices.</description>

      <title>Length scales in electrolytes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The elusive presence of an anomalously increasing screening length at high ionic concentrations hampers a complete picture of interactions in electrolytes. Theories which extend the diluted Debye-Huckel framework to higher concentrations predict, in addition to the expected decreasing Debye length, an increasing significant scale of the order of at most a few ionic diameters. More recent surface force balance experiments with different materials succeeded in measuring increasing length scales which, however, turn out to extend over tenths or even hundreds of ionic diameters. While simulation work has managed to characterize the former, the latter still avoid detection, generating doubts about its true origin. Here we provide a step forward in the clarification of such a conundrum. We have studied by extensive Molecular Dynamics simulation the properties of a generic model of electrolyte, lithium tetrafluoroborate dissolved in ethylene-carbonate, in a vast range of salt concentrations continuously joining the Debye non-interacting limit to the opposite over-charged ionic liquid-like states. On one side, we have accurately determined the macroscopic concentration-induced structural, dielectric and transport modifications, on the other we have quantified the resulting nano-scale ions organization. Based only on the simulation data, without resorting to any uncontrolled hypothesis or phenomenological parameter, we identify a convincing candidate for the measured anomalously increasing length, whose origin has been possibly misinterpreted.</description>

      <title>Phonon Thermal Transport between Two in-Plane, Two-Dimensional Nanoribbons in the Extreme Near-Field Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phonon thermal conductance of sub-nanometric vacuum gaps between two in-plane nanoribbons of two-dimensional materials (graphene and silicene) is analyzed using the atomistic Green's function method and by employing the Tersoff and Lennard-Jones potentials for describing the interatomic interactions. It is found that the phonon conductance decays exponentially with the size of the gap. Three exponential regimes have been identified. In the regime where the Lennard-Jones (L-J) potential is driven by the repulsive interatomic forces, caused by the overlap of electronic orbits, there is a sharp exponential decay in conductance as the gap increases (exp(-10.0d) for graphene). When both the repulsive and attractive (van der Waals) interatomic forces contribute to the L-J potential, the decay rate of the conductance significantly reduces to exp(-2.0d) for graphene and exp(-2.5d) for silicene. In the regime where attractive van der Waals forces dominate the L-J potential, phonon conductance has the slowest exponential decay as exp(-1.3d) for both silicene and graphene. It is also found that the contribution from the optical phonons to the conductance is non-negligible only for very small gaps between graphene nanoribbons (d &lt; 1.6 \AA). The phonon conductance of the gap is shown to vary with the width of the nanoribbon very modestly, such that the thermal conductivity of the gap linearly increases with the nanoribbon widths. The results of this study are of significance for fundamental understanding of heat transfer in the extreme near-field regime and for predicting the effect of interfaces and defects on heat transfer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02037v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new method for dark field imaging is introduced which uses scanned electron diffraction (or 4DSTEM - 4-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy) datasets as its input. Instead of working on simple summation of intensity, it works on a sparse representation of the diffraction patterns in terms of a list of their diffraction peaks. This is tested on a thin perovskite film containing structural ordering resulting in additional superlattice spots that reveal details of domain structures, and is shown to give much better selectivity and contrast than conventional virtual dark field imaging. It is also shown to work well in polycrystalline aggregates of CuO nanoparticles. In view of the higher contrast and selectivity, and the complete exclusion of diffuse scattering from the image formation, it is expected to be of significant benefit for characterisation of a wide variety of crystalline materials.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic metal-organic frameworks (MMOFs), where magnetic metal nodes are connected into a crystal structure by organic linkers, have a potential to host exotic magnetic states. We present a study of bulk magnetic properties of four metal-organic frameworks with the same boron imidazolate linkers, Cu-BIF, Co-BIF, Ni-BIF, and newly synthesized Zn-BIF, displaying a variety of lattice structures and nontrivial magnetic behaviors. While non-magnetic Zn-BIF provides an offset of magnetic response, magnetic susceptibility measurements of the other three magnetic materials demonstrate the presence of weak magnetic interactions in these MOFs, which differ between materials by sign and size. Cu-BIF, where magnetic nodes are connected into octahedral cages, shows simple paramagnetic behavior. Triangular lattice Co-MOF shows antiferromagnetic interactions on the order of 1 K, and a spin-crossover-like effect in magnetic susceptibility due to thermal depopulation of excited crystal electric field levels. Magnetic properties of Ni-BIF suggest sizable ferromagnetic interactions. Using DC/AC susceptibility and variable-field DC magnetization, we detect cluster spin-glass behavior and discuss possible microscopic origins of this behavior. This work demonstrates the variety of magnetic properties that are possible with a single organic ligand, and establishes the low energy scale of magnetic interactions through superexchange in boron imidazolate frameworks.</description>

Abstract: Macroscopic properties of materials stem from fundamental atomic-scale details, yet for insulators, resolving surface structures remains a challenge. The basal (0001) plane of ${\alpha}$-Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ was imaged with noncontact atomic force microscopy with an atomically-defined tip apex. The surface forms a complex $({\sqrt31} {\times} {\sqrt31})R{\pm}9{\deg}$ reconstruction. The lateral positions of the individual O and Al surface atoms come directly from experiment; how these connect to the underlying crystal bulk was determined based on computational modeling. Before the restructuring, the surface Al atoms assume an unfavorable, threefold planar coordination; the reconstruction allows a rehybridization with subsurface O that leads to a substantial energy gain. The reconstructed surface remains stoichiometric, Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$.</description>

      <title>Short-range order and local distortions in entropy stabilized oxides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An idealized high entropy oxide is characterized by perfect chemical disorder and perfect positional order. In this work, we investigate the extent to which short-range order (SRO) and local structural distortions impede that idealized scenario. Working in the entropy stabilized $\alpha$-PbO$_2$ structure, we compare a two-component system, (Ti,Zr)O$_2$, with a four-component system, (Ti,Zr,Hf,Sn)O$_2$, using a combination of experimental and computational approaches. Special quasi-random structures are used in conjunction with density functional theory calculations to investigate the local distortions around specific elements revealing significant local distortions that are relatively insensitive to the number of chemical constituents. Using finite temperature Monte Carlo simulations, we are able to reproduce the previously experimentally observed SRO and transition temperature for the two-component system. However, the ideal configurational entropy is never reached, so SRO is expected even at synthesis temperatures. On the other hand, the order-disorder transition temperature is dramatically lower and experimentally inaccessible for the four-component system, while the configurational entropy is closer to ideal and less sensitive to temperature. Total scattering measurements and pair distribution function analysis of slow-cooled and quenched samples support this view. In general, we demonstrate that SRO effects in high entropy materials are less prevalent as more components are added in, provided the pairwise interaction strengths remain comparable, while local distortions are less affected by the number of components.</description>

      <title>Cylindrical Cavity Expansion: A Novel Method for Characterizing the Mechanical Properties of Soft Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The low elastic modulus of soft materials, combined with geometric nonlinearity and rate dependence, presents significant challenges in the characterization of their mechanical response. We introduce a novel method for measuring the mechanical properties of soft materials under large deformations via cylindrical cavity expansion. In this method, a cylindrical cavity is fabricated in the material and expanded by volume-controlled injection of an incompressible fluid with simultaneous measurement of the applied pressure at the cavity wall. The relationship between applied pressure and deformation at the cavity wall is then employed to characterize the nonlinear mechanical properties. We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method and validate it by measuring the mechanical properties of synthetic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and comparing with reported values in the literature. Results indicate that the cylindrical cavitation method effectively captures the response of PDMS over a wide range of stiffness (shear modulus ranging from 5 kPa to 300 kPa) and exhibit high repeatability. The proposed method overcomes limitations in characterization of ultra-soft materials using traditional testing methods, such as challenges with fabrication and clamping in unaxial tension testing and friction and adhesion effects in compression and indentation testing, thus enabling accurate and precise characterization. It also offers improved accuracy and repeatability over other needle induced cavity expansion methods due to precise control over the initial cavity dimension and shape at the cost of increased invasiveness of testing.</description>

      <title>Colossal magneto-excitonic effects in 2D van der Waals magnetic semiconductor CrSBr</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 2D magnetic semiconductors, which intrinsically couple a rich landscape of magnetic orders with tightly bound electron-hole pairs (excitons), present an exciting platform to investigate the interplay between optical and magnetic phenomena at the atomic scale. In such systems, the strength of magneto-optical effects determines how deeply the magnetic properties can be revealed. Here, we report the observation of remarkably strong magneto-excitonic effects in the 2D magnetic semiconductor CrSBr that allow probing its magnetic order with unprecedented sensitivity. By investigating optical transitions above the fundamental exciton energy, we discover a massive spectral shift approaching 100 meV under applied magnetic fields - an order of magnitude larger than previously observed magneto-excitonic responses. Our comprehensive magneto-optical experiments accompanied by detailed DFT calculations indicate the possible origin of the transitions exhibiting such intriguing behavior. These findings open avenues for exploiting magneto-excitonic phenomena at newly accessible regimes, enabling novel opto-spintronic applications previously limited by weak magnetic responses.</description>

Abstract: Capillarity-driven transport in nanoporous solids is widespread in nature and crucial for modern liquid-infused engineering materials. During imbibition, curved menisci driven by high negative Laplace pressures exert an enormous contractile load on the porous matrix. Due to the challenge of simultaneously monitoring imbibition and deformation with high spatial resolution, the resulting coupling of solid elasticity to liquid capillarity has remained largely unexplored. Here, we study water imbibition in mesoporous silica using optical imaging, gravimetry, and high-resolution dilatometry. In contrast to an expected Laplace pressure-induced contraction, we find a square-root-of-time expansion and an additional abrupt length increase when the menisci reach the top surface. The final expansion is absent when we stop the imbibition front inside the porous medium in a dynamic imbibition-evaporation equilibrium, as is typical for transpiration-driven hydraulic transport in plants, especially in trees. These peculiar deformation behaviors are validated by single-nanopore molecular dynamics simulations and described by a continuum model that highlights the importance of expansive surface stresses at the pore walls (Bangham effect) and the buildup or release of contractile Laplace pressures as menisci collectively advance, arrest, or disappear. Our model suggests that these observations apply to any imbibition process in nanopores, regardless of the liquid/solid combination, and that the Laplace contribution upon imbibition is precisely half that of vapor sorption, due to the linear pressure drop associated with viscous flow. Thus, simple deformation measurements can be used to quantify surface stresses and Laplace pressures or transport in a wide variety of natural and artificial porous media.</description>

      <title>Terahertz-induced tunnel ionization drives coherent Raman-active phonon in Bismuth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Driving coherent lattice motion with THz pulses has emerged as a novel pathway for achieving dynamic stabilization of exotic phases that are inaccessible in equilibrium quantum materials. In this work, we present a previously unexplored mechanism for THz excitation of Raman-active phonons in semimetals. We show that intense THz pulses centered at 1 THz can excite the Raman-active $A_{1g}$ phonon mode at 2.9 THz in a bismuth film. We rule out the possibilities of the phonon being excited through conventional anharmonic coupling to other modes or via a THz sum frequency process. Instead, we demonstrate that the THz-driven tunnel ionization provides a plausible means of creating a displacive driving force to initiate the phonon oscillations. Our work highlights a new mechanism for exciting coherent phonons, offering potential for dynamic control over the electronic and structural properties of semimetals and narrow-band semiconductors on ultrafast timescales.</description>
