      <title>A posteriori error estimates for mixed-dimensional Darcy flow using non-matching grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we extend the a posteriori error estimates for hierarchical mixed-dimensional elliptic equations developed in [Varela et al., J. Numer. Math., 48 (2023), pp. 247-280] to the setting of non-matching mixed-dimensional grids. The extension is achieved by introducing transfer grids between the planar subdomain and interface grids, together with stable discrete projection operators for primal (potential) and dual (flux) variables. The proposed non-matching estimators remain fully guaranteed and computable. Numerical experiments, including three-dimensional problems based on community benchmarks for incompressible Darcy flow in fractured porous media, demonstrate reliable performance of the estimators for the non-matching grids and effectivity that is comparable to the estimators for matching grids.</description>

      <title>A Taxonomy of Numerical Differentiation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentiation is a cornerstone of computing and data analysis in every discipline of science and engineering. Indeed, most fundamental physics laws are expressed as relationships between derivatives in space and time. However, derivatives are rarely directly measurable and must instead be computed, often from noisy, potentially corrupt data streams. There is a rich and broad literature of computational differentiation algorithms, but many impose extra constraints to work correctly, e.g. periodic boundary conditions, or are compromised in the presence of noise and corruption. It can therefore be challenging to select the method best-suited to any particular problem. Here, we review a broad range of numerical methods for calculating derivatives, present important contextual considerations and choice points, compare relative advantages, and provide basic theory for each algorithm in order to assist users with the mathematical underpinnings. This serves as a practical guide to help scientists and engineers match methods to application domains. We also provide an open-source Python package, PyNumDiff, which contains a broad suite of methods for differentiating noisy data.</description>

      <title>High Order Numerical Methods Preserving Invariant Domain for Hyperbolic and Related Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Admissible states in hyperbolic systems and related equations often form a convex invariant domain. Numerical violations of this domain can lead to loss of hyperbolicity, resulting in illposedness and severe numerical instabilities. It is therefore crucial for numerical schemes to preserve the invariant domain to ensure both physically meaningful solutions and robust computations. For complex systems, constructing invariant-domain-preserving (IDP) schemes is highly nontrivial and particularly challenging for high-order accurate methods. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of IDP schemes for hyperbolic and related systems, with a focus on the most popular approaches for constructing provable IDP schemes. We first give a systematic review of the fundamental approaches for establishing the IDP property in first-order accurate schemes, covering finite difference, finite volume, finite element, and residual distribution methods. Then we focus on two widely used and actively developed classes of high order IDP schemes as well as their recent developments, most of which have emerged in the past decade. The first class of methods seeks an intrinsic weak IDP property in high-order schemes and then designs polynomial limiters to enforce a strong IDP property at the points of interest. This generic approach applies to high-order finite volume and discontinuousGalerkin schemes. The second class is based on the flux limiting approaches, which originated from the flux-corrected transport method and can be adapted to a broader range of spatial discretizations, including finite difference and continuous finite element methods. In this survey, we elucidate the main ideas in the construction of IDP schemes, provide some new perspectives and insights, with extensive examples, and numerical experiments in gas dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Neural Network-Finite Element Method for the Viscous-Plastic Sea-Ice Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient hybrid Neural Network-Finite Element Method (NN-FEM) for solving the viscous-plastic (VP) sea-ice model. The VP model is widely used in climate simulations to represent large-scale sea-ice dynamics. However, the strong nonlinearity introduced by the material law makes VP solvers computationally expensive, with the cost per degree of freedom increasing rapidly under mesh refinement. High spatial resolution is particularly required to capture narrow deformation bands known as linear kinematic features in viscous-plastic models. To improve computational efficiency in simulating such fine-scale deformation features, we propose to enrich coarse-mesh finite element approximations with fine-scale corrections predicted by neural networks trained with high-resolution simulations. The neural network operates locally on small patches of grid elements, which is efficient due to its relatively small size and parallel applicability across grid patches. An advantage of this local approach is that it generalizes well to different right-hand sides and computational domains, since the network operates on small subregions rather than learning details tied to a specific choice of boundary conditions, forcing, or geometry. The numerical examples quantify the runtime and evaluate the error for this hybrid approach with respect to the simulation of sea-ice deformations. Applying the learned network correction enables coarser-grid simulations to achieve qualitatively similar accuracy at approximately 11 times lower computational cost relative to the high-resolution reference simulations. Moreover, the learned correction accelerates the Newton solver by up to 10% compared to runs without the correction at the same mesh resolution.</description>

      <title>Energy-Based Modeling and Structure-Preserving Discretization of Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a comprehensive mathematical framework for energy-based modeling of physical systems, with particular emphasis on preserving fundamental structural properties throughout the modeling and discretization process. The approach provides systematic methods for handling challenging system classes including high-index differential-algebraic equations and nonlinear multiphysics problems. Theoretical foundations are established for regularizing constrained systems while maintaining physical consistency, analyzing stability properties, and constructing numerical discretizations that inherit the energy dissipation structure of the continuous models. The versatility and practical utility of the framework are demonstrated through applications across multiple domains including poroelastic media, nonlinear circuits, constrained mechanics, and phase-field models. The results ensure that essential physical properties such as energy balance and dissipation are maintained from the continuous formulation through to numerical implementation, providing robust foundations for computational physics and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Higher-order multi-scale computational method and its convergence analysis for hygro-thermo-mechanical coupling problems of quasi-periodic composite structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel higher-order multi-scale (HOMS) computational method, which is highly targeted for efficient, high-accuracy and low-computational-cost simulation of hygro-thermo-mechanical (H-T-M) coupling problems in quasi-periodic composite structures. The first innovation of this work is that the establishment of the high-accuracy multi-scale model incorporating the higher-order correction terms for H-T-M coupling problems of quasi-periodic composite structures. The second innovation of this work is that the error analyses in the point-wise and integral senses are rigorously derived for multi-scale asymptotic solutions. Especially from the point-wise error analysis, the primary impetus for current study to develop the HOMS approach for quasi-periodic composite structures is illustrated. Furthermore, an high-accuracy multi-scale numerical algorithm is developed based on finite element method, while corresponding convergent analysis is also obtained. Finally, extensive numerical experiments are conducted to validate the computational performance of the proposed HOMS computational approach, demonstrating not only exceptional numerical accuracy, but also reduced computational cost.</description>

      <title>Fast operator learning for mapping correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a fast, optimization-free method for learning the transition operators of high-dimensional Markov processes. The central idea is to perform a Galerkin projection of the transition operator to a suitable set of low-order bases that capture the correlations between the dimensions. Such a discretized operator can be obtained from moments corresponding to our choice of basis without curse of dimensionality. Furthermore, by exploiting its low-rank structure and the spatial decay of correlations, we can obtain a compressed representation with computational complexity of order $\mathcal{O}(dN)$, where $d$ is the dimensionality and $N$ is the sample size. We further theoretically analyze the approximation error of the proposed compressed representation. We numerically demonstrate that the learned operator allows efficient prediction of future events and solving high-dimensional boundary value problems. This gives rise to a simple linear algebraic method for high-dimensional rare-events simulations.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Solver to Helmholtz Equations by Recontruction Discontinuous Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, an efficient solver for the Helmholtz equation using a noval approximation space is developed. The ingradients of the method include the approximation space recently proposed, a discontinuous Galerkin scheme extensively used, and a linear system solver with a natural preconditioner. Comparing to traditional discontinuous Galerkin methods, we refer to the new method as being more efficient in the following sense. The numerical performance of the new method shows that: 1) much less error can be reached using the same degrees of freedom; 2) the sparse matrix therein has much fewer nonzero entries so that both the storage space and the solution time cost for the iterative solver are reduced; 3) the preconditioner is proved to be optimal with respect to the mesh size in the absorbing case. Such advantage becomes more pronounced as the approximation order increases.</description>

      <title>A higher-order three-scale computational method for efficient nonlinear thermo-mechanical coupling simulation of heterogeneous structures with multiple spatial scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical multi-scale methods involving two spatial scales face significant challenges when simulating heterogeneous structures with complicated three-scale spatial configurations. This study proposes an innovative higher-order three-scale (HOTS) computational method, aimed at accurately and efficiently computing the transient nonlinear thermo-mechanical coupling problems of heterogeneous structures with multiple spatial scales. In these heterogeneous structures, temperature-dependent material properties have an important impact on the thermo-mechanical coupling responses, which is the particular interest in this work. At first, the detailed macro-meso-micro correlative model with higher-order correction terms is established by recursively two-scale analysis between macro-meso and meso-micro scales, which enables high-accuracy analysis of temperature-dependent nonlinear thermo-mechanical behaviors of heterogeneous structures with complicated three-scale configurations. The local error analysis mathematically illustrates the well-balanced property of HOTS computational model, endowing it with high computational accuracy. In addition, a two-stage numerical algorithm with off-line and on-line stages is proposed in order to efficiently simulate the nonlinear thermo-mechanical responses of heterogeneous structures with three-level spatial scales and accurately capture their highly oscillatory information at micro-scale. Finally, the high computational efficiency, high numerical accuracy and low computational cost of the presented higher-order three-scale computational approach are substantiated via representative numerical experiments. It can be summarized that this scalable and robust HOTS computational approach offers a reliably numerical tool for nonlinear multiphysics simulation of large-scale heterogeneous structures in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>The Complex-Step Integral Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the well-established connection between the Hilbert transform and derivative operators, and motivated by recent developments in complex-step differentiation, we introduce the Complex-Step Integral Transform (CSIT): a generalized integral transform that combines analytic continuation, derivative approximation, and multi-scale smoothing within a unified framework. A spectral analysis shows that the CSIT preserves phase while suppressing high-wavenumber noise, offering advantages over conventional Fourier derivatives. We discuss the roles of the real and imaginary step parameters, compare FFT-based and interpolation-based implementations, and demonstrate the method on the advection equation and instantaneous-frequency computation. Results show that the CSIT yields smoother, more robust attributes than Hilbert-based methods and provides built-in stabilization for PDE solvers. The CSIT thus represents a flexible alternative for numerical differentiation, spectral analysis, and seismic signal processing. The method opens several avenues for future work, including non-periodic implementations, adaptive parameter selection, and integration with local interpolation frameworks such as high-order Finite-Element methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Communication-avoiding Krylov methods require solving small dense Gram systems at each outer iteration. We present a low-synchronization approach based on Forward Gauss--Seidel (FGS), which exploits the structure of Gram matrices arising from Chebyshev polynomial bases. We show that a single FGS sweep is mathematically equivalent to Modified Gram--Schmidt (MGS) orthogonalization in the $A$-norm and provide corresponding backward error bounds. For weak scaling on AMD MI-series GPUs, we demonstrate that 20--30 FGS iterations preserve scalability up to 64 GPUs with problem sizes exceeding 700 million unknowns. We further extend this approach to Algebraic MultiGrid (AMG) coarse-grid solves, removing the need to assemble or factor dense coarse operators</description>

      <title>A Simple Weak Galerkin Finite Element Method for the Reissner-Mindlin Plate Model on Non-Convex Polytopal Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a simple weak Galerkin (WG) finite element method for the Reissner-Mindlin plate model that partially eliminates the need for traditionally employed stabilizers. The proposed approach accommodates general, including non-convex, polytopal meshes, thereby offering greater geometric flexibility. It utilizes bubble functions without imposing the restrictive conditions required by existing stabilizer-free WG methods, which simplifies implementation and broadens applicability to a wide range of partial differential equations (PDEs). Moreover, the method allows for flexible choices of polynomial degrees in the discretization and can be applied in any spatial dimension. We establish optimal-order error estimates for the WG approximation in a discrete H^1 norm, and present numerical experiments that validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Analysis of splitting schemes for stochastic evolution equations with non-Lipschitz nonlinearities driven by fractional noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel time-splitting scheme for a class of semilinear stochastic evolution equations driven by cylindrical fractional noise. The nonlinearity is decomposed as the sum of a one-sided, non-globally, Lipschitz continuous function, and of a globally Lipschitz continuous function. The proposed scheme is based on a splitting strategy, where the first nonlinearity is treated using the exact flow of an associated differential equation, and the second one is treated by an explicit Euler approximation. We prove mean-square, strong error estimates for the proposed scheme and show that the order of convergence is $H-1/4$, where $H\in(1/4,1)$ is the Hurst index. For the proof, we establish new regularity results for real-valued and infinite dimensional fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process depending on the value of the Hurst parameter $H$. Numerical experiments illustrate the main result of this manuscript.</description>

      <title>Trace inequalities for piecewise $W^{1,p}$ functions over general polytopic meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trace inequalities are crucial tools to derive the stability of partial differential equations with inhomogeneous, natural boundary conditions. In the analysis of corresponding Galerkin methods, they are also essential to show convergence of sequences of discrete solutions to the exact one for data with minimal regularity under mesh refinements and/or degree of accuracy increase. In nonconforming discretizations, such as Crouzeix-Raviart and discontinuous Galerkin, the trial and test spaces consists of functions that are only piecewise continuous: standard trace inequalities cannot be used in this case. In this work, we prove several trace inequalities for piecewise $W^{1,p}$ functions. Compared to analogous results already available in the literature, our inequalities are established: (i) on fairly general polytopic meshes (with arbitrary number of facets and arbitrarily small facets); (ii) without the need of finite dimensional arguments (e.g., inverse estimates, approximation properties of averaging operators); (iii) for different ranges of maximal and nonmaximal Lebesgue indices.</description>

      <title>A Relaxed Randomized Averaging Block Extended Bregman-Kaczmarz Method for Combined Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized Kaczmarz-type methods are widely used for their simplicity and efficiency in solving large-scale linear systems and optimization problems. However, their applicability is limited when dealing with inconsistent systems or incorporating structural information such as sparsity. In this work, we propose a \emph{relaxed randomized averaging block extended Bregman-Kaczmarz} (rRABEBK) method for solving a broad class of combined optimization problems. The proposed method integrates an averaging block strategy with two relaxation parameters to accelerate convergence and enhance numerical stability. We establish a rigorous convergence theory showing that rRABEBK achieves linear convergence in expectation, with explicit constants that quantify the effect of the relaxation mechanism, and a provably faster rate than the classical randomized extended Bregman-Kaczmarz method. Our method can be readily adapted to sparse least-squares problems and extended to both consistent and inconsistent systems without modification. Complementary numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that rRABEBK significantly outperforms the existing Kaczmarz-type algorithms in terms of both iteration complexity and computational efficiency, highlighting both its practical and theoretical advantages.</description>

      <title>A Benamou-Brenier Proximal Splitting Method for Constrained Unbalanced Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamic formulation of optimal transport, also known as the Benamou-Brenier formulation, has been extended to the unbalanced case by introducing a source term in the continuity equation. When this source term is penalized based on the Fisher-Rao metric, the resulting model is referred to as the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao (WFR) setting, and allows for the comparison between any two positive measures without the need for equalized total mass. In recent work, we introduced a constrained variant of this model, in which affine integral equality constraints are imposed along the measure path. In the present paper, we propose a further generalization of this framework, which allows for constraints that apply not just to the density path but also to the momentum and source terms, and incorporates affine inequalities in addition to equality constraints. We prove, under suitable assumptions on the constraints, the well-posedness of the resulting class of convex variational problems. The paper is then primarily devoted to developing an effective numerical pipeline that tackles the corresponding constrained optimization problem based on finite difference discretizations and parallel proximal schemes. Our proposed framework encompasses standard balanced and unbalanced optimal transport, as well as a multitude of natural and practically relevant constraints, and we highlight its versatility via several synthetic and real data examples.</description>

      <title>A Propagator-based Multi-level Monte Carlo Method for Kinetic Neutral Species in Edge Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and investigate a new multi-level Monte Carlo scheme for numerical solutions of the kinetic Boltzmann equation for neutral species in edge plasmas. In particular, this method explicitly exploits a key structural property of neutral particle dynamics: the prevalence of frequent collisions for which the outgoing velocity is determined by local plasma parameters. Using this property, we derive a multi-level algorithm based on collision event propagator and show, both analytically and through numerical experiments, that it reproduces the results of standard Monte Carlo methods. We further demonstrate that, in the context of coupled plasma-neutral edge simulations employing correlated Monte Carlo, the proposed scheme retains trajectory correlation to machine precision as the system evolves, whereas conventional methods exhibit rapid decorrelation. These results indicate that the propagator-based multi-level Monte Carlo scheme is a promising candidate for use in fully implicit Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) solvers for coupled plasma-neutral systems.</description>

      <title>Branching Strategies Based on Subgraph GNNs: A Study on Theoretical Promise versus Practical Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for ``learning to branch'' in Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). While standard Message-Passing GNNs (MPNNs) are efficient, they theoretically lack the expressive power to fully represent MILP structures. Conversely, higher-order GNNs (like 2-FGNNs) are expressive but computationally prohibitive. In this work, we investigate Subgraph GNNs as a theoretical middle ground. Crucially, while previous work [Chen et al., 2025] demonstrated that GNNs with 3-WL expressive power can approximate Strong Branching, we prove a sharper result: node-anchored Subgraph GNNs whose expressive power is strictly lower than 3-WL [Zhang et al., 2023] are sufficient to approximate Strong Branching scores. However, our extensive empirical evaluation on four benchmark datasets reveals a stark contrast between theory and practice. While node-anchored Subgraph GNNs theoretically offer superior branching decisions, their $O(n)$ complexity overhead results in significant memory bottlenecks and slower solving times than MPNNs and heuristics. Our results indicate that for MILP branching, the computational cost of expressive GNNs currently outweighs their gains in decision quality, suggesting that future research must focus on efficiency-preserving expressivity.</description>

      <title>Modeling Complex Multiphysics Systems with Discrete Element Method Enriched with the Kernel-Independent Fast Multipole Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper describes the coupling of the MercuryDPM discrete element method (DEM) code and the implementation of the kernel-independent fast multipole method (KIFMM). The combined simulation framework allows addressing the large class of multiscale problems, including both the mechanical interactions of particulates at the fine scale and the long-range interactions of various natures at the coarse scale. Among these are electrostatic interactions in powders, clays, and particulates, magnetic interactions in ferromagnetic granulates, and gravitational interactions in asteroid clouds. The formalism of rigid clumps is successfully combined with KIFMM, enabling addressing problems involving complex long-large interactions between non-spherical particles with arbitrary charge distributions. The capabilities of our technique are demonstrated in several application examples.</description>

      <title>Computer-Assisted Search for Differential Equations Corresponding to Optimization Methods and Their Convergence Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $f:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ be a continuously differentiable convex function with its minimizer denoted by $x_*$ and optimal value $f_* = f(x_*)$. Optimization algorithms such as the gradient descent method can often be interpreted in the continuous-time limit as differential equations known as continuous dynamical systems. Analyzing the convergence rate of $f(x) - f_*$ in such systems often relies on constructing appropriate Lyapunov functions. However, these Lyapunov functions have been designed through heuristic reasoning rather than a systematic framework. Several studies have addressed this issue. In particular, Suh, Roh, and Ryu (2022) proposed a constructive approach that involves introducing dilated coordinates and applying integration by parts. Although this method significantly improves the process of designing Lyapunov functions, it still involves arbitrary choices among many possible options, and thus retains a heuristic nature in identifying Lyapunov functions that yield the best convergence rates. In this study, we propose a systematic framework for exploring these choices computationally. More precisely, we propose a brute-force approach using symbolic computation by computer algebra systems to explore every possibility. By formulating the design of Lyapunov functions for continuous dynamical systems as an optimization problem, we aim to optimize the Lyapunov function itself. As a result, our framework successfully reproduces many previously reported results and, in several cases, discovers new convergence rates that have not been shown in the existing studies.</description>

      <title>On Parameter Identification in Three-Dimensional Elasticity and Discretisation with Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool in the scientific machine learning community, with applications to both forward and inverse problems. While they have shown considerable empirical success, significant challenges remain -- particularly regarding training stability and the lack of rigorous theoretical guarantees, especially when compared to classical mesh-based methods. In this work, we focus on the inverse problem of identifying a spatially varying parameter in a constitutive model of three-dimensional elasticity, using measurements of the system's state. This setting is especially relevant for non-invasive diagnosis in cardiac biomechanics, where one must also carefully account for the type of boundary data available. To address this inverse problem, we adopt an all-at-once optimisation framework, simultaneously estimating the state and parameter through a least-squares loss that encodes both available data and the governing physics. For this formulation, we prove stability estimates ensuring that our approach yields a stable approximation of the underlying ground-truth parameter of the physical system independent of a specific discretisation. We then proceed with a neural network-based discretisation and compare it to traditional mesh-based approaches. Our theoretical findings are complemented by illustrative numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of a stabilized scheme for an optimal control problem governed by a parabolic convection--diffusion equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21070v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an optimal control problem on a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^2,$ governed by a parabolic convection--diffusion--reaction equation with pointwise control constraints. We follow the optimize--then--discretize approach, in which the state and co-state variables are discretized using the piecewise linear finite element method. For stabilization, we apply the algebraic flux correction method. Temporal discretization is performed using the backward Euler method. The discrete control variable is obtained by projecting the discretized adjoint state onto the set of admissible controls. The resulting stabilized fully--discrete scheme is nonlinear and a fixed point argument is used to prove its existence and uniqueness under a mild condition between the time step $k$ and the mesh size $h,$ e.g., $k = \mathcal{O}(h).$ Furthermore, assuming sufficient regularity of the exact solution, we derive error estimates in the $L^{2}$ and energy norms with respect to the spatial variable, and in the $\ell^\infty$ norm with respect to time for the state and co-state variables. For the control variable, we also derive an $L^{2}$-norm error estimate with respect to space and an $\ell^\infty$-norm estimate in time. Finally, we present numerical experiments that validate the the order of convergence of the stabilized fully--discrete scheme based on the algebraic flux correction method. We also test the stabilized fully--discrete scheme in optimal control problems that governed by a convection--dominant equation where the solution possesses interior layers.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Reduced Rank Extrapolation to Low-Rank Matrix Sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09165v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reduced rank extrapolation (RRE) is an acceleration method typically used to accelerate the iterative solution of nonlinear systems of equations using a fixed-point process. In this context, the iterates are vectors generated from a fixed-point mapping function. However, when considering the iterative solution of large-scale matrix equations, the iterates are low-rank matrices generated from a fixed-point process for which, generally, the mapping function changes in each iteration. To enable acceleration of the iterative solution for these problems, we propose two novel generalizations of RRE. First, we show how to effectively compute RRE for sequences of low-rank matrices. Second, we derive a formulation of RRE that is suitable for fixed-point processes for which the mapping function changes each iteration. We demonstrate the potential of the methods on several numerical examples involving the iterative solution of large-scale Lyapunov and Riccati matrix equations.</description>

      <title>A Parametric Family of Polynomial Wavelets for Signal and Image Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the potential applications of a parametric family of polynomial wavelets that has been recently introduced starting from de la Vall\'ee Poussin (VP) interpolation at Chebyshev nodes. Unlike classical wavelets, which are constructed on the real line, these VP wavelets are defined on a bounded interval, offering the advantage of handling boundaries naturally while maintaining computational efficiency. In addition, the structure of these wavelets enables the use of fast algorithms for decomposition and reconstruction. Furthermore, the flexibility offered by a free parameter allows a better control of localized singularities, such as edges in images. On the basis of previous theoretical foundations, we show the effectiveness of the VP wavelets for basic signal denoising and image compression, emphasizing their potential for more advanced signal and image processing tasks.</description>

      <title>On the numerical stability of sketched GMRES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a backward stability analysis of preconditioned sketched GMRES [Nakatsukasa and Tropp, SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl, 2024] for solving linear systems $Ax=b$, and show that the backward stability at iteration $i$ depends on the conditioning of the Krylov basis $B_{1:i}$ as long as the condition number of $A B_{1:i}$ can be bounded by $1/O(u)$, where $u$ is the unit roundoff. Under this condition, we show that sketched GMRES is backward stable as long as the condition number of $B_{1:i}$ is not too large. Under additional assumptions, we then show that the stability of a restarted implementation of sketched GMRES can be independent of the condition number of $B_{1:i}$, and restarted sketched GMRES is backward stable. We also derive sharper bounds that explain why the backward error can be small even in cases when the basis $B_{1:i}$ is very ill-conditioned, which has been observed in the literature but not yet explained theoretically. We present numerical experiments to demonstrate the conclusions of our analysis, and also show that adaptively restarting where appropriate allows us to recover backward stability in sketched GMRES.</description>

Abstract: We establish Sobolev-Poincar\'e inequalities for piecewise $W^{1,p}$ functions over families of fairly general polytopic (thence also shape-regular simplicial and Cartesian) meshes in any dimension; amongst others, they cover the case of standard Poincar\'e inequalities for piecewise $W^{1,p}$ functions and can be useful in the analysis of nonconforming finite element discretizations of nonlinear problems. Crucial tools in their derivation are novel Sobolev-trace inequalities and Babu\v{s}ka-Aziz inequalities with mixed boundary conditions. We provide estimates with constants having an explicit dependence on the geometric properties of the domain and the underlying family of polytopic meshes.</description>

Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the local convergence behavior of an extended variation of the locally optimal preconditioned conjugate gradient method (LOBPCG) for computing the extreme eigenvalue of a Hermitian matrix. The convergence rates derived in this work are either obtained for the first time or sharper than those previously established, including those in Ovtchinnikov's work ({\em SIAM J. Numer. Anal.}, 46(5):2567--2592, 2008). The study also extends to generalized problems, including Hermitian matrix polynomials that admit an extended form of the Rayleigh quotient. The new approach used to obtain these rates may also serve as a valuable tool for the convergence analysis of other gradient-type optimization methods.</description>

      <title>A parametric tensor ROM for the shallow water dam break problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a variant of a tensor reduced-order model (tROM) for the parameterized shallow-water dam-break problem. This hyperbolic system presents multiple challenges for model reduction, including a slow decay of the Kolmogorov $N$-width of the solution manifold, shock formation, and the loss of smooth solution dependence on parameters. These issues limit the performance of traditional Proper Orthogonal Decomposition based ROMs. Our tROM approach, based on a low-rank tensor decomposition, builds a parameter-to-solution map from high-fidelity snapshots and constructs localized reduced bases via a local POD procedure. We apply this method to 1D dry-bed and wet-bed problems and 2D wet-bed problem with topography and bottom friction, showing that the non-interpolatory variant of the tROM, combined with Chebyshev sampling near critical parameter values, effectively captures parameter-dependent behavior and significantly outperforms standard POD-ROMs. This is especially evident in the wet-bed case, where POD-ROMs exhibit poor resolution of shock waves and spurious oscillations.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Ocular Surface Changes with Contact Lens Wear</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over 140 million people worldwide and over 45 million people in the United States wear contact lenses; it is estimated that 12%-27.4% contact lens users stop wearing them due to discomfort. Contact lens mechanical interactions with the ocular surface have been found to affect the ocular surface itself. These mechanical interactions are difficult to measure and calculate in a clinical setting, and the research in this field is limited. This paper presents the first mathematical model that captures the interactions between the contact lens and the open eye, where the contact lens configuration, the contact lens suction pressure, and the deformed ocular shape are all emergent properties of the model. The non-linear coupling between the contact lens and the eye is achieved by assuming that the suction pressure under the lens is applied directly to the ocular surface through the post-lens tear film layer. The contact lens mechanics are modeled using a previous published model. We consider homogeneous and heterogeneous linear elastic eye models, different ocular shapes, different lens shapes and thickness profiles, and extract lens deformations, suction pressure profiles, and ocular deformations and stresses for all the considered scenarios. The model predicts higher ocular deformations and stresses at the center of the eye and in the limbal/scleral regions. Accounting for heterogeneous material eye parameters increases the magnitude of such deformations and stresses. The ocular displacements and stresses non-linearly increase as we increase the stiffness of the contact lens. Inserting a steeper contact lens on the eye results in a reduction of the ocular displacement at the center of the eye and a larger displacement at the edge of the contact lens. The model predictions are compared with experimental data and previously developed mathematical models.</description>

      <title>Transient thermal analysis of a bi-layered composites with the dual-reciprocity inclusion-based boundary element method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a single-domain dual-reciprocity inclusion-based boundary element method (DR-iBEM) for a three-dimensional fully bonded bi-layered composite embedded with ellipsoidal inhomogeneities under transient/harmonic thermal loads. The heat equation is interpreted as a static one containing time- and frequency-dependent nonhomogeneous source terms, which is similar to eigen-fields but is transformed into a boundary integral by the dual-reciprocity method. Using the steady-state bimaterial Green's function, boundary integral equations are proposed to take into account continuity conditions of temperature and heat flux, which avoids setting up any continuity equations at the bimaterial interface. Eigen-temperature-gradients and eigen-heat-source are introduced to simulate the material mismatch in thermal conductivity and heat capacity, respectively. The DR-iBEM algorithm is particularly suitable for investigating the transient and harmonic thermal behaviors of bi-layered composites and is verified by the finite element method (FEM). Numerical comparison with the FEM demonstrates its robustness and accuracy. The method has been applied to a functionally graded material as a bimaterial with graded particle distributions, where particle size and gradation effects are evaluated.</description>

      <title>Finite Volume Analysis of the Poisson Problem via a Reduced Discontinuous Galerkin Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose and analyze a high-order finite volume method for the Poisson problem based on the reduced discontinuous Galerkin (RDG) space. The main idea is to employ the RDG space as the trial space and the piecewise constant space as the test space, thereby formulating the scheme in a Petrov-Galerkin framework. This approach inherits the local conservation property of finite volume methods while benefiting from the approximation capabilities of discontinuous Galerkin spaces with significantly fewer degrees of freedom. We establish a rigorous error analysis of the proposed scheme: in particular, we prove optimal-order convergence in the DG energy norm and suboptimal-order convergence in \(L^2\) norm. The theoretical analysis is supported by a set of one- and two-dimensional numerical experiments with Dirichlet and periodic boundary conditions, which confirm both the accuracy and efficiency of the method. The significance of this work lies in bridging finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin methodologies through the RDG space, thus enabling finite volume schemes with a mathematically rigorous convergence theory.</description>

      <title>Numerical Analysis of the 2D Stochastic Navier-Stokes Equations: Convergence under Transport Noise and No-slip Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is concerned with the numerical approximation of the two-dimensional stochastic Navier-Stokes equation with transport noise and no-slip boundary conditions on a convex polygonal domain. The analysis is challenged by the solution's low spatial regularity and the non-Lipschitz nonlinearity. We derive a convergence rate in the mean-square sense for a spatial semidiscretization. Furthermore, for the full discretization, we prove convergence in probability and establish an explicit rate with respect to the time step.</description>

      <title>An explicit Euler method for Sobolev vector fields with applications to the continuity equation on non cartesian grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04118v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a novel stability estimate in $L^\infty _t (L^p _x)$ between the regular Lagrangian flow of a Sobolev vector field and a piecewise affine approximation of such flow. This approximation of the flow is obtained by a (sort of) explicit Euler method, and it is the crucial tool to prove approximation results for the solution of the continuity equation by using the representation of the solution as the push-forward via the regular Lagrangian flow of the initial datum. We approximate the solution in two ways, one probabilistic and one deterministic, using different approximations for both the flow and the initial datum. Such estimates for the solution of the continuity equation are derived on non Cartesian grids and without the need to assume a CFL condition.</description>

      <title>A Practitioner's Guide to Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The so-called Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), whose design is merely inspired, rather than dictated, by the Kolmogorov superposition theorem, have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). This review provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the rapidly expanding KAN landscape. By collecting and categorizing a large set of open-source implementations, we map the vibrant ecosystem supporting modern KAN development. We organize the review around four core themes:
  (i) presenting a precise history of Kolmogorov's superposition theory toward neural-network formulations; (ii) establishing the formal equivalence between KANs and MLPs; (iii) analyzing the critical role of basis functions; and (iv) organizing recent advancements in accuracy, efficiency, regularization, and convergence.
  Finally, we provide a practical Choose-Your-KAN guide to assist practitioners in selecting appropriate architectures, and we close by identifying current research gaps and future directions. The associated GitHub repository (https://github.com/AmirNoori68/kan-review) complements this paper and serves as a structured reference for ongoing KAN research.</description>
