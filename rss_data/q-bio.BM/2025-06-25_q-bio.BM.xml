      <title>Toward the Explainability of Protein Language Models for Sequence Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based language models excel in a variety of protein-science tasks that range from structure prediction to the design of functional enzymes. However, these models operate as black boxes, and their underlying working principles remain unclear. Here, we survey emerging applications of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to protein language models (pLMs) and describe their potential in protein research. We break down the workflow of a generative decoder-only Transformer into four information contexts: (i) training sequences, (ii) input prompt, (iii) model architecture, and (iv) output sequence. For each, we describe existing methods and applications of XAI. Additionally, from published studies we distil five (potential) roles that XAI can play in protein design: Evaluator, Multitasker, Engineer, Coach, and Teacher, with the Evaluator role being the only one widely adopted so far. These roles aim to help both protein science practitioners and model developers understand the possibilities and limitations of implementing XAI for the design of sequences. Finally, we highlight the critical areas of application for the future, including risks related to security, trustworthiness, and bias, and we call for community benchmarks, open-source tooling, and domain-specific visualizations to advance explainable protein design. Overall, our analysis aims to move the discussion toward the use of XAI in protein design.</description>

      <title>ProxelGen: Generating Proteins as 3D Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop ProxelGen, a protein structure generative model that operates on 3D densities as opposed to the prevailing 3D point cloud representations. Representing proteins as voxelized densities, or proxels, enables new tasks and conditioning capabilities. We generate proteins encoded as proxels via a 3D CNN-based VAE in conjunction with a diffusion model operating on its latent space. Compared to state-of-the-art models, ProxelGen's samples achieve higher novelty, better FID scores, and the same level of designability as the training set. ProxelGen's advantages are demonstrated in a standard motif scaffolding benchmark, and we show how 3D density-based generation allows for more flexible shape conditioning.</description>

      <title>A standard transformer and attention with linear biases for molecular conformer generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sampling low-energy molecular conformations, spatial arrangements of atoms in a molecule, is a critical task for many different calculations performed in the drug discovery and optimization process. Numerous specialized equivariant networks have been designed to generate molecular conformations from 2D molecular graphs. Recently, non-equivariant transformer models have emerged as a viable alternative due to their capability to scale to improve generalization. However, the concern has been that non-equivariant models require a large model size to compensate the lack of equivariant bias. In this paper, we demonstrate that a well-chosen positional encoding effectively addresses these size limitations. A standard transformer model incorporating relative positional encoding for molecular graphs when scaled to 25 million parameters surpasses the current state-of-the-art non-equivariant base model with 64 million parameters on the GEOM-DRUGS benchmark. We implemented relative positional encoding as a negative attention bias that linearly increases with the shortest path distances between graph nodes at varying slopes for different attention heads, similar to ALiBi, a widely adopted relative positional encoding technique in the NLP domain. This architecture has the potential to serve as a foundation for a novel class of generative models for molecular conformations.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic free energy map for the non-oxidative glycolysis pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing reaction pathways that maximize the production of a target compound in a given metabolic network is a fundamental problem in systems biology. In this study, we systematically explore the non-oxidative glycolysis metabolic network, guided by the principle that reactions with negative Gibbs free energy differences are thermodynamically favored. We enumerate alternative pathways that implement the net non-oxidative glycolysis reaction, categorized by their length. Our analysis reveals several alternative thermodynamically favorable pathways beyond those reported in experiments. In addition, we identify molecules within the network, such as 3-hydroxypropionic acid, that may have significant potential for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Inferring protein folding mechanisms from natural sequence diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protein sequences serve as a natural record of the evolutionary constraints that shape their functional structures. We show that it is possible to use only sequence information to go beyond predicting native structures and global stability to infer the folding mechanisms of globular proteins. The one- and two-body evolutionary energy fields at the amino-acid level are mapped to a coarse-grained description of folding, where proteins are divided into contiguous folding elements, commonly referred to as foldons. For 15 diverse protein families, we calculated the folding mechanisms of hundreds of proteins by simulating an Ising chain of foldons, with their energetics determined by the amino acid sequences. We show that protein topology imposes limits on the variability of folding cooperativity within a family. While most beta and alpha/beta structures exhibit only a few possible mechanisms despite high sequence diversity, alpha topologies allow for diverse folding scenarios among family members. We show that both the stability and cooperativity changes induced by mutations can be computed directly using sequence-based evolutionary models.</description>
