      <title>Hypergraphs as Weighted Directed Self-Looped Graphs: Spectral Properties, Clustering, Cheeger Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypergraphs naturally arise when studying group relations and have been widely used in the field of machine learning. There has not been a unified formulation of hypergraphs, yet the recently proposed edge-dependent vertex weights (EDVW) modeling is one of the most generalized modeling methods of hypergraphs, i.e., most existing hypergraphs can be formulated as EDVW hypergraphs without any information loss to the best of our knowledge. However, the relevant algorithmic developments on EDVW hypergraphs remain nascent: compared to spectral graph theories, the formulations are incomplete, the spectral clustering algorithms are not well-developed, and one result regarding hypergraph Cheeger Inequality is even incorrect. To this end, deriving a unified random walk-based formulation, we propose our definitions of hypergraph Rayleigh Quotient, NCut, boundary/cut, volume, and conductance, which are consistent with the corresponding definitions on graphs. Then, we prove that the normalized hypergraph Laplacian is associated with the NCut value, which inspires our HyperClus-G algorithm for spectral clustering on EDVW hypergraphs. Finally, we prove that HyperClus-G can always find an approximately linearly optimal partitioning in terms of Both NCut and conductance. Additionally, we provide extensive experiments to validate our theoretical findings from an empirical perspective.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Bipartite Networks in Anime Series: Textual Analysis, Topic Clustering, and Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article analyzes a specific bipartite network that shows the relationships between users and anime, examining how the descriptions of anime influence the formation of user communities. In particular, we introduce a new variable that quantifies the frequency with which words from a description appear in specific word clusters. These clusters are generated from a bigram analysis derived from all descriptions in the database. This approach fully characterizes the dynamics of these communities and shows how textual content affect the cohesion and structure of the social network among anime enthusiasts. Our findings suggest that there may be significant implications for the design of recommendation systems and the enhancement of user experience on anime platforms.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Weighted Cascade Model for Competitive Influence Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a modified Weighted Cascade model that integrates asymmetric budgets and product scores, providing new insights into the Generalized Asymmetric Influence Maximization problem, which we establish as NP-hard. Our simulations demonstrate that players with higher budgets possess a distinct advantage in networks characterized by larger diameters, whereas players with superior product scores exhibit a significant advantage in networks with smaller diameters. Moreover, we identify a robust linear relationship between graph size and the magnitude of influenced nodes. In densely connected networks we derive bounds for the probabilities of influence that are independent of network size. Our examination of Nash equilibria in this domain underscores the absence of a guaranteed pure Nash equilibrium, suggesting that the strategic enhancement of budgets or product scores may yield more substantial benefits than the pursuit of an optimal strategy in this context.</description>

      <title>UniTraj: Universal Human Trajectory Modeling from Billion-Scale Worldwide Traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human trajectory modeling is essential for deciphering movement patterns and supporting advanced applications across various domains. However, existing methods are often tailored to specific tasks and regions, resulting in limitations related to task specificity, regional dependency, and data quality sensitivity. Addressing these challenges requires a universal human trajectory foundation model capable of generalizing and scaling across diverse tasks and geographic contexts. To this end, we propose UniTraj, a Universal human Trajectory foundation model that is task-adaptive, region-independent, and highly generalizable. To further enhance performance, we construct WorldTrace, the first large-scale, high-quality, globally distributed dataset sourced from open web platforms, encompassing 2.45 million trajectories with billions of points across 70 countries. Through multiple resampling and masking strategies designed for pre-training, UniTraj effectively overcomes geographic and task constraints, adapting to heterogeneous data quality. Extensive experiments across multiple trajectory analysis tasks and real-world datasets demonstrate that UniTraj consistently outperforms existing approaches in terms of scalability and adaptability. These results underscore the potential of UniTraj as a versatile, robust solution for a wide range of trajectory analysis applications, with WorldTrace serving as an ideal but non-exclusive foundation for training.</description>

      <title>AdaSociety: An Adaptive Environment with Social Structures for Multi-Agent Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional interactive environments limit agents' intelligence growth with fixed tasks. Recently, single-agent environments address this by generating new tasks based on agent actions, enhancing task diversity. We consider the decision-making problem in multi-agent settings, where tasks are further influenced by social connections, affecting rewards and information access. However, existing multi-agent environments lack a combination of adaptive physical surroundings and social connections, hindering the learning of intelligent behaviors. To address this, we introduce AdaSociety, a customizable multi-agent environment featuring expanding state and action spaces, alongside explicit and alterable social structures. As agents progress, the environment adaptively generates new tasks with social structures for agents to undertake. In AdaSociety, we develop three mini-games showcasing distinct social structures and tasks. Initial results demonstrate that specific social structures can promote both individual and collective benefits, though current reinforcement learning and LLM-based algorithms show limited effectiveness in leveraging social structures to enhance performance. Overall, AdaSociety serves as a valuable research platform for exploring intelligence in diverse physical and social settings. The code is available at https://github.com/bigai-ai/AdaSociety.</description>

      <title>SHyPar: A Spectral Coarsening Approach to Hypergraph Partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-of-the-art hypergraph partitioners utilize a multilevel paradigm to construct progressively coarser hypergraphs across multiple layers, guiding cut refinements at each level of the hierarchy. Traditionally, these partitioners employ heuristic methods for coarsening and do not consider the structural features of hypergraphs. In this work, we introduce a multilevel spectral framework, SHyPar, for partitioning large-scale hypergraphs by leveraging hyperedge effective resistances and flow-based community detection techniques. Inspired by the latest theoretical spectral clustering frameworks, such as HyperEF and HyperSF, SHyPar aims to decompose large hypergraphs into multiple subgraphs with few inter-partition hyperedges (cut size). A key component of SHyPar is a flow-based local clustering scheme for hypergraph coarsening, which incorporates a max-flow-based algorithm to produce clusters with substantially improved conductance. Additionally, SHyPar utilizes an effective resistance-based rating function for merging nodes that are strongly connected (coupled). Compared with existing state-of-the-art hypergraph partitioning methods, our extensive experimental results on real-world VLSI designs demonstrate that SHyPar can more effectively partition hypergraphs, achieving state-of-the-art solution quality.</description>

      <title>Information diffusion assumptions can distort our understanding of social network dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To analyze the flow of information online, experts often rely on platform-provided data from social media companies, which typically attribute all resharing actions to an original poster. This obscures the true dynamics of how information spreads online, as users can be exposed to content in various ways. While most researchers analyze data as it is provided by the platform and overlook this issue, some attempt to infer the structure of these information cascades. However, the absence of ground truth about actual diffusion cascades makes verifying the efficacy of these efforts impossible. This study investigates the implications of the common practice of ignoring reconstruction all together. Two case studies involving data from Twitter and Bluesky reveal that reconstructing cascades significantly alters the identification of influential users, therefore affecting downstream analyses in general. We also propose a novel reconstruction approach that allows us to evaluate the effects of different assumptions made during the cascade inference procedure. Analysis of the diffusion of over 40,000 true and false news stories on Twitter reveals that the assumptions made during the reconstruction procedure drastically distort both microscopic and macroscopic properties of cascade networks. This work highlights the challenges of studying information spreading processes on complex networks and has significant implications for the broader study of digital platforms.</description>

      <title>Centrality in Collaboration: A Novel Algorithm for Social Partitioning Gradients in Community Detection for Multiple Oncology Clinical Trial Enrollments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Patients at a comprehensive cancer center who do not achieve cure or remission following standard treatments often become candidates for clinical trials. Patients who participate in a clinical trial may be suitable for other studies. A key factor influencing patient enrollment in subsequent clinical trials is the structured collaboration between oncologists and most responsible physicians. Possible identification of these collaboration networks can be achieved through the analysis of patient movements between clinical trial intervention types with social network analysis and community detection algorithms. In the detection of oncologist working groups, the present study evaluates three community detection algorithms: Girvan-Newman, Louvain and an algorithm developed by the author. Girvan-Newman identifies each intervention as their own community, while Louvain groups interventions in a manner that is difficult to interpret. In contrast, the author's algorithm groups interventions in a way that is both intuitive and informative, with a gradient evident in social partitioning that is particularly useful for epidemiological research. This lays the groundwork for future subgroup analysis of clustered interventions.</description>

      <title>Memory-Efficient Community Detection on Large Graphs Using Weighted Sketches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Community detection in graphs identifies groups of nodes with denser connections within the groups than between them, and while existing studies often focus on optimizing detection performance, memory constraints become critical when processing large graphs on shared-memory systems. We recently proposed efficient implementations of the Louvain, Leiden, and Label Propagation Algorithms (LPA) for community detection. However, these incur significant memory overhead from the use of collision-free per-thread hashtables. To address this, we introduce memory-efficient alternatives using weighted Misra-Gries (MG) sketches, which replace the per-thread hashtables, and reduce memory demands in Louvain, Leiden, and LPA implementations - while incurring only a minor quality drop (up to 1%) and moderate runtime penalties. We believe that these approaches, though slightly slower, are well-suited for parallel processing and could outperform current memory-intensive techniques on systems with many threads.</description>

      <title>A Persuasion-Based Prompt Learning Approach to Improve Smishing Detection through Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Smishing, which aims to illicitly obtain personal information from unsuspecting victims, holds significance due to its negative impacts on our society. In prior studies, as a tool to counteract smishing, machine learning (ML) has been widely adopted, which filters and blocks smishing messages before they reach potential victims. However, a number of challenges remain in ML-based smishing detection, with the scarcity of annotated datasets being one major hurdle. Specifically, given the sensitive nature of smishing-related data, there is a lack of publicly accessible data that can be used for training and evaluating ML models. Additionally, the nuanced similarities between smishing messages and other types of social engineering attacks such as spam messages exacerbate the challenge of smishing classification with limited resources. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel data augmentation method utilizing a few-shot prompt learning approach. What sets our approach apart from extant methods is the use of the principles of persuasion, a psychology theory which explains the underlying mechanisms of smishing. By designing prompts grounded in the persuasion principles, our augmented dataset could effectively capture various, important aspects of smishing messages, enabling ML models to be effectively trained. Our evaluation within a real-world context demonstrates that our augmentation approach produces more diverse and higher-quality smishing data instances compared to other cutting-edging approaches, leading to substantial improvements in the ability of ML models to detect the subtle characteristics of smishing messages. Moreover, our additional analyses reveal that the performance improvement provided by our approach is more pronounced when used with ML models that have a larger number of parameters, demonstrating its effectiveness in training large-scale ML models.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Content Moderation with Culturally-Aware Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Content moderation on a global scale must navigate a complex array of local cultural distinctions, which can hinder effective enforcement. While global policies aim for consistency and broad applicability, they often miss the subtleties of regional language interpretation, cultural beliefs, and local legislation. This work introduces a flexible framework that enhances foundation language models with cultural knowledge. Our approach involves fine-tuning encoder-decoder models on media-diet data to capture cultural nuances, and applies a continued training regime to effectively integrate these models into a content moderation pipeline. We evaluate this framework in a case study of an online podcast platform with content spanning various regions. The results show that our culturally adapted models improve the accuracy of local violation detection and offer explanations that align more closely with regional cultural norms. Our findings reinforce the need for an adaptable content moderation approach that remains flexible in response to the diverse cultural landscapes it operates in and represents a step towards a more equitable and culturally sensitive framework for content moderation, demonstrating what is achievable in this domain.</description>
