      <title>What kind of linearly distributive category do polynomial functors form?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper has two purposes. The first is to extend the theory of linearly distributive categories by considering the structures that emerge in a special case: the normal duoidal category $(\mathsf{Poly} ,\mathcal{y}, \otimes, \triangleleft )$ of polynomial functors under Dirichlet and substitution product. This is an isomix LDC which is neither $*$-autonomous nor fully symmetric. The additional structures of interest here are a closure for $\otimes$ and a co-closure for $\triangleleft$, making $\mathsf{Poly}$ a bi-closed LDC, which is a notion we introduce in this paper.
  The second purpose is to use $\mathsf{Poly}$ as a source of examples and intuition about various structures that can occur in the setting of LDCs, including duals, cores, linear monoids, and others, as well as how these generalize to the non-symmetric setting. To that end, we characterize the linearly dual objects in $\mathsf{Poly}$: every linear polynomial has a right dual which is a representable. It turns out that the linear and representable polynomials also form the left and right cores of $\mathsf{Poly}$. Finally, we provide examples of linear monoids, linear comonoids, and linear bialgebras in $\mathsf{Poly}$.</description>

      <title>On the Anatomy of Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a category-theoretic diagrammatic formalism in order to systematically relate and reason about machine learning models. Our diagrams present architectures intuitively but without loss of essential detail, where natural relationships between models are captured by graphical transformations, and important differences and similarities can be identified at a glance. In this paper, we focus on attention mechanisms: translating folklore into mathematical derivations, and constructing a taxonomy of attention variants in the literature. As a first example of an empirical investigation underpinned by our formalism, we identify recurring anatomical components of attention, which we exhaustively recombine to explore a space of variations on the attention mechanism.</description>

      <title>A Pattern Language for Machine Learning Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Idealised as universal approximators, learners such as neural networks can be viewed as "variable functions" that may become one of a range of concrete functions after training. In the same way that equations constrain the possible values of variables in algebra, we may view objective functions as constraints on the behaviour of learners. We extract the equivalences perfectly optimised objective functions impose, calling them "tasks". For these tasks, we develop a formal graphical language that allows us to: (1) separate the core tasks of a behaviour from its implementation details; (2) reason about and design behaviours model-agnostically; and (3) simply describe and unify approaches in machine learning across domains.
  As proof-of-concept, we design a novel task that enables converting classifiers into generative models we call "manipulators", which we implement by directly translating task specifications into code. The resulting models exhibit capabilities such as style transfer and interpretable latent-space editing, without the need for custom architectures, adversarial training or random sampling. We formally relate the behaviour of manipulators to GANs, and empirically demonstrate their competitive performance with VAEs. We report on experiments across vision and language domains aiming to characterise manipulators as approximate Bayesian inversions of discriminative classifiers.</description>

      <title>What is the universal property of the 2-category of monads?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a 2-category $\mathcal{K}$, we consider Street's 2-category Mnd($\mathcal{K}$) of monads in $\mathcal{K}$, along with Lack and Street's 2-category EM($\mathcal{K}$) and the identity-on-objects-and-1-cells 2-functor Mnd($\mathcal{K}$) $\to$ EM($\mathcal{K}$) between them. We show that this 2-functor can be obtained as a "free completion" of the 2-functor $1\colon \mathcal{K} \to \mathcal{K}$. We do this by regarding 2-functors which act as the identity on both objects and 1-cells as categories enriched a cartesian closed category $\mathbf{BO}$ whose objects are identity-on-objects functors. We also develop some of the theory of $\mathbf{BO}$-enriched categories.</description>

      <title>A semi-strictly generated closed structure on Gray-Cat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the semi-strictly generated internal homs of $\mathbf{Gray}$-categories $[\mathfrak{A}, \mathfrak{B}]_\text{ssg}$ defined in \cite{Miranda strictifying operational coherences} underlie a closed structure on the category $\mathbf{Gray}$-$\mathbf{Cat}$ of $\mathbf{Gray}$-categories and $\mathbf{Gray}$-functors. The morphisms of $[\mathfrak{A}, \mathfrak{B}]_\text{ssg}$ are composites of those trinatural transformations which satisfy the unit and composition conditions for pseudonatural transformations on the nose rather than up to an invertible $3$-cell. Such trinatural transformations leverage three-dimensional strictification \cite{Miranda strictifying operational coherences} while overcoming the challenges posed by failure of middle four interchange to hold in $\mathbf{Gray}$-categories \cite{Bourke Gurski Cocategorical Obstructions to a Tensor Product of Gray Categories}. As a result we obtain a closed structure that is only partially monoidal with respect to \cite{crans tensor of gray categories}. As a corollary we obtain a slight strengthening of strictification results for braided monoidal bicategories \cite{Gurski Loop Spaces}, which will be improved further in a forthcoming paper \cite{Miranda weak interchange 4-categories}.</description>

      <title>Abstract Kleisli structures on 2-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: F\"uhrmann introduced Abstract Kleisli structures to model call-by-value programming languages with side effects, and showed that they correspond to monads satisfying a certain equalising condition on the unit. We first extend this theory to non-strict morphisms of monads, and to incorporate $2$-cells of monads. We then further extend this to a theory of abstract Kleisli structures on $2$-categories, characterising when the original pseudomonad can be recovered by the abstract Kleisli structure on its $2$-category of free-pseudoalgebras.</description>

      <title>A Topologically Enriched Probability Monad on the Cartesian Closed Category of CGWH Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probability monads on categories of topological spaces are classical objects of study in the categorical approach to probability theory. We construct a probability monad on the category of compactly generated weakly Hausdorff (CGWH) spaces, a (if not the) standard choice of convenient category of topological spaces. Because a novel version of the Riesz representation theorem plays a fundamental role in our construction, we name it the Riesz probability monad. We show that the Riesz probability monad is a simultaneous extension of the classical Radon and Giry monads that is topologically enriched. Topological enrichment corresponds to a strengthened continuous mapping theorem (in the sense of probability theory). In addition, restricting the Riesz probability monad to the cartesian closed subcategory of weakly Hausdorff quotients of countably based (QCB) spaces results in a probability monad which is strongly affine, ensuring that the notions of independence and determinism interact as we would expect.</description>
