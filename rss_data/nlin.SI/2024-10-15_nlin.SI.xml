      <title>On tensor invariants for integrable cases of Euler, Lagrange and Kovalevskaya rigid body motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss global tensor invariants of a rigid body motion in the cases of Euler, Lagrange and Kovalevskaya. These invariants are obtained by substituting tensor fields with cubic on variable components into the invariance equation and solving the resulting algebraic equations using computer algebra systems. According to the Poincar\'{e}-Cartan theory of invariants, the existence of invariant geometric structures raises the question of using them to study the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of McMillan mappings III. Symmetric map with mixed nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article extends the study of dynamical properties of the symmetric McMillan map, emphasizing its utility in understanding and modeling complex nonlinear systems. Although the map features six parameters, we demonstrate that only two are irreducible: the linearized rotation number at the fixed point and a nonlinear parameter representing the ratio of terms in the biquadratic invariant. Through a detailed analysis, we classify regimes of stable motion, provide exact solutions to the mapping equations, and derive a canonical set of action-angle variables, offering analytical expressions for the rotation number and nonlinear tune shift. We further establish connections between general standard-form mappings and the symmetric McMillan map, using the area-preserving H\'eon map and accelerator lattices with thin sextupole magnet as representative case studies. Our results show that, despite being a second-order approximation, the symmetric McMillan map provides a highly accurate depiction of dynamics across a wide range of system parameters, demonstrating its practical relevance in both theoretical and applied contexts.</description>

      <title>A scaling law in optomechanically induced nonlinear oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stable limit cycle as a stabilized mechanical oscillation is the primary result of the dynamical evolution of an optomechanical system under sufficiently powerful pump. Because this dynamical process is highly nonlinear, it was not clear whether there exists a quantitative law to relate an evolved mechanical oscillation (the limit cycle of the dynamical process) to the given parameters of the fabricated system. Here, by means of the numerical simulations based on nonlinear dynamics, we demonstrate the existence of such quantitative relations that are generally valid to the nonlinear optomechanical processes. These quantitative relations can be summarized to a scaling law that is seemingly similar to those in phase transitions of many-body systems but has very different properties. Such a quantitative law enables one to find the more feasible system parameters for realizing the same or a similar dynamical evolution result, so it will be useful to the relevant experimental researches.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Classical Correspondence in a Quartic Oscillator -- Corrections to Frequency and Bounds for Periodic Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We take a qualitative comparative look at quantum and classical quartic anharmonic oscillators. It has been shown that the behavior of the quantum anharmonic oscillator mimics that of the classical anharmonic oscillators with the structurally same Hamiltonian in the coherent state basis of the harmonic oscillators. The associated equation of motion allows us to use Lindstet-Poincare perturbation method to compute the classical frequency of the oscillation order by order, by taking care of its dependence on amplitude and the quantum corrections. We also derive a bound for periodicity of such oscillations in both the classical and quantum cases.</description>

      <title>Integrable Semi-Discretization for a Modified Camassa-Holm Equation with Cubic Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, an integrable semi-discretization of the modified Camassa-Holm (mCH) equation with cubic nonlinearity is presented. The key points of the construction are based on the discrete Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation and appropriate definition of discrete reciprocal transformations. First, we demonstrate that these bilinear equations and their determinant solutions can be derived from the discrete KP equation through Miwa transformation and some reductions. Then, by scrutinizing the reduction process, we obtain a set of semi-discrete bilinear equations and their general soliton solutions in the Gram-type determinant form. Finally, we obtain an integrable semi-discrete analog of the mCH equation by introducing dependent variables and discrete reciprocal transformation. It is also shown that the semi-discrete mCH equation converges to the continuous one in the continuum limit.</description>

      <title>Using Symmetries to Investigate the Complete Integrability, Solitary Wave Solutions and Solitons of the Gardner Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a scaling symmetry, it is shown how to compute polynomial conservation laws, generalized symmetries, recursion operators, Lax pairs, and bilinear forms of polynomial nonlinear partial differential equations thereby establishing their complete integrability. The Gardner equation is chosen as the key example for it comprises both the Korteweg-de Vries and modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equations. The Gardner and Miura transformations which connect these equations are also computed using the concept of scaling homogeneity. Exact solitary wave solutions and solitons of the Gardner equation are derived using Hirota's method and other direct methods. The nature of these solutions depends on the sign of the cubic term in the Gardner equation and the underlying mKdV equation. It is shown that flat (table-top) waves of large amplitude only occur when the sign of the cubic nonlinearity is negative (defocusing case) whereas the focusing Gardner equation has the standard elastically colliding solitons. The paper's aim is to provide a review of integrability properties and solutions of the Gardner equation and illustrate the applicability of the scaling symmetry approach. The methods and algorithms used in this paper have been implemented in Mathematica but can be adapted for major computer algebra systems.</description>
