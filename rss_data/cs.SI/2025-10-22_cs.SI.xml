      <title>Refugees of the Digital Space: Platform Migration from TikTok to RedNote</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In January 2025, the U.S. government enacted a nationwide ban on TikTok, prompting a wave of American users -- self-identified as ``TikTok Refugees'' -- to migrate to alternative platforms, particularly the Chinese social media app RedNote (Xiaohongshu). This paper examines how these digital migrants navigate cross-cultural platform environments and develop adaptive communicative strategies under algorithmic governance. Drawing on a multi-method framework, the study analyzes temporal posting patterns, influence dynamics, thematic preferences, and sentiment-weighted topic expressions across three distinct migration phases: Pre-Ban, Refugee Surge, and Stabilization.
  An entropy-weighted influence score was used to classify users into high- and low-influence groups, enabling comparative analysis of content strategies. Findings reveal that while dominant topics remained relatively stable over time (e.g., self-expression, lifestyle, and creativity), high-influence users were more likely to engage in culturally resonant or commercially strategic content. Additionally, political discourse was not avoided, but selectively activated as a point of transnational engagement.
  Emotionally, high-influence users tended to express more positive affect in culturally connective topics, while low-influence users showed stronger emotional intensity in personal narratives. These findings suggest that cross-cultural platform migration is shaped not only by structural affordances but also by users' differential capacities to adapt, perform, and maintain visibility. The study contributes to literature on platform society, affective publics, and user agency in transnational digital environments.</description>

      <title>The Value of Patience in Online Grocery Shopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the COVID-19 pandemic, online grocery shopping has rapidly reshaped consumer behavior worldwide, fueled by ever-faster delivery promises aimed at maximizing convenience. Yet, this growth has also substantially increased urban traffic congestion, emissions, and pollution. Despite extensive research on urban delivery optimization, little is known about the trade-off between individual convenience and these societal costs. In this study, we investigate the value of marginal extensions in delivery times, termed customer patience, in mitigating the traffic burden caused by grocery deliveries. We first conceptualize the problem and present a mathematical model that highlights a convex relationship between patience and traffic congestion. The theoretical predictions are confirmed by an extensive, network-science based analysis leveraging two large-scale datasets encompassing over 8 million grocery orders in Dubai. Our findings reveal that allowing just five additional minutes in delivery time reduces daily delivery mileage by approximately 30 percent and life-cycle CO2 emissions by 20 percent. Beyond ten minutes of added patience, however, marginal benefits diminish significantly. These results highlight that modest increases in consumer patience can deliver substantial gains in traffic reduction and sustainability, offering a scalable strategy to balance individual convenience with societal welfare in urban delivery systems.</description>

      <title>UniqueRank: Identifying Important and Difficult-to-Replace Nodes in Attributed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Node-ranking methods that focus on structural importance are widely used in a variety of applications, from ranking webpages in search engines to identifying key molecules in biomolecular networks. In real social, supply chain, and terrorist networks, one definition of importance considers the impact on information flow or network productivity when a given node is removed. In practice, however, a nearby node may be able to replace another node upon removal, allowing the network to continue functioning as before. This replaceability is an aspect that existing ranking methods do not consider. To address this, we introduce UniqueRank, a Markov-Chain-based approach that captures attribute uniqueness in addition to structural importance, making top-ranked nodes harder to replace. We find that UniqueRank identifies important nodes with dissimilar attributes from its neighbors in simple symmetric networks with known ground truth. Further, on real terrorist, social, and supply chain networks, we demonstrate that removing and attempting to replace top UniqueRank nodes often yields larger efficiency reductions than removing and attempting to replace top nodes ranked by competing methods. Finally, we show UniqueRank's versatility by demonstrating its potential to identify structurally critical atoms with unique chemical environments in biomolecular structures.</description>

      <title>Belief propagation for finite networks using a symmetry-breaking source node</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Belief Propagation (BP) is an efficient message-passing algorithm widely used for inference in graphical models and for solving various problems in statistical physics. However, BP often yields inaccurate estimates of order parameters and their susceptibilities in finite systems, particularly in sparse networks with few loops. Here, we show for both percolation and Ising models that fixing the state of a single well-connected "source" node to break global symmetry substantially improves inference accuracy and captures finite-size effects across a broad range of networks, especially tree-like ones, at no additional computational cost.</description>

      <title>From Newborn to Impact: Bias-Aware Citation Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a key to accessing research impact, citation dynamics underpins research evaluation, scholarly recommendation, and the study of knowledge diffusion. Citation prediction is particularly critical for newborn papers, where early assessment must be performed without citation signals and under highly long-tailed distributions. We identify two key research gaps: (i) insufficient modeling of implicit factors of scientific impact, leading to reliance on coarse proxies; and (ii) a lack of bias-aware learning that can deliver stable predictions on lowly cited papers. We address these gaps by proposing a Bias-Aware Citation Prediction Framework, which combines multi-agent feature extraction with robust graph representation learning. First, a multi-agent x graph co-learning module derives fine-grained, interpretable signals, such as reproducibility, collaboration network, and text quality, from metadata and external resources, and fuses them with heterogeneous-network embeddings to provide rich supervision even in the absence of early citation signals. Second, we incorporate a set of robust mechanisms: a two-stage forward process that routes explicit factors through an intermediate exposure estimate, GroupDRO to optimize worst-case group risk across environments, and a regularization head that performs what-if analyses on controllable factors under monotonicity and smoothness constraints. Comprehensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. Specifically, our model achieves around a 13% reduction in error metrics (MALE and RMSLE) and a notable 5.5% improvement in the ranking metric (NDCG) over the baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Unfair Mistakes on Social Media: How Demographic Characteristics influence Authorship Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Authorship attribution techniques are increasingly being used in online contexts such as sock puppet detection, malicious account linking, and cross-platform account linking. Yet, it is unknown whether these models perform equitably across different demographic groups. Bias in such techniques could lead to false accusations, account banning, and privacy violations disproportionately impacting users from certain demographics. In this paper, we systematically audit authorship attribution for bias with respect to gender, native language, and age. We evaluate fairness in 3 ways. First, we evaluate how the proportion of users with a certain demographic characteristic impacts the overall classifier performance. Second, we evaluate if a user's demographic characteristics influence the probability that their texts are misclassified. Our analysis indicates that authorship attribution does not demonstrate bias across demographic groups in the closed-world setting. Third, we evaluate the types of errors that occur when the true author is removed from the suspect set, thereby forcing the classifier to choose an incorrect author. Unlike the first two settings, this analysis demonstrates a tendency to attribute authorship to users who share the same demographic characteristic as the true author. Crucially, these errors do not only include texts that deviate from a user's usual style, but also those that are very close to the author's average. Our results highlight that though a model may appear fair in the closed-world setting for a performant classifier, this does not guarantee fairness when errors are inevitable.</description>

      <title>From Substitution to Complement? Uncovering the Evolving Interplay between Ride-hailing Services and Public Transit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The literature on transportation network companies (TNCs), also known as ride-hailing services, has often characterized these service providers as predominantly substitutive to public transit (PT). However, as TNC markets expand and mature, the complementary and substitutive relationships with PT may shift. To explore whether such a transformation is occurring, this study collected travel data from 96,716 ride-hailing vehicles during September 2022 in Shanghai, a city characterized by an increasingly saturated TNC market. An enhanced data-driven framework is proposed to classify TNC-PT relationships into four types: first-mile complementary, last-mile complementary, substitutive, and independent. Our findings indicate comparable ratios of complementary trips (9.22%) and substitutive trips (9.06%), contrasting sharply with the findings of prior studies. Furthermore, to examine the nonlinear impact of various influential factors on these ratios, a machine learning method integrating categorical boosting (CatBoost) and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) is proposed. The results show significant nonlinear effects in some variables, including the distance to the nearest metro station and the density of bus stops. Moreover, metro hubs and regular single-line stations exhibit distinct effects on first- or last-mile complementary ratios. These ratios' relation to the distance to single-line stations shows an inverted U-shaped pattern, with effects rising sharply within 1.5 km, remaining at the peak between 1.5 and 3 km, and then declining as the distance increases to about 15 km.</description>

      <title>Sync or Sink: Bounds on Algorithmic Collective Action with Noise and Multiple Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective action against algorithmic systems, which enables groups to promote their own interests, is poised to grow. Hence, there will be growth in the size and the number of distinct collectives. Currently, there is no formal analysis of how coordination challenges within a collective can impact downstream outcomes, or how multiple collectives may affect each other's success. In this work, we aim to provide guarantees on the success of collective action in the presence of both coordination noise and multiple groups. Our insight is that data generated by either multiple collectives or by coordination noise can be viewed as originating from multiple data distributions. Using this framing, we derive bounds on the success of collective action. We conduct experiments to study the effects of noise on collective action. We find that sufficiently high levels of noise can reduce the success of collective action. In certain scenarios, large noise can sink a collective success rate from $100\%$ to just under $60\%$. We identify potential trade-offs between collective size and coordination noise; for example, a collective that is twice as big but with four times more noise experiencing worse outcomes than the smaller, more coordinated one. This work highlights the importance of understanding nuanced dynamics of strategic behavior in algorithmic systems.</description>

      <title>Learning Peer Influence Probabilities with Linear Contextual Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In networked environments, users frequently share recommendations about content, products, services, and courses of action with others. The extent to which such recommendations are successful and adopted is highly contextual, dependent on the characteristics of the sender, recipient, their relationship, the recommended item, and the medium, which makes peer influence probabilities highly heterogeneous. Accurate estimation of these probabilities is key to understanding information diffusion processes and to improving the effectiveness of viral marketing strategies. However, learning these probabilities from data is challenging; static data may capture correlations between peer recommendations and peer actions but fails to reveal influence relationships. Online learning algorithms can learn these probabilities from interventions but either waste resources by learning from random exploration or optimize for rewards, thus favoring exploration of the space with higher influence probabilities. In this work, we study learning peer influence probabilities under a contextual linear bandit framework. We show that a fundamental trade-off can arise between regret minimization and estimation error, characterize all achievable rate pairs, and propose an uncertainty-guided exploration algorithm that, by tuning a parameter, attains any pair within this trade-off. Our experiments on semi-synthetic network datasets show the advantages of our method over static methods and contextual bandits that ignore this trade-off.</description>

      <title>Learning to Make Friends: Coaching LLM Agents toward Emergent Social Ties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can large language model (LLM) agents reproduce the complex social dynamics that characterize human online behavior -- shaped by homophily, reciprocity, and social validation -- and what memory and learning mechanisms enable such dynamics to emerge? We present a multi-agent LLM simulation framework in which agents repeatedly interact, evaluate one another, and adapt their behavior through in-context learning accelerated by a coaching signal. To model human social behavior, we design behavioral reward functions that capture core drivers of online engagement, including social interaction, information seeking, self-presentation, coordination, and emotional support. These rewards align agent objectives with empirically observed user motivations, enabling the study of how network structures and group formations emerge from individual decision-making. Our experiments show that coached LLM agents develop stable interaction patterns and form emergent social ties, yielding network structures that mirror properties of real online communities. By combining behavioral rewards with in-context adaptation, our framework establishes a principled testbed for investigating collective dynamics in LLM populations and reveals how artificial agents may approximate or diverge from human-like social behavior.</description>

      <title>Network Prebunking Problem: Optimizing Prebunking Targets to Suppress the Spread of Misinformation in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a countermeasure against misinformation that undermines the healthy use of social media, a preventive intervention known as \textit{prebunking} has recently attracted attention in the field of psychology. Prebunking aims to strengthen individuals' cognitive resistance to misinformation by presenting weakened doses of misinformation or by teaching common manipulation techniques before they encounter actual misinformation. Despite the growing body of evidence supporting its effectiveness in reducing susceptibility to misinformation at the individual level, an important open question remains: how best to identify the optimal targets for prebunking interventions to mitigate the spread of misinformation in a social network. To address this issue, we formulate a combinatorial optimization problem, called the \textit{network prebunking problem}, which aims to select optimal prebunking targets that minimizes the spread of misinformation in a social network under limited intervention budgets. We show that the problem is NP-hard and that its objective function is monotone and submodular, which provides a theoretical foundation for approximation guarantees of greedy algorithms. However, since the greedy algorithm is computationally expensive and does not scale to large networks, we propose an efficient approximation algorithm, MIA-NPP, based on the Maximum Influence Arborescence (MIA) approach, which restricts influence propagation around each node to a local directed tree rooted at that node. Through numerical experiments using real-world social network datasets, we demonstrate that MIA-NPP effectively suppresses the spread of misinformation under both fully observed and uncertain model parameter settings.</description>

      <title>Fast Unbiased Sampling of Networks with Given Expected Degrees and Strengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13230v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The configuration model is a cornerstone of statistical assessment of network structure. While the Chung-Lu model is among the most widely used configuration models, it systematically oversamples edges between large-degree nodes, leading to inaccurate statistical conclusions. Although the maximum entropy principle offers unbiased configuration models, its high computational cost has hindered widespread adoption, making the Chung-Lu model an inaccurate yet persistently practical choice. Here, we propose fast and efficient sampling algorithms for the max-entropy-based models by adapting the Miller-Hagberg algorithm. Evaluation on 103 empirical networks demonstrates 10-1000 times speedup, making theoretically rigorous configuration models practical and contributing to a more accurate understanding of network structure.</description>

      <title>Learning when to rank: Estimation of partial rankings from sparse, noisy comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02505v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ranking items based on pairwise comparisons is common, from using match outcomes to rank sports teams to using purchase or survey data to rank consumer products. Statistical inference-based methods such as the Bradley-Terry model, which extract rankings based on an underlying generative model, have emerged as flexible and powerful tools to tackle ranking in empirical data. In situations with limited and/or noisy comparisons, it is often challenging to confidently distinguish the performance of different items based on the evidence available in the data. However, most inference-based ranking methods choose to assign each item to a unique rank or score, suggesting a meaningful distinction when there is none. Here, we develop a principled nonparametric Bayesian method, adaptable to any statistical ranking method, for learning partial rankings (rankings with ties) that distinguishes among the ranks of different items only when there is sufficient evidence available in the data. We develop a fast agglomerative algorithm to perform Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) inference of partial rankings under our framework and examine the performance of our method on a variety of real and synthetic network datasets, finding that it frequently gives a more parsimonious summary of the data than traditional ranking, particularly when observations are sparse.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Local Search Approach for Polarized Community Discovery in Signed Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02197v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Signed networks, where edges are labeled as positive or negative to represent friendly or antagonistic interactions, provide a natural framework for analyzing polarization, trust, and conflict in social systems. Detecting meaningful group structures in such networks is crucial for understanding online discourse, political divisions, and trust dynamics. A key challenge is to identify communities that are internally cohesive and externally antagonistic, while allowing for neutral or unaligned vertices. In this paper, we propose a method for identifying $k$ polarized communities that addresses a major limitation of prior methods: their tendency to produce highly size-imbalanced solutions. We introduce a novel optimization objective that avoids such imbalance. In addition, it is well known that approximation algorithms based on local search are highly effective for clustering signed networks when neutral vertices are not allowed. We build on this idea and design the first local search algorithm that extends to the setting with neutral vertices while scaling to large networks. By connecting our approach to block-coordinate Frank-Wolfe optimization, we prove a linear convergence rate, enabled by the structure of our objective. Experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality, while remaining competitive in computational efficiency.</description>

Abstract: We introduce VERA-MH (Validation of Ethical and Responsible AI in Mental Health), an automated evaluation of the safety of AI chatbots used in mental health contexts, with an initial focus on suicide risk.
  Practicing clinicians and academic experts developed a rubric informed by best practices for suicide risk management for the evaluation. To fully automate the process, we used two ancillary AI agents. A user-agent model simulates users engaging in a mental health-based conversation with the chatbot under evaluation. The user-agent role-plays specific personas with pre-defined risk levels and other features. Simulated conversations are then passed to a judge-agent who scores them based on the rubric. The final evaluation of the chatbot being tested is obtained by aggregating the scoring of each conversation.
  VERA-MH is actively under development and undergoing rigorous validation by mental health clinicians to ensure user-agents realistically act as patients and that the judge-agent accurately scores the AI chatbot. To date we have conducted preliminary evaluation of GPT-5, Claude Opus and Claude Sonnet using initial versions of the VERA-MH rubric and used the findings for further design development. Next steps will include more robust clinical validation and iteration, as well as refining actionable scoring. We are seeking feedback from the community on both the technical and clinical aspects of our evaluation.</description>
