      <title>Computational aspects of disks enclosing many points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a set of $n$ points in the plane. We present several different algorithms for finding a pair of points in $S$ such that any disk that contains that pair must contain at least $cn$ points of $S$, for some constant $c&gt;0$. The first is a randomized algorithm that finds a pair in $O(n\log n)$ expected time for points in general position, and $c = 1/2-\sqrt{(1+2\alpha)/12}$, for any $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$. The second algorithm, also for points in general position, takes quadratic time, but the constant $c$ is improved to $1/2-1/{\sqrt{12}} \approx 1/4.7$. The second algorithm can also be used as a subroutine to find the pair that maximizes the number of points inside any disk that contains the pair, in $O(n^2\log n)$ time. We also consider variants of the problem. When the set $S$ is in convex position, we present an algorithm that finds in linear time a pair of points such that any disk through them contains at least $n/3$ points of $ S $. For the variant where we are only interested in finding a pair such that the diametral disk of that pair contains many points, we also have a linear-time algorithm that finds a disk with at least $n/3$ points of $S$. Finally, we present a generalization of the first two algorithms to the case where the set $S$ of points is coloured using two colours. We also consider adapting these algorithms to solve the same problems when $S$ is a set of points inside of a simple polygon $P$, with the notion of a disk replaced by that of a geodesic disk.</description>

      <title>How many times can two minimum spanning trees cross?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a generic set of $n$ points in the plane, and let $P=R\cup B$ be a coloring of $P$ in two colors. We are interested in the number of crossings between the minimum spanning trees (MSTs) of $R$ and $B$, denoted by $\crossAB(R,B)$. We define the \emph{bicolored MST crossing number} of $P$, denoted by $\cross(P)$, as $\cross(P) = \max_{P= R\cup B}(\crossAB(R,B))$. We prove a linear upper bound for $\cross(P)$ when $P$ is generic. If $P$ is dense or in convex position, we provide linear lower bounds. Lastly, if $P$ is chosen uniformly at random from the unit square and is colored uniformly at random, we prove that the expected value of $\crossAB(R,B)$ is linear.</description>

      <title>On Triangles in Colored Pseudoline Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the faces in pseudoline arrangements in which the pseudolines are colored with two colors. Bj\"orner, Las Vergnas, Sturmfels, White, and Ziegler conjecture the existence of a two-colored triangle in such arrangements. We consider variants of this problem. We show that in any non-trivial two-coloring of a pseudoline arrangement there exists a two-colored triangle or quadrangle. We also investigate the existence of a bichromatic triangle assuming certain structures on the coloring.
  Previously, several authors investigated the chromatic number and independence number of hypergraphs whose vertices correspond to the pseudolines of an arrangement and the hyperedges correspond to the faces of the arrangement. We show that the maximum of the independence numbers of such hypergraphs is $\lceil \frac{2}{3}n-1\rceil$. We also prove that if we only consider the triangular faces then this maximum becomes $n-\Theta(\log n)$.</description>
