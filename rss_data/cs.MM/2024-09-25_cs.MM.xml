      <title>Rethinking Emotion Bias in Music via Frechet Audio Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The subjective nature of music emotion introduces inherent bias in both recognition and generation, especially when relying on a single audio encoder, emotion classifier, or evaluation metric. In this work, we conduct a study on Music Emotion Recognition (MER) and Emotional Music Generation (EMG), employing diverse audio encoders alongside the Frechet Audio Distance (FAD), a reference-free evaluation metric. Our study begins with a benchmark evaluation of MER, highlighting the limitations associated with using a single audio encoder and the disparities observed across different measurements. We then propose assessing MER performance using FAD from multiple encoders to provide a more objective measure of music emotion. Furthermore, we introduce an enhanced EMG approach designed to improve both the variation and prominence of generated music emotion, thus enhancing realism. Additionally, we investigate the realism disparities between the emotions conveyed in real and synthetic music, comparing our EMG model against two baseline models. Experimental results underscore the emotion bias problem in both MER and EMG and demonstrate the potential of using FAD and diverse audio encoders to evaluate music emotion objectively.</description>

      <title>Revise, Reason, and Recognize: LLM-Based Emotion Recognition via Emotion-Specific Prompts and ASR Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15551</link>

Abstract: Annotating and recognizing speech emotion using prompt engineering has recently emerged with the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet its efficacy and reliability remain questionable. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study on this topic, beginning with the proposal of novel prompts that incorporate emotion-specific knowledge from acoustics, linguistics, and psychology. Subsequently, we examine the effectiveness of LLM-based prompting on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcription, contrasting it with ground-truth transcription. Furthermore, we propose a Revise-Reason-Recognize prompting pipeline for robust LLM-based emotion recognition from spoken language with ASR errors. Additionally, experiments on context-aware learning, in-context learning, and instruction tuning are performed to examine the usefulness of LLM training schemes in this direction. Finally, we investigate the sensitivity of LLMs to minor prompt variations. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the emotion-specific prompts, ASR error correction, and LLM training schemes for LLM-based emotion recognition. Our study aims to refine the use of LLMs in emotion recognition and related domains.</description>

      <title>Layer-wise Model Merging for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Segmentation Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Merging parameters of multiple models has resurfaced as an effective strategy to enhance task performance and robustness, but prior work is limited by the high costs of ensemble creation and inference. In this paper, we leverage the abundance of freely accessible trained models to introduce a cost-free approach to model merging. It focuses on a layer-wise integration of merged models, aiming to maintain the distinctiveness of the task-specific final layers while unifying the initial layers, which are primarily associated with feature extraction. This approach ensures parameter consistency across all layers, essential for boosting performance. Moreover, it facilitates seamless integration of knowledge, enabling effective merging of models from different datasets and tasks. Specifically, we investigate its applicability in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), an unexplored area for model merging, for Semantic and Panoptic Segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate substantial UDA improvements without additional costs for merging same-architecture models from distinct datasets ($\uparrow 2.6\%$ mIoU) and different-architecture models with a shared backbone ($\uparrow 6.8\%$ mIoU). Furthermore, merging Semantic and Panoptic Segmentation models increases mPQ by $\uparrow 7\%$. These findings are validated across a wide variety of UDA strategies, architectures, and datasets.</description>

      <title>HA-FGOVD: Highlighting Fine-grained Attributes via Explicit Linear Composition for Open-Vocabulary Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) models are considered to be Large Multi-modal Models (LMM), due to their extensive training data and a large number of parameters. Mainstream OVD models prioritize object coarse-grained category rather than focus on their fine-grained attributes, e.g., colors or materials, thus failed to identify objects specified with certain attributes. However, OVD models are pretrained on large-scale image-text pairs with rich attribute words, whose latent feature space can represent the global text feature as a linear composition of fine-grained attribute tokens without highlighting them. Therefore, we propose in this paper a universal and explicit approach for frozen mainstream OVD models that boosts their attribute-level detection capabilities by highlighting fine-grained attributes in explicit linear space. Firstly, a LLM is leveraged to highlight attribute words within the input text as a zero-shot prompted task. Secondly, by strategically adjusting the token masks, the text encoders of OVD models extract both global text and attribute-specific features, which are then explicitly composited as two vectors in linear space to form the new attribute-highlighted feature for detection tasks, where corresponding scalars are hand-crafted or learned to reweight both two vectors. Notably, these scalars can be seamlessly transferred among different OVD models, which proves that such an explicit linear composition is universal. Empirical evaluation on the FG-OVD dataset demonstrates that our proposed method uniformly improves fine-grained attribute-level OVD of various mainstream models and achieves new state-of-the-art performance.</description>
