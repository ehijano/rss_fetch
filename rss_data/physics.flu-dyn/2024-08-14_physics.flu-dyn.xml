      <title>Separation of a Laminar Boundary Layer Subjected to Pressure Gradients with Spanwise Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characteristics of three-dimensional laminar separation bubbles (LSBs), compared with their quasi-two-dimensional counterparts, are studied using direct numerical simulation. A three-dimensional suction-blowing distribution is applied on the top boundary to induce flow separation. Three levels of suction strength (i.e., adverse pressure gradient (APG) strength) are tested. For each suction level, the spanwise extent of the suction is varied using a Gaussian distribution centered about the domain centerline. Two non-uniform suction distributions are compared with uniformly-applied suction across the full span (implying a two-dimensional LSB), totaling nine cases. All cases are performed at $Re_\delta = U_{\infty}\delta/\nu = 1000$ based on the inflow boundary layer thickness ($\delta$) and free-stream velocity ($U_{\infty}$). Initial results indicate stark contrast between three-dimensional and two-dimensional LSBs. Most notably, the role of suction width is determining the topology of the LSB and its reattachment mechanism. Meanwhile, APG is responsible for determining the size of the LSB and level of turbulence at reattachment. Streamwise-oriented vortices are identified along the crest of the three-dimensional LSBs.</description>

      <title>Generalized incompressible fluid dynamical system interpolating between the Navier-Stokes and Burgers equations in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a set of generalized incompressible fluid dynamical equations, which interpolates between the Burgers and Navier-Stokes equations in two dimensions and study their properties theoretically and numerically. It is well-known that under the assumption of potential flows the multi-dimensional Burgers equations are integrable in the sense they can be reduced to the heat equation, via the so-called Cole-Hopf linearization. On the other hand, it is believed that the Navier-Stokes equations do not possess such a nice property. Take, for example, the 2D Navier-Stokes equations and rotate the velocity gradient by 90 degrees, we then obtain a system which is equivalent to the Burgers equations. Based on this observation, we introduce a system of generalized incompressible fluid dynamical equations by rotating velocity gradient through a continuous angle parameter. That way we can compare properties of an integrable system with those of non-integrable ones by relating them through a continuous parameter. Using direct numerical experiments we show how the flow properties change (actually, deteriorate) when we increase the angle parameter $\alpha$ from 0 to $\pi/2$. It should be noted that the case associated with least regularity, namely the Burgers equations ($\alpha=\pi/2$), is integrable via the heat kernel. We also formalize a perturbative treatment of the problem, which in principle yields the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations on the basis of that of the Burgers equations. The principal variations around the Burgers equations are computed numerically and are shown to agree well with the results of direct numerical simulations for some time.</description>

      <title>Intricate Evaporation Dynamics in Different Multi-Droplet Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the evaporation dynamics of an array of sessile droplets arranged in different configurations. Utilizing a customized goniometer, we capture side and top view profiles to monitor the evolution of height, spread, contact angle, and volume of the droplets. Our results reveal that the lifetime of a droplet array surpasses that of an isolated droplet, attributed to the shielding effect induced by neighbouring droplets, which elevates the local vapour concentration, thereby reducing the evaporation rate. We found that lifetime increases as droplet separation distance decreases at a fixed configuration and substrate temperature. It is observed that the lifetimes increase with the number of droplets. We observe a decrease in lifetimes, following a power law trend with increasing substrate temperature, with the shielding effect diminishing at higher substrate temperatures due to natural convective effects. We also observe a generalised behavior for the centrally placed droplet across various separation distances and substrate temperatures. This arises from different droplet configurations and substrate temperatures, which modify the local vapour concentration around the droplets without significantly impacting the contact line dynamics. Additionally, the experimental results are compared with a diffusion-based theoretical model that incorporates the evaporative cooling effect to predict the lifetime of the central droplet within the array. We observe that the theoretical model satisfactorily predicts the lifetime of the droplet at room temperature. However, for high-temperature cases, the model slightly overpredicts the evaporative lifetimes.</description>

      <title>Buoyancy induced motion of a Newtonian drop in elastoviscoplastic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate theoretically the buoyancy-driven motion of a viscous drop in a yield-stress material, incorporating elastic effects represented by the Saramito-Herschel-Bulkley constitutive equation. We solve the governing equations using an open-source finite volume solver and utilizing the volume of fluid technique to accurately capture the interface between the two fluids. To validate our numerical approach, we compare our results with data from previous experimental and numerical studies. We find quantitative agreement in terms of terminal velocities and drop shapes, affirming the accuracy of our model and its numerical solution. Notably, we observe that incorporating elastic effects into the modelling of the continuous phase is essential for predicting phenomena reported in experiments, such as the inversion of the flow field behind the sedimenting drop (i.e., the negative wake) or the formation of a teardrop shape. Due to the elastoviscoplastic nature of the continuous phase, we observe that small drops remain entrapped because the buoyancy force is insufficient to fluidize the surrounding material. We investigate entrapment conditions using two different protocols, which yield different outcomes due to the interplay between capillarity and elasto-plasticity. Finally, we conduct an extensive parametric analysis to evaluate the impact of rheological parameters (yield stress, elastic modulus, and interfacial tension) on the dynamics of sedimentation.</description>

      <title>Deep reinforcement learning for the management of the wall regeneration cycle in wall-bounded turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wall cycle in wall-bounded turbulent flows is a complex turbulence regeneration mechanism that remains not fully understood. This study explores the potential of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for managing the wall regeneration cycle to achieve desired flow dynamics. We integrate the StableBaselines3 DRL libraries with the open-source DNS solver CaNS to create a robust platform for dynamic flow control. The DRL agent interacts with the DNS environment, learning policies that modify wall boundary conditions to optimize objectives such as the reduction of the skin-friction coefficient or the enhancement of certain coherent structures features.
  Initial experiments demonstrate the capability of DRL to achieve drag-reduction rates comparable with those achieved via traditional methods, though limited to short time periods. We also propose a strategy to enhance the coherence of velocity streaks, assuming that maintaining straight streaks can inhibit instability and further reduce skin friction. The implementation makes use of the message-passing-interface (MPI) wrappers for efficient communication between the Python-based DRL agent and the DNS solver, ensuring scalability on high-performance computing architectures.
  Our results highlight the promise of DRL in flow control applications and underscore the need for more advanced control laws and objective functions. Future work will focus on optimizing actuation periods and exploring new computational architectures to extend the applicability and the efficiency of DRL in turbulent flow management.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the checkerboard problem to reduce numerical dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work provides a comprehensive exploration of various methods in solving incompressible flows using a projection method, and their relation to the occurrence and management of checkerboard oscillations. It employs an algebraic symmetry-preserving framework, clarifying the derivation and implementation of discrete operators while also addressing the associated numerical errors. The lack of a proper definition for the checkerboard problem is addressed by proposing a physics-based coefficient. This coefficient, rooted in the disparity between the compact- and wide-stencil Laplacian operators, is able to quantify oscillatory solution fields with a physics-based, global, normalised, non-dimensional value. The influence of mesh and time-step refinement on the occurrence of checkerboarding is highlighted. Therefore, single measurements using this coefficient should be considered with caution, as the value presents little use without any context and can either suggest mesh refinement or use of a different solver. In addition, an example is given on how to employ this coefficient, by establishing a negative feedback between the level of checkerboarding and the inclusion of a pressure predictor, to dynamically balance the checkerboarding and numerical dissipation. This method is tested for laminar and turbulent flows, demonstrating its capabilities in obtaining this dynamical balance, without requiring user input. The method is able to achieve low numerical dissipation in absence of oscillations or diminish oscillation on skew meshes, while it shows minimal loss in accuracy for a turbulent test case. Despite its advantages, the method exhibits a slight decrease in the second-order relation between time-step size and pressure error, suggesting that other feedback mechanisms could be of interest.</description>

      <title>Linear stability analysis of a vertical liquid film over a moving substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of liquid film flows are important in many industrial applications. In the dip-coating process, a liquid film is formed over a substrate extracted at a constant speed from a liquid bath. We studied the linear stability of this film considering different thicknesses $\hat{h}$ for four liquids, spanning a large range of Kapitza numbers ($\rm Ka$). By solving the Orr-Sommerfeld eigenvalue problem with the Chebyshev-Tau spectral method, we calculated the neutral curves, investigated the instability mechanism and computed the absolute/convective threshold. The instability mechanism was studied through the analysis of vorticity distribution and the kinetic energy balance of the perturbations. It was found that liquids with low $\rm Ka$ (e.g. corn oil, $\text{Ka}$ = 4) have a smaller area of stability than a liquid at high $\rm Ka$ (e.g. Liquid Zinc, $\rm Ka$ = 11525). Surface tension has both a stabilizing and a destabilizing effect, especially for large $\rm Ka$. For long waves, it curves the vorticity lines near the substrate, reducing the flow under the crests. For short waves, it fosters vorticity production at the interface and creates a region of intense vorticity near the substrate. In addition, we discovered that the surface tension contributes to both the production and dissipation of perturbation's energy depending on the $\rm Ka$ number. In terms of absolute/convective threshold, we found a window of absolute instability in the $\text{Re}-\hat{h}$ space, showing that the Landau-Levich-Derjaguin solution ($\hat{h}=0.945 \text{Re}^{1/9}\text{Ka}^{-1/6}$) is always convectively unstable. Moreover, we show that for $\text{Ka}&lt;17$, the Derjaguin's solution ($\hat{h}=1$) is always convectively unstable.</description>

      <title>Convolutional Neural Networks For Turbulent Model Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex turbulent flow simulations are an integral aspect of the engineering design process. The mainstay of these simulations is represented by eddy viscosity based turbulence models. Eddy viscosity models are computationally cheap due to their underlying simplifications, but their predictions are also subject to structural errors. At the moment, the only method available to forecast these uncertainties is the Eigenspace Perturbation Method. This method's strictly physics-based approach frequently results in unreasonably high uncertainty bounds, which drive the creation of extremely cautious designs. To tackle this problem, we employ a strategy based on deep learning. In order to control the perturbations, our trained deep learning models forecast the appropriate amount of disturbance to apply to the anticipated Reynolds stresses. A Convolutional Neural Network is used to carry out this, and it is trained to distinguish between high fidelity data, which is a mapping of flow characteristics, and model projections based on eddy viscosity.</description>

      <title>High-speed ditching of double curvature specimens with cavitation and ventilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The water entry at high horizontal speed of double-curvature specimens, reproducing the rear part of the fuselage that first gets in contact with the water during aircraft ditching, is investigated experimentally. Three shapes are analysed, representing different aircraft types. Pressure and load measurements are taken, supported by underwater high-speed visualization. The effects of different horizontal speeds, pitch angles, and curvatures are analysed, while keeping a constant vertical-to-horizontal velocity ratio. It is observed that the longitudinal curvature plays a significant role in the hydrodynamics, potentially leading to cavitation and ventilation in the rear part of the specimen at high speeds. The transverse curvature affects the pressures and loads both at the front and at the rear, since a lower transverse curvature increases the possibility of the fluid to escape from the sides. An increase in pitch angle results in an increased loading, in terms of both amplitude and distribution. Finally, an increased horizontal speed leads to higher loads at the front but also affects the cavitation and ventilation modalities at the rear. The load scaling for flat plates also applies to these specimens at the front, but the occurrence of cavitation and ventilation invalidates it at the rear. The time evolution of the cavitation region and of the wetted area are examined through advanced image processing techniques and pressure data analysis. The comparison with the geometric intersection area of the specimen with the still water surface provides further insight into the hydrodynamic phenomena during the water entry.</description>

      <title>A three-layer model for the dam-break flow of particulate suspensions driven by sedimentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a system of Saint-Venant-type equations to model laboratory experiments of dam-break particle-laden flows. We explore homogeneous and non-cohesive liquid-solid suspensions of monodispersed glass beads that propagate as single-phase flows, forming a progressively growing deposit of particles at the bottom of a smooth channel and creating a thin layer of pure liquid at the surface. The novelty of this model is twofold. First, we fully characterize the first-order behavior of these flows (mean velocity, runout distances and deposits geometry) through the sole sedimentation process of the grains, thus avoiding the use of any artificial friction to stop the flow. The model remains very simple and turns out to be effective despite the complex nature of interactions involved in these phenomena. Secondly, the sedimentation dynamics of the grains is observed to not being mainly affected by the flow, but remains comparable to that measured in static suspensions. The mathematical model is validated by comparing the experimental kinematics and deposit profiles with the simulations. The results highlight that this simplified model is sufficient to describe the general features of these flows as well as their deposit morphology, provided that the settling rate is adjusted starting from a critical value of the Reynolds number where the flow agitation begins to significantly delay the mean sedimentation velocity.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Induced Separation of a Laminar Boundary Layer over a Partially-Slip Wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characteristics of pressure-induced laminar separation bubbles (LSBs) over a partially-slip wall, compared with that over a canonical no-slip wall, are studied using direct numerical simulation. Three cases, two utilizing linear Robin-type slip boundary conditions of differing slip length ($\Lambda$), and one non-slip are compared. For the partial-slip cases, a streamwise distribution of slip profile is employed ensuring smooth transition between no-slip and partial-slip (transition from no-slip to a constant slip length takes 5$\delta$, where $\delta$ is the inflow boundary layer thickness). The constant target slip length is maintained for $20\delta$ upstream and during the onset of flow separation. The separation is induced by a wall-normal velocity profile applied at the top boundary. All cases are performed at $Re_\delta = U_{\infty}\delta/\nu = 455$. Initial results indicate that as slip length increases, separation and reattachment are delayed. Most notably, the formation and shedding of roller vortices is mitigated as slip length increases, resulting in a less turbulent wake, despite that self-similarity of the plane shear layer is maintained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rogue waves are associated with various ocean processes, both at the coast and in the open ocean. In either zone, inhomogeneities in the wave field caused by shoaling, crossing seas or current interactions disturb wave statistics, increasing rogue wave probability and magnitude. Such amplification of the frequency of rogue waves and their intensity, i.e. the maximum normalized height, have been attested in numerical simulations and laboratory studies, in particular for wave-current interactions. In this study, we investigate the effect of the current intensity and direction on rogue wave probability, by analyzing long-term observations from the southern North Sea. We observe that the amplification is similar for opposing and following currents. Despite the sea states being dominantly broad-banded and featuring a large directional spread, anomalous statistics are of the same order of magnitude as those observed in unidirectional laboratory experiments for stationary currents.</description>

      <title>On Long-Crested Ocean Rogue Waves Originating From Localized Amplitude and Frequency Modulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rogue waves are known to occur on the ocean surface leading to significant damage to marine installations and compromising ship safety. Understanding the physical mechanisms responsible for extreme wave focusing is crucial in order to predict and prevent their formation and impact. Two intensively discussed wave amplification frameworks are the linear and nonlinear focusing mechanisms. These are also known as superposition principle and modulation instability, respectively. We report an experimental study investigating the formation mechanism in a unidirectional representative JONSWAP-type sea state and show that the nonlinear focusing mechanism can be sub-categorized into either a localized amplitude or a so far less-studied phase-related frequency modulation, or both being at play. The frequency modulation-type mechanism occurs at a lower probability, as suggested from the distribution of more than 200 extreme events, however, it cannot be underrated or disregarded.</description>

      <title>Quantification of salt transports due to exchange flow and tidal flow in estuaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To understand mechanisms of salt intrusion in estuaries, we develop a semi-analytical model, that explicitly accounts for salt transport by both exchange flow and tidal flow. This model, after calibration, successfully hindcasts hydrodynamics and salinity dynamics in three estuaries that have strongly different characteristics. We find, from analyzing the model results for these three estuaries, that salt transport processes by exchange flow and tidal flow interact through the subtidal stratification. Transport by exchange flow creates stratification, thereby generating a phase shift of tidal salinity with respect to the tidal flow, which is important for the magnitude of the tidal salt transport. Conversely, the strength of tidal currents determines the vertical mixing that breaks down stratification. A new analytical formulation is presented for the component of the salt transport driven by the depth-averaged tidal flow. This salt transport is larger than the component associated with the vertical shear of the tidal current. Finally, a method that yields analytical equations that quantify the importance of different contributions to the salt transport using only primary information is developed using approximate solutions for the subtidal stratification. This method performs well for the estuaries considered.</description>

      <title>A global summary of seafloor topography influenced by turbulent water mixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulent water motions are important for the exchange of momentum, heat, nutrients, and suspended matter including sediments in the deep-sea that is generally stably stratified in density. To maintain ocean-density stratification, an irreversible diapycnal turbulent transport is needed. The geological shape and texture of marine topography is important for water mixing as most of deep-sea turbulence is generated via breaking internal waves at sloping seafloors. For example, slopes of semidiurnal internal tidal characteristics can critically match the mean seafloor slope. In this paper, the concept of critical slopes are revisited from a global internal wave-turbulence viewpoint seafloor topography -- and using moored high-resolution temperature sensor data. Observations suggest that turbulence generation via internal wave breaking at 5+/-1.5% of all seafloors is sufficient to maintain ocean-density stratification. However most, &gt;90%, turbulence contribution is found at supercritical, rather than the more limited critical, slopes measured at 1-minute-scales that cover about 50% of seafloors at water depths &lt; 2000 m. Internal tides (about 60%) dominate over near-inertial waves (about 40%), which is confirmed from comparison of NE-Atlantic data with East-Mediterranean data (no tides). Seafloor-elevation spectra show a wavenumber (k) fall-off rate of k^-3, which is steeper than previously found. The fall-off rate is even steeper, resulting in less elevation-variance, in a one-order-of-magnitude bandwidth around k_T=0.5 cycle-per-km. The corresponding length is equivalent to the internal tidal excursion. The reduction in seafloor-elevation variance seems associated with erosion by internal wave breaking. Potential robustness of the seafloor-internal wave interaction is discussed.</description>

      <title>The Onset of Intermittency in Active Turbulence</title>

Abstract: Recent results suggest that highly active, chaotic, non-equilibrium states of living fluids might share much in common with high Reynolds number, inertial turbulence. We now show, by using a hydrodynamical model, the onset of intermittency and the consequent multiscaling of Eulerian and Lagrangian structure functions as a function of the bacterial activity. Our results bridge the worlds of low and high Reynolds number flows as well as open up intriguing possibilities of what makes flows intermittent.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of unsteady premixed flames in meso scale channels and the effects of varying the wall heating conditions</title>

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of flames at small scales opens up opportunities to enhance the performance of small-scale power generation devices, micro-reactors, fire safety devices, and numerous other systems that confine combustion to micro/meso scales. The current study delves into the dynamics of laminar premixed methane-air flames in mesoscale channels, subject to different wall heating conditions. Two external heaters, positioned at adjustable distances, are employed to create a bimodal wall heating profile on the combustor walls. The separation distance (d) between the heaters was varied, and the resulting flame dynamics were examined across a wide range of equivalence ratios and Reynolds numbers (Re). The observed dynamics were also compared against a baseline configuration that utilises a single heater to establish an axial unimodal wall temperature profile. Apart from the previously documented observations of unsteady flames with repetitive extinction and ignition (FREI) characteristics, this study identifies an additional unsteady propagating flame (PF) regime. While FREI appeared at stoichiometric and fuel-rich conditions, propagating flames were observed at the equivalence ratio of 0.8. Unlike the FREI regime where the flame extinguishes after a characteristic travel distance, propagating flames continue to travel till they reach the upstream end of the combustor tube, where they extinguish upon encountering a meshed constriction. These flames are associated with a characteristic heat-release-rate oscillation that couples with the pressure fluctuations at frequencies close to the natural harmonic of the combustor tube. These dynamics are discussed in detail with appropriate theoretical arguments to justify the observed trends.</description>

      <title>Absolute and convective instabilities in a liquid film over a substrate moving against gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The drag-out problem for small Reynolds numbers ($\rm Re$) admits the Landau-Levich-Derjaguin (LLD) solution for small capillary numbers ($\rm Ca$), and Derjaguin's solution for large $\rm Ca$. We investigate whether these solutions are absolutely or convectively unstable, solving the Orr-Sommerfeld eigenvalue problem. For Derjaguin's solution, we show that the LLD solution is convectively unstable for $\text{Ka}&lt;17$ and absolutely unstable for $\text{Ka} \gtrsim 0.15 \,\text{Re}^{1.7}$ for $\text{Re} &gt; 10$. For water ($\text{Ka}=3400$), the LLD solution is always convectively unstable. The absolute instability is observed only when the dip-coated film is additionally fed from above.</description>

      <title>How "mixing" affects propagation and structure of intensely turbulent, lean, hydrogen-air premixed flames</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how intrinsically fast hydrogen-air premixed flames can be rendered much faster in turbulence is crucial for systematically developing hydrogen-based gas turbines and spark ignition engines. Here, we present fundamental insights into the variation of flame displacement speeds by investigating how the disrupted flame structure affects speed and vice-versa. Three DNS cases of lean hydrogen-air mixtures with $Le$ from 0.5 to 1 and $Ka$ from 100 to 1000 are analyzed. Suitable comparisons are made with the closest canonical laminar flame configurations at same mixture conditions and their suitability and limitations in expounding turbulent flame properties are elucidated. Since near zero-curvature surface locations are most probable and representative of the average flame geometry in such large $Ka$ flames, this study focuses on the statistical variation of flame displacement speed and the concomitant change in flame structure at those locations. Relevant flame properties are averaged normal to the zero-curvature isotherm regions to obtain the conditional mean flame structures. In the smallest $Le$ case, downstream of the most probable zero-curvature regions, the temperature exceeds that of the standard laminar flame, leading to enhanced local thermal gradient and flame speed. This is due to increased heat-release rate contribution by preferential diffusion in positive curvatures downstream of the zero-curvature locations. In addition, for all cases, the local flame structure is also broadened due to reversal in the direction of the flame speed gradient underpinned by ubiquitous, non-local, cylindrical self-interaction upstream of the zero-curvature regions, leading to localized scalar mixing within the flame structure. These non-local effects combine to define the most probable flame structure and the associated variation in local flame speed in turbulent premixed flames.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Aeroelastic Analyses of Structures in Turbulent Wind Conditions using Enhanced Gaussian Processes with Aerodynamic Priors</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in data-driven aeroelasticity have been driven by the wealth of data available in the wind engineering practice, especially in modeling aerodynamic forces. Despite progress, challenges persist in addressing free-stream turbulence and incorporating physics knowledge into data-driven aerodynamic force models. This paper presents a hybrid Gaussian Process (GPs) methodology for non-linear modeling of aerodynamic forces induced by gusts and motion on bluff bodies. Building on a recently developed GP model of the motion-induced forces, we formulate a hybrid GP aerodynamic force model that incorporates both gust- and motion-induced angles of attack as exogenous inputs, alongside a semi-analytical quasi-steady (QS) model as a physics-based prior knowledge. In this manner, the GP model incorporates the absent physics of the QS model, and the non-dimensional hybrid formulation enhances its appeal from an aerodynamic perspective. We devise a training procedure that leverages simultaneous input signals of gust angles, based on random free-stream turbulence, and motion angles, based on random broadband signals. We verify the methodology through analytical linear aerodynamics of a flat plate and non-linear aerodynamics of a bridge deck using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The standout feature of the presented methodology is its applicability for aeroelastic buffeting analyses, showcasing robustness when handling broadband excitation. Importantly, the non-linear hybrid model preserves its capability to capture higher-order harmonics in the motion-induced forces and remains applicable for flutter analysis, while incorporating both motion and gust angles as input. Applications of the methodology are anticipated in the aeroelastic analysis and monitoring of slender line-like structures.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Super-Resolution Simulation Method of Three-Dimensional Street-Scale Atmospheric Flows for Real-Time Urban Micrometeorology Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A two-stage super-resolution simulation method is proposed for street-scale air temperature and wind velocity, which considerably reduces the computation time while maintaining accuracy. The first stage employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) to correct large-scale flows above buildings in the input low-resolution (LR) simulation results. The second stage uses another CNN to reconstruct small-scale flows between buildings from the output of the first stage, resulting in high-resolution (HR) inferences. The CNNs are trained using HR simulation data for the second stage and their coarse-grained version for the first stage as the ground truth, where the HR simulations are conducted independently of the LR simulations used as input. This learning approach separates the spatial scales of inference in each stage. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated using micrometeorological simulations in an actual urban area around Tokyo Station in Japan. The super-resolution simulation successfully inferred HR atmospheric flows, reducing errors by approximately 50% for air temperature and 60% for wind velocity compared to the LR simulations. Furthermore, the two-stage approach allowed for localized HR inferences, reducing GPU memory usage to as low as 12% during the training phase. The total wall-clock time for 60-min predictions was reduced to 6.83 min, which was approximately 3.32% of the HR simulation time (206 min). The proposed method demonstrates the potential for real-time micrometeorology predictions in urban areas with a combination of physics-based and data-driven models.</description>

      <title>Rotational dynamics of a disk in a thin film of weakly nematic fluid subject to linear friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamics at low Reynolds numbers experiences recent revival in the fields of biophysics and active matter. While in bulk isotropic fluids it is exhaustively studied, this is less so in anisotropic fluids and in confined situations. Here, we combine the latter two by studying the rotation of a disk-like inclusion in a uniaxially anisotropic, globally oriented, incompressible two-dimensional fluid film. In terms of a perturbative expansion in parameters that quantify anisotropies in viscosity and in additional linear friction with a supporting substrate or other type of confinement, we derive analytical expressions for the resulting hydrodynamic flow and pressure fields as well as for the resistance and mobility coefficients of the rotating disk. It turns out that, in contrast to translational motion, the solutions remain well-behaved also in the absence of the additional linear friction. Comparison with results from finite-element simulations show very good agreement with those from our analytical calculations. Besides applications to describe technological systems, for instance, in the area of microfluidics and thin cells of aligned nematic liquid crystals, our solutions are important for quantitative theoretical approaches to fluid membranes and thin films in general featuring a preferred direction.</description>
