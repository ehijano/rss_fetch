      <title>Multi-task Photonic Reservoir Computing: Wavelength Division Multiplexing for Parallel Computing with a Silicon Microring Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, as the ever-increasing demand for more powerful computing resources continues, alternative advanced computing paradigms are under extensive investigation. Significant effort has been made to deviate from conventional Von Neumann architectures. In-memory computing has emerged in the field of electronics as a possible solution to the infamous bottleneck between memory and computing processors, which reduces the effective throughput of data. In photonics, novel schemes attempt to collocate the computing processor and memory in a single device. Photonics offers the flexibility of multiplexing streams of data not only spatially and in time, but also in frequency or, equivalently, in wavelength, which makes it highly suitable for parallel computing. Here, we numerically show the use of time and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) to solve four independent tasks at the same time in a single photonic chip, serving as a proof of concept for our proposal. The system is a time-delay reservoir computing (TDRC) based on a microring resonator (MRR). The addressed tasks cover different applications: Time-series prediction, waveform signal classification, wireless channel equalization, and radar signal prediction. The system is also tested for simultaneous computing of up to 10 instances of the same task, exhibiting excellent performance. The footprint of the system is reduced by using time-division multiplexing of the nodes that act as the neurons of the studied neural network scheme. WDM is used for the parallelization of wavelength channels, each addressing a single task. By adjusting the input power and frequency of each optical channel, we can achieve levels of performance for each of the tasks that are comparable to those quoted in state-of-the-art reports focusing on single-task operation...</description>

      <title>Interactive embodied evolution for socially adept Artificial General Creatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce here the concept of Artificial General Creatures (AGC) which encompasses "robotic or virtual agents with a wide enough range of capabilities to ensure their continued survival". With this in mind, we propose a research line aimed at incrementally building both the technology and the trustworthiness of AGC. The core element in this approach is that trust can only be built over time, through demonstrably mutually beneficial interactions.
  To this end, we advocate starting from unobtrusive, nonthreatening artificial agents that would explicitly collaborate with humans, similarly to what domestic animals do. By combining multiple research fields, from Evolutionary Robotics to Neuroscience, from Ethics to Human-Machine Interaction, we aim at creating embodied, self-sustaining Artificial General Creatures that would form social and emotional connections with humans. Although they would not be able to play competitive online games or generate poems, we argue that creatures akin to artificial pets would be invaluable stepping stones toward symbiotic Artificial General Intelligence.</description>

      <title>SHA-CNN: Scalable Hierarchical Aware Convolutional Neural Network for Edge AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Scalable Hierarchical Aware Convolutional Neural Network (SHA-CNN) model architecture for Edge AI applications. The proposed hierarchical CNN model is meticulously crafted to strike a balance between computational efficiency and accuracy, addressing the challenges posed by resource-constrained edge devices. SHA-CNN demonstrates its efficacy by achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art hierarchical models while outperforming baseline models in accuracy metrics. The key innovation lies in the model's hierarchical awareness, enabling it to discern and prioritize relevant features at multiple levels of abstraction. The proposed architecture classifies data in a hierarchical manner, facilitating a nuanced understanding of complex features within the datasets. Moreover, SHA-CNN exhibits a remarkable capacity for scalability, allowing for the seamless incorporation of new classes. This flexibility is particularly advantageous in dynamic environments where the model needs to adapt to evolving datasets and accommodate additional classes without the need for extensive retraining. Testing has been conducted on the PYNQ Z2 FPGA board to validate the proposed model. The results achieved an accuracy of 99.34%, 83.35%, and 63.66% for MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets, respectively. For CIFAR-100, our proposed architecture performs hierarchical classification with 10% reduced computation while compromising only 0.7% accuracy with the state-of-the-art. The adaptability of SHA-CNN to FPGA architecture underscores its potential for deployment in edge devices, where computational resources are limited. The SHA-CNN framework thus emerges as a promising advancement in the intersection of hierarchical CNNs, scalability, and FPGA-based Edge AI.</description>

      <title>Lexicase-based Selection Methods with Down-sampling for Symbolic Regression Problems: Overview and Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, several new lexicase-based selection variants have emerged due to the success of standard lexicase selection in various application domains. For symbolic regression problems, variants that use an epsilon-threshold or batches of training cases, among others, have led to performance improvements. Lately, especially variants that combine lexicase selection and down-sampling strategies have received a lot of attention. This paper evaluates random as well as informed down-sampling in combination with the relevant lexicase-based selection methods on a wide range of symbolic regression problems. In contrast to most work, we not only compare the methods over a given evaluation budget, but also over a given time as time is usually limited in practice. We find that for a given evaluation budget, epsilon-lexicase selection in combination with random or informed down-sampling outperforms all other methods. Only for a rather long running time of 24h, the best performing method is tournament selection in combination with informed down-sampling. If the given running time is very short, lexicase variants using batches of training cases perform best.</description>

      <title>Genetic Instruct: Scaling up Synthetic Generation of Coding Instructions for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on instruction samples for alignment, but creating these datasets poses challenges, particularly in expert-dependent tasks like coding, which can be cost-prohibitive. One approach to mitigate these challenges is synthesizing data using another LLM. In this paper, we introduce a scalable method for generating synthetic instructions to enhance the code generation capability of LLMs. The proposed algorithm, Genetic-Instruct, mimics evolutionary processes, utilizing self-instruction to create numerous synthetic samples from a limited number of seeds. Genetic-Instruct is designed for efficient scaling of the generation process. Fine-tuning multiple coding LLMs with the synthetic samples demonstrates a significant improvement in their code generation accuracy compared to the baselines.</description>
