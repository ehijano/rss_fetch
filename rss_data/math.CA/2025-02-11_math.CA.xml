      <title>Linear Semi-discrete Polyharmonic Flows of Closed Polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2007, Chow and Glickenstein considered a linear semi-discrete analogue of the second-order curve shortening flow for smooth closed curves. In this article, we consider linear semi-discrete analogues of the polyharmonic curve diffusion flows for curves in $\mathbb{R}^p, p\geq 2$. Since our flows correspond to first-order systems of linear ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients, solutions can be written down explicitly. As an application of similar ideas, we consider a linear semi-discrete answer to Yau's question of when one can flow one curve to another by a curvature flow. In this setting, we are able to flow any closed polygonal curve to any other with the same or differing number of vertices, in the sense of exponential convergence in infinite time to a translate of the target polygon.</description>

      <title>Weighted variational inequalities for heat semigroups associated with Schr\"odinger operators related to critical radius functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a Schr\"{o}dinger operator and $\mathcal{V}_\varrho(e^{-t\mathcal{L}})$ be the variation operator of heat semigroup associated to $\mathcal{L}$ with $\varrho&gt;2$. In this paper, we first obtain the quantitative weighted $L^p$ bounds for $\mathcal{V}_\varrho(e^{-t\mathcal{L}})$ with a class of weights related to critical radius functions, which contains the classical Muckenhoupt weights as a proper subset. Next, a new bump condition, which is weaker than the classical bump condition, is given for two-weight inequality of $\mathcal{V}_\varrho(e^{-t\mathcal{L}})$, and the weighted mixed weak type inequality corresponding to Sawyer's conjecture for $\mathcal{V}_\varrho(e^{-t\mathcal{L}})$ are obtained. Furthermore, the quantitative restricted weak type $(p,p)$ bounds for $\mathcal{V}_\varrho(e^{-t\mathcal{L}})$ are also given with a new class of weights $A_{p}^{\rho,\theta,\mathcal{R}}$, which is larger than the classical $A_{p}^{\mathcal{R}}$ weights. Meanwhile, several characterizations of $A_{p,q,\alpha}^{\rho,\theta,\mathcal{R}}$ in terms of restricted weak type estimates of maximal operators are established.</description>

      <title>Maximal operators on spaces BMO and BLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider maximal kernel-operators on abstract measure spaces $(X,\mu)$ equipped with a ball-basis. We prove that under certain asymptotic condition on the kernels those operators maps boundedly BMO(X) into BLO(X), generalizing the well-known results of Bennett-DeVore-Sharpley and Bennett for the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function. As a particular case of such an operator one can consider the maximal function \begin{equation}
  M_\phi f(x)=\sup_{r&gt;0}\frac{1}{r^d}\int_{R^d}|f(t)|\phi\left(\frac{x-t}{r}\right)dt, \end{equation} and its non-tangential version. Here $\phi(x)\ge 0$ is a bounded spherical function on $R^d$, decreasing with respect to $|x|$ and satisfying the bound \begin{equation*}
  \int_{R^d}\phi (x)\log (2+|x|)dx&lt;\infty. \end{equation*} We prove that if $f\in BMO(R^d)$ and $M_\phi(f)$ is not identically infinite, then $M_\phi(f)\in BLO(R^d)$. Our main result is an inequality, providing an estimation of certain local oscillation of the maximal function $M(f)$ by a local sharp function of $f$.</description>

      <title>A Counterexample to the Mizohata-Takeuchi Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a family of $L^p$ estimates of the X-Ray transform of positive measures in $\mathbb R^d$, which we use to construct a $\log R$-loss counterexample to the Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture for every $C^2$ hypersurface in $\mathbb R^d$ that does not lie in a hyperplane. In particular, multilinear restriction estimates at the endpoint cannot be sharpened directly by the Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture.</description>

      <title>The uniform quantitive weighted boundedness of fractional Marcinkiewicz integral and its commutator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose that $\Omega \in L^{\infty}(\mathbb{S} ^{n-1})$ is homogeneous of degree zero with mean value zero. Then we consider a fractional type Marcinkiewicz integral operator $$\mu_{\Omega ,\beta }f(x) = \left ( \int_{0}^{\infty } \left | \int_{\left | x-y \right |\le t }^{} \frac{\Omega (x-y)}{\left | x-y \right |^{n-1-\beta } } f(y)dy \right | ^{2}\frac{dt}{t^3} \right )^{\frac{1}{2} },\quad 0&lt;\beta&lt;n.$$ Our main contribution is the quantitive weighted result of the classical Marcinkiewicz integral $\mu_{\Omega}$ proved by Hu and Qu [Math. Ineq. appl., 22(2019), 885-899] can be recovered from the quantitative weighted estimates of $\mu_{\Omega,\beta}$ in this paper when $\beta\to 0^+$. As inference, we also gives the uniform quantitive weighted bounds for the corresponding fractional commutators of $\mu_{\Omega,\beta}$ when $\beta \rightarrow 0^+$.</description>

      <title>On a theorem of Mattila in the p-adic setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A, B$ be subsets of $(\mathbb{Z}/p^r\mathbb{Z})^2$. In this note, we provide conditions on the densities of $A$ and $B$ such that $|gA-B|\gg p^{2r}$ for a positive proportion of $g\in SO_2(\mathbb{Z}/p^r\mathbb{Z})$. The conditions are sharp up to constant factors in the unbalanced case, and the proof makes use of tools from discrete Fourier analysis and results in restriction/extension theory.</description>

      <title>Counting Lattice Points near Kor\'anyi Spheres via Generalized Radon Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study a lattice point counting problem for spheres in Heisenberg groups, incorporating both the non-isotropic dilation structure and the non-commutative group law. More specifically, we establish an upper bound for the average number of lattice points in a $\delta$-neighborhood of a Kor\'anyi sphere of large radius, where the average considered is over Heisenberg group translations of the sphere. This is in contrast with previous works, which either count lattice points on dilates of a fixed sphere (see \cites{GNT, Gath2}) or consider averages over Euclidean translations of the sphere (see \cites{CT}). We observe that incorporating the Heisenberg group structure allows us to circumvent the degeneracy arising from the vanishing of the Gaussian curvature at the poles of the Kor\'anyi sphere. In fact, in lower dimensions (the first and second Heisenberg group), our method establishes an upper bound for this number which gives a logarithmic improvement over the bound implied by the previously known results. Even for the higher dimensional Heisenberg groups, we recover the bounds implied by the main result of \cite{GNT} using a completely different approach of generalized Radon transforms.
  Further, we obtain upper bounds for the average number of lattice points near more general spheres described with respect to radial, Heisenberg homogeneous norms as considered in \cite{GNT}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove sharp local smoothing estimates for wave equations on compact Riemannian manifolds in 3+1 dimensions and obtained improved estimates in higher dimensions. This is achieved by deriving local smoothing estimates for certain Fourier integral operators. We also obtain improved local smoothing estimates for wave equations in Euclidean spaces.</description>

      <title>A positivity conjecture for a quotient of $q$-binomial coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conjecture that, if the quotient of two $q$-binomial coefficients with the same top argument is a polynomial, then it has non-negative coefficients. We summarise what is known about the conjecture and prove it in two non-trivial cases. As a corollary we obtain that a polynomial that is conjectured to be a cyclic sieving polynomial for Kreweras words [S. Hopkins and M. Rubey, Selecta Math. (N.S.) 28 (2022), Paper No. 10] is indeed a polynomial with non-negative integer coefficients.</description>

Abstract: Given the growing quantity of proposals and works of basic hypergeometric functions in the scope of $q$-calculus, it is important to introduce a systematic classification of $q$-calculus. Our aim in this article is to investigate certain interesting several $q$-partial derivative formulas, $q$-contiguous function relations, $q$-recurrence relations, various $q$-partial differential equations, summation formulas, transformation formulas and $q$-integrals representations for basic Humbert confluent hypergeometric functions under what constraints of parameters. These interesting properties, as special cases, include many known expansions of basic Humbert hypergeometric functions, and are also include particular interest in the area.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Hahn polynomials and difference equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09170v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multivariate Hahn polynomials are constructed explicitly as the common eigenvectors of a family of second order difference operators. They are orthogonal with respect to the hypergeometric multinomial distribution. The main difference operator is adopted from the work of Karlin-McGregor in 1975. The minor ones are the subsets of the main one containing less and less variables. These operators commute with each other. In contrast to the multivariate Krawtchouk and Rahman like polynomials derived recently, the entire multivariate Hahn polynomials are rational functions of the system parameters. Complete sets of multivariate Krawtchouk and Meixner polynomials are derived by limiting procedures.</description>

      <title>General theory of balayage on locally compact spaces. Applications to weighted minimum energy problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under suitable requirements on a kernel on a locally compact space, we develop a theory of inner (outer) balayage of quite general Radon measures $\omega$ (not necessarily of finite energy) onto quite general sets (not necessarily closed). We prove the existence and the uniqueness of inner (outer) swept measures, analyze their properties, and provide a number of alternative characterizations. In spite of being in agreement with Cartan's theory of Newtonian balayage, the results obtained require essentially new methods and approaches, since in the case in question, useful specific features of Newtonian potentials may fail to hold. The theory thereby established extends considerably that by Fuglede (Anal. Math., 2016) and that by the author (Anal. Math., 2022), these two dealing with $\omega$ of finite energy. Such a generalization enables us to improve substantially our recent results on the Gauss variational problem (Constr. Approx., 2024), by strengthening their formulations and/or by extending the area of their validity. This study covers many interesting kernels in classical and modern potential theory, which also looks promising for other applications.</description>

      <title>The extremal values of the ratio of differences of power mean, arithmetic mean, and geometric mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11947v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the paper the maximum and the minimum of the ratio of the difference of the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean, and the difference of the power mean and the geometric mean of $n$ variables, are studied. A new optimization argument was used which reduces $n$ variable optimization problem to a single variable. All possible cases of the choice of the power mean and the choice of the number of variables of the means are studied. The obtained results generalize and complete the earlier results which were either for specific intervals of power means or for small number of variables of the means. Some of the results are formulated as the best constant inequalities involving interpolation of the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean. The monotonicity and convergence of these best constants are also studied.</description>
