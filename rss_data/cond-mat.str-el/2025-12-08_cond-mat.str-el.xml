      <title>Interaction-Induced Breakdown of Anderson Localization: Thermodynamic Segregation disguised as the Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between strong disorder and repulsive interactions in the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model under open boundary conditions. While uncorrelated disorder is widely accepted to localize all single-particle eigenstates, a phenomenon typically reinforced by interactions in the Many-Body Localization (MBL) regime, we report a counter-intuitive breakdown of this paradigm. We demonstrate that strong repulsive interactions can overcome disorder-induced localization, driving the system into a macroscopically segregated phase where spin species accumulate at opposite boundaries. Although this boundary accumulation phenomenologically mimics the Non-Hermitian Skin Effect (NHSE) observed in non-reciprocal systems, our comprehensive analysis reveals a fundamentally different origin. By performing a rigorous control experiment in the Hermitian limit, we prove that the segregation persists without non-reciprocity, identifying many-body energy minimization as the primary driver. This "interaction-induced segregation" manifests as a sharp thermodynamic crossover, characterized by a divergent energy susceptibility, challenging the conventional understanding of disorder-interaction competition in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Sub 1 K Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigeration with Rare-Earth Borates Ba$_3$XB$_9$O$_{18}$ and Ba$_3$XB$_3$O$_9$, X = (Yb, Gd)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration (ADR) is regaining relevance for the refrigeration to temperatures below 1 K as global helium-3 supply is increasingly strained. While ADR at these temperatures is long established with paramagnetic hydrated salts, more recently frustrated rare-earth oxides were found to offer higher entropy densities and practical advantages since they do not degrade under heating or evacuation. We report structural, magnetic and thermodynamic properties of the rare-earth borates Ba$_3$XB$_9$O$_{18}$ and Ba$_3$XB$_3$O$_9$ with X = (Yb, Gd). Except for Ba$_3$GdB$_9$O$_{18}$, which orders at 108 mK, the three other materials remain paramagnetic down to their lowest measured temperatures. ADR performance starting at 2 K in a field of 5 T is analyzed and compared to literature results.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Orbital Degeneracy and Vacancies in Stabilizing Collinear Magnetic Order in Cr$_{1+\delta}$Te$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cr$_{1+\delta}$Te$_2$, a two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnet, displays a contested magnetic structure, poised between collinear and non-collinear spin configurations. In this work, we investigate the magnetic structure of Cr$_{1.33}$Te$_2$ at the microscopic level by combining single-crystal neutron diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and first-principles calculations. Neutron diffraction measurements reveal a distinct collinear spin alignment, whereas spectroscopic analyses reveal inherent structural vacancies at both Cr and Te sites. These vacancies lead to local symmetry breaking that elevates the orbital degeneracy of the Cr 3$d$ states, as demonstrated by our first-principles analysis. The resulting modification of magnetocrystalline anisotropy emerges as the key mechanism stabilising the collinear magnetic ground state over the non-collinear one in the presence of vacancies. Our findings uncover a vacancy-driven route to control spin anisotropy and magnetic ordering in layered ferromagnets, offering new insights into the design of tunable 2D magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Charge Density Waves in Moire Ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An incommensurate charge density wave (CDW) is a periodic modulation of charge that breaks translational symmetry incongruently with the underlying lattice. Its low-energy excitations, the phason, are collective, gapless phase fluctuations. We study a half-filled, four-band ladder model where a shift $\delta=p/q$ between the legs leads to a supercell of q composite cells. The moir\'e potential narrows minibands near the Fermi level, resulting in additional peaks in the density of states, whose separation is controlled by $\delta$. The inclusion of short-range Coulomb interactions leads to an excitonic incommensurate CDW state. We identify the oscillations in its amplitude with a gapped Higgs collective mode and a lowest-energy Goldstone mode, realized by long-lived neutral phasons whose propagation velocity is governed by the shift {\delta} and the inter-leg tunneling amplitude. Our results show that even the slightest interlayer mismatches can strongly modify both charge-ordering patterns and low-energy bosonic excitations in layered materials, and suggest that the enigmatic CDW phase in the quasi-one-dimensional compound HfTe3 is excitonic in nature.</description>

      <title>Sliding phasons in Moir\'e Ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An incommensurate charge density wave is a periodic modulation of charge that breaks translational symmetry at a momentum that does not coincide with the primitive lattice vectors. Its Goldstone excitation, the phason, comprises collective gapless phase fluctuations. Aiming to unveil the mechanism behind the onset of incommensurate charge order in layered materials, we study a half-filled, four-band tight-binding model on a ladder with a relative shift $\delta=p/q$ between the legs, induced by the dimerization of one of them. The shift results in a moir\'e supercell comprising q composite cells and a modulated inter-leg tunneling. The moir\'e potential compresses the leg bands into flat minibands near the Fermi level, resulting in additional low-energy peaks in the density of states. Including Coulomb interactions, we find an incommensurate charge-density-wave phase in which the charge modulation is out of phase between the legs. The collective excitations of this state are long-lived neutral, acoustic phasons whose speed is controlled by the moir\'e parameter $\delta$ and the inter-leg tunneling amplitude. This model sheds light on the role of interlayer incongruities in the formation of excitonic charge-ordered phases in van der Waals and heterostructured materials.</description>

      <title>Irreversible phase reconfiguration and thermal-memory effects in a highly-correlated manganite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase separated manganites provide a unique platform to study the dynamics of competing electronic and structural orders in correlated systems. In $La_{0.275}Pr_{0.35}Ca_{0.375}MnO_{3}$ (LPCMO), we use temperature cycling Raman spectroscopy to uncover a previously unidentified regime of structural irreversibility, emerging from the interplay between lattice distortions and phase competition across the phase separation and charge and orbital ordering temperatures. This irreversible behavior encodes a thermal memory effect reflecting the system's history dependent energy landscape. Correlated magnetic and transport responses confirm the coupling between lattice and electronic degrees of freedom, revealing a nem form of nonequilibrium phase dynamics in mixed valence oxides. These results advance the understanding of metastability and memory phenomena in strongly correlated materials, opening pathways toward adaptive and neuromorphic functionalities in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Topological spin multipolization and linear magnetoelectric coupling in two-dimensional antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we predict that the magnetoelectric response of two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnets is determined by the topology of the ground state. This topological magnetoelectric response, encoded in the spin magnetoelectric polarizability and its closely related spin multipolization, occurs when the electronic structure of the antiferromagnetic insulator is described by massive 2D Dirac fermions, and is therefore native to 2D, unlike the topological magnetoelectric effect of three-dimensional topological insulators. To demonstrate the topological contribution to the (spin) magnetoelectric polarizability, we compute the magnetoelectric polarizability microscopically for two distinct minimal lattice models: a spin-orbit coupled N\'eel antiferromagnet and a spin-orbit-free noncollinear antiferromagnet with double-$Q$ spin order. We show that the topological origin of the revealed magnetoelectric effect can be traced back to the electromagnetic response of topological semimetals in two dimensions, and hence is ultimately governed by a strong topological invariant in one dimension. Given this dimensional hierarchy, we further consider two minimal lattice models in one dimension, both one-dimensional variants of the 2D lattice models, and show that the magnetoelectric polarizability exhibits a clear signature of nontrivial crystalline topology. Possible material realizations are discussed.</description>

      <title>Layer dipole magnetoelectric polarizability of antiferromagnetic bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study magnetoelectric effects in two-dimensional magnetic bilayers and introduce the notion of a layer dipole magnetoelectric polarizability. This magnetoelectric polarizability describes the magnetization response to an applied electric field perpendicular to the bilayer. As such, it represents the electric analog of the spin magnetoelectric polarizability, governing the charge polarization response to an applied Zeeman field. Starting from the orbital magnetization produced by a perpendicular displacement field, we derive a microscopic expression for the layer dipole magnetoelectric polarizability and apply it to two minimal models for bilayer magnets, i.e., a buckled square lattice model and a magnetic topological insulator model. In the case of the buckled square lattice model we show that the layer dipole magnetoelectric polarizability has a (quasi-)topological contribution, revealing a topological magnetoelectric response of two-dimensional antiferromagnets associated with the layer pseudospin degree of freedom.</description>

      <title>Uncovering surface states of the Dirac semimetal BaMg2Bi2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BaMg2Bi2 is a Dirac semimetal characterized by a simple Dirac cone crossing the Fermi level at the center of the Brillouin zone, protected by C3 rotational symmetry. Together with its Sr-based analogue SrMg2Bi2, it has been proposed as a promising candidate for a chemically driven topological switch: while SrMg2Bi2 is an insulator, BaMg2Bi2 exhibits non-trivial topological features. A detailed understanding of its electronic structure is essential to elucidate its electronic and transport properties. Previous photoemission studies confirmed the Dirac nature of BaMg2Bi2, but were limited to high photon energies, which hindered direct comparison with density functional theory calculations (DFT), due to reduced resolution and higher-frequency matrix-element modulation in that regime. In this work, we combine high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and DFT calculations to get full insight on the valence band states, providing a comprehensive picture of the low-energy electronic structure. Our measurements reveal the presence of previously unobserved surface states. We found that they are topologically trivial, but they unlock a more comprehensive understanding of the material's behavior, reconciling previous discrepancies between experiment and theory.</description>

      <title>Minimal two band model and experimental proposals to distinguish pairing mechanisms of the high-T$_c$ superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of high-T$_c$ superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has opened the door to a new route to high temperature superconductivity, distinct from that in cuprates and iron-based materials. Yet, despite intense recent activity, we lack experimentally testable protocols for distinguishing between different pairing scenarios. In this Letter, we construct a minimal two-band model that reproduces the Fermi-surface topology observed in recent ARPES measurements and DFT calculations, and we analyze superconductivity arising from two distinct pairing mechanisms. We show that these mechanisms yield sharply different responses to an applied perpendicular electric field. Thus, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ offers the unique opportunity to cleanly distinguish between different pairing scenarios. Finally, we propose three concrete experimental proposals designed to distinguish these scenarios and thereby identify the pairing mechanism most relevant to the real material.</description>

      <title>Thermal stability originates the vanishing of the specific heats at the absolute zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between the vanishing of the heat capacities as $T\to0^+$ and the thermal stability is examined. The heat capacities vanish as fast as or faster than $T$ as $T\to0^+$ for states at the phase space boundary ($T=0$) to sustain the standard thermal stability criterion $U_{ss}&gt;0$. Conversely, weakly vanishing heat capacities, which signify a loss of curvature in $U(S)$ at $T=0$, are the signature of a critical condition precisely at $T=0$, as exemplified in marginal Fermi liquids. Therefore, the vanishing of the specific heat should be viewed not as a new law but as a confirmatory result of the existing framework of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Development of a Modular ODMR Setup for Optical Experiments in a Variable Temperature Insert</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed an optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) setup designed for compatibility with a widely used, commercially available helium bath cryostat equipped with a variable temperature insert. The optical path extends nearly two meters, spanning the full length of the cryostat insert, enabling excitation of the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers and detection of the resulting fluorescence from outside the cryostat. The setup preserves optical alignment and beam quality along this extended path allowing integration into existing cryogenic systems without significant modifications. We demonstrate the setup's performance by measuring the temperature dependence of the resonance signal and its behavior under small applied magnetic fields, as well as the magnetic transition of a SrRuO$_3$ sample, thereby showcasing the feasibility of NV magnetometry on a sample in constrained cryogenic environments.</description>

      <title>Investigating a Quantum-Inspired Method for Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on recent advances in quantum algorithms which measure and reuse qubits and in efficient classical simulation leveraging projective measurements, we extend these frameworks to real-time dynamics of quantum many-body systems undergoing discrete-time and continuous-time Hamiltonian evolution, and find improvements that significantly reduce sampling overhead. The approach exploits causal light-cone structure by interleaving time and space evolution and applying projective measurements as soon as local subsystems reach the target physical time, suppressing entanglement growth. Comparing to time-evolving block decimation, the method reaches longer times per sample for the same resources. We also gain the ability to study dynamics of entanglement that would be occurring on quantum hardware when following similar protocols, such as the holographic quantum dynamics simulation framework. We show how to efficiently obtain local observables as well as equal-time and time-dependent correlation functions. Our findings show how optimizations for quantum hardware can benefit classical tensor network simulations and how such classical methods can yield insights into the utility of quantum simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare different limits of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model of $N$ complex fermion with $p$-fermion interactions. First, we compute the fermion Green's function and free energy in the limit of large $N$ followed subsequently by the limit of large $p$. Next, we examine the `double-scaling' limit in which the large $N,p$ limits are taken at fixed $\lambda = p^2/N$. Earlier results on the latter limit are resummed for small $\lambda$, and shown to match our results for the first limit. We also describe the holographic match of our results to two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity with an additional $U(1)$ gauge field.</description>

      <title>Zero-field superconducting diode effect induced by magnetic flux in a van der Waals superconductor trigonal PtBi$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect is one of the nonreciprocal transport phenomena, where the critical current depends on the current direction. This effect is typically realized in superconductors with broken spatial-inversion and time-reversal symmetry. To break the time-reversal symmetry, external magnetic fields are commonly used. Here, we demonstrate a sign-controllable superconducting diode effect under zero external magnetic field in a van der Waals superconductor trigonal PtBi$_2$. The sign of the zero-field superconducting diode effect is controlled by the poling magnetic field, that is a large magnetic field applied prior to measurements. This result indicates that trapped magnetic flux are responsible for breaking the time-reversal symmetry. Our findings highlight the crucial role of trapped magnetic flux in generating the superconducting diode effect and provide a general pathway for realizing a zero-field superconducting diode effect.</description>

      <title>Squeezing Classical Antiferromagnets into Quantum Spin Liquids via Global Cavity Fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cavity quantum electrodynamics with atomic ensembles is typically associated with collective spin phenomena, such as superradiance and spin squeezing, in which the atoms evolve collectively as a macroscopic spin ($S\sim N/2$) on the Bloch sphere. Surprisingly, we show that the tendency toward a collective spin description need not imply collective spin phenomena; rather, it can be exploited to generate new forms of strongly correlated quantum matter. The key idea is to use uniform cavity-mediated interactions to energetically project the system into the total-spin singlet sector ($S=0$) - a highly entangled subspace where the physics is governed entirely by cavity fluctuations. Focusing on Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a single-mode cavity, we show that global cavity fluctuations can effectively squeeze classical antiferromagnets into quantum spin liquids, characterized by non-local entanglement, fractionalized excitations, and emergent gauge fields. This work suggests that cavity QED can be a surprising resource for inducing strongly correlated phenomena, which could be explored in the new generation of hybrid tweezer-cavity platforms.</description>

      <title>Improving 2D-ness to enhance thermopower in oxide superlattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transport dynamics of itinerant charge carriers and their interactions with the environment. For two-dimensional oxide thermoelectrics, predominantly represented by doped SrTiO3-based superlattices, reduced spatial dimensions and increased effective mass are known to enhance thermopower (S). However, because of their large effective Bohr radius resulting from their high dielectric constant, SrTiO3-based systems have limitations in exhibiting the 2D characteristic. Here, we focus on EuTiO3 as an alternative perovskite platform in which fractional LaxEu1-xTiO3/EuTiO3 artificial superlattices demonstrate the improvement in 2D nature for the dimensionality-induced improvement of S. We observed a quasi-2D thermopower S2D of -950 uV K-1 and S2D/S3D of ~20 resulting from the improved 2D confinement. Thermopower measurements, combined with hybrid density functional theory calculations, show the enhanced S originates from the confinement of Ti 3dxy-states within the LaxEu1-xTiO3 layers and the associated increase in the 2D density of states. In detail, a smaller effective Bohr radius and modified electronic band structures, in conjunction with the presence of the Eu 4f-states in EuTiO3 which modified the local electronic potential and strengthened the spatial confinement of Ti 3d-states. This approach to improving the dimensional confinement establishes a small effective Bohr radius and Eu 4f-state assisted 2D confinement provides valuable insights into the design of high-performance applications in artificial oxide superlattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among van der Waals crystals, transition metal trihalide VI3 has driven attention for its magnetic and orbital properties. However, its chemical instability under ambient conditions make its exploitation challenging for technological implementation. In this context, here we show how synchrotron radiation soft X-rays partially restore stoichiometric chemical and electronic properties of VI3 crystals. By combining X-ray absorption and X-ray photoemission spectroscopies, we show as-cleaved and aged (in ultra-high vacuum conditions) chemical degradation of VI3 crystal surface, with the formation of vanadates, and its, at least partial, recovery under high-flux soft X-ray beam exposure, revealing that superficial hygroscopic contamination couples relatively weakly to the crystal surface.</description>

      <title>Electrically Tunable Spin Exchange Splitting in Graphene Hybrid Heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphene, with spin and valley degrees of freedom, fosters unexpected physical and chemical properties for the realization of next-generation quantum devices. However, the spin symmetry of graphene is rather robustly protected, hampering manipulation of the spin degrees of freedom for the application of spintronic devices such as electric gate tunable spin filters. We demonstrate that a hybrid heterostructure composed of graphene and LaCoO3 epitaxial thin film exhibits an electrically tunable spin exchange splitting. The large and adjustable spin exchange splitting of 155.9 - 306.5 meV was obtained by the characteristic shifts in both the spin symmetry broken quantum Hall states and the Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations. Strong hybridization induced charge transfer across the hybrid heterointerface has been identified for the observed spin exchange splitting. The substantial and facile controllability of the spin exchange splitting provides an opportunity for spintronics applications with the electrically-tunable spin polarization in hybrid heterostructures.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14929v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish multiple interrelated, fundamental results in quantum many-body systems that can have long-range interactions. For a sufficiently long quantum spin chain, we first show that if the multi-spin interactions in the Hamiltonian decay fast enough as their ranges increase and the Hamiltonian is gapped, then the ground states satisfy the entanglement area law, even if there is a ground state degeneracy due to a spontaneously broken discrete symmetry. This area law also holds for certain excited states. Second, if such a long-range interacting Hamiltonian has an anomalous symmetry, then the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem applies, i.e., the Hamiltonian cannot have a unique gapped symmetric ground state. If the Hamiltonian contains only 2-spin interactions, these results hold when the interactions decay faster than $1/r^2$, with $r$ the distance between the two interacting spins. Third, we show that pure states with an anomalous symmetry, which may not be a ground state of any natural Hamiltonian, must be long-range entangled. The symmetries we consider include on-site internal symmetries combined with lattice translation symmetries, and they can also extend to purely internal but non-on-site symmetries. Moreover, these internal symmetries can be discrete or continuous. We explore the applications of these results through various examples.</description>

      <title>Quantum Supercritical Regime with Universal Magnetocaloric Scaling in Ising Magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22236v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum critical points ubiquitously emerge in strongly correlated systems, with their influence persisting at finite temperatures and external fields. A paradigmatic example is the quantum Ising magnet, where transverse field $g$ controlling quantum fluctuations can expand the quantum critical point into an extended quantum critical regime. In this work, we propose a distinct quantum supercritical regime originating also from the quantum critical point but controlled by the longitudinal field $h$ coupled to the order parameter. Through thermal tensor network simulations, we find the quantum supercritical regime is enclosed by the finite-temperature crossover boundaries $T \propto h^{{z\nu}/\Delta}$, where $z$, $\nu$ and $\Delta \equiv \beta+\gamma$ are critical exponents. We comprehend the supercritical scaling via thermal data collapse based on the derived scaling form. Amongst other intriguing phenomena in quantum supercritical regime, there exists an enhanced magnetocaloric effect characterized by a universally diverging magnetic Gr\"uneisen ratio $\Gamma_h \propto T^{-\Delta/{z\nu}}$, which indicates that a small symmetry-breaking field $h$ can generate dramatic temperature variation. We propose to observe the quantum supercritical regime in Ising-chain compound CoNb$_2$O$_6$ and related quantum materials, revealing a helium-3-free pathway to millikelvin cooling via the supercritical magnetocaloric effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I explore a theory of transport and optical properties of strange metallic carriers in strongly correlated systems that follows from assuming that the diffusion constant has reached its quantum limit $D=\hbar/m$, and that such quantum carriers behave as distinguishable particles as they would in an electronic solid. These assumptions immediately lead to $T$-linear resistivities with apparent Planckian scattering rates and, extending to the frequency domain, to the stretched Drude peaks and $\omega/T$ scaling commonly observed in optical absorption experiments in strange metals. This behavior can be rationalized by observing that when the thermal de Broglie length $\lambda_{dB}$ exceeds the mean-free-path, the carrier motion can no longer be described in terms of random collisions of classical particles as assumed by Drude-Boltzmann theory and should be viewed instead as a sequence of projective measurements collapsing the wavefunction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Hall effect, AC magnetic susceptibility ($\chi_{\rm ac}$), and magnetic force microscopy of the uniaxial ferromagnet CeRu$_2$Ga$_2$B with a centrosymmetric crystal structure. We observe a finite topological Hall effect (THE) within the ordered phase before the magnetization is polarized by applied field. By comparing the field dependences of the area fraction of the magnetic bubbles, the derivative of $\chi_{\rm ac}$, and the THE signal, we deduce that the magnetic bubbles of CeRu$_2$Ga$_2$B evolve from the trivial to topological spin texture with field. Our findings will be utilized to expand the search for magnetic materials hosting the topological spin textures to ones with uniaxial anisotropy, and open a new possibility to tailor the topological spin texture.</description>

Abstract: We present the time-dependent Quantum Geometric Tensor (tQGT) as a comprehensive tool for capturing the geometric character of insulators observable within linear response. We show that tQGT describes the zero-point motion of bound electrons and acts as a generating function for generalized sum rules of electronic conductivity. It therefore enables a systematic framework for computing the instantaneous response of insulators, including optical mass, orbital angular momentum, and dielectric constant. This construction guarantees a consistent approximation across these quantities upon restricting the number of occupied and unoccupied states in a low-energy description of an infinite quantum system. We outline how quantum geometry can be generated in periodic systems by lattice interference and examine spectral weight transfer from small frequencies to high frequencies by creating geometrically frustrated flat bands.</description>

      <title>Family of multilayer graphene superconductors with tunable chirality: Momentum-space vortices nucleated by a ring of Berry curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments in rhombohedrally-stacked multilayer graphene heterostructures have reported signatures of chiral superconductivity, emerging from a spin and valley-polarized normal state with broken time-reversal symmetry and an associated anomalous Hall effect. These findings bring into focus the role of the electronic Bloch wavefunction and the quantum geometric tensor in determining the superconducting pairing channel. In this work, we examine superconducting instabilities of a model of $N$-layer rhombohedral graphene that possesses an enhanced Berry curvature distribution on an extended ring in momentum space $-$ that we dub the 'Berry ring of fire' $-$ in the presence of an isotropic attractive interaction with a parametrically controlled spatial range. We determine that local interactions favor a $N$-fold winding in the order parameter phase for odd-$N$ layered systems, with even-$N$ layers requiring a spatially extended attraction range to achieve pairing. For generic interaction lengths, we discover a family of chiral superconductors and, remarkably, momentum-space vortices nucleated on the Berry ring of fire. The existence of these vortices can be traced to a momentum-space flux quantization condition involving the Berry curvature, with the phase winding dictated by a combination of the Berry flux and a 'statistical flux' to enforce Fermi-Dirac statistics. Such an order parameter structure allows for the possibility of in-situ tuning between various chiral superconducting phases through changes in the electron density or the displacement field. We discuss ways in which these predictions can be experimentally tested and potentially exploited in future devices.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity implementation of a Majorana-encoded CNOT gate on a photonic platform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the experimental realisation of a robust CNOT quantum gate in a Majorana-encoded logical space simulated on a photonic platform. Instead of implementing physical Majorana quasiparticles, our experiment emulates the algebra of Majorana zero modes using photonic degrees of freedom obtained through a Jordan-Wigner mapping. This mapping enables us to simulate two logical qubits, encoded in three Kitaev chains supporting endpoint Majorana operators. Moreover, we realise the unitary representations of both intra-chain and inter-chain Majorana braiding operations that implement the encoded CNOT gate. Due to hardware constraints, the full braiding sequence is executed through a cyclic input-output procedure, requiring an indirect reconstruction of accumulated noise across successive steps. We numerically show that the Majorana encoding offers resilience to the dominant noise in our photonic setup, provided the physical error rate stays below a well-defined threshold. As our experimental error rate (p=0.012) lies beneath this threshold, the experimentally measured encoded CNOT fidelity is significantly enhanced, exceeding 0.992. This reveals a novel pathway to fault-tolerant quantum computing based on Majorana-inspired encodings, even in the absence of full topological protection.</description>

      <title>Axionic tunneling from a topological Kondo insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discoveries over the past two decades have revealed the remarkable ability of quantum materials to emulate relativistic properties of the vacuum, from Dirac cones in graphene to the Weyl surface states of topological insulators. Yet the most elusive consequence of topology in quantum matter is the axionic $E\cdot B$ term in the electromagnetic response. Here we report a direct signature of axionic physics obtained through scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Although recent STM experiments using SmB$_6$ nanowires have been interpreted as evidence for spin-polarized currents arising from topological surface states, we show that the observed spin polarization instead originates from axionic electrodynamics. Our analysis reveals a striking voltage-induced magnetization: extremely small voltages ($\sim$ 30 meV) generate tip moments of order 0.1 $\mu_B$ that reverse sign with the applied bias. The magnitude, tunability, and reversibility of this signal are consistent with an axionic $E \cdot B$ coupling, and fully account for the magnetic component of the tip density of states, ruling out static magnetism. Millivolt-scale control of spin polarization in a tunnel junction provides a new route for probing axionic electrodynamics and opens avenues for future STM and spintronics applications.</description>
