      <title>A Comparison of 1D and 3D Exoplanet Atmosphere Model Grids: ScCHIMERA and the SPARC/MITgcm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inferring the properties of transiting exoplanet atmospheres relies on comparing models to spectroscopic observations. Atmosphere models, however, make a range of assumptions, from one-dimensional (1D, varying with altitude) radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) to three-dimensional (3D) general circulation models (GCMs). The goal of this investigation is to determine the causes of differences in dayside thermal emission spectra resulting from 3D-GCMs (using SPARC/MITgcm) and 1D-RCE models (using ScCHIMERA). We conduct a one-to-one comparison of 1D-RCE models and 3D-GCMs with the same outgoing bolometric thermal flux over a grid of equilibrium temperatures, gravities, metallicities, and rotation periods. Each 1D-RCE model assumes heat redistribution in the planet's atmosphere consistent with that in the corresponding 3D-GCM's photosphere. Comparing corresponding models, the dayside average pressure-temperature (PT) structures can be broken into four vertical regions, each influencing wavelength-dependent differences in their spectra. Furthermore, the dayside average 3D-GCM PTs for planets with Teq=1400 K exhibit a temperature inversion, whereas corresponding 1D-RCE models do not. We find that spectral differences between 1D-RCE models and 3D-GCMs with the same parameters decrease for hotter planets because the spectral shapes more closely resemble blackbodies. To a lesser extent, spectral differences increase for planets with longer rotation periods because of smaller day-night temperature contrasts in the photosphere. Finally, we compare spectral differences to realistic observational uncertainties from JWST with the NIRISS SOSS, NIRSpec G395H, and MIRI LRS instrument modes. We find that 1D-RCE models and 3D-GCMs with the same parameters can produce dayside spectral differences larger than JWST's uncertainty, potentially biasing data-model inferences.</description>

      <title>ALMA Band 7 Observations of Water Lines in the Protoplanetary Disk of V883 Ori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FU Orionis star V883 Ori provides a unique opportunity to probe the water snowline in a protoplanetary disk. During an accretion burst, the enhanced stellar luminosity heats the disk, sublimating ices and bringing volatile species into the gas-phase. The water snowline, located at $\sim$80 au in the midplane, represents a key boundary for dust growth and volatile delivery to forming planets. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 7 observations of V883 Ori that detect two targeted water isotopologue transitions: para-H$_2$$^{18}$O $5_{1,5}$-$4_{2,2}$ at 322 GHz and HDO $3_{3,1}$-$4_{2,2}$ at 335 GHz. After correcting for Keplerian rotation, we detect HDO and H$_2$$^{18}$O at 23.6$\sigma$ and 9.3$\sigma$, respectively. Rotational-diagram analysis using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach yields $T_\mathrm{rot}=116.89\pm12.81$ K and $N=(4.90\pm1.69)\times10^{15}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ for H$_2$$^{18}$O, and $T_\mathrm{rot}=87.46\pm4.95$ K and $N=(4.47\pm0.62)\times10^{15}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ for HDO. These results imply water vapor abundances of $N_{\mathrm{H_2O}}/N_{\mathrm{H_2}}\sim3\times10^{-7}$-$5\times10^{-6}$ and an HDO/H$_2$O ratio of $(0.4$-$2.0)\times10^{-3}$ just inside the water snowline, broadly consistent with inheritance from protostellar envelopes. The HDO line in Band 7 is significantly weaker than predicted from Band 6 extrapolation, showing only $\sim$26% of the expected strength. This attenuation can be explained by a more compact, hotter emitting region with an effective radius of $\sim$53 au and/or frequency-dependent dust absorption that enlarges the apparent inner cavity at higher frequency. Our results highlight both the diagnostic power of water isotopologue lines and the need for higher angular resolution observations to resolve the water snowline and test these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Collisional Outcomes Based on Impact Simulations of Mars-sized Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the outcomes of collisions between Mars-sized bodies through smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations, focusing on the transitions among ``merging'', ``hit-and-run'', and catastrophic disruption. By systematically varying impact velocity, angle, and mass ratio, we characterize the dependence of collision outcomes on geometric and energetic parameters. A new analytic model is developed using characteristic energies -- particularly the energy deposited in overlapping regions of the colliding bodies -- to accurately describe the mass of the largest and second-largest remnants. The model successfully reproduces simulation results across a broad range of impact conditions and improves on previous models by better capturing the transitions between ``merging'', ``hit-and-run'', and disruption. We also derive outcome formulas averaged over impact-parameter-weighted angular distributions, enabling more realistic applications to integrated modeling of planet formation. The model further shows consistency with outcomes from dust aggregate collision simulations, highlighting its utility for modeling collisional processes not only for large planetesimals but also for smaller bodies.</description>

      <title>Characterising injection signatures in Jupiter's ultraviolet aurora using Juno observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete features in Jupiter's ultraviolet aurora have been interpreted as signatures of plasma injections in the middle magnetosphere. There exists some ambiguity whether magnetodisc scattering or high-latitude Alfvenic acceleration best describes the observed properties of these injection signatures, and also to what extent arcs in the outer emission are related to injections. Many injection signatures are the result of the evolution of dawn storms; there is, however, limited evidence that non-dawn-storm injection signatures are sometimes present in the aurora. We use automatic detection of these discrete features, alongside data from Juno-UVS and in-situ measurements by other Juno instruments, to show that scattering likely accounts for most of the electron precipitation associated with injection signatures. Additionally, there is evidence that injection signatures can be classified into two types: dawn-storm and non-dawn-storm. Arc-like features in the outer emission show very similar properties to traditional blob-like injection signatures and may consist of sequences of injection signatures that have broadened into an arc via energy-dependent electron drift.</description>

      <title>JWST NIRSpec finds no clear signs of an atmosphere on TOI-1685 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the prevalence of atmospheres on terrestrial planets is a core objective in exoplanetary science. While M dwarf systems offer a promising opportunity, conclusive observations of terrestrial atmospheres have remained elusive, with many yielding flat transmission spectra. We observe four transits of the hot terrestrial planet TOI-1685 b using JWST's NIRSpec G395H instrument. Combining this with the transit from the previously-observed phase curve of the planet with the same instrument, we perform a detailed analysis to determine the possibility of an atmosphere on TOI-1685 b. From our retrievals, the Bayesian evidence favours a simple flat line model, indicating no evidence for an atmosphere on TOI-1685 b, in line with results from the phase curve analysis. Our results show that hydrogen-dominated atmospheres can be confidently ruled out. For heavier, secondary atmospheres we find a lower limit on the mean molecular weight of ~10, at a significance of ~5 sigma. Pure CO2, SO2, H2O, and CH4 atmospheres, or a mixed secondary atmosphere (CO+CO2+SO2) could explain the data (Delta lnZ &lt; 3). However, pure CH4 atmospheres may be physically unlikely, and the pure H2O and CO2 cases require a high-altitude cloud, which could also be interpreted as a thin cloud-free atmosphere. We discuss the theoretical possibility for different types of atmosphere on this planet, and consider the effects of atmospheric escape and stellar activity on the system. Though we find that TOI-1685 b is likely a bare rock, this study also highlights the challenges of detecting secondary atmospheres on rocky planets with JWST.</description>

      <title>Structure of Jupiter's High-Latitude Storms: Folded Filamentary Regions Revealed by Juno</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sprawling, turbulent cloud formations dominate the meteorology of Jupiter's mid-to-high latitudes, known as Folded Filamentary Regions (FFRs). A multi-wavelength characterisation by Juno reveals the spatial distribution, vertical structure, and energetics of the FFRs. The cloud tops display multiple lobes of stratiform aerosols, separated by darker, cloud-free lanes, and embedded with smaller eddies and high-altitude cumulus clouds. These cyclonic FFRs are microwave-bright in shallow-sounding wavelengths ($p&lt;5$ bars) and microwave-dark in deep-sounding wavelengths ($p&gt;10$ bars), with the transition potentially associated with the water condensation layer (6-7 bars). Associating microwave contrasts with temperature anomalies, this implies despinning of cyclonic eddies above/below their mid-planes. Despite deep roots (being detectable in wavelengths sounding $\sim100$ bars), they are ``pancake vortices'' with horizontal extents at least an order of magnitude larger than their depth. In the northern hemisphere, FFRs are most common in cyclonic belts poleward of $40^\circ$N (all latitudes are planetocentric), particularly a North Polar Filamentary Belt (NPFB) near $66-70^\circ$N that defines the transition from organised belts/zones to the chaotic polar domain. This distribution explains the high lightning rates from $45-80^\circ$N, peaking in a belt poleward of $52.3^\circ$N, which may trace the availability of water for moist convection. Many observed lightning flashes can be associated to specific FFRs containing bright storms, but some FFRs display no activity, suggesting quiescent periods during storm evolution. Analogies to Earth's oceanic eddies suggest that cyclones deform isentropic surfaces at their midplanes, raising deep water-rich layers upwards to promote moist convection, release latent heat, and inject clouds into the upper troposphere.</description>

      <title>The Emergence of Prebiotic Chemistry in the ISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrary to popular belief, the interstellar medium (ISM) is not empty; it is filled with atoms, dust particles, and molecules. Some of these molecules may have been the very building blocks of life that, delivered to Earth via comets and meteorites, could have given rise to Life itself. A large-area single-dish telescope with superb sensitivity, field-of-view and multi-band instruments will allow us to explore the limits of chemical complexity in the interstellar medium, across our Galaxy and in external galaxies, determining whether amino acids, sugars, or RNA/DNA nucleobases can form in space.</description>

      <title>The Future of Evolved Planetary Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the formation, evolution, and chemical diversity of exoplanets are now central areas of astrophysics research. White dwarfs provide a uniquely sensitive laboratory for studying the end stages of planetary-system evolution and for probing the bulk composition of both rocky and volatile-rich exoplanetary material. In the 2030s new facilities will transform our ability to carry out \textit{``industrial-scale''} astrophysics, leading to fundamental results and new challenges for the next decade. By combining the volume of data surveyed by the ESA {\em Gaia} mission and Vera C. Rubin Observatory with the next-generation of spectroscopic facilities, the European Southern Observatory (ESO) community will be in a position to obtain an unbiased census of evolved planetary systems, constrain the composition of thousands of disrupted planetesimals, and connect these signatures to Galactic populations and stellar birth environments. Thus, it is now the time for assessing those challenges and preparing for the future. This white paper outlines key science opportunities arising in the next decade and the technological requirements of future ESO facilities in enabling transformative discoveries in the 2040s. These future facilities will have to combine a number of features that are crucial for studying evolved planetary systems at white dwarfs, such as broad optical to near-infrared coverage, a high sensitivity at blue wavelengths, multi-resolution capability, massive multi-plexing, and time-domain reactivity.</description>

      <title>Why the Northern Hemisphere Needs a 30-40 m Telescope and the Science at Stake. How do Planetary Systems Form?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection and characterization of protoplanets in protoplanetary disks around young stars is emerging as a transformative field that will redefine our understanding of how planetary systems form. While current facilities have revealed the diversity of mature exoplanets and the complex structures of disks, we still lack the crucial observational link between them: a statistically meaningful census of planets caught in the act of formation. This white paper argues that such a breakthrough requires access to the nearest and most informative star-forming regions, roughly half of which are poorly accessible or entirely unreachable from Cerro Armazones. Although the ELT alone will strongly impact our knowledge of planet formation, its location prevents Europe from fully exploiting the necessary parameter space. A 30-40 m telescope in the northern hemisphere is therefore essential for obtaining diffraction-limited imaging of protoplanets and disks across the entire sky, enabling robust demographics, exploiting synergies with ngVLA, Gaia, and other facilities covering the north, and ensuring that Europe remains at the forefront of the planet-formation revolution in the coming decades.</description>

      <title>Why the Northern Hemisphere Needs a 30-40m Telescope and the Science at Stake: from Interstellar Visitors to Planetary Defence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small Solar system Objects (SSOs) preserve the physical, chemical, and dynamical signatures of the Sun's protoplanetary disk. Upcoming surveys will discover vast numbers of new objects, yet their scientific value will depend on follow-up observations requiring far greater sensitivity and resolution than those currently available. A 30-m class telescope like the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) will be transformative, but its Southern location will leave significant regions of the sky poorly covered or even non accessible. A Northern 30-40m telescope is therefore essential to achieve full-sky coverage and fully exploit the small body discoveries of the 2030-2050 era, in particular for targets of opportunity or unexpected discoveries, like those of interstellar objects and potentially hazardous asteroids, as well as for distant trans-Neptunian objects and space mission targets.</description>

      <title>Why the Northern Hemisphere Needs a 30-40 m Telescope and the Science at Stake: Key Targets of Opportunity on Gas and Ice Giants and their satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) will transform our knowledge of the outer planets and their satellite systems; however the visibility of unique targets of opportunity with high scientific value will be reduced for northern objects. Uranus' declination favors observations from the Northern Hemisphere until 2055, and Neptune will be favored from the Northern Hemisphere from 2027 for the next 90 years. Jupiter and Saturn experience cycles of better observability from either hemisphere on cycles of 10 and 30 years. These planets and their satellite systems often offer unique opportunities for discovery through time-critical observations. We argue that a 30-m class size telescope in the Northern Hemisphere with complementary scientific instrumentation to that on the ELT will secure the possibility of observing high-impact unpredictable phenomena in these systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Debris discs reveal the architectures and dynamical histories of planetary systems. Sub-millimetre observations trace large dust grains within debris discs, revealing their bulk properties. Debris discs have so far only been detected around ~20% of stars, representing the bright end of the population. A new facility is required to reach fainter discs, overcoming the confusion limit, with multiwavelength capabilities for characterisation, sensitivity to large-scale emission for nearby targets and a large field of view for surveying distant populations. All of this is made possible with the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimetre Telescope (AtLAST).</description>

      <title>The use of astronomical data for satellite tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study explored the usage of astronomical observations for the identification and tracking of artificial satellites. Spacecraft streaks on astronomical images are a growing issue for the astronomical community. The increasing number of satellites in the future will only worsen the situation for ground-based optical and radio observations of cosmic objects. In addition, the spacecraft passages often lead to the discarding of the obtained data. In this analysis, we propose an estimation of the usefulness of dedicated astronomical observation for spacecraft monitoring, identification, and deduction of orbital parameters. We use astronomical data from the Astronomical Observatory Meshtitsa (Bulgaria) and the https://www.tycho-tracker.com/ software for the streak analysis. The results are compared with well-known satellite databases, such as https://celestrak.org/. The findings are discussed in the framework of space weather research.</description>

      <title>Thermal properties of interplanetary coronal mass ejections at 1 AU and their connection to geoeffectiveness across solar cycles 23-25</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) are major drivers of heliospheric variability and can produce prolonged disturbances near Earth. Understanding their thermodynamic evolution is crucial for assessing their heat budget and exploring how thermal states relate to their plasma dynamics and geoeffectiveness. We conduct a comprehensive statistical analysis of magnetic ejecta (MEs) over Solar Cycles 23, 24, and the ascending phase of 25. Leveraging a polytropic framework, we characterized the thermal state of ME based on the event-wise median proton polytropic index (Gamma_p) from in-situ measurements at 1 AU. We find that MEs are thermodynamically active and rarely evolve adiabatically or isothermally. Notably, a significant fraction (45%) of MEs exhibit a heating state. Heating MEs dominate near solar maxima and exhibit strong solar-cycle modulation in Gamma_p, proton temperature, and expansion speed, indicating active in-transit heating processes. Whereas, Cooling MEs show a nearly constant Gamma_p = 2 across cycles, suggesting enhanced cooling beyond adiabatic expectations and possible thermal energy retention from eruption to 1 AU. Notably, the median Gamma_p value increases from 1.49 (SC23) to 1.88 (SC24), indicating a shift to cooling-dominated states over successive cycles. High-impact ICMEs, predominantly Heating MEs (Gamma_p = 0.59), often manifest as magnetic clouds with enhanced magnetic fields, low plasma beta, pronounced sheath compression, elevated expansion, and post-ICME high-speed flows, making them the most geoeffective drivers of strong geomagnetic storms. These results establish Gamma_p as a useful diagnostic of ICME thermal states, though meaningful assessment of geoeffectiveness requires combined consideration of thermal, plasma, and magnetic field properties.</description>

      <title>A Characterization of JWST MIRI Detector Persistence and Implications for High-Contrast Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The JWST MIRI detector exhibits a flux deficit persistence, but its timescales and impacts remain largely uncharacterized, particularly at the longest imaging wavelengths. In this study, we analyze full-field MIRI imager observations at 21 $\mu$m (F2100W) to quantify detector persistence following a saturation event by a bright (K = 5.65 mag) nearby (8.12 $\pm$ 0.04 pc) mid M-dwarf star, IRAS 21500+5903. Unlike typical persistence that appears as excess flux, this effect presents as a flux deficit in pixels previously illuminated by the saturating or near saturating source. We measure persistence at two post-saturation epochs: shortly after saturation (11.6 minutes) and an hour later (1.39 hours). Immediately after the saturation event, we detect a persistence level of $1.69 \pm 0.10$%. By fitting a Bayesian exponential decay model to the two epochs, we estimate that persistence decreases to one-tenth of its initial value after $5.16^{+1.49}_{-0.94}$ hours. We examine the implications of persistence for MIRI high-contrast imaging using the imager (not coronagraphy). Specifically, we discuss how MIRI detector persistence can produce false-positive exoplanet signals in direct imaging surveys, as well as degrade PSF subtraction, particularly at small inner working angles. We also outline mitigation strategies to avoid these impacts in future observations.</description>

      <title>A Machine-Learning Approach for Identifying CME-Associated Stellar Flares in TESS Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are major drivers of stellar space weather and can strongly influence the habitability of exoplanets. However, compared to the frequent occurrence of white-light flares, confirmed stellar CMEs remain extremely rare. Whether such flares are commonly accompanied by CMEs is a key question for solar-stellar comparative studies. Using Sun-as-a-star soft X-ray flare light curves observed by the GOES XRS 1--8~\AA\ channel, we compiled a sample of 1,766 M-class and larger solar flares and extracted features with both deep convolutional neural networks and manual methods. Five machine-learning classifiers were trained to distinguish eruptive from confined flares, with the random forest model achieving the best performance (true skill statistic; TSS = 0.31). This TSS value indicates that the model possesses a moderate ability to discriminate between eruptive and confined flares. Normalized white-light and GOES XRS flare light curves show broadly consistent temporal evolution, reflecting their shared energy-release history and supporting a probabilistic transfer of the model to white-light flare data. We applied the best-performing RF model to 41,405 TESS-detected flares on FGKM-type main-sequence stars, predicting that approximately 47% of events show CME-like morphological characteristics, with the model-implied intrinsic association fraction lying in the range 35%--60%. Intriguingly, the CME occurrence rate decreases with increasing flare energy, indicating that the most energetic flares may be more strongly confined by overlying magnetic fields. These results provide new insight into flare-CME connections in diverse stellar environments and have important implications for assessing the impact of stellar eruptive activity on exoplanetary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Towards ALMA2040: An update from the European community and invitation to contribute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last 15 years, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has revolutionized astrophysics by providing unprecedented resolution and sensitivity in observing the cold universe, including the formation of stars, planets, and galaxies. With groundbreaking discoveries ranging from the first detailed images of protoplanetary disks to the kinematics of galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization, ALMA has showcased the vast discovery potential of the (sub-)mm wavelength regime. However, in another 15 years from now--in the 2040s--the science landscape will have changed dramatically as new major observational facilities will have started their operations or have come towards advanced maturity in their scientific outcome (e.g., JWST, Rubin Observatory, ELT, Euclid, Gaia, Plato, Ariel, Roman Space Telescope, SPHEREx, LiteBIRD, LISA, SKA and others). At the same time, ALMA's current Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade will have been in place for ~10 years, and ALMA itself will have been operational for 30 years. To fully exploit this era, the community needs a next-generation facility operating at (sub-)mm wavelengths with capabilities far beyond those possible within ALMA's current infrastructure.
  To this end, ALMA2040 is a community-driven initiative to define the key scientific questions of the 2040s and translate them into a technical vision for a next-generation transformational (sub-)millimeter facility. Our goal with this document is to summarize the current status of the effort, synthesize outcomes from the 2025 workshops, outline next steps toward a reference design concept, and invite broad participation from the global mm/sub-mm community to help shape this future facility.
  In the following we provide details on the process and scope. We invite everyone who wishes to join the effort and/or contribute to the dedicated White Papers planned for 2026.</description>

      <title>The Detection-vs-Retrieval Challenge: Titan as an Exoplanet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12144v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cassini's observations of Titan's atmosphere are exemplary benchmarks for exoplanet atmospheric studies owing to (1) their precision and (2) our independent knowledge of Titan. Leveraging these observations, we perform retrievals (i.e., analyses) of Titan's transmission spectrum to investigate the strengths/limitations of exoplanet atmospheric retrievals with a particular focus on the underlying assumptions regarding the molecular species included in the retrieval. We find that multiple hydrocarbons can be ``retrieved'' depending on the selection made ahead of a retrieval. More importantly, we find that the estimates of other parameters such as the abundance of key absorbers like methane can be biased by $\sim$0.5 dex (by a factor of $\sim$3) due to such choices. This shows that beyond the possible misidentification of a molecular feature (e.g., current debate surrounding dimethyl sulfide, DMS, in K2-18 b), the implicit molecular detections made pre-retrieval to avoid retrieving for hundreds of molecules at a time can bias a large range of parameters. We thus recommend sensitivity analysis to assess the dependencies of atmospheric inferences on such selections in tandem with complementary information (e.g., chemistry models) to support any pre-retrieval selection. Finally, we introduce an independent path to constrain the dominant atmospheric constituent, even when lacking observable absorption feature (e.g., H$_2$ and N$_2$) through the scale height.</description>

      <title>Searching for GEMS: The Occurrence of Giant Planets orbiting M-dwarfs within 100 pc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08773v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results from a systematic search for transiting short-period Giant Exoplanets around M-dwarf Stars (GEMS; $P &lt; 10$ days, $R_p \gtrsim 8~R_\oplus$) within a distance-limited 100 pc sample of $149,316$ M-dwarfs using TESS-Gaia Light Curve (TGLC) data. We describe the development and application of the \textit{TESS-miner} package and associated vetting procedures used in this analysis. To assess detection completeness, we conducted $\sim$72 million injection-recovery tests across $\sim$26,000 stars with an average of $\sim$3 sectors of data per star, subdivided into early-type (M0--M2.5), mid-type (M2.5--M4), and late-type (M4 or later) M-dwarfs. Our pipeline demonstrates high sensitivity across all subtypes within the injection bounds.
  We estimate the occurrence rates of short-period GEMS as a function of stellar mass, and combine our measured rates with those derived for FGK stars, fitting an exponential trend with stellar mass, consistent with core-accretion theory predictions. We find GEMS occurrence rates of $0.118\% \pm 0.068\%$ for early-type M-dwarfs, $0.153\% \pm 0.069\%$ for mid-type, and $0.036\% \pm 0.024\%$ for late-type M-dwarfs, with a mean rate of $0.068\%\pm0.024\%$ across the full sample. While our search spanned $1.0~\mathrm{days} &lt; P &lt; 10.0$ days, these rates were calculated using planets orbiting with $1.0~\mathrm{days} &lt; P &lt; 5.0$ days. This work establishes the basis for future occurrence rate studies of transiting GEMS.</description>

      <title>Pre-perihelion evolution of the NiI/FeI abundance ratio in the coma of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. From extreme to normal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emission lines of FeI and NiI are commonly found in the coma of Solar System comets, even at large heliocentric distances. These atoms are most likely released from the surface of the comet's nucleus or from a short-lived parent. These lines were also found in the interstellar comet 2I/Borisov, which has a NiI/FeI abundance ratio similar to that observed in Solar System comets. Here, we report observations of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which were carried out with the ESO Very Large Telescope equipped with the UVES and X-shooter spectrographs. Spectra were obtained at heliocentric distances ranging from 3.14 to 1.85 au. NiI was detected at all epochs. FeI was only detected at heliocentric distances smaller than 2.64 au. We estimated the NiI and FeI production rates by comparing the observed line intensities with those produced by a dedicated fluorescence model. Comet 3I first exhibited extreme and unusual NiI/FeI abundance ratios during the initial stages of its activity. However, as its heliocentric distance decreased, this ratio became indistinguishable from those observed in Solar System comets and in comet 2I/Borisov. Comet 3I was found to be C$_2$-depleted, with a NiI/FeI abundance ratio finally consistent with other C$_2$-depleted comets. Nevertheless, comet 3I remains exceptional due to its high, total production rate of NiI and FeI, which is at least one order of magnitude larger than that of other comets. We interpreted these observations assuming that the NiI and FeI atoms were released through the sublimation of Ni(CO)$_4$ and Fe(CO)$_5$ carbonyls. This scenario provides a straightforward explanation for the asymmetric release of NiI and FeI atoms in the cometary coma and how it depends on the heliocentric distance. It also supports the presence of carbonyls in the cometary material.</description>

      <title>Lunar Dust: Formation, Microphysics, and Transport</title>

Abstract: Lunar dust -- the sub-millimeter fraction of the regolith -- controls the optical, thermophysical, electrical, mechanical, and environmental behavior of the Moon's surface. These properties set the performance envelopes of remote-sensing retrievals, regolith geotechnics, volatile cycles, and exploration systems, while also posing operational and biomedical risks. We synthesize Apollo sample analyses and in-situ observations (Surveyor, Lunokhod, Apollo) with contemporary datasets from the LRO Diviner Lunar Radiometer, the LADEE/LDEX exospheric dust measurements, and Chang'e-4 Lunar Penetrating Radar (LPR). We also incorporate 2024-2025 results: Chandrayaan-3 ChaSTE thermophysics at the Vikram lander's site, SCALPSS plume-surface diagnostics from Intuitive Machines Mission 1 (IM-1), and Negative Ions at the Lunar Surface (NILS) detections of a dayside near-surface H$^{-}$ population on Chang'e-6. The review links (i) production and modification processes to (ii) grain-scale physical/chemical/electrical/optical/mechanical properties, then to (iii) mobilization pathways (meteoroid ejecta, electrostatic hopping, rocket-plume entrainment), and finally to (iv) region-specific design ranges across maria, highlands, pyroclastic units, magnetic swirls, and permanently shadowed regions (PSRs). We quantify temperature-illumination dependence across day/night and PSR-equator regimes through a two-channel $k(T,\rho)$ model and charge-relaxation scaling. We provide closed-form expressions for adhesion-aware lift thresholds and for near-surface (0-3~m) dust transport at apex/hover heights as functions of sheath structure. The result is a design-ready set of relations, figures, and tables that propagate microphysics and composition into engineering parameters for upcoming landed and rover operations.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Free Dynamics in Rotating Spherical Shell Convection Driven By Internal Heating and Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The bulk properties of convection in stellar and giant planet interiors are often assumed to be independent of the molecular diffusivities, which are very small. By contrast, simulations of this process in rotating, spherical shells, which are typically driven by conductive boundary heat fluxes, generally yield results that depend on the diffusivity. This makes it challenging to extrapolate these simulation results to real objects. However, laboratory models and Cartesian-box simulations suggest that diffusion-free dynamics are more readily obtained if convection is driven using prescribed internal heating and cooling instead of boundary fluxes. Here, we apply this methodology to simulations of Boussinesq, hydrodynamic rotating spherical shell convection. We find that this set-up unambiguously yields diffusion-free behaviour for some bulk properties of the convection, such as the radial temperature contrast and the convective heat transport. Moreover, the transition from prograde to retrograde equatorial zonal flow is diffusion-free and only depends on the convective Rossby number. The diffusivity dependence of other bulk properties is regime-dependent. In simulations that are rotationally constrained, the convective velocities, and the strength and structure of the zonal flow, are diffusion-dependent, although the zonal flow appears to approach a diffusion-free state for sufficiently high supercriticality. In simulations that are uninfluenced by rotation, or are only influenced by rotation at large scales, diffusion-free convective velocities and zonal flows are obtained. The result that many aspects of our idealised simulations are diffusion-free has promising implications for the development of realistic stellar and giant planet convection models that can access diffusion-free regimes.</description>
