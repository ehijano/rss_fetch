      <title>Covered Forest: Fine-grained generalization analysis of graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The expressive power of message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) is reasonably well understood, primarily through combinatorial techniques from graph isomorphism testing. However, MPNNs' generalization abilities -- making meaningful predictions beyond the training set -- remain less explored. Current generalization analyses often overlook graph structure, limit the focus to specific aggregation functions, and assume the impractical, hard-to-optimize $0$-$1$ loss function. Here, we extend recent advances in graph similarity theory to assess the influence of graph structure, aggregation, and loss functions on MPNNs' generalization abilities. Our empirical study supports our theoretical insights, improving our understanding of MPNNs' generalization properties.</description>

      <title>Payment Scheduling in the Interval Debt Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The network-based study of financial systems has received considerable attention in recent years but has seldom explicitly incorporated the dynamic aspects of such systems. We consider this problem setting from the temporal point of view and introduce the Interval Debt Model (IDM) and some scheduling problems based on it, namely: Bankruptcy Minimization/Maximization, in which the aim is to produce a payment schedule with at most/at least a given number of bankruptcies; Perfect Scheduling, the special case of the minimization variant where the aim is to produce a schedule with no bankruptcies (that is, a perfect schedule); and Bailout Minimization, in which a financial authority must allocate a smallest possible bailout package to enable a perfect schedule. We show that each of these problems is NP-complete, in many cases even on very restricted input instances. On the positive side, we provide for Perfect Scheduling a polynomial-time algorithm on (rooted) out-trees although in contrast we prove NP-completeness on directed acyclic graphs, as well as on instances with a constant number of nodes (and hence also constant treewidth). When we allow non-integer payments, we show by a linear programming argument that the problem Bailout Minimization can be solved in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Locked Polyomino Tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15996v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A locked $t$-omino tiling is a grid tiling by $t$-ominoes such that, if you remove any pair of tiles, the only way to fill in the remaining $2t$ grid cells with $t$-ominoes is to use the same two tiles in the exact same configuration as before. We exclude degenerate cases where there is only one tiling overall due to small dimensions. It is a classic (and straightforward) result that finite grids do not admit locked 2-omino tilings. In this paper, we construct explicit locked $t$-omino tilings for $t \geq 3$ on grids of various dimensions. Most notably, we show that locked 3- and 4-omino tilings exist on finite square grids of arbitrarily large size, and locked $t$-omino tilings of the infinite grid exist for arbitrarily large $t$. The result for 4-omino tilings in particular is remarkable because they are so rare and difficult to construct: Only a single tiling is known to exist on any grid up to size $40 \times 40$. In a weighted version of the problem where vertices of the grid may have weights from the set $\{1, 2\}$ that count toward the total tile size, we demonstrate the existence of locked tilings on arbitrarily large square weighted grids with only 6 tiles.
  Locked $t$-omino tilings arise as obstructions to widely used political redistricting algorithms in a model of redistricting where the underlying census geography is a grid graph. Most prominent is the ReCom Markov chain, which takes a random walk on the space of redistricting plans by iteratively merging and splitting pairs of districts (tiles) at a time. Locked $t$-omino tilings are isolated states in the state space of ReCom. The constructions in this paper are counterexamples to the meta-conjecture that ReCom is irreducible on graphs of practical interest.</description>

      <title>Permutation and Multi-permutation Codes Correcting Multiple Deletions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Permutation codes in the Ulam metric, which can correct multiple deletions, have been investigated extensively recently. In this work, we are interested in the maximum size of permutation codes in the Ulam metric and aim to design permutation codes that can correct multiple deletions with efficient decoding algorithms. We first present an improvement on the Gilbert--Varshamov bound of the maximum size of these permutation codes by analyzing the independence number of the auxiliary graph. The idea is widely used in various cases and our contribution in this section is enumerating the number of triangles in the auxiliary graph and showing that it is small enough. Next, we design permutation codes correcting multiple deletions with a decoding algorithm. In particular, the constructed permutation codes can correct $t$ deletions with at most $(3t-1) \log n+o(\log n)$ bits of redundancy where $n$ is the length of the code. Our construction is based on a new mapping which yields a new connection between permutation codes in the Hamming metric and permutation codes in various metrics. Furthermore, we construct permutation codes that correct multiple bursts of deletions using this new mapping. Finally, we extend the new mapping for multi-permutations and construct the best-known multi-permutation codes in Ulam metric.</description>

      <title>The strong vertex span of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The strong vertex (edge) span of a given graph $G$ is the maximum distance that two players can maintain at all times while visiting all vertices (edges) of $G$ and moving either to an adjacent vertex or staying in the current position independently of each other. We introduce the notions of switching walks and triod size of a tree, which are used to determine the strong vertex and the strong edge span of an arbitrary tree. The obtained results are used in an algorithm that computes the strong vertex (edge) span of the input tree in linear time.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the set of zero-noise limits measures of perturbed cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We add small random perturbations to a cellular automaton and consider the one-parameter family $(F_\epsilon)_{\epsilon&gt;0}$ parameterized by $\epsilon$ where $\epsilon&gt;0$ is the level of noise. The objective of the article is to study the set of limiting invariant distributions as $\epsilon$ tends to zero denoted $\mathcal{M}_0^l$. Some topological obstructions appear, $\mathcal{M}_0^l$ is compact and connected, as well as combinatorial obstructions as the set of cellular automata is countable: $\mathcal{M}_0^l$ is $\Pi_3$-computable in general and $\Pi_2$-computable if it is uniformly approached. Reciprocally, for any set of probability measures $\mathcal{K}$ which is compact, connected and $\Pi_2$-computable, we construct a cellular automaton whose perturbations by an uniform noise admit $\mathcal{K}$ as the zero-noise limits measure and this set is uniformly approached. To finish, we study how the set of limiting invariant measures can depend on a bias in the noise. We construct a cellular automaton which realizes any connected compact set (without computable constraints) if the bias is changed for an arbitrary small value. In some sense this cellular automaton is very unstable with respect to the noise.</description>
