      <title>Dysmemic Pressure: Selection Dynamics in Organizational Information Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Why do organizations comprised of intelligent individuals converge on collective delusion? This paper introduces dysmemic pressure as a formal mechanism explaining organizational epistemic failure. Synthesizing strategic communication theory (Crawford &amp; Sobel, 1982), agency theory (Prendergast, 1993), and cultural evolution (Boyd &amp; Richerson, 1985), I demonstrate how preference divergence between organizational agents generates stable equilibria where communication becomes statistically independent of reality, while transmission biases lock dysfunction into self-reinforcing states. The mechanism operates through identifiable dynamics: as the bias between sender and receiver preferences increases, communication precision degrades through progressively coarser partitions until reaching "babbling equilibrium" where messages carry no information; simultaneously, transmission biases (content, prestige, conformity) ensure that dysfunctional signals outcompete accurate ones in the organizational meme pool. Three detailed case studies--Nokia's smartphone collapse, NASA's Challenger disaster, and Wells Fargo's account fraud scandal--illustrate the mechanism's operation across industries and failure modes. I derive five testable propositions and evaluate potential countermeasures through a mechanism design lens. The analysis reframes organizational dysfunction from moral failure to physics problem, explaining why standard interventions (culture change, leadership development, values alignment) so often fail: they treat equilibrium outcomes as behavioral problems rather than altering the selection environment that produces them.</description>

      <title>Layer-2 Adoption and Ethereum Mainnet Congestion: Regime-Aware Causal Evidence Across London, the Merge, and Dencun (2021-2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Do Ethereum's Layer-2 (L2) rollups actually decongest the Layer-1 (L1) mainnet once protocol upgrades and demand are held constant? Using a 1245-day daily panel from August 5, 2021 to December 31, 2024 that spans the London, Merge, and Dencun upgrades, we link Ethereum fee and congestion metrics to L2 user activity, macro-demand proxies, and targeted event indicators. We estimate a regime-aware error-correction model that treats posting-clean L2 user share as a continuous treatment. Over the pre-Dencun (London+Merge) window, a 10 percentage point increase in L2 adoption lowers median base fees by about 13% -- roughly 5 Gwei at pre-Dencun levels -- and deviations from the long-run relation decay with an 11-day half-life. Block utilization and a scarcity index show similar congestion relief. After Dencun, L2 adoption is already high and treatment support narrows, so blob-era estimates are statistically imprecise and we treat them as exploratory. The pre-Dencun window therefore delivers the first cross-regime causal estimate of how aggregate L2 adoption decongests Ethereum, together with a reusable template for monitoring rollup-centric scaling strategies.</description>

      <title>Topological cluster synchronization via Dirac spectral programming on directed hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective synchronization in complex systems arises from the interplay between topology and dynamics, yet how to design and control such patterns in higher-order networks remains unclear. Here we show that a Dirac spectral programming framework enables programmable topological cluster synchronization on directed hypergraphs. By encoding tail-head hyperedges into a topological Dirac operator and introducing a tunable mass term, we obtain a spectrum whose isolated eigenvalues correspond to distinct synchronization clusters defined jointly on nodes and hyperedges. Selecting a target eigenvalue allows the system to self-organize toward the associated cluster state without modifying the underlying hypergraph structure. Simulations on directed-hypergraph block models and empirical systems--including higher-order contact networks and the ABIDE functional brain network--confirm that spectral selection alone determines the accessible synchronization patterns. Our results establish a general and interpretable route for controlling collective dynamics in directed higher-order systems.</description>

      <title>Language, participation and inclusivity in the urban planning process in Mzuzu City</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Participation in urban planning is championed for entrenching democracy and development. Malawi passed the Local Government Act (1998) and Decentralization Policy (1998) to facilitate community participation in decision-making processes. Several studies have been conducted on decentralization and local governance on community participation. Little attention has been paid to examining the impact of the language used in planning processes on democracy and inclusivity envisaged in the law and policy. Using communicative action theory, the study examined challenges posed by language used in planning processes on inclusivity in the approval processes of urban plans. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, observations and document review and analyzed using thematic and discourse analysis. The findings show that while there is high participation at community planning levels, because planners communicate using local languages, participation is compromised in the service committees at city level where final planning decisions are made due to language barrier. Specifically, lack of sincerity, truthfulness, comprehensibility and therefore legitimacy are apparent. Planners are reluctant to simplify written language and translate planning jargon into local languages for councillors to understand. The study concludes that community participation in the urban planning process in Mzuzu fails to entrench democracy due to lack of inclusiveness owing to the language barrier at city level where final planning decisions are made. The study proposes a framework for inclusive participation in urban planning including the motivation, conditions for effective participation and outcomes of participation.</description>

      <title>Analysis of airport runway pavement reliability considering temperature variation: The case of Sao Paulo-Congonhas international airport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Airport pavement design methods, such as those of the FAA, assume general climatic conditions, although regional temperature variations significantly affect pavement behavior, stress strain distribution, performance, and reliability. With global warming, evaluating how temperature influences pavement materials and resilience has become increasingly important. This study conducts a reliability analysis of pavement designed by traditional methods while incorporating seasonal temperature variation for Sao Paulo Congonhas International Airport CGH. After designing the pavement based on the airports traffic mix, a Monte Carlo Simulation was used to assess reliability under temperature changes. Results show that the cumulative damage factor from MCS is 79% lower than that obtained with the FAA method, indicating that aircraft cause less damage than predicted. The pavement could support 2.5 times more traffic at 95% reliability and 5.0 times more at 50% reliability. These findings suggest that, in Brazilian airports where fatigue governs design, FAARFIELD overestimates damage and increases construction costs, highlighting the need to calibrate design methods to local climatic conditions. Limitations include the deterministic temperature model and the exclusion of factors such as precipitation, thickness variability, and temperature dependent fatigue testing. Future work will aim to address these gaps and refine performance equations.</description>

      <title>Predication of Final Medal Counts in Olympic Games by Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, a program strength model was proposed to evaluate the performance of countries across different Olympic events. The model assessed how strong a country's program was in each event and also factored in the influence of past Olympic performances. The final medal counts from the Paris 2024 Olympic Games were used to validate the model and to determine the optimal set of constants using Monte Carlo simulation. Based on this model, a prediction of the final medal counts for the 2028 Olympic Games is also provides for reference.</description>

      <title>The Least Action-Augmented Lanchester Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The principle of least action, a fundamental principle in variational mechanics with broad applicability to classical physical systems, is employed to formulate a novel attrition model for combat dynamics. This formulation extends the Lanchester's square law through second-order temporal derivatives by requiring the resultant Euler-Lagrange equation to coincide with the classical Lanchester's equation. Initial conditions at a specified temporal point enable determination of subsequent system evolution through action minimization, while terminal boundary conditions permit backward reconstruction of combat trajectories. The model's validity is examined through historical analysis of WWII engagements: the Battle of Kursk and the Battle of Iwo Jima. Comparative studies with conventional Lanchester's square models demonstrate marked improvements in predictive accuracy regarding force strength progression, particularly in capturing non-linear attrition patterns characteristic of prolonged engagements.</description>

      <title>Energy and GHG saving potentials of sufficiency measures -- a synthesis for Germany</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sixth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emphasises the potential of demand-side measures, such as sufficiency, for mitigating climate change. Although quantified potentials of various sufficiency measures exist, policy advisors and energy modellers criticise the lack of findability and comparability of the relevant data. Due to the high level of heterogeneity in units, reference points and calculation methods, the data cannot be used to summarise sufficiency potentials at a national level. Consequently, this paper aims to identify, structure, harmonise and synthesise existing data in order to determine the greatest saving potentials per sector and highlight data gaps. Based on a systematic literature review, we have created a curated open-source database containing over 300 quantified energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) saving potentials for Germany, which could be used as a blueprint for other such data collections. Most quantifications were available for the building sector, particularly for appliances. The highest total energy and GHG emission savings in Germany were identified in measures that reduce per capita living space, with saving potentials of -150 Terawatt-hours per year (TWh/a) and -118 Million Tons of Carbon Dioxide Equivalents per year (Mt CO2eq./a; this measure also includes lower heating temperatures). This synthesis can help modellers to better account for sufficiency potentials in scenarios, and help policymakers to understand the saving potentials of sufficiency. We encourage researchers to quantify more energy and GHG saving potentials in order to fill the identified gaps and to use the proposed synthesis structure.</description>

      <title>Network localization governs social contagion dynamics with macro-level reinforcement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spread of ideas, behaviors, and technologies generally depends on feedback mechanisms operating across multiple scales. Previous studies have extensively examined pairwise transmission and local reinforcement. However, the role of macro-level social influence -- where widespread adoption enhances further adoption -- remains understudied. Here, we focus on a contagion process that incorporates both pairwise interactions and macro-level reinforcement. We show that the contagion undergoes a shift from continuous to mixed-order transition as macro-level influence exceeds a reinforcement threshold. Simulations on various real-world networks indicate that network localization governs the contagion outcomes by determining the critical point and the reinforcement threshold. Building on this insight, we develop a structural metric linking network localization to contagion dynamics, revealing a key trade-off: networks that facilitate weak contagion tend to experience slower diffusion and lower adoption rates, while networks that suppress weak contagions enable faster and more widespread adoption. These findings challenge the conventional belief that stronger local connectivity uniformly promotes contagion.</description>

      <title>Functional Percolation: Criticality of Form and Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how network structure constrains and enables information processing is a central problem in the statistical mechanics of interacting systems. Here we study random networks across the structural percolation transition and analyze how connectivity governs realizable input-output transformations under cascade dynamics. Using Erdos-Renyi networks as a minimal ensemble, we examine structural, functional, and information-theoretic observables as functions of mean degree. We find that the emergence of the giant connected component coincides with a sharp transition in realizable information processing: complex input-output response functions become accessible, functional diversity increases rapidly, output entropy rises, and directed information flow, quantified by transfer entropy, extends beyond local neighborhoods. We term this coincidence of structural, functional, and informational transitions functional percolation, referring to a sharp expansion of the space of realizable input-output functions at the percolation threshold. Near criticality, networks exhibit a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between functional complexity and diversity, suggesting that percolation criticality may provide a general organizing principle of information processing capacity in systems with local interactions and propagating influences.</description>

      <title>Reducing Recurrent Competitive Epidemics via Dynamic Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.13395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by scenarios of epidemic competition, as well as how social contagions spread at the level of individuals, this work considers the competition between two conflicting node states that spread over a social graph according to a generic diffusion process. For this setting, we introduce the Generalized Largest Reduction in Infectious Edges (gLRIE), which is a dynamic resource allocation strategy that favors the preferred state against the other. Our analysis assumes a generic continuous-time SIS-like (Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible) diffusion model that allows for: arbitrary node transition rate functions for nodes to change state, and competition between the healthy (positive) and infected (negative) states, which are both diffusive at the same time, yet mutually exclusive at each node. The strategy follows a minimum-risk-maximum-gain principle, and its features are particularly relevant for social contagion phenomena. In accordance with the LRIE strategy that we generalize, we show that in this context the gLRIE strategy remains a greedy solution for the minimization of the number of infected network nodes over time. Ultimately, simulations are employed to compare the proposed strategy with other existing alternatives, demonstrating that gLRIE exhibits superior performance across a spectrum of scenarios, including a realistic counter-contagion campaign in a small well-monitored community.</description>

Abstract: We obtain an exact formula for the probability that a uniformly random spanning tree of the $2$-by-$n$ square grid is ``balanced'' in the sense that it has an edge whose removal partitions its vertices into two sets of equal size. We compute the exact limit of this probability as $n\rightarrow\infty$.</description>

      <title>Learning to detect continuous gravitational waves: an open data-analysis competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report results of a public data-analysis challenge, hosted on the open data-science platform Kaggle, to detect simulated continuous gravitational-wave signals (CWs). These are weak signals from rapidly spinning neutron stars that remain undetected despite extensive searches. The competition dataset consisted of a population of CW signals using both simulated and real LIGO detector data matching the conditions of actual CW searches. The competition attracted more than 1,000 participants to develop realistic CW search algorithms. We describe the top 10 approaches and discuss their applicability as a pre-processing step compared to standard CW-search approaches. For the competition's dataset, we find that top approaches can reduce the computing cost by 1 to 3 orders of magnitude at a false-dismissal probability comparable to standard CW searches. Additionally, the competition drove the development of new GPU-accelerated detection pipelines, which facilitated their adoption in other areas of gravitational-wave data analysis. We release the associated dataset, which constitutes the first open standardized benchmark for CW detection, to enable reproducible method comparisons and to encourage further developments toward the first detection of these elusive signals.</description>
