      <title>BRST Symmetry Violation and Fundamental Limitations of Asymptotic Safety in Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The asymptotic safety program assumes that quantum gravity becomes renormalizable through ultraviolet fixed points in metric-based couplings. We demonstrate that this approach {encounters fundamental symmetry violations} across multiple independent criteria, all traceable to a single fundamental cause: the breakdown of general covariance and BRST symmetries above the gravitational cutoff scale. Rigorous canonical quantization proves that general covariance cannot be maintained quantum mechanically in dimensions greater than two, while recent path integral calculations reveal persistent gauge parameter dependence in quantum gravitational corrections, signaling BRST symmetry violation. These dual proofs establish that the metric tensor ceases to exist as a valid quantum degree of freedom above $\Lambda_{\text{grav}}$$\sim$$10^{18}$ GeV, rendering the search for ultraviolet fixed points in metric-based theories {problematic from a foundational physical perspective}. We provide comprehensive analysis demonstrating that asymptotic safety exhibits persistent gauge parameter dependence where fixed-point properties vary with arbitrary gauge choices, non-convergent truncation schemes extending to the 35th order showing no approach to stable values, experimental {tensions} with electroweak precision tests by orders of magnitude, matter content requirements incompatible with the Standard Model, absence of concrete graviton predictions due to gauge and truncation dependence, unitarity {challenges} through ghost instabilities and propagator negativity, and fundamental Wick rotation obstructions preventing reliable connection between Euclidean calculations and physical Lorentzian spacetime. We contrast this with the Unified Standard Model with Emergent Gravity framework that systematically avoids all asymptotic safety pathologies.</description>

      <title>Traversable Wormhole Solutions in f (Q, Lm) Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate traversable wormhole solutions within the framework of $f(\mathscr{Q},\mathscr{L}_m)$ gravity, a symmetric teleparallel theory featuring non-minimal coupling between geometry and matter. Adopting a linear functional form $f(\mathscr{Q},\mathscr{L}_m) = -\alpha \mathscr{Q} + 2\mathscr{L}_m + \beta$, we derive the field equations for a static, spherically symmetric Morris-Thorne wormhole geometry with vanishing redshift function. Four distinct shape functions are considered: $b(r)=\sqrt{r_0 r}$, $b(r)=r_0\left(\dfrac{r}{r_0}\right)^{\gamma}$ (with $0&lt;\gamma&lt;1$), and $b(r)=\dfrac{r_0 \ln (r+1)}{\ln (r_0+1)}$. The geometric viability of each configuration is verified through standard traversability conditions, including the flaring-out requirement and asymptotic flatness. We analyze the energy conditions and demonstrate that, consistent with known results in wormhole physics, the null energy condition is violated in the vicinity of the throat, indicating the presence of exotic matter. In addition, we employ embedding diagrams to visualize the spatial geometry of the wormhole solutions, providing a clear geometric interpretation of the flaring-out condition at the throat. Our results suggest that $f(\mathscr{Q},\mathscr{L}_m)$ gravity provides a viable framework for constructing traversable wormholes, with the non-minimal matter-geometry coupling influencing both the geometry and the matter sector.</description>

      <title>Liouville theory on a horizon: point particle/scalar field duality and Page-like curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the consequences of a recent paper on quantum gravity are 1) a duality between point particles and massive scalar propagators, 2) the recovery of the entropy of a boundary (a black hole) in the same form as that of the EFT approach to Quantum Gravity and 3) a quantum correction to Hawking radiations and a Page-like curve. In this recent paper, information about what lies inside a boundary is encoded onto it, meaning that in this approach the information directly leaks from the horizon to the bulk in the form of Hawking radiations.</description>

      <title>Dirac Sources for Nonmetricity and Torsion in Metric-affine Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metric-affine gravity (GL(4) gauge theory) in 4-dimensions is coupled to a spacetime Dirac source field using the isomorphisms of the Lie algebra gl(4) to the Clifford algebras Cl(3,1) and Cl(2,2). A simple transformation relates the generators of Cl(3,1) to a real representation of Cl(2,2), while the real representation of Cl(2,2) serves directly as a basis for the Lie algebra gl(4). Therefore, although GL(4) does not contain a spinor representation of the Lorentz group, expanding its Lie algebra in the Cl(2,2) basis gives a Clifford valued connection with well-defined coupling to Dirac spinors. Variation of the expansion coefficients gives new Dirac sources for both torsion and nonmetricity, separated by identifying the so(3,1) basis within the gl(4) basis.</description>

      <title>Wada Boundaries in Generic Polynomial PP-Wave Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the geodesics of pp-wave spacetimes with polynomial profiles of degrees $3\leq n\leq10$, which are dynamically equivalent to the motion of a classical particle in a two-dimensional harmonic polynomial potential. By analysing the escape basins associated with different asymptotic outcomes, we show that all basins exhibit the Wada property for every polynomial degree considered. We further compute the basin entropy $S_{b}$, finding that it increases monotonically with the polynomial degree, indicating enhanced unpredictability of the final state of the system. The boundary basin entropy $S_{bb}$ is also evaluated, and the $\ln(2)$ criterion confirms that the basin boundaries are fractal for $n&gt;3$. We conjecture that the Wada property persists for polynomial degrees $n&gt;10$.</description>

      <title>Healthy scalar-tensor theories with third-order derivatives: Generalized disformal Horndeski and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically construct ghost-free scalar-tensor theories whose Lagrangian includes up to third-order derivatives of the scalar field. Using a spatially covariant action written in terms of the ADM variables, we impose degeneracy and consistency conditions that ensure the propagation of only one scalar and two tensor degrees of freedom. The resultant theories extend the generalized disformal Horndeski and U-DHOST theories. We discuss the transformation properties of these theories under generalized disformal transformations.</description>

      <title>Chiellini-Integrable Cosmologies with Phantom Divide Crossing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate exact cosmological solutions with a massive scalar field minimally coupled to the Einstein-Hilbert action in General Relativity. For an extended Higgs-like scalar self-interaction, we find that the resulting field equations belong to the damped Ermakov-Painlev\'e II class and construct novel analytical solutions within the framework of the Chiellini integrability condition. We analyze whether the expanding branch of the solutions can describe a late-time cosmic acceleration, using a combined statistical analysis of BAO, CMB, cosmic chronometer and Pantheon+SHOES supernova datasets. A crucial outcome of this exercise is the analytical emergence of a smooth phantom divide crossing in the dark energy equation of state, achieved without introducing any pathological instabilities. The reconstruction yields a present-day Hubble parameter $H_0 \gtrsim 70 \,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, with a reduced tension relative to the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. The results indicate that Chiellini-integrable scalar cosmologies are capable of providing a robust and analytically controlled framework for modeling late-time cosmic acceleration and phantom divide crossing, offering a viable alternative to phenomenological dark-energy parametrizations.</description>

      <title>Sub-Leading Logarithms for Scalar Potential Models on de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continual production of long wavelength scalars and gravitons during inflation injects secular growth into loop corrections which would be constant in flat space. One typically finds that each additional factor of the loop counting parameter can induce up to a certain number of logarithms of the scale factor. Loop corrections that attain this number are known as ``leading logarithms''; those with fewer are sub-leading. Starobinsky's stochastic formalism has long been known to reproduce the leading logarithms of scalar potential models. We show that the first sub-leading logarithm is captured by applying the stochastic formalism to a certain part of the 1-loop effective potential. This is checked at 2-loops for a massless, minimally coupled scalar with a quartic self-interaction on de Sitter background.</description>

      <title>Probing dynamical embeddings in a five-dimensional spacetime in light of DESI BAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We here investigate the observational viability of Nash gravity as an alternative to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Based on Nash's embedding theorem, the model introduces orthogonal perturbations via variations in the extrinsic curvature, generating scalar-type metric perturbations directly from geometry, without the need to introduce additional fields. We confront the model with current observational data, including Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements from Planck, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from DESI DR2, and recent Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) compilations. Our analysis shows that Nash gravity provides a good fit to the data, yielding a slightly higher value for the Hubble constant, $H_0 = 69.32 \pm 0.72$ km/s/Mpc, compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model, thus offering a potential alleviation of the $H_0$ tension. Furthermore, the model naturally predicts a suppressed growth of structure, with $S_8 \approx 0.76$ across various joint analyses, potentially alleviating the so-called $S_8$ tension, assuming that this discrepancy is not solely due to systematic effects in other independent measurements. In some cases, Nash gravity achieves a better fit to the data than the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm at the $2\sigma$ level.</description>

      <title>Tidal dynamics and stellar disruption in charged Kalb-Ramond black holes in nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate tidal forces, geodesic deviation, and tidal disruption in the black hole spacetime described by the Kalb-Ramond-ModMax solution, where electromagnetic nonlinearity is governed by the parameter $\gamma$ and Lorentz symmetry violation by the parameter $l$. In the canonical sector ($\alpha=1$), the radial tidal force exhibits a transition marked by a sign inversion between the horizons $r_{-}$ and $r_+$, signaling internal regimes of radial compression analogous to those of charged black holes; the parameter $l$ controls the strength and location of this transition, while $\gamma$ regulates the nonlinear electromagnetic contribution. The angular tidal force is predominantly compressive, $l$ shaping the effective geometry, and $\gamma$ acting as a damping factor. In the phantom sector ($\alpha=-1$), tidal forces and geodesic deviation diverge, indicating a tidal instability, with $l$ and $\gamma$ affecting only the magnitude of the response. We further show that $l$ shifts the relation between the horizon radius $r_+$ and the tidal disruption radius $r_{\rm Roche}$, thereby modifying the critical (Hills) mass defined by $r_{\rm Roche}=r_+$. Tidal disruption of neutron stars occurs inside the horizon for supermassive black holes, whereas Sun-like stars are disrupted outside the horizon, with $\gamma$ becoming relevant only for ultramassive black holes with masses $\sim 10^{8}M_{\odot}$. Our results demonstrate that Kalb-Ramon-ModMax effects are largely suppressed for supermassive black holes, but may be relevant for intermediate-mass systems and observable tidal disruption events, offering an indirect probe of Lorentz violation and nonlinear electrodynamics in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>The pseudo-complex Friedmann Lemaitre Robertson Walker model and the time dependence of the Hubble constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pseudocomplex version of the FLRW model is presented within the framework of pseudocomplex General Relativity (pcGR). In this approach, dark energy arises as a geometric consequence of the pseudocomplex structure, leading to a time dependent Hubble parameter rather than a strictly constant H0. The relation between the tiderived and constrained using recent DESI BAO data. Fitting beta yields a best-fit value beta = 1.0426, corresponding to a deceleration parameter q = -0.9361 and a present day Hubble acceleration me derivative of the Hubble parameter and a single geometric parameter beta in the effective dark energy equation of state is derived and constrained using recent DESI BAO data. Fitting beta yields a best-fit value beta = 1.0426, corresponding to a deceleration parameter q = -0.9361 and a present day Hubble acceleration H0 sim 0.94 x10-17 (km/s2)/Mpc. Using the exact Sandage Loeb relation, the predicted redshift drift over 20 years for a source at z = 4 is Delta-v sim -11.1 cm/s, in close agreement with the Lambda CDM prediction. In pcGR, however, the non-vanishing H0 is a direct geometric prediction, providing a clear and testable target for future high-precision spectroscopic observations.</description>

      <title>Confronting eikonal and post-Kerr methods with numerical evolution of scalar field perturbations in spacetimes beyond Kerr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate computation of quasinormal modes from rotating black holes beyond general relativity is crucial for testing fundamental physics with gravitational waves. In this study, we assess the accuracy of the eikonal and post-Kerr approximations in predicting the quasinormal mode spectrum of a scalar field on a deformed Kerr spacetime. To obtain benchmark results and to analyze the ringdown dynamics from generic perturbations, we further employ a 2+1-dimensional numerical time-evolution framework. This approach enables a systematic quantification of theoretical uncertainties across multiple angular harmonics, a broad range of spin parameters, and progressively stronger deviations from the Kerr geometry. We then confront these modeling errors with simple projections of statistical uncertainties in quasinormal mode frequencies as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio, thereby exploring the domain of validity of approximate methods for prospective high-precision black-hole spectroscopy. We also report that near-horizon deformations can affect prograde and retrograde modes differently and provide a geometrical explanation.</description>

      <title>A Closed-Form Surrogate for the Equivalent Diameter of the Kerr Shadow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a closed-form surrogate for the equivalent diameter of the Kerr black-hole shadow, defined as the diameter of the circle with the same area as the shadow's critical curve. The construction enforces the exact face-on (polar) limit by explicitly separating an analytically computed polar contribution based on the spherical photon-orbit branch where the horizontal impact parameter vanishes. The remaining inclination dependence is captured by a compact 15-parameter polynomial placed inside an exponential correction. The coefficients are determined by ordinary least squares on a deterministic reference grid generated from the Kerr critical-curve area. Over the practical domain of dimensionless spin from 0 to 0.998 and inclination from just above 0 degrees up to 90 degrees (with the exactly polar point treated analytically), the surrogate achieves sub-percent accuracy. On the training grid the median absolute percent error is 0.0105 percent with a worst case of 0.782 percent, and on a denser out-of-sample validation set (including inclinations down to 0.5 degrees) the median, 95th-percentile, and worst-case errors are 0.023 percent, 0.471 percent, and 1.64 percent, respectively. The resulting expression provides fast evaluations of the shadow size without numerical ray tracing, making it convenient for repeated calls in parameter inference and rapid model comparisons.</description>

      <title>Constant-roll $\beta$-exponential inflation: Palatini formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the inflationary dynamics of the $\beta$-exponential potential model, where a scalar field couples to quadratic $(R + R^2)$ gravity. In this model, the inflaton is the field that determines the size of the extra dimension. We employ the Palatini formalism to derive the resulting Einstein-frame generalized $k$-inflation effective theory, which we analyze under the assumption that the constant-roll condition is satisfied.
  We scan the parameter space for inflationary predictions, specifically the spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, ensuring consistency with the results from ACT DR6. The compliant regions are depicted accordingly. For a suitable range of the model parameters, the values obtained for the inflationary observables align with the most recent observations by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) collaboration and/or the Planck mission.</description>

      <title>The impact of waveform systematics and Gaussian noise on the interpretation of GW231123</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GW231123 is an exceptional gravitational-wave event consistent with the merger of two massive, highly-spinning black holes. Reliable inference of the source properties is crucial for accurate interpretation of its astrophysical implications. However, characterization of GW231123 is challenging: only few signal cycles are observed and different signal models result in systematically different parameters. We investigate whether the interpretation of GW231123 is robust against model systematics and Gaussian detector noise. We show that the model systematics observed in GW231123 can be reproduced for a simulated signal based on the numerical-relativity surrogate model NRSur7dq4. Simulating data using the maximum-likelihood NRSur7dq4 waveform for GW231123 and no noise realization, we closely recover the systematics observed for the real signal. We then explore how the headline properties of GW231123 are impacted by Gaussian detector noise. Using the NRSur7dq4 maximum-likelihood waveform and different noise realizations, we consistently find support for large masses, high spin magnitudes (median $\chi_1\geq 0.7$), and high spin precession (median $\chi_\mathrm{p}\geq 0.68$). The spin in the direction of the angular momentum ($\chi_\mathrm{eff}$) fluctuates more. Finally, again comparing to simulated signals, we show that any differences in the GW231123 inference based on each separate detector are not statistically significant. These results show that the properties of GW231123, and most importantly the high mass and high spin magnitudes inferred by NRSur7dq4, are robust.</description>

      <title>Note on pulsar timing array correlation functions induced by peculiar velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several papers have recently calculated the contribution to pulsar timing array overlap reduction functions (ORFs) induced by our peculiar velocity with respect to the rest frame of the stochastic gravitational-wave background. Here we show that a harmonic-space calculation confirms the most recent result. We note that, with the harmonic-space calculation, the ORFs for spin-1 GWs and the correlations with astrometry measurements are also easily obtained.</description>

      <title>Upper limits on microhertz gravitational waves from supermassive black-hole binaries using PSR J1909-3744 data from the second IPTA data release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a search for gravitational waves (GWs) from individual sources using high-cadence observations of PSR J1909\(-\)3744 obtained during an intensive observing campaign with the International Pulsar Timing Array second data release (IPTA-DR2) between July 2010 and November 2012. The observations, conducted at three different radio frequencies with the Nan\c{c}ay Radio Telescope (NRT) and Parkes Telescope (PKS) and five frequencies with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), enabled precise corrections for dispersion measure effects and scattering variations. After these corrections, the timing residuals showed an unmodeled periodic noise component with an amplitude of 340 ns. Our analysis yields upper limits on the GW strain from individual sources, constraining it to be below \(1.9 \times 10^{-14}\) at 71 nHz and \(2.3 \times 10^{-13}\) at 1 \textmu Hz for average sky locations, while for optimal source locations the limits improve to \(6.2 \times 10^{-15}\) and \(8.9 \times 10^{-14}\) at the same frequencies, respectively. Our new limits are about a factor of 1.52 more stringent than those of Perera et al. based on an earlier EPTA data.</description>

      <title>Ghost-Free Stable Minkowski Vacua in Lovelock Compactifications on Irreducible Symmetric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the compactification of higher-dimensional Lovelock gravity on compact irreducible symmetric spaces, focusing on conditions under which a physically healthy four-dimensional Minkowski vacuum exists. We show that when the internal dimension is five or less, or when the theory is restricted to the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet sector, the four-dimensional graviton (tensor sector) is necessarily a ghost. Inclusion of the cubic Lovelock term removes this ghost instability; however, the resulting Minkowski vacuum is generically only metastable, being accompanied by energetically favored Anti-de Sitter vacua. While such metastability cannot be avoided for spherical internal spaces, we identify an infinite class of higher-rank symmetric spaces where the true vacuum can be pushed to infinity in moduli space, thereby realizing genuinely stable and ghost-free Minkowski vacua at the level of the four-dimensional effective theory. To support these conclusions, we explicitly compute Lovelock terms up to cubic order on these spaces, confirming a universal log-convexity among the linear, quadratic, and cubic invariants, which plays a central role in our analysis.</description>

      <title>Geodesics, One Point Functions and Black Hole Perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic black holes exhibit a striking relation between thermal boundary one-point functions and bulk geodesic lengths. In the large conformal-dimension limit, the one-point function of a primary operator is given by the exponential of the geodesic length from its boundary insertion point to the horizon. We test the robustness of this relation under perturbations by considering an arbitrary radial deformation of an Euclidean BTZ black hole and working to first order in the perturbation. We find that the relation remains robust: the corrected one-point function at large conformal dimension is still governed by an exponent proportional to the modified boundary-to-horizon geodesic length. The result is established using WKB and saddle-point methods, with the validity of the WKB approximation justified by exact analyses.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15 yr Data Set: Piecewise Power-Law Reconstruction of the Gravitational-Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The NANOGrav 15-year (NG15) data set provides evidence for a gravitational-wave background (GWB) signal at nanohertz frequencies, which is expected to originate either from a cosmic population of inspiraling supermassive black-hole binaries or new particle physics in the early Universe. A firm identification of the source of the NG15 signal requires an accurate reconstruction of its frequency spectrum. In this paper, we provide such a spectral characterization of the NG15 signal based on a piecewise power-law (PPL) ansatz that strikes a balance between existing alternatives in the literature. Our PPL reconstruction is more flexible than the standard constant-power-law model, which describes the GWB spectrum in terms of only two parameters: an amplitude A and a spectral index gamma. Concurrently, it better approximates physically realistic GWB spectra -- especially those of cosmological origin -- than the free spectral model, since the latter allows for arbitrary variations in the GWB amplitude from one frequency bin to the next. Our PPL reconstruction of the NG15 signal relies on individual PPL models with a fixed number of internal nodes (i.e., constant power law, broken power law, doubly broken power law, etc.) that are ultimately combined in a Bayesian model average. The data products resulting from our analysis provide the basis for fast refits of spectral GWB models.</description>

      <title>Resolving Hubble tension and locating missing baryons: Synergies between fast radio bursts and emerging cosmological probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two of the most pressing challenges in cosmology are the persistent discrepancy in measurements of the Hubble constant, referred to as the Hubble tension, and the deficit of baryons in the local Universe, known as the missing baryon problem. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) encode the integrated electron column density along their lines of sight, offering a unique probe of both the cosmic expansion rate ($H_0$) and the baryon density ($\Omega_{\rm b}$). However, constraints from FRBs alone suffer from a severe $H_0$-$\Omega_{\rm b}$ degeneracy that prevents them from resolving either problem independently. We show that this degeneracy can be broken by combining FRBs with other emerging probes whose degeneracy directions differ in the $H_0$-$\Omega_{\rm b}$ plane. Specifically, we quantify three multi-messenger approaches: FRBs paired with gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens, strong gravitational lensing (SGL) time delays, and 21 cm intensity mapping (IM). The combinations FRB+GW, FRB+SGL, and FRB+21 cm IM each deliver simultaneous constraints on $H_0$ and $\Omega_{\rm b}$ better than ($1\%$, $1\%$) in the $\Lambda$CDM model, ($1.5\%$, $2\%$) in the $w$CDM model, and ($2\%$, $3.5\%$) in the CPL model. Moreover, in a model-independent framework, both FRB+GW and FRB+SGL constrain $H_0$ and $\Omega_{\rm b}$ to better than ($1\%$, $2\%$) precision. These results demonstrate that the synergy between FRBs and other emerging probes holds great promise for resolving the Hubble tension and locating the missing baryons.</description>

      <title>Diamonds in the Bulk and Large-$N$ Scaling in AdS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Field Theory (QFT) introduced us to the notion that a causal diamond in space-time corresponded to a subsystem of a quantum mechanical system defined on the global space-time. Work by Jacobson, Fischler and Susskind, and particularly Bousso suggested that, in the quantum theory of gravity, this subsystem should have a density matrix of finite entropy. These authors formalized older intuitive arguments based on black hole physics. Although mathematically, Type II von Neumann algebras admit finite entropy density matrices, the black hole arguments suggest that the number of physical states in these subsystems is finite. The conjecture that de Sitter (dS) space has a finite number of physical states was first made by Fischler and one of the present authors. Leutheusser and Liu showed that, in the $N = \infty$ limit, causal diamonds with finite area in AdS radius units had Type $III_1$ von Neumann sub-algebras of the full operator algebra. They claimed that this was true for finite values of the UV cutoff, and that the algebra was the algebra of bulk local fields in the diamond. We will argue that the second part of this conjecture is incorrect and that the bulk field algebra emerges only in a double scaled limit, where the boundary UV cutoff is taken to infinity as $N$ is taken to infinity. There is never a bulk field theory description that resolves distances smaller than the AdS radius.</description>

Abstract: We study a massive-photon electrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in the curved spacetime of Einstein's gravity. We consider a Proca-type photon mass and present equations in terms of electric and magnetic (EM) fields and the vector potential. We present the electrodynamics and MHD in the covariant and ADM formulations valid in general spacetime and in linearly perturbed cosmological spacetime. We present wave equations assuming the metric variations are negligible compared with the field variations. Equations are derived without fixing the temporal gauge condition and the gauge transformation properties of the EM fields and the vector potential are presented. Using the post-Newtonian approximation we show the dark Proca field behaves as dust in the non-relativistic limit under the Klein transformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave astronomy has entered a regime where it can extract information about the population properties of the observed binary black holes. The steep increase in the number of detections will offer deeper insights, but it will also significantly raise the computational cost of testing multiple models. To address this challenge, we propose a procedure that first performs a non-parametric (data-driven) reconstruction of the underlying distribution, and then remaps these results onto a posterior for the parameters of a parametric (informed) model. The computational cost is primarily absorbed by the initial non-parametric step, while the remapping procedure is both significantly easier to perform and computationally cheaper. In addition to yielding the posterior distribution of the model parameters, this method also provides a measure of the model's goodness-of-fit, opening for a new quantitative comparison across models.</description>

      <title>Quasi-normal modes and shadows of scale-dependent regular black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate how a regular scale-dependent black hole, characterized by a single extra parameter $\epsilon$, behaves under perturbations by a test field (quasi-normal modes) and under light imaging (shadows) in a four-dimensional space-time background. On the quasi-normal modes side, we study how it responds to scalar and Dirac perturbations. To do this, we implement the well known WKB semi-analytic method of 6th order for obtaining the quasi-normal frequencies. We discuss the behavior of the real and imaginary parts of the quasi-normal modes for different values of the parameter $\epsilon$ and the overtone $n$ and multipole $\ell$ numbers. On the black hole imaging side, we ray-trace the geometry and illuminate it with a thin-accretion disk. Choosing $\epsilon=1.0$ we compute the size of the central brightness depression and generate full images of the black hole. We discuss the features (i.e. luminosity) of successive photon rings through the Lyapunov exponent of nearly-bound, unstable geodesics. Furthermore we use the correspondence (in the limit $\ell \gg n$) between quasi-normal mode frequencies and unstable bound light orbits to infer the numerical values of the latter using the former and find a remarkable accuracy of the correspondence in providing the right numbers. Our results support the usefulness of this correspondence in order to perform cross-tests of black holes using these two messengers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed a numerical code which evolves the semiclassical Einstein's equation (with the quantum stress-energy contribution added as a source term) for the spherically symmetric metric inside an evaporating semiclassical charged black hole. An analytical approximation for the evolving semiclassical metric was recently developed by Ori and Zilberman (and will be briefly overviewed here). We seek to numerically check the validity of this analytical approximation. The Einstein equations in this case are partial differential equations for the two unknown metric functions which fully describe the spherically symmetric metric. We begin our numerical simulation close to the event horizon with regular initial data specified by a variant of the charged Vaidya metric. We then evolve the metric functions deep into the neighborhood of the inner horizon. We explore the results of running this numerical code in several representative cases. Our numerical simulations confirm the validity of the above mentioned analytical approximation in all these cases.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of Cosmological Perturbations in the Bumblebee Model: Parameter Constraints and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13958v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We constrain the parameter space of the Bumblebee model in a cosmological background and then investigate the properties of gravitational waves within the constrained parameter space. Our analysis reveals seven perturbative degrees of freedom in the cosmological background: two tensor, two vector, and two scalar modes, along with an additional mode from the matter sector. The stability conditions for all these modes are derived. By incorporating the observed accelerated expansion of the universe and the observational constraints on tensor gravitational waves, we derive bounds on the parameter space of the Bumblebee model. Our results indicate that the non-minimal coupling parameter $\xi$ must be non-positive, a constant background value $b_{t}$ of the Bumblebee field implies $\sigma\ne -\tfrac{1}{2}\xi$, and the Lorentz-violating parameter $\xi b^2$ has a lower bound on the order of $10^{-15}$. We then investigate the propagation characteristics and polarization modes of gravitational waves in both the small-scale and Minkowski limits. The propagation modes of gravitational waves in the Bumblebee model consist of two tensor modes, two vector modes, and one scalar mode. Notably, the tensor modes travel at subluminal speeds, whereas the vector and scalar modes propagate at superluminal speeds, when $\xi b_{t}^2\ne 0$. These results provide a concrete theoretical framework and specific observational signatures for testing Lorentz invariance in the gravitational sector with future gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the overlapping of photon rings - higher-order images of a black hole's luminous environment, concentrated near the shadow boundary and expected to be resolved in future observations. We consider a broad class of static spherically symmetric spacetimes and geometrically thin equatorial accretion disk with a prescribed inner radius and infinite outer extent, viewed by a polar observer. Depending on the inner radius of the disk, the thickness of each photon ring varies, and the rings may or may not overlap. By overlapping, we mean that portions of images appear at the same angular position on the observer's sky. To characterize the overlapping, we introduce the radius of merging - the value of the disk's inner radius at which two photon rings of given orders begin to overlap. Since each radius of merging is labeled by two indices corresponding to the image orders, it becomes possible to arrange these radii in the form of an infinite-dimensional matrix where only the upper right-hand corner is filled. This matrix, which we call the "matrix of merging", is a signature of spacetime only, and, once known, it provides a qualitative understanding of the overlapping pattern for any chosen value of the inner radius of the disk. Remarkably, the matrix of merging exhibits several universal properties that hold for all spherically symmetric metrics and can be established even without explicit calculation of light trajectories. Based on these properties, we demonstrate that certain overlapping patterns are universally forbidden across all such spacetimes and for any inner radius of the disk. Examples for the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes are provided. The main application of our study is constraining the spacetime metric and the accretion model using observed photon ring overlaps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we extend our previously presented analytical formulas (Phys.Rev.D 109 (2024) 12, 124055) for describing light rays passing near or emitted in the vicinity of compact objects to a broader class of spherically symmetric, static spacetimes, including the Johansen-Psaltis and Rezzolla-Zhidenko metric families. The generalized formulas retain the simplicity and accuracy of the original approach while allowing for more general deviations from Schwarzschild geometry. These expressions provide an approximate yet accurate mapping between emission points and the image plane of an asymptotic observer, enabling fast analytical computations of accretion disk images, polarization of the emitted radiation, luminosity curves associated with pulsars, and other related applications. As examples, we compute isoradial curves for several metric families and the Stokes parameters Q and U for a hot spot orbiting near a black hole described by one of the studied metrics, presenting the corresponding polarization (QU) curves.</description>

      <title>Identification and characterization of distorted gravitational waves by lensing using deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) can be distorted by intervening mass distributions while propagating, leading to frequency-dependent modulations that imprint a distinct signature on the observed waveforms. Bayesian inference for GW lensing with conventional sampling methods is costly, and the problem is exacerbated by the rapidly growing GW catalog. Moreover, assessing the statistical significance of lensed candidates requires thousands, if not millions, of simulations to estimate the background from noise fluctuations and waveform systematics, which is infeasible with standard samplers. We present a novel method, DINGO-lensing, for performing inference on lensed GWs, extending the neural posterior estimation framework DINGO. By comparing our results with those using conventional samplers, we show that the compute time of parameter estimation of lensed GWs can be reduced from weeks to seconds, while preserving accuracy both in the posterior distributions and the evidence ratios. We train our neural networks with LIGO detector noise at design sensitivity and a lens model that accommodates two overlapping images with a constant $\pi/2$ phase shift. We show that the lensing parameters are recovered with millisecond precision for the time delays. We also demonstrate that our network can identify signals diffracted by point masses, highlighting its flexibility for searches. By simulating thousands of lensed and nonlensed events, we determine how the detectability changes with different source properties. DINGO-lensing provides a scalable and efficient avenue for identifying and characterizing gravitationally lensed GW events in the upcoming observing runs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As in thermodynamics, the celebrated first law of black hole mechanics relates infinitesimal changes in the properties of nearby equilibrium states of black holes (without reference to any physical process that causes the transition). The second law is a qualitative statement that the area of an event horizon cannot decrease under appropriate physical assumptions. These laws are generalized. The new first law applies to black holes in general relativity that can be arbitrarily far from equilibrium and refers to \emph{finite} changes that occur due to \emph{physical processes}. The new second law is a \emph{quantitative} statement that relates the change in the dynamical horizon area with the flux of energy falling into the black hole in a physical process.6</description>

      <title>Fast frequency-domain phenomenological modeling of eccentric aligned-spin binary black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the IMRPhenomXE frequency-domain phenomenological waveform model for the dominant mode of inspiral-merger-ringdown non-precessing binary black holes in elliptical orbits. IMRPhenomXE extends the quasi-circular IMRPhenomXAS waveform model for the dominant $(\ell, |m|) =$ (2,2) modes to eccentric binaries. For the inspiral part, orbit-averaged equations of motion within the quasi-Keplerian parametrization up to third post-Newtonian order, including spin effects, are evolved, and the waveform modes are computed using the stationary phase approximation on eccentricity expanded expressions up to $\mathcal{O}(e^{12})$. The model assumes circularization at merger-ringdown, where it adopts the underlying quasicircular IMRPhenomXAS baseline. We show that IMRPhenomXE reduces to the accurate IMPhenomXAS model in the quasi-circular limit. Compared against 186 public numerical relativity waveforms from the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes catalog with initial eccentricities up to $~0.8$, IMRPhenomXE provides values of unfaithfulness below $3\%$ for $72\%$ of simulations with initial eccentricities below 0.4. For larger eccentricities, the unfaithfulness degrades up to $\gtrsim 10\%$ due to the underlying small eccentricity expansions and additional modelling approximations. In terms of speed, IMRPhenomXE outperforms any of the existing inspiral-merger-ringdown eccentric waveform models. We demonstrate the efficiency, robustness, and modularity of IMRPhenomXE through injections into zero noise and parameter-estimation analyses of gravitational-wave events, showing that IMRPhenomXE is a ready-to-use waveform model for gravitational-wave astronomy in the era of rapidly growing event catalogs.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet Behavior of the Wheeler-DeWitt Equation in Horava-Lifshitz Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum structure of black hole interiors in Horava-Lifshitz gravity by analyzing the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in minisuperspace. Focusing on the ultraviolet regime, where higher-order spatial curvature terms dominate, we derive analytical solutions in this UV limit for both the original Horava-Lifshitz action and its analytically continued counterpart. We study their behavior near the event horizon and the classical singularity, with particular attention to the interpretation of the wave function in terms of the annihilation-to-nothing scenario proposed in general relativity. In this paper, we have considered cases in which the two-dimensional spatial section is spherical, planar, or hyperbolic, as well as models with positive, negative, or vanishing cosmological constant. In all cases, we find that the terms dominating in the ultraviolet regime, together with the effects of the running scaling parameter, act to suppress the annihilation-to-nothing behavior. These results suggest that, at least within the range explored in this study, the characteristic annihilation-to-nothing behavior does not appear in the ultraviolet regime of Horava-Lifshitz gravity, and provide a new perspective on the understanding of singularity resolution in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Detecting electromagnetic counterparts to LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA gravitational wave events with DECam: Neutron Star Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13673v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With GW170817 being the only multimessenger gravitational wave (GW) event with an associated kilonova detected so far, there exists a pressing need for realistic estimation of the GW localization uncertainties and rates, as well as optimization of available telescope time to enable the detection of new kilonovae. We simulate GW events assuming a data-driven distribution of binary parameters for the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) fourth and fifth observing runs (O4 and O5). We map the binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) properties to the kilonova optical light curves. We use the simulated population of kilonovae to generate follow-up observing plans, with the primary goal of optimizing detection with the Gravitational Wave Multi-Messenger Astronomy DECam Survey (GW-MMADS). We explore the dependence of kilonova detectability on the mass, distance, inclination, and spin of the binaries. Assuming that no BNS was detected during O4 until the end of 2024, we present updated GW BNS (NSBH) merger detection rates. We expect to detect BNS (NSBH) kilonovae with DECam at a per-year rate of: $0$-$2.0$ ($0$) in O4, and $2.0$-$19$ ($0$-$1.0$) in O5. We expect the majority of BNS detections and also those accompanied by a detectable kilonova to produce a hypermassive NS remnant, with a significant fraction of the remaining BNSs promptly collapsing to a BH. We release GW simulations and depths required to detect kilonovae based on our predictions to support the astronomical community in their multimessenger follow-up campaigns and analyses.</description>

      <title>Reanalyzing DESI DR1: 1. $\Lambda$CDM Constraints from the Power Spectrum and Bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first independent re-analysis of the galaxy clustering data from DESI Data Release 1, utilizing an effective field theory full-shape model. We analyze the power spectra and bispectra of the public catalogs using a custom-built pipeline based on window-deconvolved quasi-optimal estimators, accounting for a number of systematic effects. Compared to the official collaboration analysis, we add the galaxy power spectrum hexadecapole and the bispectrum monopole, and also introduce a novel stochastic estimator for fiber collisions, which facilitates robust bispectrum analyses. As a first application, we perform a full-shape analysis of the DESI power spectra and bispectra in the context of the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM. Using external priors on the physical baryon density and the primordial power spectrum tilt, we constrain the matter density fraction to $\Omega_m=0.284\pm 0.011$, the Hubble constant to $H_0=70.7\pm 1.1$ km/s/Mpc, and the mass fluctuation amplitude to $\sigma_8=0.811\pm 0.030$. The bispectrum sharpens constraints on $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$ by $\approx 10\%$ and shifts $\Omega_m$ by $\approx 1\sigma$ towards the \textit{Planck} $\Lambda$CDM value. Combining our full-shape likelihood with the official DESI DR2 BAO measurements, cosmological parameters shift further towards the \textit{Planck} values, with $\Omega_m=0.296\pm 0.007$, $H_0=68.8\pm 0.6$ km/s/Mpc, $\sigma_8=0.818\pm 0.029$ (with tighter constraints obtained in joint analyses). Similar results are obtained in a joint analysis with DR1 BAO, accounting for the cross-covariance. Finally, the bispectrum data improves measurements of quadratic bias parameters, which are consistent with predictions from halo occupation distribution models. Our work highlights the importance of higher-order statistics and sets the stage for upcoming full-shape analyses of non-minimal cosmological models.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15 yr Data Set: Targeted Searches for Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first targeted searches for continuous gravitational waves (CWs) from 114 active galactic nuclei (AGN) that may host supermassive black hole binaries, using the NANOGrav 15 yr data set. By incorporating electromagnetic priors on sky location, distance, redshift, and CW frequency, our strain and chirp mass upper limits are typically improved by a factor of $\sim 2$ (median 2.2) relative to all-sky limits at the same frequency. Bayesian comparisons against a model including only a Hellings-Downs correlated background disfavors a CW signal for all targets, with a mean Bayes factor of $0.73 \pm 0.32$. Two targets have Bayes factors slightly above unity, but coherence tests, random targeting experiments, and a conservative accounting of the 114-target trials factor all indicate that they are consistent with noise. We use these two candidates as worked examples to illustrate an end-to-end targeted CW search analysis and a suite of follow up tests that future promising candidates would need to pass. We find that the electromagnetic interpretations of both candidates are ambiguous, and we update the constraints on a putative binary in 3C 66B, ruling out part of its previously allowed parameter space. Ultimately, our results demonstrate the current sensitivity of targeted pulsar timing array searches for CWs and define a roadmap for future multimessenger CW detections.</description>

      <title>$SO(1, d + 1)$ symmetry of the Exact RG equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a method for constructing from first principles, a holographic bulk dual action in Euclidean $AdS_{d+1}$ space for a $d$-dimensional Euclidean CFT on the boundary, starting from the Polchinski's Exact Renormalization Group (ERG) equation that describes the RG evolution of the interaction part of the boundary Wilson action. The bulk action in $AdS_{d+1}$ has an $SO(1,d+1)$ symmetry and is obtained from the evolution operator of the Polchinski's ERG equation by a map that involves a field redefinition and requires a $\textit{special}$ form of the UV cutoff function in the ERG equation. In this paper, we show that for $\textit{any form}$ of the cutoff function, the ERG evolution operator has an $SO(1,d+1)$ symmetry. The generators of the special conformal transformation depend on the cutoff function. For the special cutoff function that maps to $AdS$ space, the transformations have the standard form of $AdS$ isometry. We also show that the ERG evolution operator for the $\textit{full}$ Wilson action can be put in the same form as the Polchinski's ERG equation by a field redefinition and consequently also has an $SO(1,d+1)$ symmetry for any cutoff function.</description>

      <title>Relativistic jets from millisecond proto-magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapidly rotating, strongly magnetized neutron stars (``millisecond proto-magnetars'') formed in stellar core-collapse, neutron star mergers, and white dwarf accretion-induced collapse have long been proposed as central engines of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) and accompanying supernovae/kilonovae. However, during the first few seconds after birth, neutrino heating drives baryon-rich winds from the neutron star surface, potentially limiting the magnetization and achievable Lorentz factors of the outflow and casting doubt on whether proto-magnetars can launch ultra-relativistic jets at early times, as needed to power short-duration GRB. We present 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of neutrino-heated proto-magnetar winds that incorporate M0 neutrino transport. While the global wind properties broadly agree with previous analytic estimates calibrated to one-dimensional models, our simulations reveal essential multidimensional effects. For rapidly rotating models with spin periods P = 1 ms, centrifugal forces strongly enhance mass loss near the rotational equator, producing a dense, sub-relativistic outflow ( ~0.1c). This equatorial wind naturally confines and collimates less baryon-loaded outflows emerging from higher latitudes, leading to the formation of a structured bipolar jet with a peak magnetization up to ~ 30-100 along the pole, sufficient to reach bulk Lorentz factors ~ 100 on larger scales. The resulting angular stratification of the outflow energy into ultra-relativistic polar and sub-relativistic equatorial components is broadly consistent with the observed partition between beaming-corrected GRB energies and supernova/kilonova ejecta. Our results demonstrate that millisecond proto-magnetars can launch relativistic jets within seconds of formation and highlight their potential role in powering the diverse electromagnetic counterparts of compact-object explosions.</description>
