      <title>Covariant Lyapunov vectors as global solutions of a partial differential equation on the phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12543v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a new tool to describe the behaviour of a dynamical system, we introduce the concept of "covariant Lyapunov field", i.e. a field which assigns all the components of covariant Lyapunov vectors at almost all points of the phase space. We focus on the case in which these fields are overall continuous and also differentiable along individual trajectories. We show that in ergodic systems such fields can be characterized as the global solutions of a differential equation on the phase space. Due to the arbitrariness in the choice of a multiplicative scalar factor for the Lyapunov vector at each point of the phase space, this differential equation exhibits a gauge invariance that is formally analogous to that of quantum electrodynamics. Under the hypothesis that the covariant Lyapunov field is overall differentiable, we give a geometric interpretation of our result: each 2-dimensional foliation of the space that contains whole trajectories is univocally associated with a Lyapunov exponent, and the corresponding covariant Lyapunov field is one of the generators of the foliation. In order to show with an example how this new approach can be applied to the study of concrete dynamical systems, we display an explicit solution of the differential equations that we have obtained for the covariant Lyapunov fields in a model involving a geodesic flow.</description>

      <title>Magnetodynamics of short nanoparticle chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the understanding and application of nanoparticle assemblies driven by external fields. Although these systems can exhibit marked transitions in behavior compared to non-interacting counterparts, it has often proven challenging to connect their dynamics with underlying physical mechanisms or even to verifiably establish their structure under realistic experimental conditions. We have studied colloidal iron oxide nanoparticles that assemble into ordered, few-particle linear chains under the influence of oscillating and pulsed magnetic fields. In this work, our goal has been to answer the following question: by what physical mechanisms does the magnetic switching of a linear chain evolve from the switching of its constituent particles? Cryo-TEM has been used to flash freeze and image the structures formed by oscillatory drive fields, and magnetic relaxometry has been used to extract the multiple time constants associated with magnetic switching of the short chains. Armed with the physical structure from microscopy and the field-dependent switching times from magnetic measurements, we have conducted extensive micromagnetic simulations, revealing probable physical mechanisms for each time constant regime spanning ~1 microsecond to 1 s in time. These types of magnetic nanomaterials have great potential for biomedical technologies, particularly magnetic particle imaging and hyperthermia, and rigorous elucidation of their physics will hasten their optimization.</description>
