      <title>Urban Density and Equity of Access to Social Services in Australian Urban Areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To measure access to social services (primary health care, early childhood care/education, and public transport), we create a social service access index (SSI) for Australian capital cities. We show that only two, Melbourne and Sydney, have some limited characteristics of a compact or 15-minute city, but only in city centres and inner cities where population densities are highest and have less low density housing types. In the outer suburban and peri-urban areas as well as across all of the remaining cities, proximity to social services is poor and residents suffer the consequences of spatial inequity.</description>

      <title>Reputation assimilation mechanism for sustaining cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Keeping a high reputation, by contributing to common efforts, plays a key role in explaining the evolution of collective cooperation among unrelated agents in a complex society. Nevertheless, it is not necessarily an individual feature, but may also reflect the general state of a local community. Consequently, a person with a high reputation becomes attractive not just because we can expect cooperative acts with higher probability, but also because such a person is involved in a more efficient group venture. These observations highlight the cumulative and socially transmissible nature of reputation. Interestingly, these aspects were completely ignored by previous works. To reveal the possible consequences, we introduce a spatial public goods game in which we use an assimilated reputation simultaneously characterizing the individual and its neighbors' reputation. Furthermore, a reputation-dependent synergy factor is used to capture the high (or low) quality of a specific group. Through extensive numerical simulations, we investigate how cooperation and extended reputation co-evolve, thereby revealing the dynamic influence of the assimilated reputation mechanism on the emergence and persistence of cooperation. By fostering social learning from high-reputation individuals and granting payoff advantages to high-reputation groups via an adaptive multiplier, the assimilated reputation mechanism promotes cooperation, ultimately to the systemic level.</description>

      <title>Population-mobility coevolution drives spatial heterogeneity of cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial heterogeneity of cities -- the uneven distribution of population and activities -- is fundamental to urban dynamics and related to critical issues such as infrastructure overload, housing affordability, and social inequality. Despite sharing similar scaling laws of population and mobility, cities exhibit vastly different spatial patterns. This paradox call for a mechanistic explanation for the emergence of spatial heterogeneity, while existing qualitative or descriptive studies fail to capture the underlying mechanisms. Here, we propose a coupled dynamical model that describe the intra-city population-mobility coevolution, explaining spatial heterogeneity as an emergent outcome of mutual feedback between the fast-changing mobility and the slow-adapting population. Our model is validated on over 388 million records from eight diverse global cities, successfully reproduces both the statistical laws and realistic spatial patterns. We find out realistic heterogeneity emerges as a distinct stable state, intermediate between disordered homogeneity and unsustainable super-hub dominance. Moreover, we theoretically and empirically show that populated areas are predominantly shaped by coevolution strength, while the increasing distance decay leads cities through a three-phase transition of homogeneity-heterogeneity-homogeneity. Besides, functional attractiveness between areas consistently enhances the ordered heterogeneous structure. Simulations of real-world planning scenarios -- including crisis-induced lockdown, planned zone expansions, and dispersal from congested centers -- indicate that integrated population-mobility policies are more cost-effective than single interventions. Our model can provides mechanistic, high-resolution insights to rigorously inform policy design.</description>

      <title>Regret, Uncertainty, and Bounded Rationality in Norm-Driven Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces an agent-based model that explains how regret, uncertainty, and social norms interact to shape vaccination behavior during epidemics. The model integrates three behavioral mechanisms, anticipated regret, evolving norms, and uncertainty-dependent trust, within a unified learning framework. Grounded in psychology and behavioral economics, it captures how individuals make probabilistic choices influenced by material payoffs, fear, trust, and social approval. Simulations of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered process show that collective outcomes are best when agents display an intermediate level of rationality; they deliberate enough to respond to risk but remain flexible enough to adapt, avoiding the instability of both random and overly rigid decision-making. Regret exerts a dual influence; moderate levels encourage adaptive self-correction, while excessive regret or greed destabilize choices. Uncertainty has a similarly non-linear effect; moderate ambiguity promotes caution, but too much uncertainty disrupts coordination. Social norms restore cooperation by compensating for incomplete information. Among them, personal norms drive behavior when individuals have clear information and moral confidence; injunctive norms, reflecting perceived approval, gain influence under uncertainty; and descriptive norms, based on observing others' actions, serve as informational cues that guide behavior when direct knowledge is limited. Overall, the model provides a psychologically grounded, computationally explicit account of how emotion, cognition, and social norms govern preventive behavior during epidemics.</description>

      <title>On the design of a profession-oriented course on Theoretical Mechanics for physics education students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a profession-oriented course we offered at the University of Vienna, aimed at physics education teacher students. The course on Theoretical Classical Mechanics has been conceived and designed from its outset with the explicit goal of bridging the gap between the abstract, mathematical notions employed in Theoretical Physics with the concrete future needs of prospective teachers in their profession. We aimed at countering both the negative attitudes of students towards Theoretical Physics and the interrelated skepticism of professors regarding the students mathematical proficiency. Our main findings are that these goals can indeed be achieved through a careful selection of course material and the associated mathematical tools, by closely interwoven lecture topics and exercises, and thorough planning according to principles for high-school teaching known from science education research. Establishing close connections between the material taught in the course and the students future occupation as high-school teachers has proven to be of utmost importance. This is possible without any sacrifice of mathematical rigor or of the quality of Physics presented.</description>
