      <title>Emerging Threats and Countermeasures in Neuromorphic Systems: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing mimics brain-inspired mechanisms through spiking neurons and energy-efficient processing, offering a pathway to efficient in-memory computing (IMC). However, these advancements raise critical security and privacy concerns. As the adoption of bio-inspired architectures and memristive devices increases, so does the urgency to assess the vulnerability of these emerging technologies to hardware and software attacks. Emerging architectures introduce new attack surfaces, particularly due to asynchronous, event-driven processing and stochastic device behavior. The integration of memristors into neuromorphic hardware and software implementations in spiking neural networks offers diverse possibilities for advanced computing architectures, including their role in security-aware applications. This survey systematically analyzes the security landscape of neuromorphic systems, covering attack methodologies, side-channel vulnerabilities, and countermeasures. We focus on both hardware and software concerns relevant to spiking neural networks (SNNs) and hardware primitives, such as Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) and True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) for cryptographic and secure computation applications. We approach this analysis from diverse perspectives, from attack methodologies to countermeasure strategies that integrate efficiency and protection in brain-inspired hardware. This review not only maps the current landscape of security threats but provides a foundation for developing secure and trustworthy neuromorphic architectures.</description>

      <title>Adoption of Generative Artificial Intelligence in the German Software Engineering Industry: An Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools have seen rapid adoption among software developers. While adoption rates in the industry are rising, the underlying factors influencing the effective use of these tools, including the depth of interaction, organizational constraints, and experience-related considerations, have not been thoroughly investigated. This issue is particularly relevant in environments with stringent regulatory requirements, such as Germany, where practitioners must address the GDPR and the EU AI Act while balancing productivity gains with intellectual property considerations. Despite the significant impact of GenAI on software engineering, to the best of our knowledge, no empirical study has systematically examined the adoption dynamics of GenAI tools within the German context. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive mixed-methods study on GenAI adoption among German software engineers. Specifically, we conducted 18 exploratory interviews with practitioners, followed by a developer survey with 109 participants. We analyze patterns of tool adoption, prompting strategies, and organizational factors that influence effectiveness. Our results indicate that experience level moderates the perceived benefits of GenAI tools, and productivity gains are not evenly distributed among developers. Further, organizational size affects both tool selection and the intensity of tool use. Limited awareness of the project context is identified as the most significant barrier. We summarize a set of actionable implications for developers, organizations, and tool vendors seeking to advance artificial intelligence (AI) assisted software development.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping, autonomous testing, and initialization system for Si/Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$ multi-quantum-dot devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07676v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dot (QD) devices have become central to advancements in spin-based quantum computing. However, the increasing complexity of modern QD devices makes calibration and control -- particularly at elevated temperatures -- a bottleneck to progress, highlighting the need for robust and scalable autonomous solutions. A major hurdle arises from trapped charges within the oxide layers, which induce random offset voltage shifts on gate electrodes, with a standard deviation of approximately 83 mV of variation within state-of-the-art present-day devices. Efficient characterization and tuning of large arrays of QD qubits depend on choices of automated protocols. Here, we introduce a physically intuitive framework for a bootstrapping, autonomous testing, and initialization system (BATIS) designed to streamline QD device evaluation and calibration. BATIS navigates high-dimensional gate voltage spaces, automating essential steps such as leakage testing, formation of all current channels, and gate characterization in the presence of trapped charges. For forming the current channels, BATIS follows a non-standard approach that requires a single set of measurements regardless of the number of channels. Demonstrated at 1.3 K on a quad-QD Si/Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$ device, BATIS eliminates the need for deep cryogenic environments during initial device diagnostics, significantly enhancing scalability and reducing setup times. By requiring only minimal prior knowledge of the device architecture, BATIS represents a platform-agnostic solution, adaptable to various QD systems, which bridges a critical gap in QD autotuning.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking LLMs for Political Science: A United Nations Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in natural language processing, yet their potential for high-stake political decision-making remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses the gap by focusing on the application of LLMs to the United Nations (UN) decision-making process, where the stakes are particularly high and political decisions can have far-reaching consequences. We introduce a novel dataset comprising publicly available UN Security Council (UNSC) records from 1994 to 2024, including draft resolutions, voting records, and diplomatic speeches. Using this dataset, we propose the United Nations Benchmark (UNBench), the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs across four interconnected political science tasks: co-penholder judgment, representative voting simulation, draft adoption prediction, and representative statement generation. These tasks span the three stages of the UN decision-making process--drafting, voting, and discussing--and aim to assess LLMs' ability to understand and simulate political dynamics. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the potential and challenges of applying LLMs in this domain, providing insights into their strengths and limitations in political science. This work contributes to the growing intersection of AI and political science, opening new avenues for research and practical applications in global governance.

      <title>Addressing the Minor-Embedding Problem in Quantum Annealing and Evaluating State-of-the-Art Algorithm Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13376v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the minor-embedding problem, which involves mapping the variables of an Ising model onto a quantum annealing processor. The primary motivation stems from the observed performance disparity of quantum annealers when solving problems suited to the processor's architecture versus those with non-hardware-native topologies. Our research has two main objectives: i) to analyze the impact of embedding quality on the performance of D-Wave Systems quantum annealers, and ii) to evaluate the quality of the embeddings generated by Minorminer, the standard minor-embedding technique in the quantum annealing literature, provided by D-Wave. Regarding the first objective, our experiments reveal a clear correlation between the average chain length of embeddings and the relative errors of the solutions sampled. This underscores the critical influence of embedding quality on quantum annealing performance. For the second objective, we evaluate Minorminer's embedding capabilities, the quality and robustness of its embeddings, and its execution-time performance on Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs. We also compare its performance with Clique Embedding, another algorithm developed by D-Wave, which is deterministic and designed to embed fully connected Ising models into quantum annealing processors, serving as a worst-case scenario. The results demonstrate that there is significant room for improvement for Minorminer, suggesting that more effective embedding strategies could lead to meaningful gains in quantum annealing performance.</description>

      <title>Extractive summarization on a CMOS Ising machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extractive summarization (ES) aims to generate a concise summary by selecting a subset of sentences from a document while maximizing relevance and minimizing redundancy. Although modern ES systems achieve high accuracy using powerful neural models, their deployment typically relies on CPU or GPU infrastructures that are energy-intensive and poorly suited for real-time inference in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we explore the feasibility of implementing McDonald-style extractive summarization on a low-power CMOS coupled oscillator-based Ising machine (COBI) that supports integer-valued, all-to-all spin couplings. We first propose a hardware-aware Ising formulation that reduces the scale imbalance between local fields and coupling terms, thereby improving robustness to coefficient quantization: this method can be applied to any problem formulation that requires k of n variables to be chosen. We then develop a complete ES pipeline including (i) stochastic rounding and iterative refinement to compensate for precision loss, and (ii) a decomposition strategy that partitions a large ES problem into smaller Ising subproblems that can be efficiently solved on COBI and later combined. Experimental results on the CNN/DailyMail dataset show that our pipeline can produce high-quality summaries using only integer-coupled Ising hardware with limited precision. COBI achieves 3-4.5x runtime speedups compared to a brute-force method, which is comparable to software Tabu search, and two to three orders of magnitude reductions in energy, while maintaining competitive summary quality. These results highlight the potential of deploying CMOS Ising solvers for real-time, low-energy text summarization on edge devices.</description>
