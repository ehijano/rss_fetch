      <title>The Impact of a Chatbot's Ephemerality-Framing on Self-Disclosure Perceptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-disclosure, the sharing of one's thoughts and feelings, is affected by the perceived relationship between individuals. While chatbots are increasingly used for self-disclosure, the impact of a chatbot's framing on users' self-disclosure remains under-explored. We investigated how a chatbot's description of its relationship with users, particularly in terms of ephemerality, affects self-disclosure. Specifically, we compared a Familiar chatbot, presenting itself as a companion remembering past interactions, with a Stranger chatbot, presenting itself as a new, unacquainted entity in each conversation. In a mixed factorial design, participants engaged with either the Familiar or Stranger chatbot in two sessions across two days, with one conversation focusing on Emotional- and another Factual-disclosure. When Emotional-disclosure was sought in the first chatting session, Stranger-condition participants felt more comfortable self-disclosing. However, when Factual-disclosure was sought first, these differences were replaced by more enjoyment among Familiar-condition participants. Qualitative findings showed Stranger afforded anonymity and reduced judgement, whereas Familiar sometimes felt intrusive unless rapport was built via low-risk Factual-disclosure.</description>

      <title>HOT-FIT-BR: A Context-Aware Evaluation Framework for Digital Health Systems in Resource-Limited Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implementation of digital health systems in low-middle-income countries (LMICs) often fails due to a lack of evaluations that take into account infrastructure limitations, local policies, and community readiness. We introduce HOT-FIT-BR, a contextual evaluation framework that expands the HOT-FIT model with three new dimensions: (1) Infrastructure Index to measure electricity/internet availability, (2) Policy Compliance Layer to ensure regulatory compliance (e.g., Permenkes 24/2022 in Indonesia), and (3) Community Engagement Fit. Simulations at Indonesian Health Centers show that HOT-FIT-BR is 58% more sensitive to detecting problems than HOT-FIT, especially in rural areas with an Infra Index &lt;3. The framework has also proven adaptive to the context of other LMICs such as India and Kenya through local parameter adjustments.</description>

      <title>Institutionalizing Folk Theories of Algorithms: How Multi-Channel Networks (MCNs) Govern Algorithmic Labor in Chinese Live-Streaming Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As algorithmic systems increasingly structure platform labor, workers often rely on informal "folk theories", experience-based beliefs about how algorithms work, to navigate opaque and unstable algorithmic environments. Prior research has largely treated these theories as bottom-up, peer-driven strategies for coping with algorithmic opacity and uncertainty. In this study, we shift analytical attention to intermediary organizations and examine how folk theories of algorithms can be institutionally constructed and operationalized by those organizations as tools of labor management. Drawing on nine months of ethnographic fieldwork and 37 interviews with live-streamers and staff at Multi-Channel Networks (MCNs) in China, we show that MCNs develop and circulate dual algorithmic theories: internally, they acknowledge the volatility of platform systems and adopt probabilistic strategies to manage risk; externally, they promote simplified, prescriptive theories portraying the algorithm as transparent, fair, and responsive to individual effort. They have further operationalize those folk theories for labor management, encouraging streamers to self-discipline and invest in equipment, training, and routines, while absolving MCNs of accountability. We contribute to CSCW and platform labor literature by demonstrating how informal algorithmic knowledge, once institutionalized, can become infrastructures of soft control -- shaping not only how workers interpret platform algorithms, but also how their labor is structured, moralized and governed.</description>

      <title>Can we Debias Social Stereotypes in AI-Generated Images? Examining Text-to-Image Outputs and User Perceptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have enabled visual content creation through text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, despite their creative potential, T2I models often replicate and amplify societal stereotypes -- particularly those related to gender, race, and culture -- raising important ethical concerns. This paper proposes a theory-driven bias detection rubric and a Social Stereotype Index (SSI) to systematically evaluate social biases in T2I outputs. We audited three major T2I model outputs -- DALL-E-3, Midjourney-6.1, and Stability AI Core -- using 100 queries across three categories -- geocultural, occupational, and adjectival. Our analysis reveals that initial outputs are prone to include stereotypical visual cues, including gendered professions, cultural markers, and western beauty norms. To address this, we adopted our rubric to conduct targeted prompt refinement using LLMs, which significantly reduced bias -- SSI dropped by 61% for geocultural, 69% for occupational, and 51% for adjectival queries. We complemented our quantitative analysis through a user study examining perceptions, awareness, and preferences around AI-generated biased imagery. Our findings reveal a key tension -- although prompt refinement can mitigate stereotypes, it can limit contextual alignment. Interestingly, users often perceived stereotypical images to be more aligned with their expectations. We discuss the need to balance ethical debiasing with contextual relevance and call for T2I systems that support global diversity and inclusivity while not compromising the reflection of real-world social complexity.</description>

      <title>Automating eHMI Action Design with LLMs for Automated Vehicle Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The absence of explicit communication channels between automated vehicles (AVs) and other road users requires the use of external Human-Machine Interfaces (eHMIs) to convey messages effectively in uncertain scenarios. Currently, most eHMI studies employ predefined text messages and manually designed actions to perform these messages, which limits the real-world deployment of eHMIs, where adaptability in dynamic scenarios is essential. Given the generalizability and versatility of large language models (LLMs), they could potentially serve as automated action designers for the message-action design task. To validate this idea, we make three contributions: (1) We propose a pipeline that integrates LLMs and 3D renderers, using LLMs as action designers to generate executable actions for controlling eHMIs and rendering action clips. (2) We collect a user-rated Action-Design Scoring dataset comprising a total of 320 action sequences for eight intended messages and four representative eHMI modalities. The dataset validates that LLMs can translate intended messages into actions close to a human level, particularly for reasoning-enabled LLMs. (3) We introduce two automated raters, Action Reference Score (ARS) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), to benchmark 18 LLMs, finding that the VLM aligns with human preferences yet varies across eHMI modalities.</description>

      <title>What Shapes Writers' Decisions to Disclose AI Use?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Have you ever read a blog or social media post and suspected that it was written--at least in part--by artificial intelligence (AI)? While transparently acknowledging contributors to writing is generally valued, why some writers choose to disclose or withhold AI involvement remains unclear. In this work, we ask what factors shape writers' decisions to disclose their AI use as a starting point to effectively advocate for transparency. To shed light on this question, we synthesize study findings and theoretical frameworks in human-AI interaction and behavioral science. Concretely, we identify and curate a list of factors that could affect writers' decisions regarding disclosure for human-AI co-created content.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Wearable Tap Water Audio Detection through Subclass Annotation in the HD-Epic Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable human activity recognition has been shown to benefit from the inclusion of acoustic data, as the sounds around a person often contain valuable context. However, due to privacy concerns, it is usually not ethically feasible to record and save microphone data from the device, since the audio could, for instance, also contain private conversations. Rather, the data should be processed locally, which in turn requires processing power and consumes energy on the wearable device. One special use case of contextual information that can be utilized to augment special tasks in human activity recognition is water flow detection, which can, e.g., be used to aid wearable hand washing detection. We created a new label called tap water for the recently released HD-Epic data set, creating 717 hand-labeled annotations of tap water flow, based on existing annotations of the water class. We analyzed the relation of tap water and water in the dataset and additionally trained and evaluated two lightweight classifiers to evaluate the newly added label class, showing that the new class can be learned more easily.</description>

      <title>Describe Me Something You Do Not Remember - Challenges and Risks of Exposure Design Using Generative Artificial Intelligence for Therapy of Complex Post-traumatic Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with sudden, uncontrollable, and intense flashbacks of traumatic memories. Trauma exposure psychotherapy has proven effective in reducing the severity of trauma-related symptoms. It involves controlled recall of traumatic memories to train coping mechanisms for flashbacks and enable autobiographical integration of distressing experiences. In particular, exposure to visualizations of these memories supports successful recall. Although this approach is effective for various trauma types, it remains available for only a few. This is due to the lack of cost-efficient solutions for creating individualized exposure visualizations. This issue is particularly relevant for the treatment of Complex PTSD (CPTSD), where traumatic memories are highly individual and generic visualizations do not meet therapeutic needs. Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) offers a flexible and cost-effective alternative. GAI enables the creation of individualized exposure visualizations during therapy and, for the first time, allows patients to actively participate in the visualization process. While GAI opens new therapeutic perspectives and may improve access to trauma therapy, especially for CPTSD, it also introduces significant challenges and risks. The extreme uncertainty and lack of control that define both CPTSD and GAI raise concerns about feasibility and safety. To support safe and effective three-way communication, it is essential to understand the roles of patient, system, and therapist in exposure visualization and how each can contribute to safety. This paper outlines perspectives, challenges, and risks associated with the use of GAI in trauma therapy, with a focus on CPTSD.</description>

      <title>Imago Obscura: An Image Privacy AI Co-pilot to Enable Identification and Mitigation of Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Users often struggle to navigate the privacy / publicity boundary in sharing images online: they may lack awareness of image privacy risks and/or the ability to apply effective mitigation strategies. To address this challenge, we introduce and evaluate Imago Obscura, an AI-powered, image-editing copilot that enables users to identify and mitigate privacy risks with images they intend to share. Driven by design requirements from a formative user study with 7 image-editing experts, Imago Obscura enables users to articulate their image-sharing intent and privacy concerns. The system uses these inputs to surface contextually pertinent privacy risks, and then recommends and facilitates application of a suite of obfuscation techniques found to be effective in prior literature -- e.g., inpainting, blurring, and generative content replacement. We evaluated Imago Obscura with 15 end-users in a lab study and found that it greatly improved users' awareness of image privacy risks and their ability to address those risks, allowing them to make more informed sharing decisions.</description>

      <title>Creativity in LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-driven multi-agent systems (MAS) are transforming how humans and AIs collaboratively generate ideas and artifacts. While existing surveys provide comprehensive overviews of MAS infrastructures, they largely overlook the dimension of \emph{creativity}, including how novel outputs are generated and evaluated, how creativity informs agent personas, and how creative workflows are coordinated. This is the first survey dedicated to creativity in MAS. We focus on text and image generation tasks, and present: (1) a taxonomy of agent proactivity and persona design; (2) an overview of generation techniques, including divergent exploration, iterative refinement, and collaborative synthesis, as well as relevant datasets and evaluation metrics; and (3) a discussion of key challenges, such as inconsistent evaluation standards, insufficient bias mitigation, coordination conflicts, and the lack of unified benchmarks. This survey offers a structured framework and roadmap for advancing the development, evaluation, and standardization of creative MAS.</description>

      <title>Learning Annotation Consensus for Continuous Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In affective computing, datasets often contain multiple annotations from different annotators, which may lack full agreement. Typically, these annotations are merged into a single gold standard label, potentially losing valuable inter-rater variability. We propose a multi-annotator training approach for continuous emotion recognition (CER) that seeks a consensus across all annotators rather than relying on a single reference label. Our method employs a consensus network to aggregate annotations into a unified representation, guiding the main arousal-valence predictor to better reflect collective inputs. Tested on the RECOLA and COGNIMUSE datasets, our approach outperforms traditional methods that unify annotations into a single label. This underscores the benefits of fully leveraging multi-annotator data in emotion recognition and highlights its applicability across various fields where annotations are abundant yet inconsistent.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Vision from EEG Brain Recordings: How much does EEG know?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing and understanding dynamic visual information (video) from brain EEG recordings is challenging due to the non-stationary nature of EEG signals, their low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the limited availability of EEG-Video stimulus datasets. Most recent studies have focused on reconstructing static images from EEG recordings. In this work, we propose a framework to reconstruct dynamic visual stimuli from EEG data and conduct an in-depth study of the information encoded in EEG signals. Our approach first trains a feature extraction network using a triplet-based contrastive learning strategy within an EEG-video generation framework. The extracted EEG features are then used for video synthesis with a modified StyleGAN-ADA, which incorporates temporal information as conditioning. Additionally, we analyze how different brain regions contribute to processing dynamic visual stimuli. Through several empirical studies, we evaluate the effectiveness of our framework and investigate how much dynamic visual information can be inferred from EEG signals. The inferences we derive through our extensive studies would be of immense value to future research on extracting visual dynamics from EEG.</description>

      <title>The EU AI Act, Stakeholder Needs, and Explainable AI: Aligning Regulatory Compliance in a Clinical Decision Support System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is a promising solution to ensure compliance with the EU AI Act, the first multi-national regulation for AI. XAI aims to enhance transparency and human oversight of AI systems, particularly ``black-box models'', which are criticized as incomprehensible. However, the discourse around the main stakeholders in the AI Act and XAI appears disconnected. While XAI prioritizes the end user's needs as the primary goal, the AI Act focuses on the obligations of the provider and deployer of the AI system. We aim to bridge this divide and provide guidance on how these two worlds are related. By fostering an interdisciplinary discussion in a cross-functional team with XAI, AI Act, legal, and requirements engineering experts, we walk through the steps necessary to analyze an AI-based clinical decision support system to clarify the end-user needs and assess AI Act applicability. By analyzing our justified understanding using an AI system under development as a case, we show that XAI techniques can fill a gap between stakeholder needs and the requirements of the AI Act. We look at the similarities and contrasts between the legal requirements and the needs of stakeholders. In doing so, we encourage researchers and practitioners from the XAI community to reflect on their role towards the AI Act by achieving a mutual understanding of the implications of XAI and the AI Act within different disciplines.</description>

      <title>Challenges for artificial cognitive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The declared goal of this paper is to fill this gap: "... cognitive systems research needs questions or challenges that define progress. The challenges are not (yet more) predictions of the future, but a guideline to what are the aims and what would constitute progress." -- the quotation being from the project description of EUCogII, the project for the European Network for Cognitive Systems within which this formulation of the 'challenges' was originally developed (http://www.eucognition.org). So, we stick out our neck and formulate the challenges for artificial cognitive systems. These challenges are articulated in terms of a definition of what a cognitive system is: a system that learns from experience and uses its acquired knowledge (both declarative and practical) in a flexible manner to achieve its own goals.</description>

Abstract: Smart microscopy represents a paradigm shift in biological imaging, moving from passive observation tools to active collaborators in scientific inquiry. Enabled by advances in automation, computational power, and artificial intelligence, these systems are now capable of adaptive decision-making and real-time experimental control. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework that reconceptualizes smart microscopy as a partner in scientific investigation. Central to our framework is the concept of the 'epistemic-empirical divide' in cellular investigation-the gap between what is observable (empirical domain) and what must be understood (epistemic domain). We propose six core design principles: epistemic-empirical awareness, hierarchical context integration, an evolution from detection to perception, adaptive measurement frameworks, narrative synthesis capabilities, and cross-contextual reasoning. Together, these principles guide a multi-agent architecture designed to align empirical observation with the goals of scientific understanding. Our framework provides a roadmap for building microscopy systems that go beyond automation to actively support hypothesis generation, insight discovery, and theory development, redefining the role of scientific instruments in the process of knowledge creation.</description>

      <title>A Dashboard Approach to Monitoring Mpox-Related Discourse and Misinformation on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mpox (formerly monkeypox) is a zoonotic disease caused by an orthopoxvirus closely related to variola and remains a significant global public health concern. During outbreaks, social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) can both inform and misinform the public, complicating efforts to convey accurate health information. To support local response efforts, we developed a researcher-focused dashboard for use by public health stakeholders and the public that enables searching and visualizing mpox-related tweets through an interactive interface. Following the CDC's designation of mpox as an emerging virus in August 2024, our dashboard recorded a marked increase in tweet volume compared to 2023, illustrating the rapid spread of health discourse across digital platforms. These findings underscore the continued need for real-time social media monitoring tools to support public health communication and track evolving sentiment and misinformation trends at the local level.</description>

      <title>How Do Experts Make Sense of Integrated Process Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A range of integrated modeling approaches have been developed to enable a holistic representation of business process logic together with all relevant business rules. These approaches address inherent problems with separate documentation of business process models and business rules. In this study, we explore how expert process workers make sense of the information provided through such integrated modeling approaches. To do so, we complement verbal protocol analysis with eye-tracking metrics to reveal nuanced user behaviours involved in the main phases of sensemaking, namely information foraging and information processing. By studying expert process workers engaged in tasks based on integrated modeling of business processes and rules, we provide insights that pave the way for a better understanding of sensemaking practices and improved development of business process and business rule integration approaches. Our research underscores the importance of offering personalized support mechanisms that increase the efficacy and efficiency of sensemaking practices for process knowledge workers.</description>

      <title>Supervised Contrastive Learning for Ordinal Engagement Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Student engagement plays a crucial role in the successful delivery of educational programs. Automated engagement measurement helps instructors monitor student participation, identify disengagement, and adapt their teaching strategies to enhance learning outcomes effectively. This paper identifies two key challenges in this problem: class imbalance and incorporating order into engagement levels rather than treating it as mere categories. Then, a novel approach to video-based student engagement measurement in virtual learning environments is proposed that utilizes supervised contrastive learning for ordinal classification of engagement. Various affective and behavioral features are extracted from video samples and utilized to train ordinal classifiers within a supervised contrastive learning framework (with a sequential classifier as the encoder). A key step involves the application of diverse time-series data augmentation techniques to these feature vectors, enhancing model training. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated using a publicly available dataset for engagement measurement, DAiSEE, containing videos of students who participated in virtual learning programs. The results demonstrate the robust ability of the proposed method for the classification of the engagement level. This approach promises a significant contribution to understanding and enhancing student engagement in virtual learning environments.</description>

      <title>SELF-PERCEPT: Introspection Improves Large Language Models' Detection of Multi-Person Mental Manipulation in Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mental manipulation is a subtle yet pervasive form of abuse in interpersonal communication, making its detection critical for safeguarding potential victims. However, due to manipulation's nuanced and context-specific nature, identifying manipulative language in complex, multi-turn, and multi-person conversations remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs). To address this gap, we introduce the MultiManip dataset, comprising 220 multi-turn, multi-person dialogues balanced between manipulative and non-manipulative interactions, all drawn from reality shows that mimic real-world scenarios. For manipulative interactions, it includes 11 distinct manipulations depicting real-life scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Llama-3.1-8B, employing various prompting strategies. Despite their capabilities, these models often struggle to detect manipulation effectively. To overcome this limitation, we propose SELF-PERCEPT, a novel, two-stage prompting framework inspired by Self-Perception Theory, demonstrating strong performance in detecting multi-person, multi-turn mental manipulation. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/danushkhanna/self-percept .</description>

      <title>System-driven Cloud Architecture Design Support with Structured State Management and Guided Decision Assistance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cloud architecture design is a complex process requiring both technical expertise and architectural knowledge to develop solutions from frequently ambiguous requirements. We present CloudArchitectBuddy, a system-driven cloud architecture design support application with two key mechanisms: (1) structured state management that enhances design understanding through explicit representation of requirements and architectural decisions, and (2) guided decision assistance that facilitates design progress through proactive verification and requirement refinement. Our study with 16 industry practitioners showed that while our approach achieved comparable design quality to a chat interface, participants rated our system higher for usability and appreciated its ability to help understand architectural relationships and identify missing requirements. However, participants also expressed a need for user-initiated interactions where they could freely provide design instructions and engage in detailed discussions with LLMs. These results suggest that integrating a chat interface into our structured and guided workflow approach would create a more practical solution, balancing systematic design support with conversational flexibility for comprehensive cloud architecture development.</description>

      <title>DeepConvContext: A Multi-Scale Approach to Timeseries Classification in Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite recognized limitations in modeling long-range temporal dependencies, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has traditionally relied on a sliding window approach to segment labeled datasets. Deep learning models like the DeepConvLSTM typically classify each window independently, thereby restricting learnable temporal context to within-window information. To address this constraint, we propose DeepConvContext, a multi-scale time series classification framework for HAR. Drawing inspiration from the vision-based Temporal Action Localization community, DeepConvContext models both intra- and inter-window temporal patterns by processing sequences of time-ordered windows. Unlike recent HAR models that incorporate attention mechanisms, DeepConvContext relies solely on LSTMs -- with ablation studies demonstrating the superior performance of LSTMs over attention-based variants for modeling inertial sensor data. Across six widely-used HAR benchmarks, DeepConvContext achieves an average 10% improvement in F1-score over the classic DeepConvLSTM, with gains of up to 21%. Code to reproduce our experiments is publicly available via github.com/mariusbock/context_har.</description>

      <title>Humble AI in the real-world: the case of algorithmic hiring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humble AI (Knowles et al., 2023) argues for cautiousness in AI development and deployments through scepticism (accounting for limitations of statistical learning), curiosity (accounting for unexpected outcomes), and commitment (accounting for multifaceted values beyond performance). We present a real-world case study for humble AI in the domain of algorithmic hiring. Specifically, we evaluate virtual screening algorithms in a widely used hiring platform that matches candidates to job openings. There are several challenges in misrecognition and stereotyping in such contexts that are difficult to assess through standard fairness and trust frameworks; e.g., someone with a non-traditional background is less likely to rank highly. We demonstrate technical feasibility of how humble AI principles can be translated to practice through uncertainty quantification of ranks, entropy estimates, and a user experience that highlights algorithmic unknowns. We describe preliminary discussions with focus groups made up of recruiters. Future user studies seek to evaluate whether the higher cognitive load of a humble AI system fosters a climate of trust in its outcomes.</description>

      <title>Label Leakage in Federated Inertial-based Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While prior work has shown that Federated Learning updates can leak sensitive information, label reconstruction attacks, which aim to recover input labels from shared gradients, have not yet been examined in the context of Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Given the sensitive nature of activity labels, this study evaluates the effectiveness of state-of-the-art gradient-based label leakage attacks on HAR benchmark datasets. Our findings show that the number of activity classes, sampling strategy, and class imbalance are critical factors influencing the extent of label leakage, with reconstruction accuracies reaching up to 90% on two benchmark datasets, even for trained models. Moreover, we find that Local Differential Privacy techniques such as gradient noise and clipping offer only limited protection, as certain attacks still reliably infer both majority and minority class labels. We conclude by offering practical recommendations for the privacy-aware deployment of federated HAR systems and identify open challenges for future research. Code to reproduce our experiments is publicly available via github.com/mariusbock/leakage_har.</description>

      <title>Racism, Resistance, and Reddit: How Popular Culture Sparks Online Reckonings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines how Reddit users engaged with the racial narratives of Lovecraft Country and Watchmen, two television series that reimagine historical racial trauma. Drawing on narrative persuasion and multistep flow theory, we analyze 3,879 Reddit comments using topic modeling and critical discourse analysis. We identify three dynamic social roles advocates, adversaries, and adaptives and explore how users move between them in response to racial discourse. Findings reveal how Reddits pseudonymous affordances shape role fluidity, opinion leadership, and moral engagement. While adversaries minimized or rejected racism as exaggerated, advocates shared standpoint experiences and historical resources to challenge these claims. Adaptive users shifted perspectives over time, demonstrating how online publics can foster critical racial learning. This research highlights how popular culture and participatory platforms intersect in shaping collective meaning making around race and historical memory.</description>

Abstract: What if digital fabrication waste could observe the world? What would they see? What would they say? "THE WASTIVE" reimagines digital fabrication waste as sentient observers, giving them a poetic voice through interactive art. As viewers approach, the installation awakens, mimicking the rhythmic ebb and flow of ocean waves - a silent dialogue where discarded materials "observe" and respond to human presence. These interactions echo the gentle murmurs of the sea, transforming technological residue into a reflective, sensory experience. Through this artistic contemplation, "THE WASTIVE" invites audiences to reconsider their creative processes and consumption habits. It serves as a poetic call for more mindful, sustainable practices, provoking deeper reflections on our interconnectedness with the environment.</description>

      <title>Evaluating LLM Adaptation to Sociodemographic Factors: User Profile vs. Dialogue History</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective engagement by large language models (LLMs) requires adapting responses to users' sociodemographic characteristics, such as age, occupation, and education level. While many real-world applications leverage dialogue history for contextualization, existing evaluations of LLMs' behavioral adaptation often focus on single-turn prompts. In this paper, we propose a framework to evaluate LLM adaptation when attributes are introduced either (1) explicitly via user profiles in the prompt or (2) implicitly through multi-turn dialogue history. We assess the consistency of model behavior across these modalities. Using a multi-agent pipeline, we construct a synthetic dataset pairing dialogue histories with distinct user profiles and employ questions from the Value Survey Module (VSM 2013) (Hofstede and Hofstede, 2016) to probe value expression. Our findings indicate that most models adjust their expressed values in response to demographic changes, particularly in age and education level, but consistency varies. Models with stronger reasoning capabilities demonstrate greater alignment, indicating the importance of reasoning in robust sociodemographic adaptation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating novel research ideas. However, these ideas often face challenges related to feasibility and expected effectiveness. This paper explores how augmenting LLMs with relevant data during the idea generation process can enhance the quality of generated ideas. We introduce two ways of incorporating data: (1) providing metadata during the idea generation stage to guide LLMs toward feasible directions, and (2) adding automatic validation during the idea selection stage to assess the empirical plausibility of hypotheses within ideas. We conduct experiments in the social science domain, specifically with climate negotiation topics, and find that metadata improves the feasibility of generated ideas by 20%, while automatic validation improves the overall quality of selected ideas by 7%. A human study shows that LLM-generated ideas, along with their related data and validation processes, inspire researchers to propose research ideas with higher quality. Our work highlights the potential of data-driven research idea generation, and underscores the practical utility of LLM-assisted ideation in real-world academic settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: College students are increasingly affected by stress, anxiety, and depression, yet face barriers to traditional mental health care. This study evaluated the efficacy of a mobile health (mHealth) intervention, Mental Health Evaluation and Lookout Program (mHELP), which integrates a smartwatch sensor and machine learning (ML) algorithms for real-time stress detection and self-management. In a 12-week randomized controlled trial (n = 117), participants were assigned to a treatment group using mHELP's full suite of interventions or a control group using the app solely for real-time stress logging and weekly psychological assessments. The primary outcome, "Moments of Stress" (MS), was assessed via physiological and self-reported indicators and analyzed using Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) approaches. Similarly, secondary outcomes of psychological assessments, including the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) for anxiety, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) for depression, and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), were also analyzed via GLMM. The finding of the objective measure, MS, indicates a substantial decrease in MS among the treatment group compared to the control group, while no notable between-group differences were observed in subjective scores of anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-8), or stress (PSS). However, the treatment group exhibited a clinically meaningful decline in GAD-7 and PSS scores. These findings underscore the potential of wearable-enabled mHealth tools to reduce acute stress in college populations and highlight the need for extended interventions and tailored features to address chronic symptoms like depression.</description>

      <title>TransBench: Breaking Barriers for Transferable Graphical User Interface Agents in Dynamic Digital Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents, which autonomously operate on digital interfaces through natural language instructions, hold transformative potential for accessibility, automation, and user experience. A critical aspect of their functionality is grounding - the ability to map linguistic intents to visual and structural interface elements. However, existing GUI agents often struggle to adapt to the dynamic and interconnected nature of real-world digital environments, where tasks frequently span multiple platforms and applications while also being impacted by version updates. To address this, we introduce TransBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate and enhance the transferability of GUI agents across three key dimensions: cross-version transferability (adapting to version updates), cross-platform transferability (generalizing across platforms like iOS, Android, and Web), and cross-application transferability (handling tasks spanning functionally distinct apps). TransBench includes 15 app categories with diverse functionalities, capturing essential pages across versions and platforms to enable robust evaluation. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in grounding accuracy, showcasing the practical utility of GUI agents in dynamic, real-world environments. Our code and data will be publicly available at GitHub.</description>

Abstract: The quality of training data is critical to the performance of machine learning applications in domains like transportation, healthcare, and robotics. Accurate image labeling, however, often relies on time-consuming, expert-driven methods with limited feedback. This research introduces a sketch-based annotation approach supported by large language models (LLMs) to reduce technical barriers and enhance accessibility. Using a synthetic dataset, we examine how sketch recognition features relate to LLM feedback metrics, aiming to improve the reliability and interpretability of LLM-assisted labeling. We also explore how prompting strategies and sketch variations influence feedback quality. Our main contribution is a sketch-based virtual assistant that simplifies annotation for non-experts and advances LLM-driven labeling tools in terms of scalability, accessibility, and explainability.</description>

      <title>CogReact: A Reinforced Framework to Model Human Cognitive Reaction Modulated by Dynamic Intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06216</link>

Abstract: Using deep neural networks as computational models to simulate cognitive process can provide key insights into human behavioral dynamics. Challenges arise when environments are highly dynamic, obscuring stimulus-behavior relationships. However, the majority of current research focuses on simulating human cognitive behaviors under ideal conditions, neglecting the influence of environmental disturbances. We propose CogReact, integrating drift-diffusion with deep reinforcement learning to simulate granular effects of dynamic environmental stimuli on human cognitive process. Quantitatively, it improves cognition modelling by considering temporal effect of environmental stimuli on cognitive process and captures both subject-specific and stimuli-specific behavioural differences. Qualitatively, it captures general trends in human cognitive process under stimuli, better than baselines. Our approach is examined in diverse environmental influences on various cognitive tasks. Overall, it demonstrates a powerful, data-driven methodology to simulate, align with, and understand the vagaries of human cognitive response in dynamic contexts.</description>

      <title>Sky-Drive: A Distributed Multi-Agent Simulation Platform for Human-AI Collaborative and Socially-Aware Future Transportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18010</link>

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous system simulation platforms have significantly enhanced the safe and scalable testing of driving policies. However, existing simulators do not yet fully meet the needs of future transportation research-particularly in enabling effective human-AI collaboration and modeling socially-aware driving agents. This paper introduces Sky-Drive, a novel distributed multi-agent simulation platform that addresses these limitations through four key innovations: (a) a distributed architecture for synchronized simulation across multiple terminals; (b) a multi-modal human-in-the-loop framework integrating diverse sensors to collect rich behavioral data; (c) a human-AI collaboration mechanism supporting continuous and adaptive knowledge exchange; and (d) a digital twin framework for constructing high-fidelity virtual replicas of real-world transportation environments. Sky-Drive supports diverse applications such as autonomous vehicle-human road users interaction modeling, human-in-the-loop training, socially-aware reinforcement learning, personalized driving development, and customized scenario generation. Future extensions will incorporate foundation models for context-aware decision support and hardware-in-the-loop testing for real-world validation. By bridging scenario generation, data collection, algorithm training, and hardware integration, Sky-Drive has the potential to become a foundational platform for the next generation of human-centered and socially-aware autonomous transportation systems research.

      <title>Human-Centered Development of Guide Dog Robots: Quiet and Stable Locomotion Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quadruped robot is a promising system that can offer assistance comparable to that of dog guides due to its similar form factor. However, various challenges remain in making these robots a reliable option for blind and low-vision (BLV) individuals. Among these challenges, noise and jerky motion during walking are critical drawbacks of existing quadruped robots. While these issues have largely been overlooked in guide dog robot research, our interviews with guide dog handlers and trainers revealed that acoustic and physical disturbances can be particularly disruptive for BLV individuals, who rely heavily on environmental sounds for navigation. To address these issues, we developed a novel walking controller for slow stepping and smooth foot swing/contact while maintaining human walking speed, as well as robust and stable balance control. The controller integrates with a perception system to facilitate locomotion over non-flat terrains, such as stairs. Our controller was extensively tested on the Unitree Go1 robot and, when compared with other control methods, demonstrated significant noise reduction -- half of the default locomotion controller. In this study, we adopt a mixed-methods approach to evaluate its usability with BLV individuals. In our indoor walking experiments, participants compared our controller to the robot's default controller. Results demonstrated superior acceptance of our controller, highlighting its potential to improve the user experience of guide dog robots.
