      <title>Enzyme as Maxwell's Demon: Steady-state Deviation from Chemical Equilibrium by Enhanced Enzyme Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enzymes are known to increase their diffusion coefficient when catalyzing reactions, a phenomenon termed enhanced enzyme diffusion (EED). While EED has been shown to bias the spatial distribution of enzymes, its effects on reaction outcomes remain unclear. Here, we show that EED can deviate the steady-state concentrations of reactants away from chemical equilibrium. This deviation results from biasing the reaction probability using information about the preceding reaction obtained via EED. Our results imply that various enzymes can act as Maxwell's demon, reducing entropy using information.</description>

      <title>Spectral Analysis and Invariant Measure in Studies of the Dynamics of the Hemostasis of a Blood Vessel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mathematical model of atherosclerosis of a blood vessel is advanced with regard for the entry of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) into blood. For the first time, the influence of cytokines on the inflammation of a blood vessel at the formation of atherosclerotic plaques is taken into account. With the help of the expansion in a Fourier series and the calculation of an invariant measure, the scenario of the appearance of strange attractors depending on a change in the parameter of the dissipation of cholesterol is studied. The conclusion is made about the interconnection of the dynamics of the metabolic process in a blood vascular system and its physical state.</description>

      <title>Multistate Density Functional Theory for Local and Charge-Transfer Tripdoublet States from Triplet-Free Radical Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction between excited states of a closed-shell chromophore and a nearby free radical species gives rise to spin-coupled doublet states, namely singdoublet and tripdoublet, as well as a quartet state. This coupling facilitates transitions that are otherwise spin-forbidden, thereby enhancing intersystem crossing and influencing luminescence and non-radiative decay pathways. In this chapter, we explore these interactions using multistate density functional theory (MSDFT). By employing a minimal active space (MAS) comprising just ten determinant configurations, MSDFT effectively captures local and charge-transfer excitations with inclusion of correlation effects. MSDFT extends the Hohenberg-Kohn density functional theory from the ground state to encompass all electronic states, underscoring the potential for developing computationally efficient methods to study excited states. Numerical results demonstrate that MSDFT accurately reproduces both qualitative trends and quantitative excited-state energies, in accord with previous studies using extended multistate complete-active-space second-order perturbation theory (XMS-CASPT2). The work explores energy changes along a reaction path from the D_0/D_1 minimum energy crossing intersection to the D_2/D_3 crossing in the exciplex formed by 10-methylphenothiazine and a dicarboximide electron acceptor linked to the stable free radical 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl (TEMPO).</description>

      <title>Unravel the rotational and translational behavior of a single squirmer in flexible polymer solutions at different Reynolds numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microorganisms thrive in complex environments and their behavior in fluids holds significant importance for various medical and industrial applications. By conducting Lattice Boltzmann simulations, the transport and rotational properties of a generic squirmer are investigated in solutions embedded with flexible polymers at different Reynolds numbers. The interplay of activity and heterogeneously distributed polymers have profound influences on these properties. Remarkable enhancements of up to three orders of magnitude in the rotational motion, along with apparent decays in self-propelling velocities, are observed for squirmers with non-zero active stresses. These extraordinary phenomena stem from the squirmer-polymer mechanical and hydrodynamic interactions. Specifically, polymer wrapping occurs in front of a pusher, while numerous polymers are absorbed in the rear of a puller. Both mechanisms enhance the rotational motion and simultaneously impede translations through forces and torques arising from direct contacts or asymmetric local flows induced by polymers. The source dipole flow fields generated by a neutral swimmer rapidly advect polymers to the rear, leaving no apparent impacts on its rotational and transport properties. The influences of Reynolds number Re and squirmer-polymer boundary conditions (no-slip and repulsive) on the dynamics are addressed. In short, the no-slip boundary condition results in more profound effects on both rotational and translational properties at Re = 0.8. However, at Re = 0.04, the disparity between the two boundary conditions diminishes due to the heightened fluid viscous drag, which impedes direct contacts between squirmers and polymers. Our results reveal the relevance of system heterogeneity and highlight the essential role of squirmer-polymer mechanical and hydrodynamic interactions in shaping the behavior of swimmers in viscoelastic fluids.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-giant number fluctuations and nematic order in microswimmer suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Giant number fluctuations (GNFs), whereby the standard deviation $\Delta N$ in the local number of particles $\langle N \rangle$ grows faster than $\sqrt{\langle N \rangle}$, are a hallmark property of dry active matter systems with orientational order, such as a collection of granular particles on a vibrated plate. This contrasts with momentum-conserving ("wet") active matter systems, such as suspensions of swimming bacteria, where no theoretical prediction of GNFs exist, although numerous experimental observations of such enhanced fluctuations have been reported. In this Letter, we numerically confirm the emergence of super-Gaussian number fluctuations in a 3-dimensional suspension of pusher microswimmers undergoing a transition to collective motion. These fluctuations emerge sharply above the transition, but only for sufficiently large values of the bacterial persistence length $\ell_p = v_s / \lambda$, where $v_s$ is the bacterial swimming speed and $\lambda$ the tumbling rate. Crucially, these "pseudo-GNFs" differ from true GNFs, as they only occur on length scales shorter than the typical size $\xi$ of nematic patches in the collective motion state, which is in turn proportional to the single-swimmer persistence length $\ell_p$. Our results thus suggest that observations of enhanced density fluctuations in biological active matter systems actually represent transient effects that decay away beyond mesoscopic length scales, and raises the question to what extent "true" GNFs with universal properties can exist in the presence of fluid flows.</description>

      <title>Efficient parameter inference in networked dynamical systems via steady states: A surrogate objective function approach integrating mean-field and nonlinear least squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In networked dynamical systems, inferring governing parameters is crucial for predicting nodal dynamics, such as gene expression levels, species abundance, or population density. While many parameter estimation techniques rely on time-series data, particularly systems that converge over extreme time ranges, only noisy steady-state data is available, requiring a new approach to infer dynamical parameters from noisy observations of steady states. However, the traditional optimization process is computationally demanding, requiring repeated simulation of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs). To overcome these limitations, we introduce a surrogate objective function that leverages decoupled equations to compute steady states, significantly reducing computational complexity. Furthermore, by optimizing the surrogate objective function, we obtain steady states that more accurately approximate the ground truth than noisy observations and predict future equilibria when topology changes. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method across ecological, gene regulatory, and epidemic networks. Our approach provides an efficient and effective way to estimate parameters from steady-state data and has the potential to improve predictions in networked dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Cramer-Rao bound and absolute sensitivity in chemical reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chemical reaction networks (CRN) comprise an important class of models to understand biological functions such as cellular information processing, the robustness and control of metabolic pathways, circadian rhythms, and many more. However, any CRN describing a certain function does not act in isolation but is a part of a much larger network and as such is constantly subject to external changes. In [Shinar, Alon, and Feinberg. "Sensitivity and robustness in chemical reaction networks." SIAM J App Math (2009): 977-998.], the responses of CRN to changes in the linear conserved quantities, called sensitivities, were studied in and the question of how to construct absolute, i.e., basis-independent, sensitivities was raised. In this article, by applying information geometric methods, such a construction is provided. The idea is to track how concentration changes in a particular chemical propagate to changes of all concentrations within a steady state. This is encoded in the matrix of absolute sensitivities. As the main technical tool, a multivariate Cramer-Rao bound for CRN is proven, which is based on the the analogy between quasi-thermostatic steady states and the exponential family of probability distributions. This leads to a linear algebraic characterization of the matrix of absolute sensitivities for quasi-thermostatic CRN. As an example, the core module of the IDHKP-IDH glyoxylate bypass regulation system is analyzed analytically and numerically by extensive random sampling of the concentration space. The experimentally known findings for the robustness of the IDH enzyme are confirmed and a hidden symmetry at the level of distributions is revealed, providing a blueprint for the analysis of the robustness properties of CRNs.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of Living Systems: Symmetry Fibrations and Synchronization in Biological Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A symmetry is a `change without change'. As simple as it sounds, this concept is the fundamental cornerstone that unifies all branches of theoretical physics. Virtually all physical laws -- ranging from classical mechanics and electrodynamics to relativity, quantum mechanics, and the standard model -- can be expressed in terms of symmetry invariances. In this book, we explore whether the same principle can also explain the emergent laws of biological systems. We introduce a new geometry for biological networks and AI architectures, drawing inspiration from the mystic genius of Grothendieck's fibrations in category theory. We attempt to bridge the gap between physics and biology using symmetries but with a twist. The traditional symmetry groups of physics are global and too rigid to describe biology. Instead, the novel notion of symmetry fibration is local, flexible, and adaptable to evolutionary pressures, providing the right framework for understanding biological complexity. In other words, this more general symmetry invariance is necessary and sufficient to ensure that a given biological network configuration can support a synchronized function. In this book, we review the theoretical progress over the last decades from mathematics, physics, computer science, dynamical systems, and graph theory that has led to the discovery of symmetry fibrations in biological networks. These symmetries act as organizing principles for biological networks. They serve as effective tools for describing the structure of these networks, blending geometry and topology. Fibrations explain how structure dictates function across various biological domains, including the transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and connectome. Additionally, they facilitate a reduction in the dimensionality of the network, simplifying it into its fundamental building blocks for biological computation.</description>
