      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, using tensor products with appropriate bimodules over Hecke algebras, we uniformly describe parabolic induction and Jacquet module. We also recover a result of Loke and Przebinda on construction of big theta lift in local theta correspondenc using similar description.</description>

      <title>A module-theoretic interpretation of quantum expansion formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a module-theoretic interpretation of the expansion formula given in [11], which defines a map on perfect matchings to compute the expansion of quantum cluster variables in quantum cluster algebras arising from unpunctured surfaces. In addition, we present a multiplication formula for string modules with one-dimensional extension spaces, derived using the skein relation. For the Kronecker type, an alternative expansion formula was given in [20], and we show that the two expansion formulas coincide.</description>

      <title>Hyperplane arrangements and Vinberg's $\theta$-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{g} = \bigoplus_{i \in \mathbb{Z} /m \mathbb{Z}} \mathfrak{g}_i$ be a periodically graded semisimple complex Lie algebra. In this note, we give a uniform proof of the recent result by W. de Graaf and H. V. L\^e that the hyperplane arrangement determined by the restrictions of the roots of $\mathfrak{g}$ to a Cartan subspace $\mathfrak{c} \subset \mathfrak{g}_1$ coincides with the hyperplane arrangement of (complex) reflections of the little Weyl group of $\mathfrak{g} = \bigoplus_{i \in \mathbb{Z} /m \mathbb{Z}} \mathfrak{g}_i$.</description>

      <title>Exploring Pintopia: Reflection Branes, Bordisms, and U-Dualities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The U-dualities of maximally supersymmetric non-chiral supergravity (SUGRA) theories lead to strong constraints on the non-perturbative structure of quantum gravity. In this paper we determine Spin- and Pin-lifts of these dualities, which extend this action to fermionic degrees of freedom. Among other things, this allows us to access non-supersymmetric sectors of these low energy effective field theories in which bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom are treated differently. We use this refinement of the duality groups, in tandem with the Swampland Cobordism Conjecture, to predict new codimension-two branes. These are a natural generalization of the recently discovered R7-branes of type II string theories. The first bordism groups for Spin-twisted duality bundles follow directly from the Abelianization of the duality groups. Viewing the SUGRA theory as the low energy limit of a toroidal compactification of M-theory, winding around these codimension-two defects enacts a reflection around one of the torus directions, which in the effective field theory appears as a charge conjugation symmetry. We establish some basic properties of such branes, including determining BPS objects which can end on it, as well as braiding rules and bound states realized by multiple reflection branes.</description>

      <title>Associative-Yamaguti algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we first introduce associative-Yamaguti algebras as the associative analogue of Lie-Yamaguti algebras. Associative algebras, reductive associative algebras and associative triple systems of the first kind form subclasses of associative-Yamaguti algebras. Any diassociative algebra canonically provides an associative-Yamaguti algebra structure. We confirm that any associative-Yamaguti algebra admits an enveloping associative algebra (i.e., it can be obtained from a reductive associative algebra). We show that a suitable skew-symmetrization of an associative-Yamaguti algebra gives rise to a Lie-Yamaguti algebra structure. Next, we define the $(2,3)$-cohomology group of an associative-Yamaguti algebra to study formal one-parameter deformations and abelian extensions. Later, we consider Yamaguti multiplications on a nonsymmetric operad as a generalization of associative-Yamaguti algebras. This notion further leads us to introduce dendriform-Yamaguti algebras, which are splitting objects for associative-Yamaguti algebras. Finally, we consider relative Rota-Baxter operators on associative-Yamaguti algebras to establish close relationships with dendriform-Yamaguti algebras.</description>

      <title>The algebraic modular functor conjecture in type $A_n$ quantum Teichm\"uller theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fock and Goncharov introduced a quantization of higher Teichm\"uller theory using cluster Poisson varieties and their noncommutative deformations, associating to a complex semisimple Lie group $G$ and a marked surface $S$ a quantum algebra $\mathbb{L}_{G,S}$ equipped with an action of the surface mapping class group. They conjectured that these quantizations form an algebraic analog of a modular functor: cutting a surface along a simple closed curve should correspond to a canonical gluing isomorphism for the associated algebras. In this paper we prove this conjecture for $G = \mathrm{PGL}_{n+1}$. Our approach requires two extensions of the Fock-Goncharov framework: (1) enhanced moduli spaces incorporating additional boundary data, providing algebro-geometric analogs of Fenchel-Nielsen twist coordinates; and (2) the residue universal Laurent ring, a refinement of the quantum universal Laurent ring obtained by localizing and imposing residue conditions. Using these tools, we construct canonical cutting isomorphisms that are equivariant under mapping class group actions and suffice to reconstruct the entire algebra $\mathbb{L}_{G,S}$ from data associated to the cut surface.</description>

      <title>Simple harmonic oscillators from non-semisimple walled Brauer algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Walled Brauer algebras $B_N ( m , n ) $ illuminate the combinatorics of mixed tensor representations of $U(N)$, with $m$ copies of the fundamental and $n$ copies of the anti-fundamental representation. They lie at the intersection of research in representation theory, AdS/CFT and quantum information theory. They have been used to study of correlators in multi-matrix models motivated by brane-anti-brane physics in AdS/CFT. They have been applied in computing and optimising fidelities of port-based quantum teleportation. There is a large $N$ regime, specifically $ N \ge (m+n)$ where the algebras are semi-simple and their representation theory more tractable. There are known combinatorial formulae for dimensions of irreducible representations and associated reduction multiplicities. The large $N$ regime has a stability property whereby these formulae are independent of $N$. In this paper we initiate a systematic study of the combinatorics in the non-semisimple regime of $ N = m +n - l $, with positive $l$. We introduce restricted Bratteli diagrams (RBD) which are useful as an instrument to process known data from the large $N$ regime to calculate representation theory data in the non-semisimple regime. We identify within the non-semisimple regime, a region of $(m,n)$-stability, where $ \min ( m, n ) \ge ( 2l -3) $ and the RBD take a stable form depending on $l$ only and not the choice of $ m,n$ within the region. In this regime, several aspects of the combinatorics of the RBD are controlled by a universal partition function for an infinite tower of simple harmonic oscillators closely related, but not identical, to the partition function of 2D non-chiral free scalar field theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum carrollian bosonic strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a recently discovered carrollian bosonic string, described classically by a sigma model where both the worldsheet and the target spacetime are carrollian. After fixing the carrollian analogue of the conformal gauge, we determine the Lie algebra of residual gauge symmetries and show it is isomorphic to the three-dimensional extended BMS algebra. We quantise the sigma model \`a la BRST and determine the spectrum of the corresponding string theory by computing the BRST cohomology. In contrast with the usual bosonic string, the spectrum of the carrollian string is finite-dimensional. The cohomology displays Poincar\'e duality and can be interpreted, for a given momentum, as inducing representations for unitary irreducible representations of the 26-dimensional Carroll group. Furthermore we interpret (most of) the cohomology as deformations of the spacetime carrollian structure augmented by the Kalb--Ramond field to which the carrollian string couples.</description>

      <title>Companions to the Andrews-Gordon and Andrews-Bressoud identities, and recent conjectures of Capparelli, Meurman, Primc, and Primc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find bivariate generating functions for the $k=1$ cases of recently conjectured colored partition identities of Capparelli, Meurman, A. Primc, and M. Primc that are slight variants of the generating functions for the sum sides of the Andrews-Gordon and Andrews-Bressoud identities, relating them to recent work of Warnaar. This $k=1$ cases turn out to be equivalent to identities of Jing, Misra, and Savage. Finally, we provide bijections for these identities involving two-line cylindric partitions, in the spirit of Corteel.</description>
