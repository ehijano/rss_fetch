      <title>Dynamics of stochastic oscillator chains with harmonic and FPUT potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by recent studies on deterministic oscillator models, we introduce a stochastic one-dimensional model for a chain of interacting particles. The model consists of $N$ oscillators performing continuous-time random walks on the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}$ with exponentially distributed waiting times. The oscillators are bound by confining forces to two particles that do not move, placed at positions $x_0$ and $x_{N+1}$, respectively, and they feel the presence of baths with given inverse temperatures: $\beta_L$ to the left, $\beta_B$ in the middle, and $\beta_R$ to the right. Each particle has an index and interacts with its nearest neighbors in index space through either a quadratic potential or a Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou type coupling. This local interaction in index space can give rise to effective long-range interactions on the spatial lattice, depending on the instantaneous configuration. Particle hopping rates are governed either by the Metropolis rule or by a modified version that breaks detailed balance at the interfaces between regions with different baths.</description>

      <title>When Normality Tests Detect Equilibrium Distributions of Finite N-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The particle number $N$ can be used as a quantitative gauge of non-Gaussianity. This idea extends to systems that are not literally finite by assigning them a notional $N $that captures the same deviation. For an ideal gas with $N$ insufficiently large for the thermodynamic limit, the velocity distribution that maximises Havrda-Charv\'at entropy departs markedly from the Maxwell-Boltzmann (Gaussian) form obtained in that limit. We explore how five standard normality tests-Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling, Cram\'er-von Mises, Jarque-Bera and Shapiro-Wilk-respond to samples drawn from this finite-$N$ equilibrium distribution. A large-scale Monte-Carlo study maps the tests' statistical power across system size $N$ and sample size $n$, providing practical reference tables for deciding when finite-size effects remain detectable.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusion and anomalous fluctuations in chiral integrable dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetries strongly influence transport properties of quantum many-body systems, and can lead to deviations from the generic case of diffusion. In this work, we study the impact of time-reversal symmetry breaking on the transport and its universal aspects in integrable chiral spin ladders. We observe that the infinite-temperature spin transport is superdiffusive with a dynamical critical exponent z = 3/2 matching the one of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class, which also lacks the time reversal symmetry. However, we find that fluctuations of the net magnetization transfer deviate from the KPZ predictions. Moreover, the full probability distribution of the associated spin current obeys fluctuation symmetry despite broken time-reversal and space-reflection symmetries. To further investigate the role of conserved quantities, we introduce an integrable quantum circuit that shares the essential symmetries with the chiral ladder, and which exhibits analogous dynamical behaviour in the absence of energy conservation. Our work shows that time-reversal symmetry breaking is compatible with superdiffusion, but insufficient to stabilize the KPZ universality in integrable systems. This suggests that additional fundamental features are missing in order to identify the emergence of such dynamics in quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Information geometry of perturbed gradient flow systems on hypergraphs: A perspective towards nonequilibrium physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article serves to concisely review the link between gradient flow systems on hypergraphs and information geometry which has been established within the last five years. Gradient flow systems describe a wealth of physical phenomena and provide powerful analytical technquies which are based on the variational energy-dissipation principle. Modern nonequilbrium physics has complemented this classical principle with thermodynamic uncertaintly relations, speed limits, entropy production rate decompositions, and many more. In this article, we formulate these modern principles within the framework of perturbed gradient flow systems on hypergraphs. In particular, we discuss the geometry induced by the Bregman divergence, the physical implications of dual foliations, as well as the corresponding infinitesimal Riemannian geometry for gradient flow systems. Through the geometrical perspective, we are naturally led to new concepts such as moduli spaces for perturbed gradient flow systems and thermodynamical area which is crucial for understanding speed limits. We hope to encourage the readers working in either of the two fields to further expand on and foster the interaction between the two fields.</description>

      <title>Snap, Crackle, and Pop: This is why the potential of mean force clashes with the fluctuation dissipation relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the non-linear generalized Langevin equation which contains a thermodynamic force. We show that even for systems in thermal equilibrium the presence of the thermodynamic force implies that the auto-correlation function of the fluctuating force becomes non-stationary. We further illustrate that a standard coarse-graining procedure that neglects this fact predicts waiting-time distributions incompatible with the original, microscopic process. We conclude that one needs to proceed with care when adding thermodynamic driving forces to the Langevin equation.</description>

      <title>Diffusion velocity modulus of self-propelled spherical and circular particles in the generalized Langevin approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research provides a framework for describing the averaged modulus of the velocity reached by an accelerated self-propelled Brownian particle diffusing in a thermal fluid and constrained to a harmonic external potential. The system is immersed in a thermal bath of harmonic oscillators at a constant temperature, where its constituents also interact with the external field. The dynamics is investigated for a sphere and a disk, and is split into two stochastic processes. The first describes the gross-grained inner time-dependent self-velocity generated from a set of independent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes without the influence of the external field. This internal mechanism provides the initial velocity for the particle to diffuse in the fluid, which is implemented in a modified generalized Langevin equation as the second process. We find that the system exhibits spontaneous fluctuations in the diffusive velocity modulus due to the inner mechanism; however, as expected, the momentary diffusive velocity fluctuations fade out at large times. The internal propelled velocity module in spherical coordinates is derived, as well as the simulation of the different modules for both the sphere and the already known equations for a disk in polar coordinates.</description>

      <title>Larger holes as narrower degree distributions in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22720v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the analysis of loops is not so much because of the complications, it has already been found that heuristically enhancing loops decreases the variance of degree distributions for improving the robustness of connectivity. While many real scale-free networks are known to contain shorter loops such as triangles, it remains to investigate the distributions of longer loops in more wide class of networks. We find a relation between narrower degree distributions and longer loops in investigating the lengths of the shortest loops in various networks with continuously changing degree distributions, including three typical types of realistic scale-free networks, classical Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs, and regular networks. In particular, we show that narrower degree distributions contain longer shortest loops, as a universal property in a wide class of random networks. We suggest that the robustness of connectivity is enhanced by constructing long loops of O(log N).</description>

      <title>Protein-protein interaction networks can be highly sensitive to the membrane phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks take place in the fluid yet structured plasma membrane. Lipid domains, sometimes termed rafts, have been implicated in the functioning of various membrane-bound signaling processes. Here, we present a model and a Monte Carlo simulation framework to investigate how changes in the domain size that arise from perturbations to membrane criticality can lead to changes in the rate of interactions among components, leading to altered outcomes. For simple PPI networks, we show that the activity can be highly sensitive to thermodynamic parameters near the critical point of the membrane phase transition. When protein-protein interactions change the partitioning of some components, our system sometimes forms out of equilibrium domains we term pockets, driven by a mixture of thermodynamic interactions and kinetic sorting. More generally, we predict that near the critical point many different PPI networks will have their outcomes depend sensitively on perturbations that influence critical behavior.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Skyrmion Flow Phases with Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is a powerful method that can identify patterns in large, complex data sets by constructing low-dimensional order parameters from higher-dimensional feature vectors. There are increasing efforts to use space-and-time-dependent PCA to detect transitions in nonequilibrium systems that are difficult to characterize with equilibrium methods. Here, we demonstrate that feature vectors incorporating the position and velocity information of driven skyrmions moving through random disorder permit PCA to resolve different types of disordered skyrmion motion as a function of driving force and the ratio of the Magnus force to the dissipation. Since the Magnus force creates gyroscopic motion and a finite Hall angle, skyrmions can exhibit a greater range of flow phases than what is observed in overdamped driven systems with quenched disorder. We show that in addition to identifying previously known skyrmion flow phases, PCA detects several additional phases, including different types of channel flow, moving fluids, and partially ordered states. Guided by the PCA analysis, we further characterize the disordered flow phases to elucidate the different microscopic dynamics and show that the changes in the PCA-derived order parameters can be connected to features in bulk transport measures, including the transverse and longitudinal velocity-force curves, differential conductivity, topological defect density, and changes in the skyrmion Hall angle as a function of drive. We discuss how asymmetric feature vectors can be used to improve the resolution of the PCA analysis, and how this technique can be extended to find disordered phases in other nonequilibrium systems with time-dependent dynamics.</description>

      <title>Phase behaviour and defect structure of soft rods on a sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using particle-resolved molecular-dynamics simulations, we compute the phase diagram for soft repulsive spherocylinders confined on the surface of a sphere. While crystal (K), smectic (Sm), and isotropic (I) phases exhibit a stability region for any aspect ratio of the spherocylinders, a nematic phase emerges only beyond a critical aspect ratio lying between 6.0 and 7.0. As required by the topology of the confining sphere, the ordered phases exhibit a total orientational defect charge of +2. In detail, the crystal and smectic phases exhibit two +1 defects at the poles, whereas the nematic phase features four +1/2 defects which are connected along a great circle. For aspect ratios above the critical value, lowering the packing fraction drives a sequence of transitions: the crystal melts into a smectic phase, which then transforms into a nematic through the splitting of the +1 defects into pairs of +1/2 defects that progressively move apart, thereby increasing their angular separation. Eventually, at very low densities, orientational fluctuations stabilize an isotropic phase. Our simulations data can be experimentally verified in Pickering emulsions and are relevant to understand the morphogenesis in epithelial tissues.</description>

      <title>The Demon Hidden Behind Life's Ultra-Energy-Efficient Information Processing -- Demonstrated by Biological Molecular Motors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable progress of artificial intelligence (AI) has revealed the enormous energy demands of modern digital architectures, raising deep concerns about sustainability. In stark contrast, the human brain operates efficiently on only ~20 watts, and individual cells process gigabit-scale genetic information using energy on the order of trillionths of a watt. Under the same energy budget, a general-purpose digital processor can perform only a few simple operations per second. This striking disparity suggests that biological systems follow algorithms fundamentally distinct from conventional computation. The framework of information thermodynamics-especially Maxwell's demon and the Szilard engine-offers a theoretical clue, setting the lower bound of energy required for information processing. However, digital processors exceed this limit by about six orders of magnitude. Recent single-molecule studies have revealed that biological molecular motors convert Brownian motion into mechanical work, realizing a "demon-like" operational principle. These findings suggest that living systems have already implemented an ultra-efficient information-energy conversion mechanism that transcends digital computation. Here, we experimentally establish a quantitative correspondence between positional information (bits) and mechanical work, demonstrating that molecular machines selectively exploit rare but functional fluctuations arising from Brownian motion to achieve ATP-level energy efficiency. This integration of information, energy, and timescale indicates that life realizes a Maxwell's demon-like mechanism for energy-efficient information processing.</description>

      <title>Domain Growth and Aging in a Phase Separating Binary Fluid Confined Inside a Nanopore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamics is known to have strong effects on the kinetics of phase separation. There exist open questions on how such effects manifest in systems under confinement. Here, we have undertaken extensive studies of the kinetics of phase separation in a two-component fluid that is confined inside pores of cylindrical shape. Using a hydrodynamics-preserving thermostat, we carry out molecular dynamics simulations to obtain results for domain growth and aging for varying temperature and pore-width. We find that all systems freeze into a morphology where stripes of regions rich in one or the other component of the mixture coexist in a locked situation. Our analysis suggests that, irrespective of the temperature the growth of the average domain size, $\ell(t)$, prior to the freezing into stripped patterns, follows the power law $\ell(t)\sim t^{2/3}$, suggesting an inertial hydrodynamic growth, which typically is applicable for bulk fluids only in the asymptotic limit. Similarly, the aging dynamics, probed by the two-time order-parameter autocorrelation function, also exhibits a temperature-independent power-law scaling with an exponent $\lambda \simeq 2.55$, much smaller than what is observed for a bulk fluid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stability of ground states in the Edwards-Anderson Ising spin glass in dimensions two and higher against perturbations of a single coupling. After reviewing the concepts of critical droplets, flexibilities and metastates, we show that, in any dimension, a certain kind of critical droplet with space-filling (i.e., positive spatial density) boundary does not exist in ground states generated by coupling-independent boundary conditions. Using this we show that if incongruent ground states exist in any dimension, the variance of their energy difference restricted to finite volumes scales proportionally to the volume. This in turn is used to prove that a metastate generated by (e.g.) periodic boundary conditions is unique and supported on a single pair of spin-reversed ground states in two dimensions. We further show that a type of excitation above a ground state, whose interface with the ground state is space-filling and whose energy remains O(1) independent of the volume, as predicted by replica symmetry breaking, cannot exist in any dimension.</description>

      <title>Probing non-equilibrium physics through the two-body Bell correlator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying equilibrium criticalities and phases from the dynamics of a system, known as a dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT), is a challenging task when relying solely on local observables. We exhibit that the experimentally accessible two-body Bell operator, originally designed to detect nonlocal correlations in quantum states, serves as an effective witness of DQPTs in a long-range (LR) XY spin chain subjected to a magnetic field, where the interaction strength decays as a power law. Following a sudden quench of the system parameters, the Bell operator between nearest-neighbor spins exhibits a distinct drop at the critical boundaries. In this study, we consider two quenching protocols, namely sudden quenches of the magnetic field strength and the interaction fall-off rate. This pronounced behavior defines a threshold, distinguishing intra-phase from inter-phase quenches, remaining valid regardless of the strength of long-range interactions, anisotropy, and system sizes. Comparative analyses further demonstrate that conventional classical and quantum correlators, including entanglement, fail to capture this transition during dynamics.</description>

      <title>Control Strategies for Maintaining Transport Symmetries Far From Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two strategies for controlling the transport dynamics of mesoscopic devices. In both cases, we manipulate the system's output - such as particle currents and energy flows - while maintaining symmetric transport properties, even under far-from-equilibrium conditions. We provide exact descriptions of each scheme and investigate their characteristics. Notably, one of them minimizes the dissimilarity between the original and modified processes, as quantified by the Kullback-Leibler divergence. These findings can be used to improve the design and control of mesoscopic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15121v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a generative modeling framework for thermodynamic computing, in which structured data is synthesized from noise by the natural time evolution of a physical system governed by Langevin dynamics. While conventional diffusion models use neural networks to perform denoising, here the information needed to generate structure from noise is encoded by the dynamics of a thermodynamic system. Training proceeds by maximizing the probability with which the computer generates the reverse of a noising trajectory, which ensures that the computer generates data with minimal heat emission. We demonstrate this framework within a digital simulation of a thermodynamic computer. If realized in analog hardware, such a system would function as a generative model that produces structured samples without the need for artificially-injected noise or active control of denoising.</description>

      <title>Does higher influence mean more information transferred? A case study using the Vicsek Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the flow of information among individuals in a complex system is critical to our understanding of its dynamics. The concept of influence is often used to correlate with information transfer, as quantified by various information-theoretical tools. However, influence has not been explicitly and quantitatively defined. Here, we propose an intuitive and quantifiable definition of influence and use the Vicsek model as an example to investigate the quantitative relations between influence and information transfer. We identify quantitative relations between influence and information transfer in pairwise interactions and collective interactions. Significantly, we uncover the dual effect of noise. Finally, we use partial information decomposition methods to reveal the unique and synergistic nature of influence and information transfer in a collective. The insights gained in our model will contribute to our understanding of other natural and artificial complex systems.</description>

      <title>Geometric decomposition of information flow: New insights into information thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a decomposition of information flow into housekeeping and excess components for autonomous bipartite systems subject to Markov jump processes. We introduce this decomposition by using the geometric structure of probability currents and the conjugate thermodynamic forces. The housekeeping component arises from the cyclic modes caused by the detailed balance violations and maintains the correlations between the two subsystems. In contrast, the excess component, is a contribution of conservative forces that alters the mutual information between the two subsystems. With this decomposition, we generalize previous results, such as the second law of information thermodynamics, the cyclic decomposition, and the information-thermodynamic extensions of thermodynamic trade-off relations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral phonons, originally identified in two-dimensional hexagonal lattices and later extended to kagome, square, and other lattices, have been extensively studied as manifestations of broken inversion and time-reversal symmetries in vibrational dynamics. In this work, we investigate the vibrational dynamics of the two-dimensional square-octagon lattice using a spring-mass model with central-force interactions. The model incorporates mass contrast and variable coupling strengths among nearest, next-nearest, and third-nearest neighbors. From the dynamical matrix, we obtain the phonon dispersion relations and identify tunable phononic band gaps governed by both mass and spring-constant ratios. The angular dependence of phase and group velocities is analyzed to reveal the pronounced anisotropy inherent to this lattice geometry. We also examine the distinctive features of the square-octagon geometry, including flat-band anomalies in the density of states and anisotropic sound propagation induced by longer-range couplings. In addition, we explore the emergence of chiral phonons by introducing a time reversal symmetry-breaking term in the dynamical matrix, and to elucidate their optical signatures, we construct a minimal model to study infrared circular dichroism arising from chiral phonon modes.</description>

Abstract: We derive a formulation of the First Law of nonequilibrium thermodynamics for biological information-processing systems by partitioning entropy in the Second Law into microscopic and mesoscopic components and by assuming that natural selection promotes optimal information processing and transmission. The resulting framework demonstrates how mesoscopic information-based subsystems can attain nonequilibrium steady states (NESS) sustained by external energy and entropy fluxes, such as those generated by ATP/ADP imbalances in vivo. Moreover, mesoscopic systems may reach NESS before microscopic subsystems, leading to ordered structures in entropy flow analogous to eddies in a moving stream.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Geometry-Adaptive MCMC for Bayesian Inference in Higher-Order Ising Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the inverse problem for the mean-field Ising model with two- and three-body interactions using a Bayesian framework. Parameter recovery in this setting is notoriously difficult, particularly near phase transitions, at criticality, and under non-identifiability, where conventional estimators and standard MCMC samplers fail. To overcome these challenges, we develop a hybrid algorithm that combines Adaptive Metropolis Hastings with geometry-aware Riemannian manifold Hamiltonian dynamics. This approach yields substantially improved mixing and convergence in the three-dimensional parameter space. Through simulated experiments across representative regimes, we demonstrate that the method achieves accurate density reconstruction and reliable uncertainty quantification even in settings where existing approaches are unstable or inapplicable.</description>

      <title>Reducibility of higher-order networks via information flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08547v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Empirical complex systems can be characterized not only by pairwise interactions, but also by higher-order (group) interactions influencing collective phenomena, from metabolic reactions to epidemics. Nevertheless, higher-order networks' apparent superior descriptive power -- compared to classical pairwise networks -- comes with a much increased model complexity and computational cost, challenging their application. Consequently, it is of paramount importance to establish a quantitative method to determine when such a modeling framework is advantageous with respect to pairwise models, and to which extent it provides a valuable description of empirical systems. Here, we propose an information-theoretic framework, accounting for how structure affect diffusion behaviors, quantifying the entropic cost and distinguishability of higher-order interactions to assess their reducibility to lower-order structures while preserving relevant functional information. Empirical analyses indicate that some systems retain essential higher-order structure, whereas in some technological and biological networks it collapses to pairwise interactions. With controlled randomization procedures, we investigate the role of nestedness and degree heterogeneity in this reducibility process. Our findings contribute to ongoing efforts to minimize the dimensionality of models for complex systems.</description>

      <title>Toward a Theory of Phase Transitions in Quantum Control Landscapes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Control landscape phase transitions (CLPTs) occur as abrupt changes in the cost function landscape upon varying a control parameter, and can be revealed by non-analytic points in statistical order parameters. A prime example are quantum speed limits (QSL) which mark the onset of controllability as the protocol duration is increased. Here we lay the foundations of an analytical theory for CLPTs by developing Dyson, Magnus, and cumulant expansions for the cost function that capture the behavior of CLPTs with a controlled precision. Using linear and quadratic stability analysis, we reveal that CLPTs can be associated with different types of instabilities of the optimal protocol. This allows us to explicitly relate CLPTs to critical structural rearrangements in the extrema of the control landscape: utilizing path integral methods from statistical field theory, we trace back the critical scaling of the order parameter at the QSL to the topological and geometric properties of the set of optimal protocols, such as the number of connected components and its dimensionality. We verify our predictions by introducing a numerical sampling algorithm designed to explore this optimal set via a homotopic stochastic update rule. We apply this new toolbox explicitly to analyze CLPTs in the single- and two-qubit control problems whose landscapes are analytically tractable, and compare the landscapes for bang-bang and continuous protocols. Our work provides the first steps towards a systematic theory of CLPTs and paves the way for utilizing statistical field theory techniques for generic complex control landscapes.</description>

      <title>Ginzburg-Landau description of a class of non-unitary minimal models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11714v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been proposed that the Ginzburg-Landau description of the non-unitary conformal minimal model $M(3,8)$ is provided by the Euclidean theory of two real scalar fields with third-order interactions that have imaginary coefficients. The same lagrangian describes the non-unitary model $M(3,10)$, which is a product of two Yang-Lee theories $M(2,5)$, and the Renormalization Group flow from it to $M(3,8)$. This proposal has recently passed an important consistency check, due to Y. Nakayama and T. Tanaka, based on the anomaly matching for non-invertible topological lines. In this paper, we elaborate the earlier proposal and argue that the two-field theory describes the $D$ series modular invariants of both $M(3,8)$ and $M(3,10)$. We further propose the Ginzburg-Landau descriptions of the entire class of $D$ series minimal models $M(q, 3q-1)$ and $M(q, 3q+1)$, with odd integer $q$. They involve $PT$ symmetric theories of two scalar fields with interactions of order $q$ multiplied by imaginary coupling constants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In optimal quantum control, control landscape phase transitions (CLPTs) indicate sharp changes occurring in the set of optimal protocols, as a physical model parameter is varied. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a new class of CLPTs, associated with changes in the topological properties of the optimal level set in a two-qubit state-preparation problem. In particular, the distance distribution of control protocols sampled through stochastic homotopic dynamics reveals discontinuous changes in the number of connected components in the optimal level set, as a function of the protocol duration. We demonstrate how topological CLPTs can be detected in modern-day experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Counterdiabatic (CD) driving has the potential to speed up adiabatic quantum state preparation by suppressing unwanted excitations. However, existing approaches either require intractable classical computations or are based on approximations which do not have performance guarantees. We propose and analyze a non-variational, system-agnostic CD expansion method and analytically show that it converges exponentially quickly in the expansion order. In finite systems, the required resources scale inversely with the spectral gap, which we argue is asymptotically optimal. To extend our method to the thermodynamic limit and suppress errors stemming from high-frequency transitions, we leverage finite-time adiabatic protocols. In particular, we show that a time determined by the quantum speed limit is sufficient to prepare the desired ground state, without the need to optimize the adiabatic trajectory. Numerical tests of our method on the quantum Ising chain show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art variational CD approaches.</description>

      <title>Entanglement generation and scaling from noisy quenches across a quantum critical point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03584v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of noise on the dynamics of entanglement in the transverse-field Ising chain, with the field quenched linearly across one or both of the quantum critical points of the model. Taking concurrence as a measure of entanglement, we find that a quench generates entanglement between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor spins, with noise reducing the amount of entanglement. Focusing on the next-nearest-neighbor concurrence, known to exhibit Kibble-Zurek scaling with the square root of the quench rate in the noiseless case, we find a different result when noise is present: The concurrence now scales logarithmically with the quench rate, with a noise-dependent amplitude. This is also different from the ``anti-Kibble-Zurek" scaling of defect density with quench rate when noise is present, suggesting that noisy entanglement generation is largely independent from the rate of defect formation. Intriguingly, the critical time scale beyond which no entanglement is produced by a noisy quench scales as a power law with the strength of noise, with the same exponent as that which governs the optimal quench time for which defect formation is at a minimum in a standard quantum annealing scheme.</description>

      <title>Causality, localization, and universality of monitored quantum walks with long-range hopping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A powerful strategy to accelerate quantum-walk-based search algorithms leverages on resetting protocols, where a detector monitors a target site and the evolution of the walker is restarted if no detection occurs within a fixed time interval. The optimal resetting rate can be extracted from the time evolution of the probability $S(t)$ that the detector has not clicked up to time $t$. We analyze $S(t)$ for a quantum walk on a one-dimensional lattice when the coupling between sites decays algebraically as $d^{-\alpha}$ with the distance $d$, for $\alpha\in(0,\infty)$. At long times, $S(t)$ decays with a universal power-law exponent that is independent of $\alpha$. At short times, $S(t)$ exhibits a plethora of phase transitions as a function of $\alpha$. From this, we provide a strategy to determine the optimal resetting rate. We identify two regimes: for $\alpha&gt;1$, the resetting rate $r$ is bounded from below by the velocity with which information propagates causally across the lattice; for $\alpha&lt;1$, instead, the long-range hopping tends to localize the walker: The optimal resetting rate depends on the size of the lattice and diverges as $\alpha\to 0$. Our strategy directly connects local measurement outcomes with the global dynamics encoded in $S(t)$. We derive simple models explaining our numerical results, shedding light on the interplay of long-range coherent dynamics, symmetries, and local quantum measurement processes in determining equilibrium. Our findings offer experimentally testable predictions and provide new physical insights on optimizing quantum search through resetting.</description>

      <title>On the generic increase of entropy in isolated systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study establishes a universal mechanism for entropy production in isolated quantum systems governed by interactions that induce random-phase fluctuations. By developing a resolvent-based framework, we demonstrate that steady-state entropy generically arises from many-body interactions, independent of specific coupling details, provided the coherent accumulation of systematic biases does not overwhelm the random-phase fluctuations. Analytical arguments reveal that entropy generation is driven by two universal pathways: interaction-induced energy broadening and temporal coarse-graining over exponentially small energy gaps. To fully characterize the probability distribution, we introduce both Lorentzian and Gaussian ansatz, analyzing the bulk and tail behaviors respectively, and derive corresponding self-consistent equations for the distribution parameters. Numerical simulations of nonintegrable Ising spin chains confirm the predicted logarithmic entropy scaling and validate the self-consistent equations for energy shift and broadening parameters. By combining Lorentzian and Gaussian profiles into an enhanced ansatz, we further refine the description of the distribution, unifying observational entropy concepts with von Neumann entropy dynamics and providing predictive tools for thermodynamic behavior in quantum many-body systems. Our findings resolve longstanding debates about interaction-dependent entropy scaling and offer pathways for entropy control in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Six loop critical exponent analysis for Lee-Yang and percolation theory</title>

Abstract: Using the recent six loop renormalization group functions for Lee-Yang and percolation theory constructed by Schnetz from a scalar cubic Lagrangian, we deduce the $\epsilon$ expansion of the critical exponents for both cases. Estimates for the exponents in three, four and five dimensions are extracted using two-sided Pad\'{e} approximants and shown to be compatible with values from other approaches.</description>
