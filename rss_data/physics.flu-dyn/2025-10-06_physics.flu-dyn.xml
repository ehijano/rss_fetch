      <title>A physically-informed sea spray generation model for splashing waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large sea spray drops - of up to 2mm in diameter - constitute one of the most uncertain factors controlling the intensification of hurricanes and severe storms because their generation mechanisms are not understood. Wave splashing produces among the largest spray drops, but observational data regarding these drops is difficult to obtain and hence cannot inform current modelling efforts. In this study, we instead propose a sea spray generation function (SSGF) for ocean wave splashing by assembling a model from first principles. First, we introduce the transverse collision of two cylindrical liquid rims as the basic mechanism for drop production. We characterize the resulting drop production in terms of three competing processes: ligament production and merging, drop generation by end-pinching, and gravity which arrests the mechanism. Second, we formulate a theoretical model which explains the drop size distributions produced by the colliding rims and test it against existing experimental and numerical data. Finally, the model can be developed into a full SSGF by incorporating sea state information with relatively few tuning parameters. The model is flexible and can be extended by including related effects such as finite droplet lifetime and secondary breakup. Altogether, our model suggests that wave splashing can efficiently produce numerous secondary droplets, challenging prior assumptions that it is an inefficient generation mechanism for sea spray.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Extended Lubrication Theories for Stokes Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lubrication theory leverages the assumption of a long and thin fluid domain to formulate a linearized approximation to the Navier-Stokes equations. Models in extended lubrication theory consider relaxations of the thin film assumption, leading to the inclusion of higher order terms. However, such models are sensitive to large surface gradients which lead the assumptions of the model to break down. In this paper, we present a formulation of extended lubrication theory, and compare our models with several existing models, along with the numerical solution to the Stokes equations. The error in pressure and velocity is characterized for a variety of fluid domain geometries. Our results indicate that the new solution is suitable for a wide range of geometries. Nonetheless, the magnitude of surface variation and the length scale ratio are both important factors influencing the accuracy of the extended lubrication theory models.</description>

      <title>A numerical stabilization scheme for the shallow shelf approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Thickness Stabilization Scheme (TSS), a numerical stabilization scheme suitable for the Shallow Shelf Approximation (SSA), one of the most widely-used models for large-scale Antarctic and Greenland ice sheet simulations. The TSS is constructed by inserting an adapted, explicit Euler thickness evolution equation into the driving stress term, thereby treating the term implicitly. We investigate the applicability of TSS across low- and high-shear idealized scenarios, by altering the inflow velocity and initial ice thickness. TSS demonstrates an increase in the numerical stability of SSA, allowing large time-step sizes of dt = 50-100 years to remain numerically stable and accurate, while time-step sizes of dt &gt; 5 in high-shear simulations show significant error without TSS. Remarkably, a time step size as large as dt = 10 000 years is numerically stable with TSS, albeit with a reduction in accuracy. TSS offers greater flexibility for ice-sheet modeling by allowing the re-allocation of computational resources. This method is applicable not only to ice-sheet modeling, including in coupled frameworks, but also to other vertically-integrated computational fluid dynamics problems that couple momentum and geometry evolution equations.</description>

      <title>oRANS: Online optimisation of RANS machine learning models with embedded DNS data generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated promise for accelerating and enhancing the accuracy of flow physics simulations, but progress is constrained by the scarcity of high-fidelity training data, which is costly to generate and inherently limited to a small set of flow conditions. Consequently, closures trained in the conventional offline paradigm tend to overfit and fail to generalise to new regimes. We introduce an online optimisation framework for DL-based Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) closures which seeks to address the challenge of limited high-fidelity datasets. Training data is dynamically generated by embedding a direct numerical simulation (DNS) within a subdomain of the RANS domain. The RANS solution supplies boundary conditions to the DNS, while the DNS provides mean velocity and turbulence statistics that are used to update a DL closure model during the simulation. This feedback loop enables the closure to adapt to the embedded DNS target flow, avoiding reliance on precomputed datasets and improving out-of-distribution performance. The approach is demonstrated for the stochastically forced Burgers equation and for turbulent channel flow at $Re_\tau=180$, $270$, $395$ and $590$ with varying embedded domain lengths $1\leq L_0/L\leq 8$. Online-optimised RANS models significantly outperform both offline-trained and literature-calibrated closures, with accurate training achieved using modest DNS subdomains. Performance degrades primarily when boundary-condition contamination dominates or when domains are too short to capture low-wavenumber modes. This framework provides a scalable route to physics-informed machine learning closures, enabling data-adaptive reduced-order models that generalise across flow regimes without requiring large precomputed training datasets.</description>

      <title>Nonmodal growth and optimal perturbations in magnetohydrodynamic shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In astrophysical shear flows, the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability is generally suppressed by magnetic tension provided a sufficiently strong streamwise magnetic field. This is often used to infer upper (or lower) bounds on field strengths in systems where shear-driven fluctuations are (or are not) observed, on the basis that fluctuations cannot grow in the absence of linear instability. On the contrary, by calculating the maximum growth that small-amplitude perturbations can achieve in finite time for such a system, we show that perturbations can grow in energy by orders of magnitude even when the flow is sub-Alfv\'enic, suggesting that shear-driven turbulence is possible even in the presence of strong magnetic fields, and challenging inferences from the observed presence or absence of shear-driven fluctuations. We further show that magnetic fields introduce additional nonmodal growth mechanisms relative to the hydrodynamic case, and that 2D simulations miss key aspects of these growth mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Penetrating the horizon of a hydrodynamic white hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a shallow-water radial outflow the horizon of a hydrodynamic white hole coincides with a standing circular hydraulic jump. The jump, caused by viscosity, makes the horizon visible as a circular front, standing as a barrier against the entry of waves within its circumference. The blocking of waves causes a pile-up at the horizon of the white hole, for which surface tension is mainly responsible. Conversely, it is also because of surface tension that the waves can penetrate the barrier. The penetrating waves (analogue Hawking quanta) tunnel through the barrier with a decaying amplitude, but a large-amplitude instability about the horizon is possible.</description>

      <title>Resonance of an object floating within a surface wavefield</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the interaction between floating cylindrical objects and surface waves in the gravity regime. Since the impact of resonance phenomena associated with floating bodies, particularly at laboratory scales, remains underexplored, we focus on the influence of the floats' resonance frequency on wave emission. First, we study the response of floating rigid cylinders to external mechanical perturbations. Using an optical reconstruction technique to measure surface wave fields in both space and time, we study the natural resonance frequency of floats with different sizes. The results indicate that the resonance frequency is influenced by the interplay between the cylinder geometry and the solid-to-fluid density ratio. Second, these floating objects are placed in an incoming wave field. These experiments demonstrate that floats diffract incoming waves, while radiating secondary waves that interfere with the incident wavefield. Minimal wave generation is observed at resonance frequencies. These findings can provide insights for elucidating the behavior of larger structures, such as sea ice floes, in natural wave fields.</description>

      <title>Wavenumber affects the lift of ray-inspired fins near a substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rays and skates tend to have different fin kinematics depending on their proximity to a ground plane such as the seafloor. Near the ground, rays tend to be more undulatory (high wavenumber), while far from the ground, rays tend to be more oscillatory (low wavenumber). It is unknown whether these differences are driven by hydrodynamics or other biological pressures. Here we show that near the ground, the time-averaged lift on a ray-like fin is highly dependent on wavenumber. We support our claims using a ray-inspired robotic rig that can produce oscillatory and undulatory motions on the same fin. Potential flow simulations reveal that lift is always negative because quasisteady forces overcome wake-induced forces. Three-dimensional flow measurements demonstrate that oscillatory wakes are more disrupted by the ground than undulatory wakes. All these effects lead to a suction force toward the ground that is stronger and more destabilizing for oscillatory fins than undulatory fins. Our results suggest that wavenumber plays a role in the near-ground dynamics of ray-like fins, particularly in terms of dorsoventral accelerations. The fact that lower wavenumber is linked with stronger suction forces offers a new way to interpret the depth-dependent kinematics of rays and ray-inspired robots.</description>

      <title>Capillary lubrication of a spherical particle near a fluid interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lubricated motion of an object near a deformable boundary presents striking subtleties arising from the coupling between the elasticity of the boundary and lubricated flow, including but not limited to the emergence of a lift force acting on the object despite the zero Reynolds number. In this study, we characterize the hydrodynamic forces and torques felt by a sphere translating in close proximity to a fluid interface, separating the viscous medium of the sphere's motion from an infinitely-more-viscous medium. We employ lubrication theory and perform a perturbation analysis in capillary compliance. The dominant response of the interface owing to surface tension results in a long-ranged interface deformation, which leads to a modification of the forces and torques with respect to the rigid reference case, that we characterise in details with scaling arguments and numerical integrations.</description>

      <title>Moment-enhanced shallow water equations for non-slip boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The shallow water equations often assume a constant velocity profile along the vertical axis. However, this assumption does not hold in many practical applications. To better approximate the vertical velocity distribution, models such as the shallow water moment expansion models have been proposed. Nevertheless, under non-slip bottom boundary conditions, both the standard shallow water equation and its moment-enhanced models struggle to accurately capture the vertical velocity profile due to the stiff source terms. In this work, we propose modified shallow water equations and corresponding moment-enhanced models that perform well under both non-slip and slip boundary conditions. The primary difference between the modified and original models lies in the treatment of the source term, which allows our modified moment expansion models to be readily generalized, while maintaining compatibility with our previous analysis on the hyperbolicity of the model. To assess the performance of both the standard and modified moment expansion models, we conduct a comprehensive numerical comparison with the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations -- a comparison that is absent from existing literature.</description>
