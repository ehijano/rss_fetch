      <title>Cognitive Biases at Play? Insights from a Bayesian Game Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the impact of cognitive biases on financial decision-making through a static Bayesian game framework. While traditional economic theory assumes fully rational investors, real-world choices are often shaped by loss aversion, overconfidence, and herd behavior. Integrating psychological insights with economic game theory, the model studies strategic interactions among investors who allocate wealth between risky and risk-free assets. Solving for the Bayesian Nash Equilibrium reveals that each bias distorts optimal portfolios and alters aggregate market dynamics. The results echo Herbert Simon's notion of bounded rationality, showing how biases can generate market inefficiencies, price bubbles, and crashes. The findings highlight the importance of incorporating psychological factors into economic models to guide policies that foster market stability and more informed financial decision-making.</description>

      <title>A Characterization of Reny's Weakly Sequentially Rational Equilibrium through $\varepsilon$-Perfect $\gamma$-Weakly Sequentially Rational Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A weakening of sequential rationality of sequential equilibrium yields Reny's (1992) weakly sequentially rational equilibrium (WSRE) in extensive-form games. WSRE requires Kreps and Wilson's (1982) consistent assessment to satisfy global rationality of nonconvex payoff functions at every information set reachable by a player's own strategy. The consistent assessment demands a convergent sequence of totally mixed behavioral strategy profiles and associated Bayesian beliefs. Nonetheless, due to the nonconvexity, proving the existence of WSRE required invoking the existence of a normal-form perfect equilibrium, which is sufficient but not necessary. Furthermore, Reny's WSRE definition does not fully specify how to construct the convergent sequence. To overcome these challenges, this paper develops a characterization of WSRE through $\varepsilon$-perfect $\gamma$-WSRE with local sequential rationality, which is accomplished by incorporating an extra behavioral strategy profile. For any given $\gamma&gt;0$, we generate a perfect $\gamma$-WSRE as a limit point of a sequence of $\varepsilon_k$-perfect $\gamma$-WSRE with $\varepsilon_k\to 0$. A WSRE is then acquired from a limit point of a sequence of perfect $\gamma_q$-WSRE with $\gamma_q\to 0$. This characterization enables analytical identification of all WSREs in small extensive-form games and a direct proof of the existence of WSRE. An application of the characterization yields a polynomial system that serves as a necessary and sufficient condition for verifying whether a totally mixed assessment is an $\varepsilon$-perfect $\gamma$-WSRE. Exploiting the system, we devise differentiable path-following methods to compute WSREs by establishing the existence of smooth paths, which are secured from the equilibrium systems of barrier and penalty extensive-form games. Comprehensive numerical results further confirm the efficiency of the methods.</description>

      <title>Eliciting Informed Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If people find it costly to evaluate the options available to them, their choices may not directly reveal their preferences. Yet, it is conceivable that a researcher can still learn about a population's preferences with careful experiment design. We formalize the researcher's problem in a model of robust mechanism design where it is costly for individuals to learn about how much they value a product. We characterize the statistics that the researcher can identify, and find that they are quite restricted. Finally, we apply our positive results to social choice and propose a way to combat uninformed voting.</description>

      <title>A General Theory of Risk Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new paradigm for risk sharing that generalizes earlier models based on discrete agents and extends them to allow for sharing risk within a continuum of agents. Agents are represented by points of a measure space and have potentially heterogeneous risk preferences modeled by risk measures. The existence of risk minimizing allocations is proved when constrained to satisfy economically convincing conditions. In the unconstrained case, we derive the dual representation of the value function using a Strassen-type theorem for the weak-star topology. These results are illustrated by explicit formulas when risk preferences are within the family of entropic and expected shortfall risk measures.</description>

      <title>The Banks Set and the Bipartisan Set May Be Disjoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01881v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tournament solutions play an important role within social choice theory and the mathematical social sciences at large. We construct a tournament of order 36 for which the Banks set and the bipartisan set are disjoint. This implies that refinements of the Banks set, such as the minimal extending set and the tournament equilibrium set, can also be disjoint from the bipartisan set.</description>

      <title>Independence of Irrelevant Decisions in Stochastic Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04827v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate stochasticity in choice behavior across diverse decisions. Each decision is modeled as a menu of actions with associated outcomes, and a stochastic choice rule assigns probabilities to actions based on the outcome profile. We characterize rules whose predictions are not affected by whether or not additional, irrelevant decisions are included in the model. Our main result is that such rules form the parametric family of mixed-logit rules.</description>

      <title>Categorize and randomize: a permissive model of stochastic choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model stochastic choices with categorization. The agent preliminarly groups alternatives in homogenous disjoint classes, then randomly chooses one class and randomly picks an item within the selected class. We give a formal definition of a choice generated by this procedure, and provide an axiomatic characterization. The characterizing properties allow an external analyst to elicit that categorization is applied. In a broader interpretation, the model allows to describe the observed choice as the composition of independent subchoices. This composition preserves rationalizability by Random Utility Maximization. A generalization of the model subsumes Luce model and Nested Logit.</description>

      <title>Comparative Statics for the Subjective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study robust comparative statics for risk-averse subjective expected utility (SEU) maximizers. Starting with a finite menu of actions totally ordered by sensitivity to risk, I identify the transformations of her menu that lead a decision-maker to take a lower action, regardless of her particular utility function or belief. My main results reveal that a robust decrease in the action selected is guaranteed by an intuitive steepening/tilting of the actions' payoffs and necessitates a slightly weaker such steepening. This basic pattern generalizes to a broad class of non-EU preferences.</description>

      <title>On The Merit Principle in Strategic Exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New fairness notions in align with the merit principle are proposed for designing exchange rules. We show that, for an obviously strategy-proof, efficient and individually rational rule, an upper bound of fairness attainable is that, if two agents possess objects considered the best by all others divided into two equal groups, then at least one receives her favorite object. Notably, it is not possible to guarantee them both receiving favorites. Our results thus indicate an unambiguous trade-off between incentives and fairness in the design of exchange rules.</description>

      <title>Equilibria under Dynamic Benchmark Consistency in Non-Stationary Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate and study a general time-varying multi-agent system where players repeatedly compete under incomplete information. Our work is motivated by scenarios commonly observed in online advertising and retail marketplaces, where agents and platform designers optimize algorithmic decision-making in dynamic competitive settings. In these systems, no-regret algorithms that provide guarantees relative to \emph{static} benchmarks can perform poorly and the distributions of play that emerge from their interaction do not correspond anymore to static solution concepts such as coarse correlated equilibria. Instead, we analyze the interaction of \textit{dynamic benchmark} consistent policies that have performance guarantees relative to \emph{dynamic} sequences of actions, and through a novel \textit{tracking error} notion we delineate when their empirical joint distribution of play can approximate an evolving sequence of static equilibria. In systems that change sufficiently slowly (sub-linearly in the horizon length), we show that the resulting distributions of play approximate the sequence of coarse correlated equilibria, and apply this result to establish improved welfare bounds for smooth games. On a similar vein, we formulate internal dynamic benchmark consistent policies and establish that they approximate sequences of correlated equilibria. Our findings therefore suggest that in a broad range of multi-agent systems where non-stationarity is prevalent, algorithms designed to compete with dynamic benchmarks can improve both individual and welfare guarantees, and their emerging dynamics approximate a sequence of static equilibrium outcomes.</description>
