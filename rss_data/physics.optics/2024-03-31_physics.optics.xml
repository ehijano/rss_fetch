      <title>Generation of Spatially Coherent Light at Extreme Ultraviolet Wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spatial coherence measurements of extreme-ultraviolet light generated using the process of high-harmonic upconversion of a femtosecond laser. Using a phase-matched hollow-fiber geometry, the generated beam is found to exhibit essentially full spatial coherence. The coherence of this laser-like EUV source is demonstrated by recording Gabor holograms of small objects. This work demonstrates the capability to do EUV holography using a tabletop experimental setup. Such an EUV source, with low divergence and high spatial coherence, can be used for experiments such as high-precision metrology, inspection of optical components for EUV lithography (1), and for microscopy and holography (2) with nanometer resolution. Furthermore, the short time duration of the EUV radiation (a few femtoseconds) will enable EUV microscopy and holography to be performed with ultrahigh time resolution.</description>

      <title>Infrared Vertical External Cavity Surface Emitting Laser Threshold Magnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers have considerable promise as high sensitivity magnetometers, however are commonly limited by inefficient collection and low contrasts. Laser threshold magnetometry (LTM) enables efficient collection and high contrasts, providing a path towards higher sensitivity magnetometry. We demonstrate an infrared LTM using an ensemble of NV centers in a single crystal diamond plate integrated into a vertical external cavity surface emitting laser. The laser was tuned to the spin dependent absorption line of the NV centers, allowing for optical readout by monitoring the laser output power. We demonstrate a magnetic sensitivity of 7.5~nT/$\sqrt{\textit{Hz}}$ in the frequency range between 10 and 50 Hz. Furthermore, the contrast and the projected PSNL sensitivity are shown to improve significantly by operating close to the lasing threshold, achieving 18.4\% and 26.6~pT/$\sqrt{\textit{Hz}}$ near threshold. What's more, an unexpected saturable absorption phenomenon was observed near threshold, which enhanced the contrast and projected PSNL sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Sub-wavelength coherent imaging of periodic samples using a 13.5 nm tabletop high harmonic light source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent diffractive imaging is unique as the only route for achieving diffraction-limited spatial resolution in the extreme ultraviolet and X-ray regions, limited only by the wavelength of the light. Recently, advances in coherent short wavelength light sources, coupled with progress in algorithm development, have significantly enhanced the power of x-ray imaging. However, to date, high-fidelity diffraction imaging of periodic objects has been a challenge because the scattered light is concentrated in isolated peaks. Here, we use tabletop 13.5nm high harmonic beams to make two significant advances. First we demonstrate high-quality imaging of an extended, nearly-periodic sample for the first time. Second, we achieve sub-wavelength spatial resolution (12.6nm) imaging at short wavelengths, also for the first time. The key to both advances is a novel technique called modulus enforced probe, which enables robust, quantitative, reconstructions of periodic objects. This work is important for imaging next generation nano-engineered devices.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As photonic technologies continue to grow in multidimensional aspects, integrated photonics holds a unique position and continuously presents enormous possibilities to research communities. Applications span across data centers, environmental monitoring, medical diagnosis, and highly compact communication components, with further possibilities growing endlessly. Here, we provide a review of state of the art integrated photonic sensors operating in near and mid infrared wavelength regions on various material platforms. Among different materials, architectures, and technologies leading the way for on chip sensors, we discuss optical sensing principles commonly applied to biochemical and gas sensing. Our focus is particularly on passive and active optical waveguides, including dispersion engineered metamaterial based structures an essential approach for enhancing the interaction between light and analytes in chip scale sensors. We harness a diverse array of cutting edge sensing technologies, heralding a revolutionary on chip sensing paradigm. Our arsenal includes refractive index based sensing, plasmonic, and spectroscopy, forging an unparalleled foundation for innovation and precision. Furthermore, we include a brief discussion of recent trends and computational concepts incorporating Artificial Intelligence &amp; Machine Learning (AI/ML) and deep learning approaches over the past few years to improve the qualitative and quantitative analysis of sensor measurements.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal surface plasmons in angularly varying, magnetized, metasurface tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically and numerically study the nonreciprocal surface waves guided by a magnetized metasurface tube. When applying the magnetic bias perpendicularly to the cylinder axis, the conductivity profile cross-section is nonuniform, which enables us to obtain pronounced nonreciprocal modes with different field distributions for propagation in opposite directions due to the coupling between different values of orbital angular momentum. We show that this property can be leveraged for directional power delivery when changing the source location, and we study the isolation ratio as a function of different parameters. The simple, continuous dependence of the isolation on the direction of magnetization allows simple yet robust control over the wave propagation properties.</description>

      <title>Reflectionless propagation of beams through a stratified medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reflectionless potentials following the prescription of Kay and Moses allow for total transmission of incoming waves of any kinetic energy. The optical analogue of such potentials occur as dielectric stratified media that can offer null reflectivity and near total transmission over a large range of incidence angles and wavelengths. In a previous work (S. Dutta Gupta and G. S. Agarwal, Opt. Express 15, 9614-9624, 2007), this was demonstrated for linearly polarized plane waves. We extend the earlier work valid for plane waves to structured beams to show near-total transmission of beams across the reflectionless dielectric profile. The analysis is based on the angular spectrum decomposition treating the beam as a collection of plane waves. Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian beams are shown to be transmitted through the film with &lt;1% reflection in most scenarios. We also discuss the superlative performance of our proposed profile in preserving the beam shape during transmission comparing these results to a conventional lambda/2 antireflection coating.</description>

      <title>Towards Reverse-Engineering the Brain: Brain-Derived Neuromorphic Computing Approach with Photonic, Electronic, and Ionic Dynamicity in 3D integrated circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The human brain has immense learning capabilities at extreme energy efficiencies and scale that no artificial system has been able to match. For decades, reverse engineering the brain has been one of the top priorities of science and technology research. Despite numerous efforts, conventional electronics-based methods have failed to match the scalability, energy efficiency, and self-supervised learning capabilities of the human brain. On the other hand, very recent progress in the development of new generations of photonic and electronic memristive materials, device technologies, and 3D electronic-photonic integrated circuits (3D EPIC ) promise to realize new brain-derived neuromorphic systems with comparable connectivity, density, energy-efficiency, and scalability. When combined with bio-realistic learning algorithms and architectures, it may be possible to realize an 'artificial brain' prototype with general self-learning capabilities. This paper argues the possibility of reverse-engineering the brain through architecting a prototype of a brain-derived neuromorphic computing system consisting of artificial electronic, ionic, photonic materials, devices, and circuits with dynamicity resembling the bio-plausible molecular, neuro/synaptic, neuro-circuit, and multi-structural hierarchical macro-circuits of the brain based on well-tested computational models. We further argue the importance of bio-plausible local learning algorithms applicable to the neuromorphic computing system that capture the flexible and adaptive unsupervised and self-supervised learning mechanisms central to human intelligence. Most importantly, we emphasize that the unique capabilities in brain-derived neuromorphic computing prototype systems will enable us to understand links between specific neuronal and network-level properties with system-level functioning and behavior.</description>

      <title>Integrated quantum communication network and vibration sensing in optical fibers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Communication and sensing technology play a significant role in various aspects of modern society. A seamless combination of the communication and the sensing systems is desired and have attracted great interests in recent years. Here, we propose and demonstrate a network architecture that integrating the downstream quantum access network (DQAN) and vibration sensing in optical fibers. By encoding the key information of eight users simultaneously on the sidemode quantum states of a single laser source and successively separating them by a filter network, we achieve a secure and efficient DQAN with an average key rate of 1.88*10^4 bits per second over an 80 km single-mode fiber. Meanwhile, the vibration location with spatial resolution of 120 m, 24 m, and 8 m at vibration frequencies of 100 Hz, 1 kHz, and 10 kHz, respectively, is implemented with the existing infrastructure of the DQAN system. Our integrated architecture provides a viable and cost-effective solution for building a secure quantum communication sensor network, and open the way for expanding the functionality of quantum communication networks.</description>

      <title>Depth from Defocus Technique for High Number Densities and Non-spherical Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Depth from Defocus (DFD) imaging technique for measuring the size and number concentration of particles in a dispersed two-phase flow has up to now been restricted to relatively sparse particle densities and to identifying only spherical particles. The present study examines two advancements to the technique, widening its range of application significantly. The first advancement introduces an image processing procedure which can identify and size particle images which are overlapping. This increases the tolerable number concentration of particles which can be identified and processed within the measurement volume. The second advancement explores the possibility of determining the size and position of non-spherical particles within an observation volume. Both advancements build on recent theoretical work, utilizing not only the gray level of the blurred, out-of-focus images, but also the gradient of the gray level normal to the nominal particle or particle ensemble contour. This gray-level gradient is used to estimate the width of the blur kernel, which is assumed to remain Gaussian.
  These enhancements are experimentally validated using a dedicated apparatus in which particles of known size, shape and degree of overlapping images can be systematically varied. This experimental setup provides benchmark data to quantify the accuracy and limitations of the processing algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear electrodynamics proposed by Bandos, Lechner, Sorokin and Townsend is a remarkable theory that unifies Maxwell, Bialynicki-Birula and ModMax theories, which are known theories invariant under conformal transformations and electromagnetic duality transformations. In the Bandos-Lechner-Sorokin-Townsend nonlinear electrodynamics, we calculate the energy flux density, dispersion relations, refractive indices, phase and group velocities of plane waves as well as the changes of the photon wavelength in the Compton scattering process in the presence of a constant uniform electromagnetic background. Our results are useful for testing and constraining this new theory of nonlinear electrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonic Time crystals (PTC) arise in time-modulated media when the frequency of modulation of permittivity is on the order of twice the frequency of light and are manifested by the generation and amplification of so-called time reversed waves propagating in the direction opposite to the incoming light. Superficially, the observed phenomenon bears resemblance to the widely known phenomena of optical parametric generation (OPG) and amplification (OPA) using second or third order optical nonlinearities. I show that while indeed the same physical mechanism underpins both PTC and OPA , the difference arises from the boundary conditions. Thus , while dispersion for both PTC and OPA exhibit the same bandgap in momentum space, only in the case of PTC can one have propagation in that bandgap with exponential amplification. I also show that PTC can be engineered with both second and third order nonlinearities, and that rather unexpectedly, modulating permittivity on the ultrafast (few fs) rate is not a necessity, and that one can emulate all the PTC features using materials with a few picoseconds response time commensurate with the propagation time through the medium.</description>

Abstract: The problem of resolving point-like light sources not only serves as a benchmark for optical resolution but also holds various practical applications ranging from microscopy to astronomy. In this research, we aim to resolve two thermal sources sharing arbitrary mutual coherence using the spatial mode demultiplexing technique. Our analytical study includes scenarios where the coherence and the emission rate depend on the separation between the sources, and is not limited to the faint sources limit. We consider the fluorescence of two interacting dipoles to demonstrate that the dependence of emission characteristics on the parameter of interest can boost the sensitivity of the estimation and noticeably prolong the duration of information decay.</description>

Abstract: We report the generation of the 5th harmonic of Ti:sapphire, at 160 nm, with more than 4~$\mu$J of pulse energy, and a pulse length of 37 fs with a 1 kHz repetition rate. The VUV pulses are produced using Four-Wave Difference Frequency Mixing (FWDFM) in a helium-filled stretched Hollow-Core Fiber (HCF), driven by a pump at 267 nm and seeded at 800 nm. Guided by simulations using Luna.jl, we are able to optimize the process carefully. The result is a conversion efficiency of $\sim$10$\%$ from the 267 nm pump beam, rivaling the efficient optical mixing schemes in nonlinear crystals.</description>

Abstract: Structurally anisotropic materials are ubiquitous in several application fields, yet their accurate optical characterization remains challenging due to the lack of general models linking their scattering coefficients to the macroscopic transport observables, and the need to combine multiple measurements to retrieve their direction-dependent values. Here, we present an improved method for the experimental determination of light transport tensor coefficients from the diffusive rates measured along all three directions, based on transient transmittance measurements and a generalized Monte Carlo model. We apply our method to the characterization of light transport properties in two common anisotropic materials - polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tape and paper - highlighting the magnitude of systematic deviations that are typically incurred when neglecting anisotropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent studies, it has been discovered that phonons can carry angular momentum, leading to a series of investigations into systems with 3-fold rotation symmetry. However, for systems with 2-fold screw rotational symmetry, such as $\alpha$-MoO$_3$, there has been no relevant discussion. In this paper, we investigated the pseudoangular momentum of phonons in crystals with 2-fold screw rotational symmetry. Taking $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ as an example, we explain the selection rules in circularly polarized Raman experiments resulting from pseudoangular momentum conservation, providing important guidance for experiments. This study of pseudoangular momentum in $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ opens up a new degree of freedom for its potential applications, expanding into new application domains.</description>

Abstract: Verification of quantum computation is a task to efficiently check whether an output given from a quantum computer is correct. Existing verification protocols conducted between a quantum computer to be verified and a verifier necessitate quantum communication to unconditionally detect any malicious behavior of the quantum computer solving any promise problem in ${\sf BQP}$. In this paper, we remove the necessity of the communication of qubits by proposing a "physically classical" verification protocol in which the verifier just sends coherent light to the quantum computer.</description>
