      <title>Fenchel's conjecture on NEC groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical discovery known as Fenchel's conjecture and proved in the 1950s, shows that every co-compact Fuchsian group $F$ has a normal subgroup of finite index isomorphic to the fundamental group of a compact unbordered orientable surface, or in algebraic terms, that $F$ has a normal subgroup of finite index that contains no element of finite order other than the identity. In this paper we initiate and make progress on an extension of Fenchel's conjecture by considering the following question: Does every planar non-Euclidean crystallographic group $\Gamma$ containing transformations that reverse orientation have a normal subgroup of finite index isomorphic to the fundamental group of a compact unbordered non-orientable surface? We answer this question in the affirmative in the case where the orbit space of $\Gamma$ is a nonorientable surface, and also in the case where this orbit space is a bordered orientable surface of positive genus. In the case where the genus of the quotient is $0$, we have an affirmative answer in many subcases, but the question is still open for others.</description>

      <title>Modular companions in planar one-dimensional equisymmetric strata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider, in the moduli space of Riemann surfaces of a fixed genus, the subset of surfaces with non-trivial automorphisms. Of special interest are the numerous subsets of surfaces admitting an action of a given finite group, $G$, acting with a specific signature. In a previous study we declared two Riemann surfaces to be \emph{modular companions} if they have topologically equivalent $G$ actions, and that their $G$ quotients are conformally equivalent orbifolds. In this article we present a geometrically-inspired measure to decide whether two modular companions are conformally equivalent (or how different), respecting the $G$ action. Along the way, we construct a moduli space for surfaces with the specified $G$ action and associated equivariant tilings on these surfaces. We specifically apply the ideas to planar, finite group actions whose quotient orbifold is a sphere with four cone points.</description>

      <title>The smoothness of the real projective deformation spaces of orderable Coxeter 3-polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Coxeter polytope is a convex polytope in a real projective space equipped with linear reflections in its facets, such that the orbits of the polytope under the action of the group generated by the linear reflections tessellate a convex domain in the real projective space. Vinberg proved that the group generated by these reflections acts properly discontinuously on the interior of the convex domain, thus inducing a natural orbifold structure on the polytope.
  In this paper, we consider labeled combinatorial polytopes $\mathcal{G}$ associated to such orbifolds, and study the deformation space $\mathcal{C} (\mathcal{G})$ of Coxeter polytopes realizing $\mathcal{G}$. We prove that if $\mathcal{G}$ is orderable and of normal type then the deformation space $\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{G})$ of real projective Coxeter 3-polytopes realizing $\mathcal{G}$ is a smooth manifold. This result is achieved by analyzing a natural map of $\mathcal{C} (\mathcal{G})$ into a smooth manifold called the realization space.</description>

      <title>Second bounded cohomology of knot quandles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the bounded cohomology of quandles and its applications to knot theory. We establish two key results that provide sufficient conditions for the infinite dimensionality of the second bounded cohomology of quandles. The first condition involves a subspace of homogeneous group quasimorphisms on the inner automorphism group of the quandle, whereas the second condition concerns the vanishing of the stable commutator length on a subgroup of this inner automorphism group. As topological applications, we show that the second bounded cohomology of the quandle of any non-split link whose link group is non-solvable as well as the quandle of any split link, is infinite dimensional. From these results, we conclude that the second bounded cohomology of the knot quandle can be used to detect the unknot. On the algebraic side, we prove that the second bounded cohomology of a free product of quandles is infinite dimensional if the inner automorphism group of at least one of the free factors is amenable. This leads to the result that the second bounded cohomology of free quandles of rank greater than one, as well as their canonical quotients, is infinite dimensional.</description>

      <title>Cohomology of symmetric stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct decompositions of:
  (1) the cohomology of smooth stacks,
  (2) the Borel--Moore homology of $0$-shifted symplectic stacks, and
  (3) the vanishing cycle cohomology of $(-1)$-shifted symplectic stacks,
  under the assumption that a good moduli space exists and the tangent space has a point-wise orthogonal structure. This holds for many moduli stacks of interest, such as the moduli stack of semistable $G$-bundles and (twisted) $G$-Higgs bundles on a curve and the $G$-character stacks of oriented closed 2-manifolds and various 3-manifolds.
  For smooth stacks, we show that their cohomology decomposes into the intersection cohomology of the good moduli space of the stack of graded points via the cohomological Hall induction map. This generalizes and provides a new proof of Meinhardt--Reineke's theorem identifying the cohomological BPS invariant for symmetric quivers with the intersection cohomology of the good moduli space.
  For $0$-shifted symplectic stacks, we define a pure Hodge module on the good moduli space, the BPS sheaf, and prove that the Borel--Moore homology of the stack decomposes into the cohomology of the BPS sheaves on the good moduli space of the stack of graded points. As an application, we propose a formulation of the topological mirror symmetry conjecture for $G$-Higgs bundles for semisimple groups $G$ in the style of Hausel--Thaddeus.
  For $(-1)$-shifted symplectic stacks, we introduce a mixed Hodge module, also referred to as the BPS sheaf, and prove a decomposition theorem analogous to the one for $0$-shifted symplectic stacks, but now for the vanishing cycle cohomology. As a particular case, we establish the cohomological integrality theorem for $3$-Calabi--Yau categories admitting a certain orientation data, generalizing the result of Davison and Meinhardt for quivers with potentials.</description>

      <title>Ghost polygons, Poisson bracket and convexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04380v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The moduli space of Anosov representations of a surface group in a semisimple group, which is an open set in the character variety, admits many more natural functions than the regular functions. We will study in particular length functions and, correlation functions. Our main result is a formula that computes the Poisson bracket of those functions using some combinatorial devices called {\em ghost polygons} and {\em ghost bracket} encoded in a formal algebra called {\em ghost algebra} related in some cases to the swapping algebra introduced by the second author. As a consequence of our main theorem, we show that the set of those functions -- length and correlation -- is stable under the Poisson bracket. We give two applications: firstly in the presence of positivity we prove the convexity of length functions, generalising a result of Kerckhoff in Teichm\"uller space, secondly we exhibit subalgebras of commuting functions. An important tool is the study of {\em uniformly hyperbolic bundles} which is a generalisation of Anosov representations beyond periodicity.</description>

Abstract: We prove that all lattices of Sp(2n,R), except those commensurable with Sp(4k+2,Z) when n=2k+1, contain the image of infinitely many mapping class group orbits of Zariski-dense maximal representation that are continuous deformations of maximal diagonal representations. In particular, we show that Sp(4k,Z) contain Zariski-dense surface subgroups for all k.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we find the first infinite family of hyperbolic 3-manifolds which admit tight contact structures but do not have any tight projectively Anosov flow. These manifolds are obtained as rational surgeries on the figure eight knot.</description>

      <title>Anosov flows in dimension 3: an outside look</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These notes were intended as support material for a minicourse on Anosov flows in the conference "Symplectic geometry and Anosov flows'' which took place in Heidelberg in July 2024 organized by Peter Albers, Jonathan Bowden and Agust\'in Moreno. I took the invitation to present the subject as asking from an outsider view of the subject, given the fact that my research uses both ideas and results from the theory of Anosov flows. The point of view of the course is to provide an overview of the main results and questions in the subject, with emphasis on the interaction with topology, geometry, specially symplectic geometry and contact aspects of the theory. Some detail is given in the presentation of the Barbot-Fenley theory of leaf spaces. Hopefully the notes will contribute in gaining a working knowledge of the theory and its many beautiful connections.</description>
