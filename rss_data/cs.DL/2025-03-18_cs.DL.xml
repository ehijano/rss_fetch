      <title>Evaluating Multilingual Metadata Quality in Crossref</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction: Scholarly research spans multiple languages, making multilingual metadata crucial for organizing and accessing knowledge across linguistic boundaries. These multilingual metadata already exist and are propagated throughout scholarly publishing infrastructure, but the extent to which they are correctly recorded, or how they affect metadata quality more broadly is little understood.
  Methods: Our study quantifies the prevalence of multilingual records across a sample of publisher metadata and offers an understanding of their completeness, quality, and alignment with metadata standards. Utilizing the Crossref API to generate a random sample of 519,665 journal article records, we categorize each record into four distinct language types: English monolingual, non-English monolingual, multilingual, and uncategorized. We then investigate the prevalence of programmatically-detectable errors and the prevalence of multilingual records within the sample to determine whether multilingualism influences the quality of article metadata.
  Results: We find that English-only records are still in the vast majority among metadata found in Crossref, but that, while non-English and multilingual records present unique challenges, they are not a source of significant metadata quality issues and, in few instances, are more complete or correct than English monolingual records.
  Discussion &amp; Conclusion: Our findings contribute to discussions surrounding multilingualism in scholarly communication, serving as a resource for researchers, publishers, and information professionals seeking to enhance the global dissemination of knowledge and foster inclusivity in the academic landscape.</description>

      <title>Arab Spring's Impact on Science through the Lens of Scholarly Attention, Funding, and Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Arab Spring is a major socio-political movement that reshaped democratic aspirations in the Middle East and North Africa, attracting global attention through news, social media, and academic discourse. However, its consequences on the academic landscape in the region are still unclear. Here, we conduct the first study of scholarly attention toward 10 target countries affected by the Arab Spring by analyzing more than 25 million articles published from 2002 to 2019. We find that changes in scholarly attention were unevenly distributed among target countries, with Egypt attracting the most attention. We reveal strong correlations between increases in scholarly attention given by source countries and increases in funding for research about the target countries as well as increased immigration of scholars from the affected region to them. Notably, our analysis reveals Saudi Arabia's positioning as a key player, among Western nations, that shapes research in the region.</description>

      <title>The UN Security Council debates 1992-2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10969</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.10969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an updated dataset containing 106,302 speeches held in the public meetings of the UN Security Council (UNSC) between 1992 and 2023. The dataset is based on publicly available meeting transcripts with the S/PV document symbol and includes the full substance of individual speeches as well as automatically extracted and manually corrected metadata on the speaker, the position of the speech in the sequence of speeches of a meeting, and the date of the speech. After contextualizing the dataset in recent research on the UNSC, the paper presents descriptive statistics on UNSC meetings and speeches that characterize the period covered by the dataset. Data highlight the extensive presence of the UN bureaucracy in UNSC meetings as well as an emerging trend towards more lengthy open UNSC debates. These open debates cover key issues that have emerged only during the period that is covered by the dataset, for example the debates relating to Women, Peace and Security or Climate-related Disasters. The corpus is available online: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/KGVSYH</description>

      <title>A Generative AI-driven Metadata Modelling Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since decades, the modelling of metadata has been core to the functioning of any academic library. Its importance has only enhanced with the increasing pervasiveness of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven information activities and services which constitute a library's outreach. However, with the rising importance of metadata, there arose several outstanding problems with the process of designing a library metadata model impacting its reusability, crosswalk and interoperability with other metadata models. This paper posits that the above problems stem from an underlying thesis that there should only be a few core metadata models which would be necessary and sufficient for any information service using them, irrespective of the heterogeneity of intra-domain or inter-domain settings. To that end, this paper advances a contrary view of the above thesis and substantiates its argument in three key steps. First, it introduces a novel way of thinking about a library metadata model as an ontology-driven composition of five functionally interlinked representation levels from perception to its intensional definition via properties. Second, it introduces the representational manifoldness implicit in each of the five levels which cumulatively contributes to a conceptually entangled library metadata model. Finally, and most importantly, it proposes a Generative AI-driven Human-Large Language Model (LLM) collaboration based metadata modelling approach to disentangle the entanglement inherent in each representation level leading to the generation of a conceptually disentangled metadata model. Throughout the paper, the arguments are exemplified by motivating scenarios and examples from representative libraries handling cancer information.</description>

      <title>Cultural Differences and Perverse Incentives in Science Create a Bad Mix: Exploring Country-Level Publication Bias in Select ACM Conferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17150v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the era of big science, many national governments are helping to build well-funded teams of scientists to serve nationalistic ambitions, providing financial incentives for certain outcomes for purposes other than advancing science. That in turn can impact the behavior of scientists and create distortions in publication rates, frequency, and publication venues targeted. To that end, we provide evidence that indicates significant inequality using standard Gini Index metrics in the publication rates of individual scientists across various groupings (e.g. country, institution type, ranking-level) based on an intensive analysis of thousands of papers published in several well-known ACM conferences (HRI, IUI, KDD, CHI, SIGGRAPH, UIST, and UBICOMP) over 15 years between 2010 to 2024. Furthermore, scientists who were affiliated with the top-5 countries (in terms of research expenditure) were found to be contributing significantly more to the inequality in publication rates than others, which raises a number of questions for the scientific community. We discuss some of those questions later in the paper. We also detected several examples in the dataset of potential serious ethical problems in publications likely caused by such incentive systems. Finally, a topic modeling analysis revealed that some countries are pursuing a much narrower range of scientific topics relative to others, indicating those incentives may also be limiting genuine scientific curiosity. In summary, our findings raise awareness of systems put in place by certain national governments that may be eroding the pursuit of truth through science and gradually undermining the integrity of the global scientific community.</description>
