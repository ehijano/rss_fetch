      <title>Great Short History of Microbiology Development as a Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of microorganisms, or microbiology, has demonstrated significant development since its inception and is currently a key field of biological sciences that has a huge impact on modern society and scientific research. Over the centuries, this discipline has undergone significant changes, shaping our understanding of infectious diseases and food safety. Starting from the simplest observations of microscopic organisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa, and ending with modern molecular and genomic research methods. This article describes a brief historical path of microbiology development. The heuristic, morphological, physiological, immunological, and molecular genetic stages are the main periods into which the development of this science is traditionally divided, despite the lack of full-fledged and precise boundaries between them.</description>

      <title>Active waves from non-reciprocity and cytoplasmic exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pattern formation in active biological matter typically arises from the feedback between chemical concentration fields and mechanical stresses. The actomyosin cortex of cells is an archetypal example of an active thin film that displays such patterns. Here, we show how pulsatory patterns emerge in a minimal model of the actomyosin cortex with a single stress-regulating chemical species that exchanges material with the cytoplasm via a linear turnover reaction. Deriving a low-dimensional amplitude-phase model, valid for a one-dimensional periodic domain and a spherical surface, we show that nonlinear waves arise from a secondary parity-breaking bifurcation that originates from the nonreciprocal interaction between spatial modes of the concentration field. Numerical analysis confirms these analytical predictions, and also reveals analogous pulsatory patterns on impermeable domains. Our study provides a generic route to the emergence of nonreciprocity-driven pulsatory patterns that can be controlled by both the strength of activity and the turnover rate.</description>

      <title>Subcellular nano-chemical characterization in photothermal spectroscopic imaging of antimicrobial interaction in model system Bacillus subtilis &amp; vancomycin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The power of photothermal spectroscopic imaging to visualize antimicrobial interaction on the surface of individual bacteria cells has been demonstrated on the model system Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) and vancomycin using mid-infrared photo-induced force microscopy (PiF-IR, also mid-IR PiFM). High-resolution PiF contrasts obtained by merging subsequent PiF-IR scans at two different illumination frequencies revealed chemical details of cell wall destruction after 30 and 60 min incubation with vancomycin with a spatial resolution of $\approx 5$ nm. This approach compensates local intensity variations induced by near-field coupling of the illuminating electric field with nanostructured surfaces, which appear in single-frequency contrasts in photothermal imaging methods, as shown by [Anindo et al., J. Phys. Chem C, 2025, 129, 4517]. Spectral shifts associated with hydrogen bond formation between vancomycin and the N-acyl-D-Ala4-D-Ala5 termini in the peptidoglycan cell wall have been observed in chemometrics of PiF-IR spectra from treated and untreated B. subtilis harvested after 30 min from the same experiment. The vancomyin interaction in the piecrust of a progressing septum is located with $\approx 10$ nm resolution exemplarily using PiF contrasts of three selected bands of a PiF-IR hyperspectral scan of an individual B. subtilis cell harvested after 30 min incubation. Our results provide a new perspective for visualizing the chemical interaction of antibiotics on the surface of microbes with few nanometer resolution.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Fast Ewald Summation with Prolates for Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast Ewald summation is the most widely used approach for computing long-range Coulomb interactions in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. While the asymptotic scaling is nearly optimal, its performance on parallel architectures is dominated by the global communication required for the underlying fast Fourier transform (FFT). Here, we develop a novel method, ESP - Ewald summation with prolate spheroidal wave functions (PSWFs) - that, for a fixed precision, sharply reduces the size of this transform by performing the Ewald split via a PSWF. In addition, PSWFs minimize the cost of spreading and interpolation steps that move information between the particles and the underlying uniform grid. We have integrated the ESP method into two widely-used open-source MD packages: LAMMPS and GROMACS. Detailed benchmarks show that this reduces the cost of computing far-field electrostatic interactions by an order of magnitude, leading to better strong scaling with respect to number of cores. The total execution time is reduced by a factor of 2 to 3 when using more than one thousand cores, even after optimally tuning the existing internal parameters in the native codes. We validate the accelerated codes in realistic long-time biological simulations.</description>

      <title>Slow Transition to Low-Dimensional Chaos in Heavy-Tailed Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that synaptic weights in the brain follow heavy-tailed distributions, yet most theoretical analyses of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) assume Gaussian connectivity. We systematically study the activity of RNNs with random weights drawn from biologically plausible L\'evy alpha-stable distributions. While mean-field theory for the infinite system predicts that the quiescent state is always unstable -- implying ubiquitous chaos -- our finite-size analysis reveals a sharp transition between quiescent and chaotic dynamics. We theoretically predict the gain at which the system transitions from quiescent to chaotic dynamics, and validate it through simulations. Compared to Gaussian networks, heavy-tailed RNNs exhibit a broader parameter regime near the edge of chaos, namely a slow transition to chaos. However, this robustness comes with a tradeoff: heavier tails reduce the Lyapunov dimension of the attractor, indicating lower effective dimensionality. Our results reveal a biologically aligned tradeoff between the robustness of dynamics near the edge of chaos and the richness of high-dimensional neural activity. By analytically characterizing the transition point in finite-size networks -- where mean-field theory breaks down -- we provide a tractable framework for understanding dynamics in realistically sized, heavy-tailed neural circuits.</description>

      <title>Automated grading and staging of ovarian cancer using deep learning on the transmission optical microscopy bright-field images of thin biopsy tissue samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ovarian cancer remains a challenging malignancy to diagnose and manage, with prognosis heavily dependent on the stage at detection. Accurate grading and staging, primarily based on histopathological examination of biopsy tissue samples, are crucial for treatment planning and predicting outcomes. However, this manual process is time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability among pathologists. The increasing volume of digital histopathology slides necessitates the development of robust, automated methods to assist in this critical diagnostic step for ovarian cancer. (Methods) This study presents a deep learning framework for the automated prediction of ovarian cancer stage (classified into five categories: 0, I, II, III, IV) using routine histopathological images. We employed a transfer learning approach, fine-tuning a ResNet-101 convolutional neural network pre-trained on ImageNet. The training process incorporated comprehensive data augmentation, weighted random sampling, and class weighting to address dataset characteristics. Hyperparameter optimization for learning rate, dropout rate, and weight decay was performed using a genetic algorithm to enhance model performance and generalization. (Results) Evaluated on an independent test set of ovarian thin tissue brightfield images, the developed model achieved a high overall classification accuracy of 97.62%.</description>

      <title>Computer simulations show that liquid-liquid phase separation enhances self-assembly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates are liquid- or gel-like droplets of proteins and nucleic acids formed at least in part through liquid-liquid phase separation. Condensates enable diverse functions of cells and the pathogens that infect them, including self-assembly reactions. For example, it has been shown that many viruses form condensates within their host cells to compartmentalize capsid assembly and packaging of the viral genome. Yet, the physical principles controlling condensate-mediated self-assembly remain incompletely understood. In this article we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to study the effect of a condensate on the assembly of icosahedral capsids. The capsid subunits are represented by simple shape-based models to enable simulating a wide range of length and time scales, while the condensate is modeled implicitly to study the effects of phase separation independent of the molecular details of biomolecular condensates. Our results show that condensates can significantly enhance assembly rates, yields, and robustness to parameter variations, consistent with previous theoretical predictions. However, extending beyond those predictions, the computational models also show that excluded volume enables control over the number of capsids that assemble within condensates. Moreover, long-lived aberrant off-pathway assembly intermediates can suppress yields within condensates. In addition to elucidating condensate-mediated assembly of viruses and other biological structures, these results may guide the use of condensates as a generic route to enhance and control self-assembly in human-engineered systems.</description>

      <title>Pitch-axis supermanoeuvrability in a biomimetic morphing-wing UAV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.09431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Birds and bats are extremely adept flyers: whether in hunting prey, or evading predators, post-stall manoeuvrability is a characteristic of vital importance. Their performance, in this regard, greatly exceeds that of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) of similar scale. Attempts to attain post-stall manoeuvrability, or supermanoeuvrability, in UAVs have typically focused on thrust-vectoring technology. Here we show that biomimetic wing morphing offers an additional pathway to classical supermanoeuvrability, as well as novel forms of bioinspired post-stall manoeuvrability. Using a state-of-the-art flight simulator, equipped with a multibody model of lifting surface motion and a delay differential equation (Goman-Khrabrov) dynamic stall model for all lifting surfaces, we demonstrate the capability of a biomimetic morphing-wing UAV for two post-stall manoeuvres: a classical rapid nose-pointing-and-shooting (RaNPAS) manoeuvre; and a wall landing manoeuvre inspired by biological ballistic transitions. We develop a guidance method for these manoeuvres, based on parametric variation of nonlinear longitudinal stability profiles, which allows efficient exploration of the space of post-stall manoeuvres in these types of UAVs; and yields insight into effective morphing kinematics to enable these manoeuvres. Our results demonstrate the capability of biomimetic morphing, and morphing control of nonlinear longitudinal stability, to enable advanced forms of transient supermanoeuvrability in UAVs.</description>

      <title>Information bounds production in replicator systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate minimal replicator systems that are able to use information in a functional manner. We consider a population of autocatalytic replicators in a flow reactor that are subject to fluctuating environments. We derive expressions of replicator production in terms of information-theoretic quantities, reflecting separate contributions from environmental uncertainty, side information, and distribution mismatch. We also derive the optimal strategy for preparing replicator concentrations, as well as a universal information-theoretic bound on the increase of productivity. We compare and contrast our findings with existing results, including 'Kelly gambling' in information theory and 'substitutional load' in evolutionary biology. The results are illustrated on a model of real-world self-assembled molecular replicators. In this real-world system, we demonstrate the benefit of internal memory when subjected to environments with temporal correlations, and we propose a plausible experimental setup for detecting the signature of functional information. We briefly discuss the role that information-processing may play in guiding the evolution of prebiotic replicator networks.</description>

      <title>Modeling the prion protein-mediated transport of extracellular vesicles on the neuron surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neurodegenerative diseases are among the leading causes of global mortality, characterized by the progressive deterioration of specific neuron populations, ultimately leading to cognitive decline and dementia. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are believed to play a role in the early stages of these diseases, acting as carriers of pathogens and contributing to neuroinflammation and disease propagation. This study presents a mathematical model aimed at characterizing the movement of EVs bearing prion protein (PrP) on their surface along neuronal surfaces. The model, informed by experimental data, investigates the influence of PrP and actin polymerization on EV transport dynamics and explores the possible interplay between passive and active mechanisms. EVs isolated from non-human astrocytes were analyzed under three conditions: untreated control (Ctrl), neurons treated with Cytochalasin D (CytoD-HN), and EVs treated with Cytochalasin D (CytoD-EV). The mathematical model is data-driven, testing different hypotheses regarding the underlying transport mechanisms. In the CytoD-EV dataset, EV movement was modeled using a flashing Brownian ratchet to represent directed motion. For active transport in the CytoD-HN set, a symmetric periodic potential was used to describe EV rolling along the neuron surface. The Ctrl scenario incorporates both mechanisms, reflecting a more complex transport behavior. A sensitivity analysis and comparison between numerical predictions and experimental data suggest that the model effectively captures key features of EV motion, providing a quantitative framework to interpret different transport regimes. While some variability remains, the approach offers a promising basis for future investigations into the role of cytoskeletal dynamics in EV-mediated disease propagation.</description>

      <title>A General Theory of Abiogenesis: Thermodynamic Selection and the Emergence of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17975v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of life is often approached through the lens of replication, heredity, or molecular specificity. This paper proposes a thermodynamic framework in which the emergence of life is driven by the persistence of reaction pathways that align energetically with fluctuating environmental inputs. We define a reaction viability inequality based on energy input, return, resilience, and expenditure, which selects for persistent chemical configurations without invoking heredity or genetic encoding.
  We further incorporate entropic dynamics and spatial constraints into an augmented persistence function, showing that systems far from equilibrium can simultaneously increase global entropy while supporting localized chemical order. These refinements lead to the development of the Thermodynamic Abiogenesis Likelihood Model (TALM), a probabilistic extension that estimates the likelihood of persistence-driven selection under various prebiotic and planetary scenarios.
  This framework redefines the conditions under which life-like organization may emerge and provides a testable, general theory for abiogenesis grounded in physical law.</description>

      <title>First passage time properties of diffusion with a broad class of stochastic diffusion coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion in a heterogeneous environment or diffusion of a particle that shows conformational fluctuations can be described by Brownian motions with stochastic diffusion coefficients (DCs). In the present study, we investigate first passage time (FPT) properties of diffusion with a broad class of stochastic DCs that are positive and non-zero. We show that for diffusion in one-dimensional semi-infinite domain with an absorbing boundary, the eventual absorption is certain. We also show that compared to diffusion whose DC is the ensemble average of a stochastic DC, in diffusion with the stochastic DC, there are particles that reach the absorbing boundary earlier. The approximate proportion of preceding particles is determined by the probability distribution of the time average of a stochastic DC for a given distance to the absorbing boundary. In addition, when particles begin to reach the absorbing boundary before the time change in a stochastic DC occurs, a stochastic DC with a larger supremum leads to an earlier arrival of particles at the absorbing boundary even if the ensemble averages of stochastic DCs are the same. For ergodic DCs, three more properties are revealed. The mean FPT is infinite. In addition, if particles take a long time to reach the absorbing boundary, the exact proportion of preceding particles is almost zero and the FPT distribution can be approximated by the L\'evy-Smirnov distribution. We show that these three properties of diffusion with an ergodic DC result from the convergence of the time average of the DC to the ensemble average. For three-dimensional diffusion with a spherical absorbing boundary, we obtain essentially the same results, except that the eventual absorption is not certain. Our results suggest that fluctuations in a DC play an important role in diffusion-limited reactions triggered by single molecules in physics, chemistry, or biology.</description>
