      <title>Beyond FINDCHIRP: Breaking the memory wall and optimal FFTs for Gravitational-Wave Matched-Filter Searches with Ratio-Filter Dechirping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A primary bottleneck in modern FFT-based matched-filter searches for gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences is not raw processor throughput, but available memory bandwidth. Standard frequency-domain implementations, such as the FINDCHIRP algorithm, rely on streaming long template waveforms and data from main memory, which leads to significant processor stalling when template durations exceed cache capacities. In this work, we introduce \textit{Ratio-Filter Dechirping} as a solution, an algorithmic restructuring of the matched filter that transforms the operation from a memory-bound Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) into a cache-efficient, compute-bound Finite Impulse Response (FIR) convolution. By utilizing a reference template to remove common orbital phase evolution, we produce slowly changing frequency-domain ratios that can be accurately implemented as short FIR filters. This method delivers a measured speedup of $8\times$ for the core filtering loop used in offline searches and should enable $&gt;10\times$ for low-latency analysis. We find that this approach generalizes to a variety of searches that include physical features such as finite size effects, eccentricity, and precession. By dramatically reducing the computational cost of matched filtering, this approach enables the expansion of searches into dense or high-dimensional parameter spaces, such as those for eccentric or subsolar-mass signals, that are already limited by available computing budgets. Furthermore, this framework provides a natural path for hardware acceleration on GPU architectures.</description>

      <title>Towards a Comprehensive Understanding of Planetary Systems through Population-Level, Large-Scale Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past three decades, exoplanet research has delivered an extensive census of planets spanning a wide range of masses, sizes, and orbital configurations. Despite this progress, the physical interpretation of these populations remains severely limited, as precise constraints on planetary masses, interior structures, and atmospheres are available only for a small, highly selected subset of targets. As a result, most known exoplanets remain physically ambiguous, preventing the construction of robust population-level trends and limiting our understanding of planet formation, evolution, and habitability.
  In the coming decades, missions such as PLATO, Earth 2.0, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will dramatically expand the number of exoplanets detected. However, without a corresponding capability to characterise planetary masses and atmospheres at scale, these discoveries will remain largely detection-driven. Current and planned facilities, including JWST and ELT-class instruments, excel at detailed studies of individual systems but are intrinsically unsuited for large, homogeneous surveys.
  This white paper identifies population-level physical characterisation as a fundamental science challenge for the 2040s and motivates the need for a new observational paradigm. We outline how photonics-enabled, modular telescope architectures can deliver the survey speed, stability, and scalability required to jointly probe planetary interiors and atmospheres across statistically meaningful samples, thereby enabling a comprehensive and physically grounded understanding of planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Uncertainties in Low-Count STIS Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate uncertainty calculations in the calstis pipeline for data in the low-count regime. Due to the low dark rate and read-noise free nature of MAMA detectors, observations of UV-dim sources can result in exposures with 0 or 1 counts in some pixels. In this regime, the "root-N" approximation widely used to calculate uncertainties breaks down, and one must compute Poisson confidence intervals for more accurate uncertainty calculations. The CalCOS pipeline was updated in 2020 to account for these low-count uncertainties. Here, we assess how STIS observations are currently affected by this phenomenon, describe a new Jupyter notebook exploring the issue, and introduce a new utility, stistools.poisson_err, to manually calculate Poisson confidence intervals for 1D STIS spectra. Additionally, we describe a related software bug in the stistools$.$inttag utility, which splits TIME-TAG data into sub-exposures. This newly fixed bug serves as a useful case-study for the proper use of Poisson confidence intervals.</description>

      <title>Development of Electroformed X-ray Optics Bridging Synchrotron Technology and Space Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed X-ray telescope mirrors using an original electroforming replication technique established through the fabrication of millimeter-aperture, ultra-short-focal-length nanofocusing mirrors for synchrotron X-ray microscopy. This paper presents detailed results of X-ray illumination tests of a 60-mm-diameter, full-circumference, double-reflection monolithic electroformed nickel mirror and its Mirror Module Assembly (MMA). The experiments were conducted at the 1-km beamline BL29XUL at SPring-8. To simulate a parallel X-ray beam from celestial sources, we constructed a dedicated evaluation system, the High-Brilliance X-ray Kilometer-long Large-Area Expanded-beam Evaluation System (HBX-KLAEES). Owing to the high photon flux and the quasi-point-like source with a small divergence provided by HBX-KLAEES, the imaging performance was evaluated with high fidelity, resolving both the sharp core and large-angle components of the Point Spread Function (PSF). The results show an extremely sharp core with a Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of 0.7 arcsec and a Half Power Diameter (HPD) of 14 arcsec, even after integration into the MMA. In addition, a positive correlation was found between angular resolution and axial figure error in both the primary and secondary mirror sections, indicating that axial figure errors contribute to image degradation. Based on these results, the MMA was selected as one of the hard X-ray optics for the FOXSI-4 sounding rocket experiment, which performs high-resolution soft and hard X-ray imaging spectroscopy of solar flares and was successfully launched. These results demonstrate the potential for further improvements in angular resolution and the development of high-resolution, ultra-short focal length X-ray optics for small satellites, including CubeSats.</description>

      <title>Gaia serial CTI modelling and radiation damage study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the course of its mission, ESA's Gaia spacecraft has generated a map of the stars of the Galaxy of exquisite detail. While in its L2 orbit, the satellite has been exposed to high energy cosmic rays and solar particles, that caused permanent damage to its CCDs. The main effect of radiation damage on Gaia data is the distortion of its images and spectra, caused by the CCDs charge transfer inefficiency (CTI) during the readout process, that, if not taken into account, can result in inaccurate measurements of a star's location and flux. In this work, the impact of CTI in the serial readout direction, larger than in the parallel due to the presence of CCDs manufacturing defects, has been analysed and modelled. A pixel-based, physically motivated CTI model, CtiPixel, has been developed to characterise the damage in Gaia CCDs. The model has been calibrated using dedicated serial CTI diagnostic data, taken every 3-4 months over the course of the mission. The model is shown to be a good representation of the observed signatures of CTI in the calibration datasets, and its parameters reveal significant insights into the nature of the CCD defects generated by space irradiation. The evolution of the damage in the serial direction shows a general small linear increase over time, with sudden step changes after strong solar flares and coronal mass ejections directed towards Earth. The serial CTI showed a further step increase as a consequence of the engineering CCD annealing experiment carried out after the completion of Gaia science observations.</description>

      <title>Silicon-based vacuum window for millimeter and submillimeter-wave astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We designed, fabricated, and characterized the properties of a silicon-based vacuum window suitable for millimeter-wave astrophysical applications. The window, which has a diameter of 124 mm, optically active diameter of 68 mm, and thickness of about 4 mm, gives an average transmittance and reflectance of 99% and 1%, respectively, a fractional bandwidth of 67%. Absorptive loss is below the detection limit of our measurement. The anti-reflection coating is made with laser ablated sub-wavelength structures (SWS), and the measured transmittance and reflectance values agree with modeling based on the measured SWS shapes. The window has been integrated into DESHIMA v2.0, an astrophysics instrument that took year-long observations with the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment.</description>

      <title>Accelerating radio astronomy imaging with RICK: a step towards SKA-Mid and SKA-Low</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The data volumes generated by modern radio interferometers, such as the SKA precursors, present significant computational challenges for imaging pipelines. Addressing the need for high-performance, portable, and scalable software, we present RICK 2.0 (Radio Imaging Code Kernels). This work introduces a novel implementation that leverages the HeFFTe library for distributed Fast Fourier Transforms, ensuring portability across diverse HPC architectures, including multi-core CPUs and accelerators. We validate RICK's correctness and performance against real observational data from both MeerKAT and LOFAR. Our results demonstrate that the HeFFTe-based implementation offers substantial performance advantages, particularly when running on GPUs, and scales effectively with large pixel resolutions and a high number of frequency planes. This new architecture overcomes the critical scaling limitations identified in previous work (Paper II, Paper III), where communication overheads consumed up to 96% of the runtime due to the necessity of communicating the entire grid. This new RICK version drastically reduces this communication impact, representing a scalable and efficient imaging solution ready for the SKA era.</description>

      <title>Weak Lensing Approximation of Wave-optics Effects from General Symmetric Lens Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17486v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing of electromagnetic (EM) waves has yielded many profound discoveries across fundamental physics, astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology. Similar to EM waves, gravitational waves (GWs) can also be lensed. When their wavelength is comparable to the characteristic scale of the lens, wave-optics (WO) effects manifest as frequency-dependent modulations in the GW waveform. These WO features encode valuable information about the lensing system but are challenging to model, especially in the weak lensing regime, which has a larger optical depth than strong lensing. We present a novel and efficient framework to accurately approximate WO effects induced by general symmetric lens profiles. Our method is validated against numerical calculations and recovers the expected asymptotic behavior in both high- and low-frequency limits. Accurate and efficient modeling of WO effects in the weak lensing regime will enable improved lens reconstruction, delensing of standard sirens, and provide a unique probe to the properties of low-mass halos with minimal baryonic content, offering new insights into the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Reconsidering the consistent use of precessing, higher order multipole models for gravitational wave analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing number of gravitational-wave (GW) observations allows for constraints to be placed on the underlying population of black holes; current estimates show that black hole spins are small, with binaries more likely to have comparable component masses. Since general relativistic effects, such as spin-induced orbital precession and higher order multipole moments, are more likely to be observed for asymmetric binary systems, a direct measurement remains unlikely. Nevertheless, we continue to consistently probe these effects by performing Bayesian inference with our most accurate and computationally expensive models. As the number of GW detections increases, it may soon become infeasible to consistently use these models for analyses. In this paper, we provide a selection criterion that determines when less accurate and computationally cheaper models can be used without giving biased estimates for the population properties of black holes in the Universe. We show that when using our selection criterion, comparable estimates can be obtained for the underlying mass and spin distribution of black holes for a simulated "worst-case" scenario population, while reducing the overall cost of performing Bayesian inference on our population by $\sim 20\%$. We anticipate a reduction of up to $78\%$ in the overall cost for an astrophysically motivated population, since there are fewer events with observable spin-precession and higher order multipole power.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Rays as an Interdisciplinary Earth Observation Tool: From Particle Physics and Atmospheric Processes to Geosciences and Urban Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of cosmic rays, which are high-energy particles originate from space and the atmosphere, has historically been associated with particle physics and astrophysics. In the last 20 years, these particles have evolved into valuable tools for observing Earth's systems. This review compiles the use of cosmic rays in three primary areas: (1) particle physics and atmospheric processes, which include cosmic-ray-induced cascades, ionization, and their impact on atmospheric chemistry and radiation; (2) geosciences, where cosmogenic radionuclides assist in the dating of geological materials and cosmic-ray neutrons are used for large-scale monitoring of soil moisture and snow water equivalents; and (3) urban science, where cosmic-ray muons are employed for non-invasive subsurface imaging and, when paired with distributed sensors, serve as the basis for smart city monitoring. The review places particular emphasis on integrating these methods with remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS), which helps close the persistent scale gap between point measurements and satellite observations, thereby enabling three-dimensional digital representations of subsurfaces. The review concludes by discussing the data standards, their integration into operational Earth observation workflows, and future research directions.</description>

      <title>Development of Low-Noise Two-stage dc-SQUID for TES Detector Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19565v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct-current superconducting quantum interference devices (dc-SQUIDs) are one of the most sensitive magnetic detectors. These sensors are extensively used in the readout of superconducting transition edge sensors (TESs), which are used for the detection of weak signals. A cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization telescope operating in 22-48 GHz is currently under developing. The TESs calorimeter of the telescope will be readout by a time-division multiplexer (TDM) SQUID readout system. We develop a two-stage dc-SQUID amplifier circuit, comprising an input-stage SQUID with 4 SQUID cells and a series SQUID array (SSA) with 100 SQUID cells. This configuration has been shown to achieve extremely high signal gain while effectively controlling system noise. We assess the system noise at $300$ $mK$ in an adiabatic demagnetisation refrigerator (ADR). The the measured magnetic flux noise of the two-stage SQUID circuit system is approximately $0.3$ ${\mu}\Phi_{0}/\sqrt{Hz}$ at $10$ $kHz$. The current noise equivalent to the input coil of input SQUID is about $2.4$ $pA/\sqrt{Hz}$. This result meets the low-noise readout requirements of the CMB TES and other applications with TES detectors.</description>

Abstract: Large n-body simulations with fully interacting objects represent the next frontier in computational planetary formation studies. In this paper, we present Mercury-Opal, the GPU-accelerated version of the n-body planet formation code Mercury-Arxes.The porting to GPU computing has been performed through OpenACC to ensure cross-platform support and minimize the code restructuring efforts while retaining most of the performance increase expected from GPU computing. We tested Mercury-Opal against its parent code Mercury-Arxes under conditions that put GPU computing at disadvantage and nevertheless show how the GPU-based execution provides advantages with respect to CPU-serial execution even for limited computational loads.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Habitable Worlds Observatory is the first telescope ever designed to search for life and will be a powerhouse of discovery across topics in astrophysics. The observatory was the top recommendation of the Astro2020 Decadal Survey for large missions and a new HWO Technology Maturation Project Office was formed in August 2024 to mature the architecture, science and technology. In this paper we review the overall approach taken to mature the mission concept. We show progress on architecture development, integrated modeling, science cases, and technology roadmaps consistent with pre-formulation studies. We discuss plans for instrument studies and international engagement and science engagement including a Community Science and Instrument Team. Finally, we describe the plan forward to the Mission Concept Review.</description>

Abstract: Radio pulses generated by cosmic-ray air showers can be used to reconstruct key properties like the energy and depth of the electromagnetic component of cosmic-ray air showers. Radio detection threshold, influenced by natural and anthropogenic radio background, can be reduced through various techniques. In this work, we demonstrate that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are an effective way to lower the threshold. We developed two CNNs: a classifier to distinguish radio signal waveforms from background noise and a denoiser to clean contaminated radio signals. Following the training and testing phases, we applied the networks to air-shower data triggered by scintillation detectors of the prototype station for the enhancement of IceTop, IceCube's surface array at the South Pole. Over a four-month period, we identified 554 cosmic-ray events in coincidence with IceTop, approximately five times more compared to a reference method based on a cut on the signal-to-noise ratio. Comparisons with IceTop measurements of the same air showers confirmed that the CNNs reliably identified cosmic-ray radio pulses and outperformed the reference method. Additionally, we find that CNNs reduce the false-positive rate of air-shower candidates and effectively denoise radio waveforms, thereby improving the accuracy of the power and arrival time reconstruction of radio pulses.</description>

      <title>Ab uno disce omnes: Single-harmonic search for extreme mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are one of the key sources of gravitational waves for space-based detectors such as LISA. However, their detection remains a major data analysis challenge due to the signals' complexity and length. We present a semi-coherent, time-frequency search strategy for detecting EMRI harmonics without relying on full waveform templates. We perform an injection and search campaign of single mildly-eccentric equatorial EMRIs in stationary Gaussian noise. The detection statistic is constructed solely from the EMRI frequency evolution, which is modeled phenomenologically using a Singular Value Decomposition basis. The pipeline and the detection statistic are implemented in time-frequency, enabling efficient searches over one year of data in approximately one hour on a single GPU. The search pipeline achieves 94% detection probability at $\mathrm{SNR} = 30$ for a false-alarm probability of $10^{-2}$, recovering the frequency evolution of the dominant harmonic to 1% relative error. By mapping the EMRI parameters consistent with the recovered frequency evolution, we show that the semi-coherent detection statistic enables a sub-percent precision estimation of the EMRI intrinsic parameters. These results establish a computationally efficient framework for constructing EMRI proposals for the LISA global fit.</description>

      <title>Seeking Spectroscopic Binaries with Data-Driven Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven stellar classification has a long and important history in astronomy, dating as far back as Annie Jump Cannon's "by eye" classifications of stars into spectral types still used today. In recent years, data-driven spectroscopy has proven to be an effective means of deriving stellar properties for large samples of stars, sidestepping issues with computational efficiency, incomplete line lists, and radiative transfer calculations associated with physical stellar models. A logical application of these algorithms is the detection of unresolved stellar binaries, which requires accurate spectroscopic models to resolve flux contributions from a fainter secondary star in the spectrum. Here we use The Cannon to train a data-driven model on spectra from the Keck High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer. We show that our model is competitive with existing data-driven models in its ability to predict stellar properties Teff, stellar radius, [Fe/H], vsin(i), and instrumental PSF, particularly when we apply a novel wavelet-based processing step to spectra before training. We find that even with accurate estimates of star properties, our model's ability to detect unresolved binaries is limited by its approx. 3% accuracy in per-pixel flux predictions, illuminating possible limitations of data-driven model applications.</description>

      <title>A Search for Binary Black Hole Mergers in LIGO O1-O3 Data with Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the first detection of gravitational waves in 2015 by LIGO from the binary black hole merger GW150914, gravitational-wave astronomy has developed significantly, with over 200 compact binary merger events cataloged. The use of neural networks has the potential to significantly speed up the detection, classification, and especially parameter estimation for gravitational wave events, compared to current techniques, quite important for electromagnetic follow-up of events. In this work, we present a machine learning pipeline using neural networks to detect gravitational wave events. We generate training data using real LIGO data to train and refine neural networks that can detect binary black hole (BBH) mergers, and apply these models to search through LIGO's first three observing runs. We detect 57 out of the 75 total cataloged BBH events with two detectors of data in O1, O2, and O3, with 57 false positives that can mostly be ruled out with parameter inference and human inspection. Finally, we extensively test this pipeline on time-shifted data to characterize its False Alarm Rate (FAR). These results are an important step in developing machine learning-based GW searches, enabling low-latency detection and multi-messenger astronomy.</description>
