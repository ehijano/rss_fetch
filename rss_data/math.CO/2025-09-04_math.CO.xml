      <title>Counting factorizations of Singer cycles in linear and unitary groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We count factorizations of Singer cycles as products of reflections in the families of special and general unitary and linear groups over a finite field. In the case of minimum-length factorizations, the resulting answer is a striking product formula resembling the count for minimum-length factorizations of Coxeter elements into reflections in complex reflections groups. Moreover, for minimum length, the answers for the unitary and linear groups exhibit the phenomenon of Ennola duality, where the number of factorizations in a unitary group over the field $\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by replacing `$q$' with `$-q$' in the corresponding answer for a linear group. We use the character theory of these groups to make this count, and in particular we employ the Deligne--Lusztig theory of characters for finite reductive groups.</description>

      <title>On circular external difference families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $(v,m,\ell,1)$-Circular External Difference Family (CEDF) is an $m$-sequence $(A_1, \ldots, A_m)$ of $\ell$-subsets of an additive group $G$ of order $v$ such that $G\setminus\{0\}$ equals the multiset of all differences $a-a'$, with $(a,a')\in A_i\times A_{i+1 \pmod{m}}$ for some $i$. CEDFs are a variation of External Difference Families, and have been recently introduced as a tool to construct non-malleable threshold schemes.
  The existence of a $(v,m,\ell,1)$-CEDF over the cyclic group is known only when the number of parts $m$ is even, while there cannot exist a cyclic CEDF for $m$ and $\ell$ both odd.
  In this work, we study the existence of cyclic CEDFs when $m$ is odd and $\ell$ is even: we construct cyclic $(v,m,\ell,1)$-CEDFs for any odd $m&gt;1$ when $\ell=2$, and for any even $\ell \ge 2$ when $m=3$.</description>

      <title>Some Maker-Breaker games on hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider some biased Maker-Breaker games. Starting with the complete $k$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices, at each turn Maker claims one edge, and then Breaker claims $b$ edges. Maker's goal is to obtain a set of edges having some increasing property. We consider the case where Maker's desired property is minimum degree $m$, or having a full-rank incidence matrix, or having a Berge Hamilton cycle or having a perfect matching or a Hamilton $\ell$-cycle.</description>

      <title>New Identities in the Character Table of Symmetric Groups involving Riordan Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amdeberhan recently proposed certain equalities between sums in the character table of symmetric groups. These equalities are between signed column sums in the character table, summing over the rows labeled by partitions in $\Ev$, where $\lambda$ is a partition of $n$ with $r$ nonzero parts and $\Ev$ is a multiset containing $2^r$ partitions of $2n$. While we observe that these equalities are not true in general, we prove that they do hold in interesting special cases. These lead to new equalities between sums of degrees of irreducible characters for the symmetric group and a new combinatorial interpretation for the Riordan numbers in terms of degrees of irreducible characters labeled by partitions with three parts of the same parity. This is the first, to our knowledge, theorem about degrees of symmetric group characters with parity conditions imposed on the partitions indexing the characters.</description>

      <title>The Szemer\'edi-Trotter theorem over arbitrary field of characteristic zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a set of $m$ points and $\mathcal{L}$ a set of $n$ lines in $K^2$, where $K$ is a field with char$(K)=0$. We prove the incidence bound $$\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{P},\mathcal{L})=O(m^{2/3}n^{2/3}+m+n).$$ Moreover, this bound is sharp and cannot be improved. This solves the Szemer\'edi-Trotter incidence problem for arbitrary field of characteristic zero.
  The crucial tool of our proof is the Baby Lefschetz principle, which allows us to restrict our study to the complex case. Based on this observation, we also prove related results over $K$, including Beck's theorem, Erd\H{o}s-Szemer\'edi theorem, and other types of incidences.</description>

      <title>Towards Upper and Lower Bounds for Chromatic Symmetric Functions in the Elementary Basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tatsuyuki Hikita recently proved the Stanley--Stembridge conjecture using probabilistic methods, showing that the chromatic symmetric functions of unit interval graphs are $e$-positive. Finding a combinatorial interpretation for these $e$-coefficients remains a major open problem. Towards this goal, we introduce sets of strong and powerful $P$-tableaux and conjecture that these sets undercount and overcount the $e$-coefficients of the chromatic symmetric function $X_{inc(P)}(\mathbf{x}, q)$. We then use this framework to obtain combinatorial interpretations for various cases of $e$-expansion coefficients of chromatic symmetric functions of unit interval graphs. Additionally, we show that strong $P$-tableaux and the Shareshian--Wachs inversion statistic appear naturally in the proof of Hikita's result.</description>

      <title>Katz similarity index comparisons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we compare the Katz similarity index to two other node similarity metrics, the standard distance and the resistance distance, for both path and cycle graphs. We consider how Katz similarity varies as the parameter $\alpha$ and the size of the graph vary. We also characterize when the three metrics give rise to different orderings of vertex pairs. In particular, we find that for all admissible values of $\alpha$ the Katz similarity index, the resistance distance, and the distance give the same ordering for node pairs in a cycle graph of arbitrary length, but the same is not true for the path graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second paper of the paper series on multiple Riordan arrays. In this paper, based on the study of multiple Riordan arrays and the multiple Riordan group, we define multiple almost-Riordan arrays and find that the set of all multiple almost-Riordan arrays forms a group, called the multiple almost-Riordan group. We also obtain the sequence characteristics of multiple almost-Riordan arrays and give the production matrices for multiple almost-Riordan arrays. We define the compression of multiple almost-Riordan arrays and provide their sequence characterization.</description>

      <title>The Ungar Games on Graded Posets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a poset $P$, an Ungar move sends $P$ to $P\setminus T$, where $T$ is some subset of maximal elements of $P$. With these Ungar moves, Defant, Kravitz, and Williams define the Ungar games, where two players alternate making nontrivial Ungar moves until one player cannot make a move and loses. We characterize the second-player wins on graded posets. We first prove recursive characterizations of second-player wins before using these results to give classifications of the second-player wins in terms of boolean circuits. We also generalize Defant, Kravitz, and Williams' work on Young's Lattice $J(\mathbb{N}^2)$ to the higher-dimensional $J(\mathbb{N}^d)$.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics behind discriminants of polynomial systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 1970s, Kouchnirenko, Bernstein, and Khovanskii noticed that the geometry of a generic system of polynomial equations is determined by the geometry of its Newton polytopes. In the 1990s, Gelfand, Kapranov, Zelevinsky, and Sturmfels extended this observation to discriminants and resultants of generic polynomials. Particularly, well-known open questions about the irreducibility of discriminants and sets of solutions of such systems lead to questions about the corresponding geometric property of tuples of polytopes: Minkowski linear independence. To address these questions, we encode Minkowski linear independence into a finite matroid and characterize its bases, circuits, and cyclics. The obtained combinatorial results are used in the subsequent work to describe components of discriminants for generic square polynomial systems.</description>

      <title>Representation number of word-representable co-bipartite graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G = (V, E)$ is said to be word-representable if there exists a word $w$ over the alphabet $V$ such that, for any two distinct letters $x, y \in V$, the letters $x$ and $y$ alternate in $w$ if and only if $xy \in E$. A graph is co-bipartite if its complement is bipartite. Therefore, the vertex set of a co-bipartite graph can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets $X$ and $Y$ such that the subgraphs induced by $X$ and $Y$ are cliques.
  The concept of word-representability for graph classes has gained significant attention in recent years. The book Words and Graphs by Sergey Kitaev and Vadim Lozin presents examples of co-bipartite graphs that are not word-representable. It is known that a graph is word-representable if and only if it admits a semi-transitive orientation. Although the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a semi-transitive orientation in co-bipartite graphs have been established, the characterization based on vertex ordering remains open. In this paper, we present necessary and sufficient conditions for a co-bipartite graph to be word-representable in terms of its vertex ordering. Furthermore, based on this vertex ordering, we provide an algorithm to construct a $3$-uniform word-representation for any word-representable co-bipartite graph. Using this result, we prove that except for the permutation graphs, the representation number of all other word-representable co-bipartite graphs is $3$.</description>

      <title>Between proper and square colorings of sparse graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $i$-independent set is a set of vertices whose pairwise distance is at least $i+1$. A proper coloring (resp. a square coloring) of a graph is a partition of its vertices into independent (resp. $2$-independent) sets. A packing $(1^{\ell},2^k)$-coloring of a graph is a partition of its vertices into $\ell$ independent sets and $k$ $2$-independent sets; this is an intermediate coloring between proper coloring and square coloring. We investigate classes of sparse graphs that have a proper $(\ell+1)$-coloring but no packing $(1^{\ell},2^k)$-coloring for any finite $k$.
  The Four Color Theorem states that every planar graph is packing $(1^4)$-colorable, and Gr\"otzsch's Theorem says every planar graph with girth at least $4$ is packing $(1^3)$-colorable. However, for every fixed $k$, we construct a planar graph with no packing $(1^{3},2^k)$-coloring and a planar graph with girth $6$ that has no packing $(1^{2},2^k)$-coloring. Moreover, for every positive integer $\ell$, we completely determine the minimum girth condition $g(\ell)$ for which every planar graph with girth at least $g(\ell)$ has a packing $(1^{\ell},2^{f(\ell)})$-coloring for some finite $f(\ell)$. Our results are actually in terms of maximum average degree.
  We also study the list version of packing colorings. We extend two results of Gastineau and Togni by showing every subcubic graph is both packing $(1^{1},2^6)$-choosable and packing $(1^{2},2^3)$-choosable, and our results are sharp. In addition, we strengthen Voigt's example of a planar graph that is not $4$-choosable by constructing a planar graph that is not packing $(1^{4},2^k)$-choosable for every positive integer $k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is $k$-gap-planar if it has a drawing in the plane such that every crossing can be charged to one of the two edges involved so that at most $k$ crossings are charged to each edge. We show this class of graphs has linear expansion. In particular, every $r$-shallow minor of a $k$-gap-planar graph has density $O(rk)$. Several extensions of this result are proved: for topological minors, for $k$-cover-planar graphs, for $k$-gap-cover-planar graphs, and for drawings on any surface. Application to graph colouring are presented.</description>

      <title>The burning number conjecture holds for trees of order $n$ with at most $\left\lfloor \sqrt{n-1}\right\rfloor$ degree-2 vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the spread of information in social networks and graph-theoretic processes such as Firefighting and graph cleaning, Bonato, Janssen and Roshanbin introduced in 2016 the burning number $b(G)$ of any finite graph $G$. They conjectured that $b(G)\le \lceil n^\frac{1}{2}\rceil$ holds for all connected graphs $G$ of order $n$, and observed that it suffices to prove the conjecture for all trees. In 2024, Murakami confirmed the conjecture for trees without degree-2 vertices. In this paper, we prove that for all trees $T$ of order $n$ with $n_2$ degree-2 vertices, $$b(T)\le \left\lceil \left(n+n_2-\left\lceil\sqrt{n+n_2+0.25}-1.5\right\rceil\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\right\rceil.$$ Hence, the conjecture holds for all trees of order $n$ with at most $\left\lfloor \sqrt{n-1}\right\rfloor$ degree-2 vertices.</description>

      <title>Colored base-3 partitions, sequences of polynomials, and perfect numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the observation that the counting function of a certain base-3 colored partition contains the even perfect numbers as a subsequence, we begin by defining a sequence of polynomials in four variables and discuss their properties and combinatorial interpretations. We then concentrate on certain subsequences that are related to the Chebyshev polynomials of both kinds. Finally, we consider several sequences of single-variable polynomials that have meaningful combinatorial interpretations as well as interesting zero distributions.</description>

      <title>Sparsity, Stress-Independence and Globally Linked Pairs in Graph Rigidity Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is $\mathcal{R}_d$-independent (resp. $\mathcal{R}_d$-connected) if its $d$-dimensional generic rigidity matroid is free (resp. connected). A result of Maxwell from 1867 implies that every $\mathcal{R}_d$-independent graph satisfies the sparsity condition $|E(H)|\leq d|V(H)|-\binom{d+1}{2}$ for all subgraphs $H$ with at least $d+1$ vertices. Several other families of graphs $G$ arising naturally in rigidity theory, such as minimally globally $d$-rigid graphs, are known to satisfy the bound $|E(G)|\leq (d+1)|V(G)|-\binom{d+2}{2}$. We unify and extend these results by considering the family of $d$-stress-independent graphs which includes many of these families. We show that every $d$-stress-independent graph is $\mathcal{R}_{d+1}$-independent. A key ingredient in our proofs is the concept of $d$-stress-linked pairs of vertices. We derive a new sufficient condition for $d$-stress linkedness and use it to obtain a similar condition for a pair of vertices of a graph to be globally $d$-linked. This result strengthens a result of Tanigawa on globally $d$-rigid graphs. We also show that every minimally $\mathcal{R}_d$-connected graph $G$ is $\mathcal{R}_{d+1}$-independent and that the only subgraphs of $G$ that can satisfy Maxwell's criterion for $\mathcal{R}_{d+1}$-independence with equality are copies of $K_{d+2}$. Our results give affirmative answers to two conjectures in graph rigidity theory.</description>

      <title>Long QMDS additive code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate additive codes, defined as $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear subspaces $C \subseteq \mathbb{F}_{q^h}^n$ of length $n$ and dimension $r$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$. An additive code is said to be of type $[n, r/h, d]_q^h$, where $d$ denotes the minimum Hamming distance and the normalized dimension $r/h$ may be fractional. A central object of interest is the class of quasi-MDS (QMDS) codes, those additive codes achieving the generalized Singleton bound:
  $$ d = n - \left\lceil \frac{r}{h} \right\rceil + 1. $$
  In this work, we construct explicit families of additive QMDS codes whose lengths exceed those of the best-known $\mathbb{F}_{q^h}$-linear MDS codes which is $q^h+1$, and we will call these types of codes ``Long'' . By leveraging $\mathbb{F}_q$-linearity and geometric tools like partial spreads and dimensional dual arcs, we show that additive structures allow longer codes without sacrificing optimality in distance. We also examine dual codes and give conditions under which the QMDS property is preserved under duality.</description>

      <title>Reconfiguration graph of vertex colorings for some generalized split graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, the \emph{reconfiguration graph of the $\ell$-colorings} of $G$, denoted by ${\cal R}_\ell(G)$, is the graph whose vertices are the $\ell$-colorings of $G$ and two $\ell$-colorings are joined by an edge if they differ on exactly one vertex of $G$. A graph $G$ is \emph{$\ell$-mixing} if ${\cal R}_\ell(G)$ is connected and the \emph{$\ell$-recoloring diameter} of $G$ is the diameter of ${\cal R}_\ell(G)$. An interesting classification problem that recently gathered a wide attention is the following: ``{\em Given a hereditary class of graphs $\cal C$ and any graph $G\in \cal C$, classify whether $G$ is $\ell$-mixing or not for any $\ell&gt; \chi(G)$}, where $\chi(G)$ is the chromatic number of $G$." In this paper, we answer this problem for the class of $(P_2+P_3, C_4)$-free graphs, and moreover, if such a graph $G$ is recolorable, then for all $\ell &gt;\chi(G)$, the $\ell$-recoloring diameter of $G$ is at most 2$n^{2}$.
  Furthermore, Cereceda conjectured that if $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices with degeneracy $d$, then for all $\ell \geq d+ 2$, the $\ell$-recoloring diameter of $G$ is at most $O(n^2)$. We prove that every ($P_2+P_3, C_4$)-free graph satifies Cereceda's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Line Graphs of Non-Word-Representable Graphs are Not Always Non-Word-Representable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is said to be word-representable if there exists a word over its vertex set such that any two vertices are adjacent if and only if they alternate in the word. If no such word exists, the graph is non-word-representable. In the literature, there are examples of non-word-representable graphs whose line graphs are non-word-representable. However, it is an open problem to determine whether the line graph of a non-word-representable graph is always non-word-representable or not? In this work, we address the open problem by considering a class of non-word-representable graphs, viz., Mycielski graphs of odd cycles of length at least five, and show that their line graphs are word-representable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Row Impartial Terminus (RIT), an impartial combinatorial game played on integer partitions. We show that any position in RIT can be uniquely decomposed into a core and a remnant. Our central result is that the Conway pair of any RIT position-which determines the outcome under both normal and mis\`ere play-is identical to the Conway pair of a corresponding position in the game of Nim defined by the remnant. This finding provides a complete winning strategy for both variants of RIT, reducing its analysis to the well-understood framework of Nim. As a consequence, we classify RIT within the Conway-Gurvich-Ho hierarchy, showing it to be forced and miserable but not pet.</description>

      <title>The ratio monotonicity of Eulerian-type polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03397v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is motivated by determining the location of modes of some unimodal Eulerian-type polynomials. The notion of ratio monotonicity was introduced by Chen-Xia when they investigated the $q$-derangement numbers. Let $(f_n(x))_{n\geqslant 0}$ be a sequence of real polynomials satisfying the Eulerian-type recurrence relation $$f_{n+1}(x)=(anx+bx+c)f_n(x)+ax(1-x)\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}f_n(x),~f_0(x)=1,$$ where $a,b$ and $c$ are nonnegative integers. Assume that $deg f_n(x)=n$. Setting $g_n(x)=x^nf_n\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)$, we have $$g_{n+1}(x)=(anx+b+cx)g_n(x)+ax(1-x)\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}g_n(x),$$ We find that if $a+c\geqslant b\geqslant c&gt;0$, then $f_n(x)$ is bi-gamma-positive and $g_n(x)$ is ratio monotone. As applications, we discover the ratio monotonicity of several Eulerian-type polynomials, including the $(exc,cyc)$ $q$-Eulerian polynomials, the $1/k$-Eulerian polynomials, a kind of generalized Eulerian polynomials studied by Carlitz-Scoville, the $(des_B,neg)$ $q$-Eulerian polynomials over the hyperoctahedral group and the $r$-colored Eulerian polynomials. In particular, let $A_n(x,q)$ be the $(exc,cyc)$ $q$-Eulerian polynomials, we find that the polynomials $x^{n-1}A_n(1/x,q)$ are ratio monotone when $0&lt;q\leqslant 1$, while $A_n(x,q)$ are ratio monotone when $1\leqslant q\leqslant 2$.</description>

      <title>A Classification of Winning Sets of Cops in $\mathbb{Z}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The game of Cops and Robbers is a pursuit-evasion game on graphs that has been extensively studied in finite settings, particularly through the concept of cop number. In this paper, we explore infinite variants of the game, focusing on the lattice graph $\mathbb{Z}^n$. Since the cop number of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ is infinite, we shift attention to the notion of \emph{cop density}, examining how sparsely cops may be placed while still guaranteeing capture. We introduce the framework of \emph{coordinate matching} as a central strategy and prove the existence of density-zero configurations of cops that ensure eventual capture of the robber. Building on this, we provide a complete classification of winning cop sets in $\mathbb{Z}^n$, showing necessary and sufficient conditions for capture based on infinite distributions of cops across coordinate directions. We conclude with directions for further study, including variations of the game where the robber imposes spatial restrictions on cop placement.</description>

      <title>From small eigenvalues to large cuts, and Chowla's cosine problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that there exists an absolute constant $\gamma&gt;0$ such that for every $A\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_{&gt;0}$ we have \[\min_{x\in [0, 2\pi]}\sum_{a\in A}\cos(ax)\leq -\Omega(|A|^{\gamma}).\]
  This gives the first polynomial bound for Chowla's cosine problem from 1965. To show this, we prove structural statements about graphs whose smallest eigenvalue is small in absolute value. As another application, we show that any graph $G$ with $m$ edges and no clique of size $m^{1/2-\delta}$ has a cut of size least $m/2+m^{1/2+\varepsilon}$ for some $\varepsilon=\varepsilon(\delta)&gt;0$. This proves a weak version of a celebrated conjecture of Alon, Bollob\'as, Krivelevich, and Sudakov. Our proofs are based on novel spectral and linear algebraic techniques, involving subspace compressions and Hadamard products of matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduced the class of weakly generalized p.q.-Baer $*$-rings. It is proved that under some assumptions every weakly generalized p.q.-Baer $*$-ring can be embedded in generalized p.q.-Baer $*$-ring. We proved that a generalized p.q.-Baer $*$-rings has partial comparability. If a generalized p.q.-Baer $*$-ring satisfies the parallelogram law then it is proved that every pair of projections has an orthogonal decomposition. A separation theorem for generalized p.q.-Baer $*$-rings is obtained. As an application of spectral theory, it is proved that generalized p.q.-Baer $*$-rings have a sheaf representation with injective sections.</description>

      <title>Integers with small digits in multiple bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that, for any $r\geq 1$, if $g_1,\ldots,g_r$ are distinct coprime integers, sufficiently large depending only on $r$, then for any $\epsilon&gt;0$ there are infinitely many integers $n$ such that all but $\epsilon \log n$ of the digits of $n$ are $\leq g_i/2$ in base $g_i$ for all $1\leq i\leq r$. In other words, for any fixed large bases, there are infinitely many $n$ such that almost all of the digits of $n$ are small in all bases simultaneously. This is both a quantitative and qualitative improvement over previous work of Croot, Mousavi, and Schmidt. As a consequence, we obtain a weak answer to a conjecture of Graham concerning divisibility of $\binom{2n}{n}$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the Laplacian matching polynomial of a graph and the effect of adding edges to a graph on the roots (called Laplacian matching roots) of this polynomial. In particular, we investigate the conditions under which the Laplacian matching roots change by integer values. We prove that the Laplacian matching root integral variation in one place is impossible and the Laplacian matching root integral variation in two places is also impossible under some constraints.</description>

      <title>Bounds for the local properties problem for difference sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13999v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the local properties problem for difference sets: we define $g(n, k, \ell)$ to be the minimum value of $\lvert A - A\rvert$ over all $n$-element sets $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ with the `local property' that $\lvert A' - A'\rvert \geq \ell$ for all $k$-element subsets $A' \subseteq A$. We view $k$ and $\ell$ as fixed, and study the asymptotic behavior of $g(n, k, \ell)$ as $n \to \infty$. One of our main results concerns the quadratic threshold, i.e., the minimum value of $\ell$ such that $g(n, k, \ell) = \Omega(n^2)$; we determine this value exactly for even $k$, and we determine it up to an additive constant for odd $k$. We also show that for all $1 &lt; c \leq 2$, the `threshold' for $g(n, k, \ell) = \Omega(n^c)$ is quadratic in $k$; conversely, for $\ell$ quadratic in $k$, we obtain upper and lower bounds of the form $n^c$ for (not necessarily equal) constants $c &gt; 1$. In particular, this provides the first nontrivial upper bounds in the regime where $\ell$ is quadratic in $k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We unify the study of quotients of matroids, polymatroids, valuated matroids and strong maps of submodular functions in the framework of Murota's discrete convex analysis. As a main result, we compile a list of ten equivalent characterizations of quotients for M-convex sets, generalizing existing formulations for (poly)matroids and submodular functions. We also initiate the study of quotients of M-convex functions, constructing a hierarchy of four separate characterizations. Our investigations yield new insights into the fundamental operation of induction, as well as the structure of linking sets and linking functions, which are generalizations of linking systems and bimatroids.</description>

      <title>KKL theorem for the influence of a set of variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a Boolean function f on the n-dimensional hypercube, and a set of variables (indexed by) $S \subset \{1,2,\ldots,n\}.$ The coalition influence of the variables S on a function f is the probability that after a random assignment of variables not in S, the value of f is undetermined. In this paper, we study a complementary notion, which we call the joint influence: the probability that, after a random assignment of variables not in S, the value of f is dependent on all variables in S.
  We show that for an arbitrary fixed d, every Boolean function f on n variables admits a d-set of joint influence at least $\tfrac{1}{10} W^{\geq d}(f) (\frac{\log n}{n})^d$, where $W^{\geq d}(f)$ is the Fourier weight of f at degrees at least d. This result is a direct generalisation of the Kahn-Kalai-Linial theorem. Further, we give an example demonstrating essential sharpness of the above bound. In our study of the joint influence we consider another notion of multi-bit influence recently introduced by Tal.</description>

      <title>Propp's benzels and Lai's nearly symmetric hexagons with holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18419v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present a new version of the second author's factorization theorem for perfect matchings of symmetric graphs. We then use our result to solve four open problems of Propp on the enumeration of trimer tilings on the hexagonal lattice.
  As another application, we obtain a semi-factorization result for the number of lozenge tilings of a large class of hexagonal regions with holes (obtained by starting with an arbitrary symmetric hexagon with holes, and translating all the holes one unit lattice segment in the same direction). This in turn leads to the solution of two open problems posed by Lai and to an extension of a result due to Fulmek and Krattenthaler, which results in exact enumeration formulas for some new families of hexagonal regions with holes.
  Our result also allows us to find new, simpler proofs (and in one case, a new, simpler form) of some formulas due to Krattenthaler for the number of perfect matchings of Aztec rectangles with unit holes along a lattice diagonal.</description>

      <title>Log-concavity of the independence polynomials of $\mathbf{W}_{p}$ graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph of order $n$. For a positive integer $p$, $G$ is said to be a $\mathbf{W}_{p}$ graph if $n\geq p$ and every $p$ pairwise disjoint independent sets of $G$ are contained within $p$ pairwise disjoint maximum independent sets. In this paper, we establish that every connected $\mathbf{W}_{p}$ graph $G$ is $p$-quasi-regularizable if and only if $n\geq(p+1)\cdot\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the independence number of $G$ and $p\neq2$. This finding ensures that the independence polynomial of a connected $\mathbf{W}_{p}$ graph $G$ is log-concave whenever $(p+1)\cdot\alpha\leq n\leq p\cdot\alpha+2\sqrt{p\cdot\alpha+p}$ and $\frac{\alpha^{2}}{4\left( \alpha+1\right) }\leq p$, or $p\cdot\alpha+2\sqrt{p\cdot\alpha+p}&lt;n\leq \frac{\left( \alpha^{2}+1\right) \cdot p+\left( \alpha-1\right) ^{2}}{\alpha-1}$ and $\frac{\alpha\left( \alpha-1\right) }{\alpha+1}\leq p$. Moreover, the clique corona graph $G\circ K_{p}$ serves as an example of the $\mathbf{W}_{p}$ graph class. We further demonstrate that the independence polynomial of $G\circ K_{p}$ is always log-concave for sufficiently large $p$.
  Keywords: very well-covered graph; quasi-regularizable graph; corona graph; $\mathbf{W}_{p}$ graph; independence polynomial; log-concavity.</description>

      <title>On the Spread of Graph-Related Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spread of a real symmetric matrix is defined as the difference between its largest and smallest eigenvalue. The study of graph-related matrices has attracted considerable attention, leading to a substantial body of findings. In this paper, we investigate a general spread problem related to $A_{\alpha}$-matrix of graphs. The $A_{\alpha}$-matrix of a graph $G$, introduced by Nikiforov in 2017, is a convex combinations of its diagonal degree matrix $D(G)$ and adjacency matrix $A(G)$, defined as $A_{\alpha} (G) = \alpha D(G) + (1-\alpha) A(G)$. Let $\lambda_1^{(\alpha)} (G)$ and $\lambda_n^{(\alpha)} (G)$ denote the largest and smallest eigenvalues of $A_{\alpha} (G)$, respectively. We determined the unique graph that maximizes $\lambda^{(\alpha)}_1 (G) - \beta\cdot\lambda^{(\gamma)}_n (G)$ among all connected $n$-vertex graphs for sufficiently large $n$, where $0 \leq \alpha &lt; 1$, $1/2\leq \gamma &lt; 1$ and $0&lt;\beta\gamma\leq 1$. As an application, we confirm a conjecture proposed by Lin, Miao, and Guo [Linear Algebra Appl. 606 (2020) 1--22]. In addition, one of main results in [SIAM J. Discrete Math. 38 (2024) 590--608] is a simple corollary of our result by choosing $\alpha = \gamma = 1/2$ and $\beta = 1$.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a superspace analogue of combinatorial Hopf algebras (Aguiar-Bergeron-Sottile, 2006), and show that the Hopf superalgebra of quasi-symmetric (resp. symmetric) functions in superspace (Fishel-Lapointe-Pinto, 2019) is a terminal object in the category of all (resp. cocommutative) combinatorial Hopf superalgebras. We also introduce a superspace analogue of chromatic symmetric functions of graphs (Stanley, 1995) using the chromatic Hopf superalgebra of two-colored graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An independent set may not contain both a vertex and one of its neighbours. This basic fact makes the uniform distribution over independent sets rather special. We consider the hard-core model, an essential generalization of the uniform distribution over independent sets. We show how its local analysis yields remarkable insights into the global structure of independent sets in the host graph, in connection with, for instance, Ramsey numbers, graph colourings, and sphere packings.</description>

      <title>The existence of pyramidal Steiner triple systems over abelian groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Steiner triple system STS$(v)$ is called $f$-pyramidal if it has an automorphism group fixing $f$ points and acting sharply transitively on the remaining $v-f$ points. In this paper, we focus on the STSs that are $f$-pyramidal over some abelian group. Their existence has been settled only for the smallest admissible values of $f$, that is, $f=0,1,3$.
  In this paper, we complete this result and determine, for every $f&gt;3$, the spectrum of values $(f,v)$ for which there is an $f$-pyramidal STS$(v)$ over an abelian group. This result is obtained by constructing difference families relative to a suitable partial spread.</description>

      <title>Thresholds for the biased Maker-Breaker domination games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the $(a,b)$-biased Maker-Breaker domination game, two players alternately select unplayed vertices in a graph $G$ such that Dominator selects $a$ and Staller selects $b$ vertices per move. Dominator wins if the vertices he selected during the game form a dominating set of $G$, while Staller wins if she can prevent Dominator from achieving this goal. Given a positive integer $b$, Dominator's threshold, $\textrm{a}_b$, is the minimum $a$ such that Dominator wins the $(a,b)$-biased game on $G$ when he starts the game. Similarly, $\textrm{a}'_b$ denotes the minimum $a$ such that Dominator wins when Staller starts the $(a,b)$-biased game. Staller's thresholds, $\textrm{b}_a$ and $\textrm{b}'_a$, are defined analogously. It is proved that Staller wins the $(k-1,k)$-biased games in a graph $G$ if its order is sufficiently large with respect to a function of $k$ and the maximum degree of $G$. Along the way, the $\ell$-local domination number of a graph is introduced. This new parameter is proved to bound Dominator's thresholds $\textrm{a}_\ell$ and $\textrm{a}_\ell'$ from above. As a consequence, $\textrm{a}_1'(G)\le 2$ holds for every claw-free graph $G$. More specific results are obtained for thresholds in line graphs and Cartesian grids. Based on the concept of $[1,k]$-factor of a graph $G$, we introduce the star partition width $\sigma(G)$ of $G$, and prove that $\textrm{a}_1'(G)\le \sigma(G)$ holds for any nontrivial graph $G$, while $\textrm{a}_1'(G)=\sigma(G)$ if $G$ is a tree.</description>

      <title>On multiplicities of interpoint distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04283v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a set $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points and a distance $d&gt;0$, the multiplicity of $d$ is the number of times the distance $d$ appears between points in $X$. Let $a_1(X) \geq a_2(X) \geq \cdots \geq a_m(X)$ denote the multiplicities of the $m$ distances determined by $X$ and let $a(X)=\left(a_1(X),\dots,a_m(X)\right)$. In this paper, we study several questions from Erd\H{o}s's time regarding distance multiplicities. Among other results, we show that:
  (1) If $X$ is convex or ``not too convex'', then there exists a distance other than the diameter that has multiplicity at most $n$.
  (2) There exists a set $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points, such that many distances occur with high multiplicity. In particular, at least $n^{\Omega(1/\log\log{n})}$ distances have superlinear multiplicity in $n$.
  (3) For any (not necessarily fixed) integer $1\leq k\leq\log{n}$, there exists $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points, such that the difference between the $k^{\text{th}}$ and $(k+1)^{\text{th}}$ largest multiplicities is at least $\Omega(\frac{n\log{n}}{k})$. Moreover, the distances in $X$ with the largest $k$ multiplicities can be prescribed.
  (4) For every $n\in\mathbb{N}$, there exists $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points, not all collinear or cocircular, such that $a(X)= (n-1,n-2,\ldots,1)$. There also exists $Y\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points with pairwise distinct distance multiplicities and $a(Y) \neq (n-1,n-2,\ldots,1)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address a problem posed by Nathan Kaplan in the 2014 Combinatorial and Additive Number Theory session: finding the largest subset $H \subseteq (\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z})^n$ with no distinct $x, y, z \in H$ such that $x + y + z \equiv 0 \pmod{4}$. For even-order abelian groups, a standard $|G|/2$ lower bound applies. We prove this is optimal for $G = (\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z})^n$ using a pair-counting argument, with an explicit construction of vectors with first coordinate odd (1 or 3 mod 4), yielding size $2 \times 4^{n-1} = 4^n / 2$ and density 0.5, verified for $n \leq 10$. An AI-assisted hybrid greedy-genetic algorithm rediscovers this optimal size, highlighting its potential in combinatorial search.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies group frames ($G$-frames) where the unitary group representation can be projective. When the group is abelian, for most combinations $N, n$, we show that $ETF(N,n)$ can only exist for genuinely projective group representations. In particular, cyclic-group frames for such parameters do not exist. We also give a characterization of all dihedral tight frames and dihedral $ETF(2n,n)$, using which, we conclude that regular dihedral $ETF(2n,n)$ must be genuinely projective. Following that, we give a characterization of regular dihedral $ETF(2n,n)$ in terms of certain structured skew Hadamard matrices. We then show that Paley $ETF(2n,n)$ and its doubling are both of this type. Finally, we classify all regular dihedral $ETF(2n,n)$ for $n\le 22$ up to switching equivalence.</description>

Abstract: We present a construction of a Jordan scheme from an elementary abelian $2$-group of rank $n$ and a $\{1,-1\}$-matrix of order $2^n$ that satisfies a specified condition. We then prove that the orders of matrices with the specified condition are limited to $2, 4$ or $8$. Using these matrices, we construct essentially two new proper Jordan schemes of orders $16$ and $32$. Finally, we analyze the structures of the real adjacency Jordan algebras of these Jordan schemes and prove that they are the first known examples whose real adjacency Jordan algebras admit simple components of type $\mathbb{R} \oplus_f \mathbb{R}^n$, namely non-Hermitian type.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for the $q$-deformed polynuclear growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study large time large deviations for the height function $\mathfrak{h}(x,t)$ of the $q$-deformed polynuclear growth introduced in ABW22 [arXiv:2108.06018]. We show that the upper-tail deviations have speed $t$ and derive an explicit formula for the rate function $\Phi_+(\mu)$. On the other hand, we show that the lower-tail deviations have speed $t^2$ and express the corresponding rate function $\Phi_-(\mu)$ in terms of a variational problem. Our analysis relies on distributional identities between the height function $\mathfrak{h}$ and two important measures on the set of integer partitions: the Poissonized Plancherel measure and the cylindric Plancherel measure. Following a scheme developed in DT21 [arXiv:1910.09271], we analyze a Fredholm determinant representation for the $q$-Laplace transform of $\mathfrak{h}(x,t)$, from which we extract exact Lyapunov exponents and through inversion the upper-tail rate function $\Phi_+$. The proof of the lower-tail large deviation principle is more subtle and requires several novel ideas which combine classical asymptotic results for the Plancherel measure and log-concavity properties of Schur polynomials. Techniques we develop to characterize the lower-tail are rather flexible and have the potential to generalize to other solvable growth models.</description>

      <title>Proper partial linear spaces affording imprimitive rank 3 automorphism groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05124v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A partial linear space is a point--line incidence structure such that each line is incident with at least two points and each pair of points is incident with at most one line. It is said to be proper if there exists at least one non-collinear point pair, and at least one line incident with more than two points. The highest degree of symmetry for a proper partial linear space occurs when the automorphism group $G$ is transitive on ordered pairs of collinear points, and on ordered pairs of non-collinear points, that is to say, $G$ is a transitive rank $3$ group on the points. While the primitive rank 3 partial linear spaces are essentially classified, we present the first substantial classification of a family of imprimitive rank $3$ examples.
  We classify all imprimitive rank $3$ proper partial linear spaces such that the rank $3$ group is semiprimitive. In particular, this includes all partial linear spaces with a rank 3 imprimitive automorphism group that is innately transitive or quasiprimitive. We construct several infinite families of examples and ten individual examples. The examples in the infinite families admit a rank $3$ action of a linear or unitary group, and to our knowledge most of these examples have not appeared before in the literature.</description>

Abstract: I present a coordinate-free, symbolic framework for deciding whether a given set of polygonal faces can form a closed, genus-zero polyhedral surface and for predicting how such a surface could be decomposed into internal tetrahedra. The method uses only discrete incidence variables, such as the number of internal tetrahedra $T$, internal gluing triangles $N_i$, and internal triangulation segments $S_i$, and applies combinatorial feasibility checks before any geometric embedding is attempted. For polyhedra in normal form, I record exact incidence identities linking $V,E,F$ to a flatness parameter $S:=\sum_f(\tmop{deg} f-3)$, and I identify parity-sensitive effects in $E$, $F$, and $S$. The external identities and parity-sensitive bounds hold universally for genus-0 polyhedral graphs. For internal quantities, I prove exact relations $N_i=2T-V+2$ and $T-N_i+S_i=1$ (with $S_i$ taken to be the number of interior edges) and obtain restricted linear ranges within a shell-aligned ladder subclass (SALT), where at most one interior edge is introduced per layer. Consequently, I propose a symbolic workflow that yields rapid pre-checks for structural impossibility, reducing the need for costly geometric validation in computational geometry, graphics, and automated modeling.</description>
