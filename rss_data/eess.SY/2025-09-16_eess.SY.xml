      <title>Generalizable Pareto-Optimal Offloading with Reinforcement Learning in Mobile Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) is essential for next-generation mobile network applications that prioritize various performance metrics, including delays and energy efficiency. However, conventional single-objective scheduling solutions cannot be directly applied to practical systems in which the preferences (i.e., the weights of different objectives) are often unknown or challenging to specify in advance. In this study, we formulate a multi-objective offloading problem for MEC with multiple edges to minimize the sum of expected long-term energy consumption and delay while considering unknown preferences. To address the challenge of unknown preferences and the potentially diverse MEC systems, we propose a generalizable multi-objective (deep) reinforcement learning (GMORL)-based tasks offloading framework, which employs the Discrete Soft Actor-Critic (Discrete-SAC) method. Our method uses a single policy model to efficiently schedule tasks based on varying preferences and adapt to heterogeneous MEC systems with different CPU frequencies and server quantities. Under the proposed framework, we introduce a histogram-based state encoding method for constructing features for multiple edges in MEC systems, a sophisticated reward function for accurately computing the utilities of delay and energy consumption, and a novel neural network architecture for improving generalization. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed GMORL scheme enhances the hypervolume of the Pareto front by up to $121.0\%$ compared to benchmarks.

      <title>Analysis and Design of Spare Strategy for Large-Scale Satellite Constellation Using Direct Insertion under (r,q) Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Markov chain-based approach for the analysis and optimization of spare-management policies in large-scale satellite constellations. Focusing on the direct strategy, we model spare replenishment as a periodic-review reorder-point/order-quantity policy, where spares are deployed directly to constellation planes. The stochastic behavior of satellite failures and launch vehicle lead times is captured through Markov representations of both failure and replenishment dynamics. Based on this efficient and accurate framework, we construct and solve an optimization problem aimed at minimizing operational costs. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a case study using a real-world mega-constellation.</description>

      <title>Complexity Reduction for TSO-DSO Coordination: Flexibility Aggregation vs. Distributed Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing number of flexible devices and distributed energy resources in power grids renders the coordination of transmission and distribution systems increasingly complex. In this paper, we discuss and compare two different approaches to optimization-based complexity reduction: Flexibility aggregation via Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) and distributed optimization via the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Flexibility aggregation achieves near-optimal solutions with minimal communication. However, its performance depends on the quality of the approximation used. In contrast, ADMM attains results closer to the centralized solution but requires significantly more communication steps. We draw upon a case study combining different matpower benchmarks to compare both methods.</description>

      <title>Optimal Path Planning for Wheel Loader Automation Enabled by Efficient Soil-Tool Interaction Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earthmoving operations with wheel loaders require substantial power and incur high operational costs. This work presents an efficient automation framework based on the Fundamental Earthmoving Equation (FEE) for soil-tool interaction modeling. A reduced-order multi-step parameter estimation method guided by Sobol's global sensitivity analysis is deployed for accurate, online excavation force prediction. An optimal control problem is then formulated to compute energy-efficient bucket trajectories using soil parameters identified in the previous digging cycle. High-fidelity simulations in Algoryx Dynamics confirm accurate force prediction and demonstrate 15-40% energy savings compared to standard paths. The total computation time is comparable to a single digging cycle, highlighting the framework's potential for real-time, energy-optimized wheel loader automation.</description>

      <title>A Linear Programming Framework for Optimal Event-Triggered LQG Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter explores intelligent scheduling of sensor-to-controller communication in networked control systems, particularly when data transmission incurs a cost. While the optimal controller in a standard linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) setup can be computed analytically, determining the optimal times to transmit sensor data remains computationally and analytically challenging. We show that, through reformulation and the introduction of auxiliary binary variables, the scheduling problem can be cast as a computationally efficient mixed-integer linear program (MILP). This formulation not only simplifies the analysis but also reveals structural insights and provides clear decision criteria at each step. Embedding the approach within a model predictive control (MPC) framework enables dynamic adaptation, and we prove that the resulting scheduler performs at least as well as any deterministic strategy (e.g., periodic strategy). Simulation results further demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms traditional periodic scheduling.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Control Barrier Functions: Nested Boolean and p-choose-r Compositions of Safety Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of composing multiple control barrier functions (CBFs) -- and matrix control barrier functions (MCBFs) -- through logical and combinatorial operations. Standard CBF formulations naturally enable conjunctive (AND) combinations, but disjunctive (OR) and more general logical structures introduce nonsmoothness and possibly a combinatorial blow-up in the number of logical combinations. We introduce the framework of combinatorial CBFs that addresses p-choose-r safety specifications and their nested composition. The proposed framework ensures safety for the exact safe set in a scalable way, using the original number of primitive constraints. We establish theoretical guarantees on safety under these compositions, and we demonstrate their use on a patrolling problem in a multi-agent system.</description>

      <title>Multi-sectoral Impacts of H2 and Synthetic Fuels Adoption for Heavy-duty Transportation Decarbonization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policies focused on deep decarbonization of regional economies emphasize electricity sector decarbonization alongside electrification of end-uses. There is growing interest in utilizing hydrogen (H2) produced via electricity to displace fossil fuels in difficult-to-electrify sectors. One such case is heavy-duty vehicles (HDV), which represent a substantial and growing share of transport emissions as light-duty vehicles electrify. Here, we assess the bulk energy system impact of decarbonizing the HDV segment via either H2, or drop-in synthetic liquid fuels produced from H2 and CO2. Our analysis soft-links two modeling approaches: (a) a bottom-up transport demand model producing a variety of final energy demand scenarios for the same service demand and (b) a multi-sectoral capacity expansion model that co-optimizes power, H2 and CO2 supply chains under technological and policy constraints to meet exogenous final energy demands. Through a case study of Western Europe in 2040 under deep decarbonization constraints, we quantify the energy system implications of different levels of H2 and synthetic fuels adoption in the HDV sector under scenarios with and without CO2 sequestration. In the absence of CO2 storage, substitution of liquid fossil fuels in HDVs is essential to meet the deep decarbonization constraint across the modeled power, H2 and transport sectors. Additionally, utilizing H2 HDVs reduces decarbonization costs and fossil liquids demand, but could increase natural gas consumption. While H2 HDV adoption reduces the need for direct air capture (DAC), synthetic fuel adoption increases DAC investments and total system costs. The study highlights the trade-offs across transport decarbonization pathways, and underscores the importance of multi-sectoral consideration in decarbonization studies.</description>

      <title>Experimental Validation of Decentralized Affine Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an experimental validation of decentralized affine transformation (AT) in multi-agent systems using teams of mini-quadcopters. The AT framework enables an agent team to safely navigate constrained, obstacle-rich environments while allowing aggressive changes in inter-agent distances, which are formally characterized through the decomposition of the AT transformation matrix. Without loss of generality, we focus on two-dimensional AT, formulated as a decentralized leader-follower problem. In this formulation, three leader quadcopters are positioned at the vertices of a triangle, while all follower quadcopters remain within the triangle. The leaders know the desired trajectories prescribed by the AT, whereas the followers do not. Instead, the followers infer their trajectories through local communication governed by fixed communication weights determined by the initial spatial configuration of the team. Experimental results validate the asymptotic convergence of decentralized AT and demonstrate its capability to safely guide multi-agent teams through obstacle-laden environments.</description>

      <title>Control Synthesis for Multiple Reach-Avoid Tasks via Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the control synthesis problem for continuous-time time-varying nonlinear systems with disturbance under a class of multiple reach-avoid (MRA) tasks. Specifically, the MRA task requires the system to reach a series of target regions in a specified order while satisfying state constraints between each pair of target arrivals. This problem is more challenging than standard reach-avoid tasks, as it requires considering the feasibility of future reach-avoid tasks during the planning process. To solve this problem, we define a series of value functions by solving a cascade of time-varying reach-avoid problems characterized by Hamilton-Jacobi variational inequalities. We prove that the super-level set of the final value function computed is exactly the feasible set of the MRA task. Additionally, we demonstrate that the control law can be effectively synthesized by ensuring the non-negativeness of the value functions over time. We also show that the Linear temporal logic task control synthesis problems can be converted to a collection of MRA task control synthesis problems by properly defining each target and state constraint set of MRA tasks. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated through four case studies on robot planning problems under time-varying nonlinear systems with disturbance.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification on State-Based Conflict Detection and Resolution Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates how navigation uncertainty affects conflict detection and resolution (CD&amp;R) for uncrewed aircraft in U-space. Position and velocity errors are modelled as zero-mean Gaussian noise consistent with ADS-L accuracy, and propagated through conflict metrics using Monte Carlo and analytical approximations. Under uncertainty, state-based detection becomes probabilistic. The probability of detection depends on both the level of uncertainty and the encounter geometry, and falls below 50% when the nominal intrusion time equals the look-ahead. Operationally, detection is re-evaluated over time as the encounter develops, yielding multiple observations with varying probabilities. Two resolution algorithms are compared: Modified Voltage Potential (MVP) and Velocity Obstacle (VO). MVP proves more robust under uncertainty because it explicitly maximises distance at the closest point of approach (CPA). By maximising CPA distance, MVP maintains an outward push and avoids reversal behaviour during the manoeuvre, whereas VO performance degrades at low relative speeds and shallow angles. BlueSky simulations confirm these effects: MVP achieves higher intrusion-prevention rates and larger post-resolution miss distances across conflict scenarios, with its advantage most pronounced at low relative velocity. The findings highlight the importance of maximising CPA distance as a conflict resolution strategy. Moreover, the look-ahead horizon and protected zone can be tuned to achieve a desired target level of safety.</description>

      <title>A Highly Compact Direct-Injection Power-Flow Controller and Line-Voltage Regulator with Shared Magnetics and Partial-Power Conversion for Full-Power Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An increasing integration of photovoltaic units, electric vehicle chargers, heat pumps, and energy storage systems challenges low-voltage power grids and can cause voltage range violation, loss of stability, (local) overload of lines, and power management problems. Research suggested universal power-flow control (UPFC) to solve power management problems. In contrast to bulky, slow, and costly conventional UPFCs with their shunt and series transformers, this paper presents a highly compact and current-dense power-flow controller, which can serve between different feeders in the low-voltage power grids. The enabler is a systematic combination of silicon car-bide (SiC) with silicon (Si) transistors and a strict partial-power topology built around a multi-active bridge. The circuit links an active-front-end converter as a shunt stage through a multi-active-bridge converter bidirectionally with low-voltage series-injection modules floating with their respective phases. The topology can use small power to control high currents through the low-voltage series-injection modules. The multi-active bridge serves as a multi-input-output power router that exchanges energy between all elements. We assess the design as well as the implementation considerations of the proposed power-flow controller mathematically and verify its performance in simulation and real systems.</description>

      <title>Factor Graph Optimization for Leak Localization in Water Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting and localizing leaks in water distribution network systems is an important topic with direct environmental, economic, and social impact. Our paper is the first to explore the use of factor graph optimization techniques for leak localization in water distribution networks, enabling us to perform sensor fusion between pressure and demand sensor readings and to estimate the network's temporal and structural state evolution across all network nodes. The methodology introduces specific water network factors and proposes a new architecture composed of two factor graphs: a leak-free state estimation factor graph and a leak localization factor graph. When a new sensor reading is obtained, unlike Kalman and other interpolation-based methods, which estimate only the current network state, factor graphs update both current and past states. Results on Modena, L-TOWN and synthetic networks show that factor graphs are much faster than nonlinear Kalman-based alternatives such as the UKF, while also providing improvements in localization compared to state-of-the-art estimation-localization approaches. Implementation and benchmarks are available at https://github.com/pirofti/FGLL.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Defense Against Coordinated Cyber-Physical Attacks: A Robust Constrained Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern power systems face increasing vulnerability to sophisticated cyber-physical attacks beyond traditional N-1 contingency frameworks. Existing security paradigms face a critical bottleneck: efficiently identifying worst-case scenarios and rapidly coordinating defensive responses are hindered by intensive computation and time delays, during which cascading failures can propagate. This paper presents a novel tri-level robust constrained reinforcement learning (RCRL) framework for robust power system security. The framework generates diverse system states through AC-OPF formulations, identifies worst-case N-K attack scenarios for each state, and trains policies to mitigate these scenarios across all operating conditions without requiring predefined attack patterns. The framework addresses constraint satisfaction through Beta-blending projection-based feasible action mapping techniques during training and primal-dual augmented Lagrangian optimization for deployment. Once trained, the RCRL policy learns how to control observed cyber-physical attacks in real time. Validation on IEEE benchmark systems demonstrates effectiveness against coordinated N-K attacks, causing widespread cascading failures throughout the network. The learned policy can successfully respond rapidly to recover system-wide constraints back to normal within 0.21 ms inference times, establishing superior resilience for critical infrastructure protection.</description>

      <title>General Decentralized Stochastic Optimal Control via Change of Measure: Applications to the Witsenhausen Counterexample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present global and person-by-person (PbP) optimality conditions for general decentralized stochastic dynamic optimal control problems, using a discrete-time version of Girsanov's change of measure. The PbP optimality conditions are applied to the Witsenhausen counterexample to show that the two strategies satisfy two coupled nonlinear integral equations. Further, we prove a fixed point theorem in a function space, establishing existence and uniqueness of solutions to the integral equations. We also provide numerical solutions of the two integral equations using the Gauss Hermite Quadrature scheme, and include a detail comparison to other numerical methods of the literature. The numerical solutions confirm Witsehausen's observation that, for certain choices of parameters, linear or affine strategies are optimal, while for other choices of parameters nonlinear strategies outperformed affine strategies.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Uncertainty Disclosure for Facilitating Enhanced Energy Storage Dispatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel privacy-preserving uncertainty disclosure framework, enabling system operators to release marginal value function bounds to reduce the conservativeness of interval forecast and mitigate excessive withholding, thereby enhancing storage dispatch and social welfare. We propose a risk-averse analytical storage arbitrage model based on stochastic dynamic programming and explicitly account for uncertainty intervals in value function training. We derive real-time marginal value function bounds using a rolling-horizon chance-constrained economic dispatch formulation. We rigorously prove that the bounds reliably cap the true opportunity cost and dynamically converge to the hindsight value. We verify that both the marginal value function and its bounds monotonically decrease with the state of charge and increase with uncertainty, providing a theoretical basis for risk-averse strategic behaviors and SoC-dependent designs. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework via an agent-based simulation on the ISO-NE test system. Under 50% renewable capacity and 35% storage capacity, the proposed bounds enhance storage response by 38.91% and reduce the optimality gap to 3.91% through improved interval predictions. Additionally, by mitigating excessive withholding, the bounds yield an average system cost reduction of 0.23% and an average storage profit increase of 13.22%. These benefits further scale with higher prediction conservativeness, storage capacity, and system uncertainty.</description>

      <title>A Signed Friedkin-Johnsen Model for Arbitrary Network Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents an opposing rule-based signed Friedkin-Johnsen (SFJ) model for the evolution of opinions in arbitrary network topologies with signed interactions and stubborn agents. The primary objective of the paper is to analyse the emergent behaviours of the agents under the proposed rule and to identify the key agents which contribute to the final opinions, characterised as influential agents. We start by presenting some convergence results which show how the opinions of the agents evolve for a signed network with any arbitrary topology. Throughout the paper, we classify the agents as opinion leaders (sinks in the associated condensation graph) and followers (the rest). In general, it has been shown in the literature that opinion leaders and stubborn agents drive the opinions of the group. However, the addition of signed interactions reveals interesting behaviours wherein opinion leaders can now become non-influential or less influential. Further, while the stubborn agents always continue to remain influential, they might become less influential owing to signed interactions. Additionally, the signed interactions can drive the opinions of the agents outside of the convex hull of their initial opinions. Thereafter, we propose the absolute influence centrality measure, which allows us to quantify the overall influence of all the agents in the network and also identify the most influential agents. Unlike most of the existing measures, it is applicable to any network topology and considers the effect of both stubbornness and signed interactions. Finally, simulations are presented for the Bitcoin Alpha dataset to elaborate the proposed results.</description>

      <title>Opinion Clustering under the Friedkin-Johnsen Model: Agreement in Disagreement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convergence of opinions in the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) framework is well studied, but the topological conditions leading to opinion clustering remain less explored. To bridge this gap, we examine the role of topology in the emergence of opinion clusters within the network. The key contribution of the paper lies in the introduction of the notion of topologically prominent agents, referred to as Locally Topologically Persuasive (LTP) agents. Interestingly, each LTP agent is associated with a unique set of (non-influential) agents in its vicinity. Using them, we present conditions to obtain opinion clusters in the FJ framework in any arbitrarily connected digraph. A key advantage of the proposed result is that the resulting opinion clusters are independent of the edge weights and the stubbornness of the agents. Finally, we demonstrate using simulation results that, by suitably placing LTP agents, one can design networks that achieve any desired opinion clustering.</description>

      <title>BERT4beam: Large AI Model Enabled Generalized Beamforming Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is anticipated to emerge as a pivotal enabler for the forthcoming sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication systems. However, current research efforts regarding large AI models for wireless communications primarily focus on fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for specific tasks. This paper investigates the large-scale AI model designed for beamforming optimization to adapt and generalize to diverse tasks defined by system utilities and scales. We propose a novel framework based on bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), termed BERT4beam. We aim to formulate the beamforming optimization problem as a token-level sequence learning task, perform tokenization of the channel state information, construct the BERT model, and conduct task-specific pre-training and fine-tuning strategies. Based on the framework, we propose two BERT-based approaches for single-task and multi-task beamforming optimization, respectively. Both approaches are generalizable for varying user scales. Moreover, the former can adapt to varying system utilities and antenna configurations by re-configuring the input and output module of the BERT model, while the latter, termed UBERT, can directly generalize to diverse tasks, due to a finer-grained tokenization strategy. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the two proposed approaches can achieve near-optimal performance and outperform existing AI models across various beamforming optimization tasks, showcasing strong adaptability and generalizability.</description>

      <title>Fundamental limitations of sensitivity metrics for anomaly impact analysis in LTI systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study establishes a connection between the output-to-output gain (OOG), a sensitivity metric quantifying the impact of stealthy attacks, and a novel input-to-input gain (IIG) introduced to evaluate fault sensitivity under disturbances, and investigates their fundamental performance limitations arising from the transmission zeros of the underlying dynamical system. Inspired by the OOG, which characterizes the maximum performance loss caused by stealthy attacks, the IIG is proposed as a new measure of robust fault sensitivity, and is defined as the maximum energy of undetectable faults for a given disturbance intensity. Then, using right (for OOG) and left (for IIG) co-prime factorizations, both metrics are expressed as the~$\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ norm of a ratio of the numerator factors. This unified representation facilitates a systematic analysis of their fundamental limitations. Subsequently, by utilizing the Poisson integral relation, theoretical bounds for the IIG and OOG are derived, explicitly characterizing their fundamental limitations imposed by system \mbox{non-minimum} phase (NMP) zeros. Finally, a numerical example is employed to validate the results.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Modeling, Analysis, and Validation of Dual-Port Grid-Forming Control for Hybrid AC/DC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the transient and dynamical behavior of hybrid AC/DC systems using dual-port grid-forming (GFM) control. A generalized modeling framework for hybrid AC/DC networks is first introduced that accounts for converter, control, and network circuit dynamics and arbitrary network topologies. This modeling framework is applied to low-voltage networks to analyze the performance of dual-port grid-forming (GFM) control. The results demonstrate that active damping by dual-port GFM control is effective at improving the transient response and mitigating oscillations. In contrast, the steady-state response characteristics can be adjusted independently with minimal impact on damping characteristics. The dynamic model and results are validated through hardware experiments for three prototypical system architectures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that low-voltage DC distribution interfaced by AC/DC converters using dual-port GFM control, can serve both as the sole interconnection between AC distribution systems and in parallel to an AC connection, thereby enhancing the operational flexibility of low- and medium-voltage distribution networks.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Self-Powered Vibration Control: Theory and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A self-powered system is a control technology that powers itself by harvesting energy from exogenous disturbances. This article details the design and experimental validation of a prototype self-powered vibration control system, for larger-scale applications (i.e., power flows above 1W and forces on the order of 1kN.) The prototype consists of a linear ballscrew coupled with a permanent-magnet synchronous machine. A custom three-phase inverter is used to control power flow, and a custom half-bridge DC-DC power converter is used to facilitate power flow to and from a storage capacitor. Due to parasitics in the control hardware, feedback laws for self-powered systems must adhere to a feasibility condition tighter than mere passivity. This article implements a tractable control design approach that accounts for this feasibility constraint. The control design is validated via hardware-in-the-loop experiments pertaining to a stochastically-excited tuned vibration absorber.</description>

      <title>A Goal-Oriented Approach for Active Object Detection with Exploration-Exploitation Balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active object detection, which aims to identify objects of interest through controlled camera movements, plays a pivotal role in real-world visual perception for autonomous robotic applications, such as manufacturing tasks (e.g., assembly operations) performed in unknown environments. A dual control for exploration and exploitation (DCEE) algorithm is presented within goal-oriented control systems to achieve efficient active object detection, leveraging active learning by incorporating variance-based uncertainty estimation in the cost function. This novel method employs an exploration-exploitation balanced cost function to actively guide the selection of the next viewpoint. Specifically, active object detection is achieved through the development of a reward function that encodes knowledge about the confidence variation of objects as a function of viewpoint position within a given domain. By identifying the unknown parameters of this function, the system generates an optimal viewpoint planning strategy. DCEE integrates parameter estimation of the reward function and view planning, ensuring a balanced trade-off between the exploitation of learned knowledge and active exploration during the planning process. Moreover, it demonstrates remarkable adaptability across diverse scenarios, effectively handling LEGO brick detection at varying locations. Importantly, the algorithm maintains consistent configuration settings and a fixed number of parameters across various scenarios, underscoring its efficiency and robustness. To validate the proposed approach, extensive numerical studies, high-fidelity virtual simulations, and real-world experiments under various scenarios were conducted. The results confirm the effectiveness of DCEE in active object detection, showcasing superior performance compared to existing methods, including model predictive control (MPC) and entropy approaches.</description>

      <title>Partitioning techniques for non-centralized predictive control: A systematic review and novel theoretical insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The partitioning problem is of central relevance for designing and implementing non-centralized Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategies for large-scale systems. These control approaches include decentralized MPC, distributed MPC, hierarchical MPC, and coalitional MPC. Partitioning a system for the application of non-centralized MPC consists of finding the best definition of the subsystems, and their allocation into groups for the definition of local controllers, to maximize the relevant performance indicators. The present survey proposes a novel systematization of the partitioning approaches in the literature in five main classes: optimization-based, algorithmic, community-detection-based, game-theoretic-oriented, and heuristic approaches. A unified graph-theoretical formalism, a mathematical re-formulation of the problem in terms of mixed-integer programming, the novel concepts of predictive partitioning and multi-topological representations, and a methodological formulation of quality metrics are developed to support the classification and further developments of the field. We analyze the different classes of partitioning techniques, and we present an overview of their strengths and limitations, which include a technical discussion about the different approaches. Representative case studies are discussed to illustrate the application of partitioning techniques for non-centralized MPC in various sectors, including power systems, water networks, wind farms, chemical processes, transportation systems, communication networks, industrial automation, smart buildings, and cyber-physical systems. An outlook of future challenges completes the survey.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control with High-Probability Safety Guarantee for Nonlinear Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model predictive control (MPC) framework for nonlinear stochastic systems that ensures safety guarantee with high probability. Unlike most existing stochastic MPC schemes, our method adopts a set-erosion that converts the probabilistic safety constraint into a tractable deterministic safety constraint on a smaller safe set over deterministic dynamics. As a result, our method is compatible with any off-the-shelf deterministic MPC algorithm. The key to the effectiveness of our method is a tight bound on the stochastic fluctuation of a stochastic trajectory around its nominal version. Our method is scalable and can guarantee safety with high probability level (e.g., 99.99%), making it particularly suitable for safety-critical applications involving complex nonlinear dynamics. Rigorous analysis is conducted to establish a theoretical safety guarantee, and numerical experiments are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed MPC method.</description>

      <title>$\epsilon$-Optimal Multi-Agent Patrol using Recurrent Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-agent patrol problem refers to repeatedly visiting different locations in an environment using multiple autonomous agents. For over two decades, researchers have studied this problem in various settings. While providing valuable insights into the problem, the works in existing literature have not commented on the nature of the optimal solutions to the problem. We first show that an $\epsilon$-approximate recurrent patrol strategy exists for every feasible patrol strategy. Then, we establish the existence of a recurrent patrol strategy that is an $\epsilon$-optimal solution to the General Patrol Problem. The factor $\epsilon$ is proportional to the discretisation constant $D$, which can be arbitrarily small and is independent of the number of patrol agents and the size of the environment. This result holds for a variety of problem formulations already studied. We also provide an algorithmic approach to determine an $\epsilon$-approximate recurrent patrol strategy for a patrol strategy created by any method from the literature. We perform extensive simulations in graphs based on real-life environments to validate the claims made in this work.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the well established idea that collective wisdom is greater than that of an individual, we propose a novel learning dynamics as a sort of companion to the Abelson model of opinion dynamics. Agents are assumed to make independent guesses about the true state of the world after which they engage in opinion exchange leading to consensus. We investigate the problem of finding the optimal parameters for this exchange, e.g. those that minimize the variance of the consensus value. Specifically, the parameter we examine is susceptibility to opinion change. We propose a dynamics for distributed learning of the optimal parameters and analytically show that it converges for all relevant initial conditions by linking to well established results from consensus theory. Lastly, a numerical example provides intuition on both system behavior and our proof methods.</description>

      <title>Varying Horizon Learning Economic MPC With Unknown Costs of Disturbed Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel varying horizon economic model predictive control (EMPC) scheme without terminal constraints for constrained nonlinear systems with additive disturbances and unknown economic costs. The general regression learning framework with mixed kernels is first used to reconstruct the unknown cost. Then an online iterative procedure is developed to adjust the horizon adaptively. Again, an elegant horizon-dependent contraction constraint is designed to ensure the convergence of the closed-loop system to a neighborhood of the desired steady state. Moreover, sufficient conditions ensuring recursive feasibility and input-to-state stability are established for the system in closed-loop with the EMPC. The merits of the proposed scheme are verified by the simulations of a continuous stirred tank reactor and a four-tank system in terms of robustness, economic performance and online computational burden.</description>

      <title>High Effort, Low Gain: Fundamental Limits of Active Learning for Linear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of identifying an unknown linear dynamical system given a finite hypothesis class. In particular, we analyze the effect of the excitation input on the sample complexity of identifying the true system with high probability. To this end, we present sample complexity lower bounds that capture the choice of the selected excitation input. The sample complexity lower bound gives rise to a system theoretic condition to determine the potential benefit of experiment design. Informed by the analysis of the sample complexity lower bound, we propose a persistent excitation (PE) condition tailored to the considered setting, which we then use to establish sample complexity upper bounds. Notably, the \acs{PE} condition is weaker than in the case of an infinite hypothesis class and allows analyzing different excitation inputs modularly. Crucially, the lower and upper bounds share the same dependency on key problem parameters. Finally, we leverage these insights to propose an active learning algorithm that sequentially excites the system optimally with respect to the current estimate, and provide sample complexity guarantees for the presented algorithm. Concluding simulations showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Distributed Finite-Horizon Optimal Control for Consensus with Differential Privacy Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of privacy-preserving consensus control for multi-agent systems (MAS) using differential privacy. We propose a novel distributed finite-horizon linear quadratic regulator (LQR) framework, in which agents share individual state information while preserving the confidentiality of their local pairwise weight matrices, which are considered sensitive data in MAS. Protecting these matrices effectively safeguards each agent's private cost function and control preferences. Our solution injects consensus error-dependent Laplace noise into the communicated state information and employs a carefully designed time-dependent scaling factor in the local cost functions. {This approach guarantees bounded consensus and achieves rigorous $\epsilon$-differential privacy for the weight matrices without relying on specific noise distribution assumptions.} Additionally, we analytically characterize the trade-off between consensus accuracy and privacy level, offering clear guidelines on how to enhance consensus performance through appropriate scaling of the LQR weight matrices and the privacy budget.</description>

Abstract: Agents controlled by the output of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms often transition to unsafe states, particularly in uncertain and partially observable environments. Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide a natural setting for studying such scenarios with limited sensing. Shields filter undesirable actions to ensure safe RL by preserving safety requirements in the agents' policy. However, synthesizing holistic shields is computationally expensive in complex deployment scenarios. We propose the compositional synthesis of shields by modeling safety requirements by parts, thereby improving scalability. In particular, problem formulations in the form of POMDPs using RL algorithms illustrate that an RL agent equipped with the resulting compositional shielding, beyond being safe, converges to higher values of expected reward. By using subproblem formulations, we preserve and improve the ability of shielded agents to require fewer training episodes than unshielded agents, especially in sparse-reward settings. Concretely, we find that compositional shield synthesis allows an RL agent to remain safe in environments two orders of magnitude larger than other state-of-the-art model-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Control Analysis and Design for Autonomous Vehicles Subject to Imperfect AI-Based Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety is a critical concern in autonomous vehicle (AV) systems, especially when AI-based sensing and perception modules are involved. However, due to the black box nature of AI algorithms, it makes closed-loop analysis and synthesis particularly challenging, for example, establishing closed-loop stability and ensuring performance, while they are fundamental to AV safety. To approach this difficulty, this paper aims to develop new modeling, analysis, and synthesis tools for AI-based AVs. Inspired by recent developments in perception error models (PEMs), the focus is shifted from directly modeling AI-based perception processes to characterizing the perception errors they produce. Two key classes of AI-induced perception errors are considered: misdetection and measurement noise. These error patterns are modeled using continuous-time Markov chains and Wiener processes, respectively. By means of that, a PEM-augmented driving model is proposed, with which we are able to establish the closed-loop stability for a class of AI-driven AV systems via stochastic calculus. Furthermore, a performance-guaranteed output feedback control synthesis method is presented, which ensures both stability and satisfactory performance. The method is formulated as a convex optimization problem, allowing for efficient numerical solutions. The results are then applied to an adaptive cruise control (ACC) scenario, demonstrating their effectiveness and robustness despite the corrupted and misleading perception.</description>

      <title>Design and Optimization of EV Charging Infrastructure with Battery in Commercial Buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The installation of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in buildings is inevitable, as states push for increased EV adoption to support decarbonization efforts. This transition could force the need for grid infrastructure upgrades and enhanced controls to support reliable power delivery to end-use loads, and overall economic operation. This paper evaluates strategies that address these needs on two fronts: i) optimal sizing of service transformers and battery energy storage systems (BESS), and ii) optimized coordination between EV charging, BESS operation, and building demand. These strategies are applied to a school campus setting, consisting of building and EV charging loads, to provide an illustration of energy management in commercial buildings with EV fleets. A rolling-window optimization approach is applied to determine i) optimal sizing of the service transformer and BESS and ii) optimal control of EV charging and BESS charge/discharge schedules. The design and control strategies are validated in a 20-year time horizon with an annually increasing number of EVs (buses and vans). In addition, an economic analysis is also carried out to show the costs and benefits of each design as a medium- and long-term investment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) models are becoming key components in an autonomous vehicle (AV), especially in handling complicated perception tasks. However, closing the loop through AI-based feedback may pose significant risks on reliability of autonomous driving due to very limited understanding about the mechanism of AI-driven perception processes. To overcome it, this paper aims to develop tools for modeling, analysis, and synthesis for a class of AI-based AV; in particular, their closed-loop properties, e.g., stability, robustness, and performance, are rigorously studied in the statistical sense. First, we provide a novel modeling means for the AI-driven perception processes by looking at their error characteristics. Specifically, three fundamental AI-induced perception uncertainties are recognized and modeled by Markov chains, Gaussian processes, and bounded disturbances, respectively. By means of that, the closed-loop stochastic stability (SS) is established in the sense of mean square, and then, an SS control synthesis method is presented within the framework of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Besides the SS properties, the robustness and performance of AI-based AVs are discussed in terms of a stochastic guaranteed cost, and criteria are given to test the robustness level of an AV when in the presence of AI-induced uncertainties. Furthermore, the stochastic optimal guaranteed cost control is investigated, and an efficient design procedure is developed innovatively based on LMI techniques and convex optimization. Finally, to illustrate the effectiveness, the developed results are applied to an example of car following control, along with extensive simulation.</description>

      <title>The LLM as a Network Operator: A Vision for Generative AI in the 6G Radio Access Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The management of future AI-native Next-Generation (NextG) Radio Access Networks (RANs), including 6G and beyond, presents a challenge of immense complexity that exceeds the capabilities of traditional automation. In response, we introduce the concept of the LLM-RAN Operator. In this paradigm, a Large Language Model (LLM) is embedded into the RAN control loop to translate high-level human intents into optimal network actions. Unlike prior empirical studies, we present a formal framework for an LLM-RAN operator that builds on earlier work by making guarantees checkable through an adapter aligned with the Open RAN (O-RAN) standard, separating strategic LLM-driven guidance in the Non-Real-Time (RT) RAN intelligent controller (RIC) from reactive execution in the Near-RT RIC, including a proposition on policy expressiveness and a theorem on convergence to stable fixed points. By framing the problem with mathematical rigor, our work provides the analytical tools to reason about the feasibility and stability of AI-native RAN control. It identifies critical research challenges in safety, real-time performance, and physical-world grounding. This paper aims to bridge the gap between AI theory and wireless systems engineering in the NextG era, aligning with the AI4NextG vision to develop knowledgeable, intent-driven wireless networks that integrate generative AI into the heart of the RAN.</description>

      <title>Synergetic Empowerment: Wireless Communications Meets Embodied Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless communication is evolving into an agent era, where large-scale agents with inherent embodied intelligence are not just users but active participants. The perfect combination of wireless communication and embodied intelligence can achieve a synergetic empowerment and greatly facilitate the development of agent communication. An overview of this synergetic empowerment is presented, framing it as a co-evolutionary process that transforms wireless communication from a simple utility into the digital nervous system of a collective intelligence, while simultaneously elevating isolated agents into a unified superorganism with emergent capabilities far exceeding individual contributions. Moreover, we elaborate how embodied intelligence and wireless communication mutually benefit each other through the lens of the perception-cognition-execution (PCE) loop, revealing a fundamental duality where each PCE stage both challenges network capacity and creates unprecedented opportunities for system-wide optimization. Furthermore, critical open issues and future research directions are identified.</description>

      <title>Development of AI-integrated infrastructure with biomedical device and mobile app for neonatal vital monitoring during and in between kangaroo care sessions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Premature infant mortality remains a critical challenge in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with continuous vital sign monitoring being essential for early detection of life-threatening conditions. This paper presents an integrated system combining NeoWarm, a novel biomedical device, with NeoRoo, a mobile application, and NeoSmartML, a machine learning infrastructure, to enable comprehensive vital sign monitoring during Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC). Our power-optimized device achieves 6-6.5 days of continuous operation on a single charge, while the mobile application implements an offline-first architecture with efficient data synchronization. The optical character recognition pipeline demonstrates promising accuracy (F1 scores 0.78-0.875) for automated vital sign extraction from existing NICU monitors. Experimental validation shows the system's feasibility for deployment in resource-constrained settings, though further optimization of heart rate and temperature detection, along with the risk classification foundation model is needed.</description>

      <title>A Service-Oriented Adaptive Hierarchical Incentive Mechanism for Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a novel framework for distributed model training. In FL, the task publisher (TP) releases tasks, and local model owners (LMOs) use their local data to train models. Sometimes, FL suffers from the lack of training data, and thus workers are recruited for gathering data. To this end, this paper proposes an adaptive incentive mechanism from a service-oriented perspective, with the objective of maximizing the utilities of TP, LMOs and workers. Specifically, a Stackelberg game is theoretically established between the LMOs and TP, positioning TP as the leader and the LMOs as followers. An analytical Nash equilibrium solution is derived to maximize their utilities. The interaction between LMOs and workers is formulated by a multi-agent Markov decision process (MAMDP), with the optimal strategy identified via deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Additionally, an Adaptively Searching the Optimal Strategy Algorithm (ASOSA) is designed to stabilize the strategies of each participant and solve the coupling problems. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>SG-ML: Smart Grid Cyber Range Modelling Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work provides a detailed specification of the Smart Grid Modelling Language (SG-ML), which is designed for the automated generation of smart grid cyber ranges. SG-ML is defined as a set of XML schemas that describe a smart grid's configuration in both machine-readable and human-friendly ways, thereby bridging the gap between system modelling and automated deployment. Unlike prior ad-hoc approaches to cyber range design, SG-ML provides a unified methodology that integrates both power system and cyber network representations. The SG-ML model can be customized by users to meet specific requirements, such as emulating physical or cyber topologies and configuring network devices. An SG-ML Processor then parses this configured model to instantiate the cyber range environment. The modelling language leverages established standards like the IEC 61850 Substation Configuration Language (SCL) and IEC 61131 PLCopen XML to define power system topology, cyber network topology, and device configurations. This approach allows for the reuse of existing assets, reducing the effort needed to create the SG-ML model. To address gaps not covered by these standards such as attack injection parameters, scenario-specific metadata, and additional network constraints, SG-ML introduces proprietary schemas that complement standard models. Overall, SG-ML enables reproducible, scalable, and automated generation of realistic smart grid cyber ranges for research, training, and security assessment.</description>

      <title>Stabilising Lifetime PD Models under Forecast Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating lifetime probabilities of default (PDs) under IFRS~9 and CECL requires projecting point--in--time transition matrices over multiple years. A persistent weakness is that macroeconomic forecast errors compound across horizons, producing unstable and volatile PD term structures. This paper reformulates the problem in a state--space framework and shows that a direct Kalman filter leaves non--vanishing variability. We then introduce an anchored observation model, which incorporates a neutral long--run economic state into the filter. The resulting error dynamics exhibit asymptotic stochastic stability, ensuring convergence in probability of the lifetime PD term structure. Simulation on a synthetic corporate portfolio confirms that anchoring reduces forecast noise and delivers smoother, more interpretable projections.</description>

      <title>Reasonable Experiments in Model-Based Systems Engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the current trend in Model-Based Systems Engineering towards Digital Engineering and early Validation &amp; Verification, experiments are increasingly used to estimate system parameters and explore design decisions. Managing such experimental configuration metadata and results is of utmost importance in accelerating overall design effort. In particular, we observe it is important to 'intelligent-ly' reuse experiment-related data to save time and effort by not performing potentially superfluous, time-consuming, and resource-intensive experiments. In this work, we present a framework for managing experiments on digital and/or physical assets with a focus on case-based reasoning with domain knowledge to reuse experimental data efficiently by deciding whether an already-performed experiment (or associated answer) can be reused to answer a new (potentially different) question from the engineer/user without having to set up and perform a new experiment. We provide the general architecture for such an experiment manager and validate our approach using an industrial vehicular energy system-design case study.</description>

      <title>Sound Matching an Analogue Levelling Amplifier Using the Newton-Raphson Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic differentiation through digital signal processing algorithms for virtual analogue modelling has recently gained popularity. These algorithms are typically more computationally efficient than black-box neural networks that rely on dense matrix multiplications. Due to their differentiable nature, they can be integrated with neural networks and jointly trained using gradient descent algorithms, resulting in more efficient systems. Furthermore, signal processing algorithms have significantly fewer parameters than neural networks, allowing the application of the Newton-Raphson method. This method offers faster and more robust convergence than gradient descent at the cost of quadratic storage. This paper presents a method to emulate analogue levelling amplifiers using a feed-forward digital compressor with parameters optimised via the Newton-Raphson method. We demonstrate that a digital compressor can successfully approximate the behaviour of our target unit, the Teletronix LA-2A. Different strategies for computing the Hessian matrix are benchmarked. We leverage parallel algorithms for recursive filters to achieve efficient training on modern GPUs. The resulting model is made into a VST plugin and is open-sourced at https://github.com/aim-qmul/4a2a.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Network Utility Maximization via GPU-Accelerated Proximal Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a GPU-accelerated proximal message passing algorithm for large-scale network utility maximization (NUM). NUM is a fundamental problem in resource allocation, where resources are allocated across various streams in a network to maximize total utility while respecting link capacity constraints. Our method, a variant of ADMM, requires only sparse matrix-vector multiplies with the link-route matrix and element-wise proximal operator evaluations, enabling fully parallel updates across streams and links. It also supports heterogeneous utility types, including logarithmic utilities common in NUM, and does not assume strict concavity. We implement our method in PyTorch and demonstrate its performance on problems with tens of millions of variables and constraints, achieving 4x to 20x speedups over existing CPU and GPU solvers and solving problem sizes that exhaust the memory of baseline methods. Additionally, we show that our algorithm is robust to congestion and link-capacity degradation. Finally, using a time-expanded transit seat allocation case study, we illustrate how our approach yields interpretable allocations in realistic networks.</description>

      <title>Highly Efficient Optimal Control for Lyophilization via Simulation of Discrete/Continuous Mixed-index Differential-algebraic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a highly efficient optimal control algorithm and policies for lyophilization (also known as freeze drying). The optimal solutions and control policies are derived using an extended version of the simulation-based algorithm, which reformulates the optimal control problem as a hybrid discrete/continuous system of mixed-index differential-algebraic equations and subsequently calculates the optimal control vector via simulation of the resulting DAEs. Our algorithm and control policies are demonstrated via a number of case studies that encompass various lyophilization and optimal control strategies. All the case studies can be solved within less than a second on a normal laptop, regardless of their complexity. The method is several orders of magnitude faster than the traditional optimization-based techniques while giving similar/better accuracy. The proposed algorithm offers an efficient and reliable framework for optimal control of lyophilization, which can also be extended to other similar systems with phase transitions.</description>

      <title>ViSTR-GP: Online Cyberattack Detection via Vision-to-State Tensor Regression and Gaussian Processes in Automated Robotic Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industrial robotic systems are central to automating smart manufacturing operations. Connected and automated factories face growing cybersecurity risks that can potentially cause interruptions and damages to physical operations. Among these attacks, data-integrity attacks often involve sophisticated exploitation of vulnerabilities that enable an attacker to access and manipulate the operational data and are hence difficult to detect with only existing intrusion detection or model-based detection. This paper addresses the challenges in utilizing existing side-channels to detect data-integrity attacks in robotic manufacturing processes by developing an online detection framework, ViSTR-GP, that cross-checks encoder-reported measurements against a vision-based estimate from an overhead camera outside the controller's authority. In this framework, a one-time interactive segmentation initializes SAM-Track to generate per-frame masks. A low-rank tensor-regression surrogate maps each mask to measurements, while a matrix-variate Gaussian process models nominal residuals, capturing temporal structure and cross-joint correlations. A frame-wise test statistic derived from the predictive distribution provides an online detector with interpretable thresholds. We validate the framework on a real-world robotic testbed with synchronized video frame and encoder data, collecting multiple nominal cycles and constructing replay attack scenarios with graded end-effector deviations. Results on the testbed indicate that the proposed framework recovers joint angles accurately and detects data-integrity attacks earlier with more frequent alarms than all baselines. These improvements are most evident in the most subtle attacks. These results show that plants can detect data-integrity attacks by adding an independent physical channel, bypassing the controller's authority, without needing complex instrumentation.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Close-Proximity Photovoltaic Panel Coating Using a Quadcopter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) panels are becoming increasingly widespread in the domain of renewable energy, and thus, small efficiency gains can have massive effects. Anti-reflective and self-cleaning coatings enhance panel performance but degrade over time, requiring periodic reapplication. Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer a flexible and autonomous way to apply protective coatings more often and at lower cost compared to traditional manual coating methods. In this letter, we propose a quadcopter-based system, equipped with a liquid dispersion mechanism, designed to automate such tasks. The localization stack only uses onboard sensors, relying on visual-inertial odometry and the relative position of the PV panel detected with respect to the quadcopter. The control relies on a model-based controller that accounts for the ground effect and the mass decrease of the quadcopter during liquid dispersion. We validate the autonomy capabilities of our system through extensive indoor and outdoor experiments.</description>

      <title>California Wildfire Inventory (CAWFI): An Extensive Dataset for Predictive Techniques based on Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to climate change and the disruption of ecosystems worldwide, wildfires are increasingly impacting environment, infrastructure, and human lives globally. Additionally, an exacerbating climate crisis means that these losses would continue to grow if preventative measures are not implemented. Though recent advancements in artificial intelligence enable wildfire management techniques, most deployed solutions focus on detecting wildfires after ignition. The development of predictive techniques with high accuracy requires extensive datasets to train machine learning models. This paper presents the California Wildfire Inventory (CAWFI), a wildfire database of over 37 million data points for building and training wildfire prediction solutions, thereby potentially preventing megafires and flash fires by addressing them before they spark. The dataset compiles daily historical California wildfire data from 2012 to 2018 and indicator data from 2012 to 2022. The indicator data consists of leading indicators (meteorological data correlating to wildfire-prone conditions), trailing indicators (environmental data correlating to prior and early wildfire activity), and geological indicators (vegetation and elevation data dictating wildfire risk and spread patterns). CAWFI has already demonstrated success when used to train a spatio-temporal artificial intelligence model, predicting 85.7% of future wildfires larger than 300,000 acres when trained on 2012-2017 indicator data. This dataset is intended to enable wildfire prediction research and solutions as well as set a precedent for future wildfire databases in other regions.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective task allocation for electric harvesting robots: a hierarchical route reconstruction approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing labor costs in agriculture have accelerated the adoption of multi-robot systems for orchard harvesting. However, efficiently coordinating these systems is challenging due to the complex interplay between makespan and energy consumption, particularly under practical constraints like load-dependent speed variations and battery limitations. This paper defines the multi-objective agricultural multi-electrical-robot task allocation (AMERTA) problem, which systematically incorporates these often-overlooked real-world constraints. To address this problem, we propose a hybrid hierarchical route reconstruction algorithm (HRRA) that integrates several innovative mechanisms, including a hierarchical encoding structure, a dual-phase initialization method, task sequence optimizers, and specialized route reconstruction operators. Extensive experiments on 45 test instances demonstrate HRRA's superior performance against seven state-of-the-art algorithms. Statistical analysis, including the Wilcoxon signed-rank and Friedman tests, empirically validates HRRA's competitiveness and its unique ability to explore previously inaccessible regions of the solution space. In general, this research contributes to the theoretical understanding of multi-robot coordination by offering a novel problem formulation and an effective algorithm, thereby also providing practical insights for agricultural automation.</description>

      <title>Dynamic modeling and simulation of an electric flash clay calcination plant for green cement production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel dynamic model of an electric flash clay calcination plant. Calcined kaolinite-rich clay has been identified as one of the most effective candidates for supplementary cementitious material (SCM), because of its large availability. Calcination of clay is achieved via the dehydroxylation reaction, which does not release CO2 (unlike limestone), but has a considerable energy requirement. The required high temperature can be met by electric resistive heating of the working gas in the plant, that can be powered by renewable energy. Therefore, CO2-free calcination of clay can be achieved. Up to 50\% of the limestone-based clinker can be substituted by calcined clay (CC), making the cement more sustainable. We consider a plant that consists of gas-material cyclones that pre-heat the clay, a calciner, and a gas-recirculation system with electric heating of the gas. The model is formulated as a system of differential-algebraic equations (DAE). The model consists of thermophysical properties, reaction kinetics and stoichiometry, transport, mass and energy balances, and algebraic constraints. The model can be used to perform dynamic simulations with changing inputs, process design, and optimization. Moreover, it can be used to develop model-based control, which is relevant for flexible operation of a clay calcination plant for green cement production.</description>

      <title>Comparing Model-based Control Strategies for a Quadruple Tank System: Decentralized PID, LMPC, and NMPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper compares the performance of a decentralized proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, a linear model predictive controller (LMPC), and a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) applied to a quadruple tank system (QTS). We present experimental data from a physical setup of the QTS as well as simulation results. The QTS is modeled as a stochastic nonlinear continuous-discrete-time system, with parameters estimated using a maximum-likelihood prediction-error-method (ML-PEM). The NMPC applies the stochastic nonlinear continuous-discrete-time model, while the LMPC uses a linearized version of the same model. We tune the decentralized PID controller using the simple internal model control (SIMC) rules. The SIMC rules require transfer functions of the process, and we obtain these from the linearized model. We compare the controller performances based on systematic tests using both the physical setup and the simulated QTS. We measure the performance in terms of tracking errors and rate of movement in the manipulated variables. The LMPC and the NMPC perform better than the decentralized PID control system for tracking pre-announced time-varying setpoints. For disturbance rejection, the MPCs perform only slightly better than the decentralized PID controller. The primary advantage of the MPCs is their ability to use the information of future setpoints. We demonstrate this by providing simulation results of the MPCs with and without such information. Finally, the NMPC achieves slightly improved tracking errors compared to the LMPC but at the expense of having a higher input rate of movement.</description>

      <title>CORB-Planner: Corridor as Observations for RL Planning in High-Speed Flight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in a large number of robotic control tasks. Nevertheless, its deployment on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) remains challenging, mainly because of reliance on accurate dynamic models and platform-specific sensing, which hinders cross-platform transfer. This paper presents the CORB-Planner (Corridor-as-Observations for RL B-spline planner), a real-time, RL-based trajectory planning framework for high-speed autonomous UAV flight across heterogeneous platforms. The key idea is to combine B-spline trajectory generation with the RL policy producing successive control points with a compact safe flight corridor (SFC) representation obtained via heuristic search. The SFC abstracts obstacle information in a low-dimensional form, mitigating overfitting to platform-specific details and reducing sensitivity to model inaccuracies. To narrow the sim-to-real gap, we adopt an easy-to-hard progressive training pipeline in simulation. A value-based soft decomposed-critic Q (SDCQ) algorithm is used to learn effective policies within approximately ten minutes of training. Benchmarks in simulation and real-world tests demonstrate real-time planning on lightweight onboard hardware and support maximum flight speeds up to 8.2m/s in dense, cluttered environments without external positioning. Compatibility with various UAV configurations (quadrotors, hexarotors) and modest onboard compute underlines the generality and robustness of CORB-Planner for practical deployment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study optimal scheduling in multi-class queueing systems with reentrance, where jobs may return for additional service after completion. Such reentrance creates feedback loops that fundamentally alter congestion dynamics and challenge classical scheduling results. We model two distinct dimensions of the reentrance behavior, the probability of return and the speed of return, and show that their product, the effective return rate, is the key statistic that governs optimal priorities. Our main result establishes a dichotomy: when the effective return rate of the smaller job class (the class with lower expected total workload) is lower, a fixed priority rule is optimal; when it is higher, fixed rules are suboptimal and the optimal policy must be state dependent. This characterization clarifies how reentrance changes the externalities that jobs impose on one another and provides structural guidance for designing scheduling policies.</description>

      <title>Parallel/Distributed Tabu Search for Scheduling Microprocessor Tasks in Hybrid Flowshop</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper deals with the makespan minimization in the hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with multiprocessor tasks. The hybrid flow shop (HFS) generalizes the classical flow shop processor configuration by replacing each processor (processing stage) by some number of identical parallel processors. Similarly, the multiprocessor tasks generalize the classical assumption, by allowing a task to require more than one processor simultaneously for its processing. In this work we present the algorithm for solving the problem based on the tabu search technique. The proposed algorithm uses parallel and distributed mechanisms for neighborhood evaluation and well balances heterogeneous network environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study considers a set of routes used by public transportation vehicles and dedicated distribution fleets in a general network. We aim to optimally locate alternative fuel refueling stations in the network to serve these dedicated routes. Deviations from prescribed routes for refueling purposes are allowed. Unlike most related literature, our approach considers all points in the network as candidate refueling station locations. We derive coverage constraints for any candidate location to serve a given route. Then we develop an exact algorithm to establish a finite dominating set (FDS) of candidate locations guaranteed to include an optimal solution to the problem. This set can be used in a mathematical model to minimize the number of stations required to cover all flows in the network. Numerical experiments on realistic networks are presented to illustrate the proposed methodology and to demonstrate its scalability and sensitivity to changes in parameter values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Box/cabinet scenarios with stacked objects pose significant challenges for robotic motion due to visual occlusions and constrained free space. Traditional collision-free trajectory planning methods often fail when no collision-free paths exist, and may even lead to catastrophic collisions caused by invisible objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose an operational aware interactive motion planner (PaiP) a real-time closed-loop planning framework utilizing multimodal tactile perception. This framework autonomously infers object interaction features by perceiving motion effects at interaction interfaces. These interaction features are incorporated into grid maps to generate operational cost maps. Building upon this representation, we extend sampling-based planning methods to interactive planning by optimizing both path cost and operational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that PaiP achieves robust motion in narrow spaces.</description>

      <title>Tensor Invariant Data-Assisted Control and Dynamic Decomposition of Multibody Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The control of robotic systems in complex, shared collaborative workspaces presents significant challenges in achieving robust performance and safety when learning from experienced or simulated data is employed in the pipeline. A primary bottleneck is the reliance on coordinate-dependent models, which leads to profound data inefficiency by failing to generalize physical interactions across different frames of reference. This forces learning algorithms to rediscover fundamental physical principles in every new orientation, artificially inflating the complexity of the learning task. This paper introduces a novel framework that synergizes a coordinate-free, unreduced multibody dynamics and kinematics model based on tensor mechanics with a Data-Assisted Control (DAC) architecture. A non-recursive, closed-form Newton-Euler model in an augmented matrix form is derived that is optimized for tensor-based control design. This structure enables a principled decomposition of the system into a structurally certain, physically grounded part and an uncertain, empirical, and interaction-focused part, mediated by a virtual port variable. Then, a complete, end-to-end tensor-invariant pipeline for modeling, control, and learning is proposed. The coordinate-free control laws for the structurally certain part provide a stable and abstract command interface, proven via Lyapunov analysis. Eventually, the model and closed-loop system are validated through simulations. This work provides a naturally ideal input for data-efficient, frame-invariant learning algorithms, such as equivariant learning, designed to learn the uncertain interaction. The synergy directly addresses the data-inefficiency problem, increases explainability and interpretability, and paves the way for more robust and generalizable robotic control in interactive environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epidemic control frequently relies on adjusting interventions based on prevalence. But designing such policies is a highly non-trivial problem due to uncertain intervention effects, costs and the difficulty of quantifying key transmission mechanisms and parameters. Here, using exact mathematical and computational methods, we reveal a fundamental limit in epidemic control in that prevalence feedback policies are outperformed by a single optimally chosen constant control level. Specifically, we find no incentive to use prevalence based control under a wide class of cost functions that depend arbitrarily on interventions and scale with infections. We also identify regimes where prevalence feedback is beneficial. Our results challenge the current understanding that prevalence based interventions are required for epidemic control and suggest that, for many classes of epidemics, interventions should not be varied unless the epidemic is near the herd immunity threshold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note presents a novel, efficient economic model predictive control (EMPC) scheme for non-dissipative systems subject to state and input constraints. A new conception of convergence filters is defined to address the stability issue of EMPC for constrained non-dissipative systems. Three convergence filters are designed accordingly to be imposed into the receding horizon optimization problem of EMPC. To improve online computational efficiency, the variable horizon idea without terminal constraints is adopted to compromise the convergence speed, economic performance, and computational burden of EMPC. Moreover, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the recursive feasibility and stability of the EMPC. The advantages of the proposed EMPC are validated by a classical non-dissipative continuous stirred-tank reactor.</description>

      <title>VH-Diffuser: Variable Horizon Diffusion Planner for Time-Aware Goal-Conditioned Trajectory Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based planners have gained significant recent attention for their robustness and performance in long-horizon tasks. However, most existing planners rely on a fixed, pre-specified horizon during both training and inference. This rigidity often produces length-mismatch (trajectories that are too short or too long) and brittle performance across instances with varying geometric or dynamical difficulty. In this paper, we introduce the Variable Horizon Diffuser (VHD) framework, which treats the horizon as a learned variable rather than a fixed hyperparameter. Given a start-goal pair, we first predict an instance-specific horizon using a learned Length Predictor model, which guides a Diffusion Planner to generate a trajectory of the desired length. Our design maintains compatibility with existing diffusion planners by controlling trajectory length through initial noise shaping and training on randomly cropped sub-trajectories, without requiring architectural changes. Empirically, VHD improves success rates and path efficiency in maze-navigation and robot-arm control benchmarks, showing greater robustness to horizon mismatch and unseen lengths, while keeping training simple and offline-only.</description>

      <title>A Converse Control Lyapunov Theorem for Joint Safety and Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the existence of a strictly compatible pair of control Lyapunov and control barrier functions is equivalent to the existence of a single smooth Lyapunov function that certifies both asymptotic stability and safety. This characterization complements existing literature on converse Lyapunov functions by establishing a partial differential equation (PDE) characterization with prescribed boundary conditions on the safe set, ensuring that the safe set is exactly certified by this Lyapunov function. The result also implies that if a safety and stability specification cannot be certified by a single Lyapunov function, then any pair of control Lyapunov and control barrier functions necessarily leads to a conflict and cannot be satisfied simultaneously in a robust sense.</description>

      <title>From private to public governance: The case for reconfiguring energy systems as a commons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.04028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discussions around the unsustainability of the dominant socio-economic structures have yet to produce solutions to address the escalating problems we face as a species. Such discussions, this paper argues, are hindered by the limited scope of the proposed solutions within a business-as-usual context as well as by the underlying technological rationale upon which these solutions are developed. In this paper, we conceptualize a radical sustainable alternative to the energy conundrum based on an emerging mode of production and a commons-based political economy. We propose a commons-oriented Energy Internet as a potential system for energy production and consumption, which may be better suited to tackle the current issues society faces. We conclude by referring to some of the challenges that the implementation of such a proposal would entail.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Nonlinear Guidance Strategies for Guaranteed Pursuit-Evasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06176v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a pursuit-evasion problem involving three agents: a pursuer, an evader, and a defender. Cooperative guidance laws are developed for the evader-defender team that guarantee interception of the pursuer by the defender before it reaches the vicinity of the evader. Unlike heuristic methods, optimal control, differential game formulation, and recently proposed time-constrained guidance techniques, a geometry-based solution is proposed to safeguard the evader from the pursuer's incoming threat. The proposed strategy is computationally efficient and expected to be scalable as the number of agents increases. Another notable feature of the proposed strategy is that the evader-defender team does not require knowledge of the pursuer's strategy, yet the pursuer's interception is guaranteed for arbitrary initial engagement geometries. It is further shown that the relevant error variables for the evader-defender team (or individual) converge to zero at a prespecified finite time that can be exactly prescribed prior to the three-body engagement. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed cooperative pursuit-evasion strategy is demonstrated through simulations across diverse engagement scenarios.</description>

      <title>Learning-Enabled Iterative Convex Optimization for Safety-Critical Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safety remains a central challenge in control of dynamical systems, particularly when the boundaries of unsafe sets are complex (e.g., nonconvex, nonsmooth) or unknown. This paper proposes a learning-enabled framework for safety-critical Model Predictive Control (MPC) that integrates Discrete-Time High-Order Control Barrier Functions (DHOCBFs) with iterative convex optimization. Unlike existing methods that primarily address CBFs of relative degree one with fully known unsafe set boundaries, our approach generalizes to arbitrary relative degrees and addresses scenarios where the unsafe set boundaries must be inferred. We extract pixel-based data specifically from unsafe set boundaries and train a neural network to approximate local linearizations of these boundaries. The learned models are incorporated into the linearized DHOCBF constraints at each time step, enabling real-time constraint satisfaction within the MPC framework. An iterative convex optimization procedure is developed to accelerate computation while maintaining formal safety guarantees. The benefits of computational performance and safe avoidance of obstacles with diverse shapes are examined and confirmed through numerical results. By bridging model-based control with learning-based environment modeling, this framework advances safe autonomy for discrete-time systems operating in complex and partially known settings.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Infinite-Dimensional Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15737v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interest in reinforcement learning (RL) for large-scale systems, comprising extensive populations of intelligent agents interacting with heterogeneous environments, has surged significantly across diverse scientific domains in recent years. However, the large-scale nature of these systems often leads to high computational costs or reduced performance for most state-of-the-art RL techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a novel RL architecture and derive effective algorithms to learn optimal policies for arbitrarily large systems of agents. In our formulation, we model such systems as parameterized control systems defined on an infinite-dimensional function space. We then develop a moment kernel transform that maps the parameterized system and the value function into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This transformation generates a sequence of finite-dimensional moment representations for the RL problem, organized into a filtrated structure. Leveraging this RL filtration, we develop a hierarchical algorithm for learning optimal policies for the infinite-dimensional parameterized system. To enhance the algorithm's efficiency, we exploit early stopping at each hierarchy, demonstrating the fast convergence property of the algorithm through the construction of a convergent spectral sequence. The performance and efficiency of the proposed algorithm are validated using practical examples in engineering and quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Robust Mean Field Social Control: A Unified Reinforcement Learning Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies linear quadratic Gaussian robust mean field social control problems in the presence of multiplicative noise. We aim to compute asymptotic decentralized strategies without requiring full prior knowledge of agents' dynamics. The primary challenges lie in solving an indefinite stochastic algebraic Riccati equation for feedback gains, and an indefinite algebraic Riccati equation for feedforward gains. To overcome these challenges, we first propose a unified dual-loop iterative framework that handles both indefinite Riccati-type equations, and provide rigorous convergence proofs for both the outer-loop and inner-loop iterations. Secondly, considering the potential biases arising in the iterative processes due to estimation and modeling errors, we verify the robustness of the proposed algorithm using the small-disturbance input-to-state stability technique. Convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal solution is thus ensured, even in the existence of disturbances. Finally, to relax the limitation of requiring precise knowledge of agents' dynamics, we employ the integral reinforcement learning technique to develop a data-driven method within the dual-loop iterative framework. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>On the Equivalence of Koopman Eigenfunctions and Commuting Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02437v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Koopman operator framework offers a way to represent a nonlinear system as a linear one. The key to this simplification lies in the identification of eigenfunctions. While various data-driven algorithms have been developed for this problem, a theoretical characterization of Koopman eigenfunctions from geometric properties of the flow is still missing. This paper provides such a characterization by establishing an equivalence between a set of Koopman eigenfunctions and a set of commuting symmetries -- both assumed to span the tangent spaces at every point on a simply connected open set. Based on this equivalence, we derive an explicit formula for the principal Koopman eigenfunctions and prove its uniform convergence on the region of attraction of a locally asymptotically stable equilibrium point, thereby offering a constructive method for computing Koopman eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Preventive and Reactive Defense Resource Allocation with Uncertain Sensor Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02881v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cyber attacks continue to be a cause of concern despite advances in cyber defense techniques. Although cyber attacks cannot be fully prevented, standard decision-making frameworks typically focus on how to prevent them from succeeding, without considering the cost of cleaning up the damages incurred by successful attacks. This motivates us to investigate a new resource allocation problem formulated in this paper: The defender must decide how to split its investment between preventive defenses, which aim to harden nodes from attacks, and reactive defenses, which aim to quickly clean up the compromised nodes. This encounters a challenge imposed by the uncertainty associated with the observation, or sensor signal, whether a node is truly compromised or not; this uncertainty is real because attack detectors are not perfect. We investigate how the quality of sensor signals impacts the defender's strategic investment in the two types of defense, and ultimately the level of security that can be achieved. In particular, we show that the optimal investment in preventive resources increases, and thus reactive resource investment decreases, with higher sensor quality. We also show that the defender's performance improvement, relative to a baseline of no sensors employed, is maximal when the attacker can only achieve low attack success probabilities.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Value of Seismic Structural Health Monitoring for post-earthquake recovery of electric power system in terms of resilience enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10318v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Post-earthquake recovery of electric power networks (EPNs) is critical to community resilience. Traditional recovery processes often rely on prolonged and imprecise manual inspections for damage diagnosis, leading to suboptimal repair prioritization and extended service disruptions. Seismic Structural Health Monitoring (SSHM) offers the potential to expedite recovery by enabling more accurate and timely damage assessment. However, SSHM deployment incurs costs, and its system-level resilience benefit remains underexplored. This study proposes a probabilistic simulation framework to quantify the value of SSHM for enhancing EPN resilience. The framework includes seismic damage modeling based on network configuration, hazard intensity, fragility functions, and damage-functionality mappings, combined with recovery simulations incorporating resource constraints, repair and transfer durations. System functionality is evaluated using graph-based island detection and optimal power flow analysis. Resilience is quantified via the Lack of Resilience (LoR) metric derived from the functionality restoration curve. SSHM is incorporated by altering the quality of damage information used in repair scheduling. Different monitoring scenarios (e.g., no-SSHM baseline, partial SSHM, full SSHM with various accuracies) are modeled using confusion matrices to simulate damage misclassification. Results show that improved damage awareness via SSHM significantly accelerates recovery and reduces LoR by up to 21%. This work supports evidence-based decisions for SSHM deployment in critical infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Taming Spontaneous Stop-and-Go Traffic Waves: A Computational Mechanism Design Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that stop-and-go waves can be generated spontaneously in traffic even without bottlenecks. Can such undesirable traffic patterns, induced by intrinsic human driving behaviors, be tamed effectively and inexpensively? Taking advantage of emerging connectivity and autonomy technologies, we envision a simple yet realistic traffic control system to achieve this goal. To prove the concept, we design such a system to suppress these waves while maximizing traffic throughput in the Tadaki setting: a circular road with varying number of vehicles. We first introduce our driver behavior model and demonstrate how our calibrated human driving agents can closely reproduce the observed human driving patterns in the original Tadaki experiment. We then propose a simple control system mediated via connected automated vehicles (CAV) whose ideal speed parameter is treated as a system-level control variable adapted to the local vehicle density of the traffic. The objective of the control system is set up as a tradeoff: maximizing throughput while minimizing traffic oscillation. Following computational mechanism design, we search for the optimal control policy as a function of vehicle density and the tradeoff attitude parameter. This can be done by letting all vehicles play a simulated game of CAV-modulated traffic under such a control system. Our simulation results show that the improvements in traffic efficiency and smoothness are substantial. Finally, we envision how such a traffic control system can be realized in an environment with smart vehicles connected to a smart infrastructure or via a scheme of variable speed advisory.</description>

      <title>Taming Spontaneous Stop-and-Go Traffic Waves: A Bifurcation Perspective of A Dynamical Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a discrete-time dynamical system in a car-following context. The system was recently introduced to parsimoniously model human driving behavior based on utility maximization. The parameters of the model were calibrated using vehicle trajectory data from the Sugiyama experiment. It was shown that such a system can accurately reproduce the observed collective phenomena of a more elaborate experiment by Tadaki et al. Once the heterogeneity and noise are switched off, the model defines a map of the corresponding discrete-time dynamical system. We first perform a bifurcation analysis of the map by studying the stability of its limit solutions: a free-flow fixed point and a stop-and-go quasi-periodic orbit. When the vehicle density is varied, our model displays a bifurcation diagram qualitatively similar to those found in a class of optimal velocity models based on an ordinary differential equation approach, including regimes where one or both of the limit solutions are stable. In a 2D bifurcation diagram we further demonstrate that imposing a vehicle density-dependent speed advisory can dissipate the stop-and-go quasi-periodic orbit. This in turn lays the mathematical foundation for a simple, yet effective proposal [1] to tame stop-and-go waves, improving traffic flow and smoothness simultaneously via variable speed advisory.</description>

      <title>Terradynamically streamlined shapes in animals and robots enhances traversability through densely cluttered terrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01797</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.01797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many animals, modern aircraft, and underwater vehicles use streamlined body shapes that reduce fluid dynamic drag to achieve fast and effective locomotion in air and water. Similarly, numerous small terrestrial animals move through cluttered terrain where 3-D, multi-component obstacles like grass, shrubs, vines, and leaf litter resist motion, but it is unknown whether their body shape plays a major role in traversal. Few ground vehicles or terrestrial robots have used body shape to effectively traverse cluttered terrain. Here, we challenged forest-floor-dwelling discoid cockroaches possessing a thin, rounded body to traverse tall, narrowly spaced, vertical, grass-like compliant beams. Animals displayed high traversal performance (79 +/- 12% probability and 3.4 +/- 0.7 s time). Although we observed diverse traversal strategies, cockroaches primarily (48 +/- 9 % probability) used a novel roll maneuver, allowing them to rapidly traverse obstacle gaps narrower than half body width (2.0 +/- 0.5 s traversal time). Reduction of body roundness by addition of artificial shells nearly inhibited roll maneuvers and decreased traversal performance. Inspired by this discovery, we added a thin, rounded exoskeletal shell to a legged robot with a nearly cuboidal body, common to many existing terrestrial robots. Without adding sensory feedback or changing the open-loop control, the rounded shell enabled the robot to traverse beam obstacles with gaps narrower than shell width via body roll. Terradynamically streamlined shapes can reduce terrain resistance and enhance traversability by assisting effective body reorientation via distributed mechanical feedback. Our findings highlight the need to consider body shape to improve robot mobility in real-world terrain often filled with clutter, and to develop better locomotor-ground contact models to understand interaction with complex terrain.</description>

      <title>Delay Analysis of 5G HARQ in the Presence of Decoding and Feedback Latencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for stringent quality of service (QoS) guarantees in 5G networks requires accurate characterisation of delay performance, often measured using Delay Violation Probability (DVP) for a given target delay. Widely used retransmission schemes like Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) and Hybrid ARQ (HARQ) improve QoS through effective feedback, incremental redundancy (IR), and parallel retransmission processes. However, existing works to quantify the DVP under these retransmission schemes overlook practical aspects such as decoding complexity, feedback delays, and the resulting need for multiple parallel ARQ/HARQ processes that enable packet transmissions without waiting for previous feedback, thus exploiting valuable transmission opportunities. This work proposes a comprehensive multi-server delay model for ARQ/HARQ that incorporates these aspects. Using a finite blocklength error model, we derive closed-form expressions and algorithms for accurate DVP evaluation under realistic 5G configurations aligned with 3GPP standards. Our numerical evaluations demonstrate notable improvements in DVP accuracy over the state-of-the-art, highlight the impact of parameter tuning and resource allocation, and reveal how DVP affects system throughput.</description>

      <title>Parametric Reachable Sets Via Controlled Dynamical Embeddings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new framework for reachable set computation through continuous evolution of a set of parameters and offsets which define a parametope, through the intersection of constraints. This results in a dynamical approach towards nonlinear reachability analysis: a single trajectory of an embedding system provides a parametope reachable set for the original system, and uncertainties are accounted for through continuous parameter evolution. This is dual to most existing computational strategies, which define sets through some combination of generator vectors, and usually discretize the system dynamics. We show how, under some regularity assumptions of the dynamics and the set considered, any desired parameter evolution can be accommodated as long as the offset dynamics are set accordingly, providing a virtual "control input" for reachable set computation. In a special case of the theory, we demonstrate how closing the loop for the parameter dynamics using the adjoint of the linearization results in a desirable first-order cancellation of the original system dynamics. Using interval arithmetic in JAX, we demonstrate the efficiency and utility of reachable parametope computation through two numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Industrial Energy Disaggregation with Digital Twin-generated Dataset and Efficient Data Augmentation</title>

Abstract: Industrial Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is limited by the scarcity of high-quality datasets and the complex variability of industrial energy consumption patterns. To address data scarcity and privacy issues, we introduce the Synthetic Industrial Dataset for Energy Disaggregation (SIDED), an open-source dataset generated using Digital Twin simulations. SIDED includes three types of industrial facilities across three different geographic locations, capturing diverse appliance behaviors, weather conditions, and load profiles. We also propose the Appliance-Modulated Data Augmentation (AMDA) method, a computationally efficient technique that enhances NILM model generalization by intelligently scaling appliance power contributions based on their relative impact. We show in experiments that NILM models trained with AMDA-augmented data significantly improve the disaggregation of energy consumption of complex industrial appliances like combined heat and power systems. Specifically, in our out-of-sample scenarios, models trained with AMDA achieved a Normalized Disaggregation Error of 0.093, outperforming models trained without data augmentation (0.451) and those trained with random data augmentation (0.290). Data distribution analyses confirm that AMDA effectively aligns training and test data distributions, enhancing model generalization.</description>

      <title>Advanced Hybrid Transformer LSTM Technique with Attention and TS Mixer for Drilling Rate of Penetration Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of the Rate of Penetration (ROP) is pivotal for drilling optimization, yet it remains a persistent challenge due to the nonlinear, dynamic, and heterogeneous nature of drilling data. This study introduces a novel hybrid deep learning architecture in which input data are first processed through a customized Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture multi-scale temporal dependencies aligned with drilling operational cycles, and the resulting features are subsequently refined by an Enhanced Transformer encoder with drilling-specific positional encodings and real-time optimization. Concurrently, the same input is directed to a Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) block that enables efficient cross-feature modeling of static and categorical attributes such as lithology indices and mud properties. The outputs from the enhanced Transformer and TS-Mixer are concatenated, after which an adaptive attention selectively emphasizes the most informative feature representations for accurate ROP prediction. The proposed framework fuses sequential memory, static feature interactions, global contextual learning, and dynamic feature weighting, providing a comprehensive solution to the heterogeneous and event-driven nature of drilling dynamics. Evaluation on a real-world drilling dataset demonstrates benchmark-leading performance, achieving an Rsqaure of 0.9988 and a MAPE of 1.447%, significantly surpassing standalone and hybrid baselines. Model interpretability is achieved through SHAP and LIME, and comparisons between actual and predicted curves, along with bias checks, confirm the accuracy and fairness of the model across various scenarios. This advanced hybrid approach enables dependable real-time ROP prediction, supporting the development of intelligent, cost-effective drilling optimization systems with significant operational benefits.</description>

      <title>Distance Between Stochastic Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the existing stochastic control theory is well equipped to handle dynamical systems with stochastic uncertainties, a paradigm shift using distance measure based decision making is required for the effective further exploration of the field. As a first step, a distance measure between two stochastic linear time invariant systems is proposed here, extending the existing distance metrics between deterministic linear dynamical systems. In the frequency domain, the proposed distance measure corresponds to the worst-case point-wise in frequency Wasserstein distance between distributions characterising the uncertainties using inverse stereographic projection on the Riemann sphere. For the time domain setting, the proposed distance corresponds to the gap metric induced type-q Wasserstein distance between the distributions characterising the uncertainty of plant models. Apart from providing lower and upper bounds for the proposed distance measures in both frequency and time domain settings, it is proved that the former never exceeds the latter. The proposed distance measures will facilitate the provision of probabilistic guarantees on system robustness and controller performances.</description>
