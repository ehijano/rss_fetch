      <title>High-$T_{\rm c}$ Ag$_x$BC and Cu$_x$BC superconductors accessible via topochemical reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hole-doping of covalent materials has long served as a blueprint for designing conventional high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductors, but thermodynamic constraints severely limit the space of realizable compounds. Our {\it ab initio} results indicate that metastable Ag$_x$BC and Cu$_x$BC phases can be accessed via standard topochemical ion exchange reactions starting from Li$_x$BC precursors. Unlike all known stoichiometric layered metal borocarbides, the predicted AgBC and CuBC derivatives, comprising honeycomb layers bridged by dumbbells, are metallic rather than semiconducting. Anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg analysis reveals that the intrinsically hole-doped AgBC possesses a unique combination of electronic and vibrational features to exhibit two-gap superconductivity above 50 K.</description>

      <title>A new collective mode in an iron-based superconductor with electronic nematicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elucidation of the symmetry and structure of order parameter(OP) is a fundamental subject in the study of superconductors. Recently, a growing number of superconducting materials have been identified that suggest additional spontaneous symmetry breakings besides the primal breaking of U(1) gauge symmetry, including time-reversal, chiral, and rotational symmetries. Observation of collective modes in those exotic superconductors is particularly important, as they provide the fingerprints of the superconducting OP. Here we investigate the collective modes in an iron-based superconductor, FeSe, a striking example of superconductivity emergent in an electronic nematic phase where the rotational symmetry of electronic degree of freedom is spontaneously broken. By using terahertz nonlinear spectroscopy technique, we discovered a collective mode resonance located substantially below the superconducting gap energy, distinct from the amplitude Higgs mode. Comparison with theoretical calculations demonstrates that the observed mode is attributed to a collective fluctuation between the s+d-wave-like ground state and the subleading pairing channel, which corresponds to the so-called Bardasis-Schrieffer mode but also resembles an intraband Leggett mode. Our result corroborates the multicomponent pairing channels in FeSe activated in the lower space group symmetry in the electronic nematic phase.</description>

      <title>The Anisotropy of Thermal Activation Energy of 2H-NbS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the anisotropic flux dynamics in 2H-NbS$_2$ single crystals through temperature-dependent resistance measurements under in-plane ($H \parallel ab$ plane) and out-of-plane ($H \perp ab$ plane) magnetic fields. Analysis of thermally activated flux flow (TAFF) resistance in the superconducting mixed state reveals stark contrasts in thermal activation energy ($U_0$) scaling and field dependence. For $H \perp ab$, $U_0(0.1 \mathrm{T}) = (1228.76 \pm 53.64)$ K follows the Arrhenius relation with a power-law field decay ($U_0\propto H^{-\alpha}$). In contrast, under $H \parallel ab$, $U_0(0.5 \mathrm{T}) = (7205.58 \pm 619.65)$ K aligns with the modified TAFF theory, where the scaling exponent $q = 2$ potentially reflects two-dimensional vortex behavior in the TAFF region, and the field dependence of $U_0$ follows parabolic relation $H^{\gamma}\left[1 - \frac{H}{H^{*}}\right]^2$. These results establish 2H-NbS$_2$ as a model system for probing the anisotropy of flux dynamics in layered superconductors.</description>

      <title>Superconducting order parameter manifested in quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent discovery of the superconducting ground state in Quasicrystals (QCs) has opened up an exciting new avenue for superconductivity based on QCs. However, theoretical studies to date have largely focused on a limited subset of quasiperiodic structures. In this work, we broaden the scope by theoretically investigating the behavior of the superconducting order parameter (OP) across a wide class of aperiodic systems, including both generalized Fibonacci and non-Fibonacci QCs based on the attractive Hubbard model. We begin with a one-dimensional toy model, and for the generality of our findings, we extend our analysis to two-dimensional QCs. Remarkably, despite the increased dimensionality, the qualitative features of the OP remain largely preserved. By systematically analyzing models generated through various growth rules, we elucidate the influence of quasiperiodicity on the OP amplitudes. We study the evolution of the OP with respect to the temperature, strength of the interaction, and nearest-neighbor hopping amplitude. Our numerical analysis identifies the most favorable QC structure and parameter regime that supports enhanced onsite pairing amplitudes. Additionally, we provide a comparative analysis of the superconducting transition temperatures across the range of quasiperiodic configurations. To gain further insight into these systems, we compute key thermodynamic quantities: the entropy and electronic specific heat, and examine their dependence on the underlying structural sequences. This analysis enables us to determine which QC structures are most conducive to Cooper pair formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider quantum mechanics in spacetime with time anisotropy. Such Lifshitz quantum mechanics is characterized by a kinetic term with fractional derivatives. We show that, contrary to popular belief, local conservation of probability is respected when the probability current is properly identified. As an application we consider a Josephson Junction with an anisotropic insulating layer. We show that anisotropy affects the tunneling rate and can greatly enhance the working of Josephson Junction.</description>

      <title>General scaling behavior of superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics of high-$T_c$ superconductors, which has been a major topic in condensed matter physics for more than thirty years, reveals some features of conventional superconductors. We analyze the scaling of the condensation energy $E_{\Delta}$ divided by $\gamma$, $E_{\Delta}/\gamma\simeq N(0)\Delta_1^2/\gamma$, that equally applicable to both conventional and unconventional high-$T_c$ superconductors. Here $N(0)$ is the density of states, $\Delta_1$ is the maximum value of the superconducting gap and $\gamma$ is the Sommerfeld coefficient. Basing on this observation, we analyze experimental facts that reveal the general scaling properties of both high-$T_c$ and ordinary superconductors, and theoretically explain that the Homes' law $\rho_{s0}= (1/2\pi\lambda_D)^2= T_c\sigma(T_c)$ is applicable to the both types of superconductors. Here $\rho_{s0}$ is the superconducting electron density, $\lambda_D$ is the zero-$T$ penetration depth, $\sigma$ is the normal state conductivity, $T$ is temperature and $T_c$ is the temperature of superconduction phase transition. For the first time, we also explain the reason of violation of the Homes' law. Our theoretical results agree well with experimental facts.</description>

      <title>Layer-selective Cooper pairing in an alternately stacked transition metal dichalcogenide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multigap superconductivity emerges when superconducting gaps form on distinct Fermi surfaces. Arising from locally overlapping atomic orbitals, multiple superconducting bands introduce a new internal degree of freedom in the material that, however, escapes external control due to their coexistence in real space in the known multigap superconductors. Here, we show that the layered superconductor 4Hb-TaSSe - composed of alternating trigonal (H) and octahedral (T) polymorph layers - is a multigap superconductor, featuring two weakly coupled superconducting condensates with distinct properties, spatially separated in alternating layers. Using high-resolution quasiparticle tunneling and Andreev reflection spectroscopy in the two polymorph layers, we identify two superconducting gaps that vary in size and internal structure. The intrinsic Cooper pairing in each polymorph is corroborated by the temperatures and magnetic fields at which the gaps open up, which differ in each polymorph layer and show opposing resilience to these parameters. This behavior enables selective external actuation upon the condensates. Our theoretical model based on ab-initio calculations reproduces key features of the observed superconducting gaps in the presence of finite interlayer hybridization and explains the unusually high critical field observed in the T-layer. Our results establish TMD polymorphs as platforms for engineering tunable multigap superconductors, offering new opportunities in layered superconducting device architectures.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Superconductivity and Vortex Dynamics in One-Dimensional TaS2 Nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the synthesis of high-quality 2H-TaS2 nanowires via a controlled two-step conversion process from TaS3 precursors, achieving robust superconductivity with a transition temperature Tc ~ 3.6 K which is significantly higher than bulk 2H-TaS2 (Tc ~ 0.8 K). Structural and compositional analyses confirm phase purity and preserved 1D morphology, while magnetotransport measurements reveal an enhanced upper critical field {\mu}oHc2 (2 K) ~ 5 T, far exceeding the bulk value ({\mu}oHc2 (0) ~ 1.17 T), attributed to dimensional confinement and suppression of charge density wave order. Magnetic characterization demonstrates complex vortex dynamics, including flux jumps and a second magnetization peak, indicative of strong pinning and crossover from elastic to plastic vortex regimes. These findings establish TaS2 nanowires as a versatile platform for studying superconductivity in reduced dimensions and exploiting confinement-driven quantum phenomena for advanced applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study linear scaling relations in electron-phonon superconductors. By combining numerical and analytical techniques, we find linear Homes scaling relations between the zero-temperature superfluid density and the normal-state dc conductivity. This phenomenon arises via either a large impurity scattering rate or inelastic scattering of electrons and Einstein phonons at large electron-phonon coupling. Thus, our Letter shows that Homes scaling is more universal than either cuprate or BCS-like physics and is, instead, a fundamental result in a wide class of superconductors.</description>

      <title>Impurity states in altermagnetic superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01008v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnetic superconductors offer the possibility of exploring unconventional superconductivity, including topological states and finite-momentum superconductivity, with promising applications in spintronics and quantum information. However, a direct experimental confirmation of their existence remains elusive. In this work, we propose non-magnetic impurities as probes of the interplay between altermagnetism and superconductivity. These impurities induce spin-polarized subgap states whose spatial extension reflects the magnetic order of the substrate material. Depending on whether or not the impurity respects the bulk symmetries, these states form spin-degenerate or spin-split doublets. An external magnetic field aligned with the N\'eel vector can further control the doublet splitting. We further demonstrate that coupling between impurity states leads to a position-dependent, spin-sensitive hybridization, enabling another approach for \textit{in situ} control of atomic-size quantum devices. These findings provide unambiguous experimental signatures of altermagnetic superconductivity accessible via local measurements such as scanning tunneling microscopy and open unexplored pathways for designing tunable quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In equilibrium, confined films of superfluid $^3$He-A have the chiral axis, $\hat{\ell}$, locked normal to the surface of the film. There are two degenerate ground states $\hat{\ell}\;||\pm\hat{z}$. However, for a temperature quench, i.e. cool down through the phase transition at a finite rate, causally disconnected regions of order parameter fluctuations develop and evolve into an inhomogeneous ordered phase that hosts both domain walls between time-reversed chiral phases as well as vortices with winding numbers $p\in\mathbb{Z}$. We present simulations based on a time-dependent generalization of Ginzburg-Landau theory for strong-coupling $^3$He that reveal both types of topological defects to be present following the temperature quench. Results for the dynamics of vortices interacting with anti-vortices as well as domain walls are presented. The vortex number density as a function of quench rate agrees well with the scaling predicted by Kibble and Zurek. We also present results for the number distribution and compare with other theoretical models for full counting statistics of the topological defect density. Finally, we present results for an asymmetry in the post-freeze-out populations of inequivalent vortex core structures that are characteristic of a chiral superfluid.</description>

Abstract: We consider a coupling element based on a symmetric superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) and show that it mediates a two-photon interaction. This and other inductive interactions due to the SQUID can be switched off in situ. We derive the system Hamiltonian for coupled resonator and rf SQUID. The rf SQUID dwells in the vicinity of its metastable well holding a number of energy states and acts as an artificial atom. We discuss how the Josephson symmetry breaks owing to magnetic fields in the superconducting loops. We assess that the two-photon coupling strength reaches 18 MHz which can exceed the single-photon capacitive interaction in the coupler.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent observation of ambient-pressure superconductivity with $T_c \sim 40$ K in La3Ni2O7 on SrLaAlO4(001) (SLAO), we explore the structural and electronic properties as well as the spin-spin correlation function of this bilayer nickelate system by using density functional theory including a Coulomb repulsion term. We find that the compressive strain exerted by this substrate leads to an unconventional occupation of the antibonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states around the $\Gamma$ point, distinct from the superconducting bulk compound under pressure. While pure strain effects rather modestly enhance the dynamical spin susceptibility, investigation of a reconstructed interface composition as observed in transmission electron microscopy uncovers a strong amplification of the spin fluctuations due to Fermi surface nesting of the antibonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states near the interface. These results provide insights into the emergence of superconductivity in strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, suggest a possible key role of the interface, and highlight fundamental differences from the hydrostatic pressure scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a high-throughput computational search for novel phonon-mediated superconductors, starting from the Materials Cloud 3-dimensional structure database of experimentally known inorganic stoichiometric compounds. We first compute the Allen-Dynes critical temperature (T$_c$) for 4533 non-magnetic metals using a direct and progressively finer sampling of the electron-phonon couplings. For the candidates with the largest T$_c$, we use automated Wannierizations and electron-phonon interpolations to obtain a high-quality dataset for the most promising 250 dynamically stable structures, for which we calculate spectral functions, superconducting bandgaps, and isotropic Migdal-Eliashberg critical temperatures. For 140 of these, we also provide anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg superconducting gaps and critical temperatures. The approach is remarkably successful in finding known superconductors, and we find 24 unknown ones with a predicted anisotropic T$_{\rm c}$ above 10~K. Among them, we identify a possible double gap superconductor (p-doped BaB$_2$), a non-magnetic half-Heusler ZrRuSb, and the perovskite TaRu$_3$C, all exhibiting significant T$_{\rm c}$. Finally, we introduce a sensitivity analysis to estimate the robustness of the predictions.</description>

      <title>Four-terminal Josephson junctions: diode effects, anomalous currents and transverse currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19376v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a multi-terminal Josephson junction consisting of a central spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) region with an in-plane Zeeman field connected to four superconducting terminals. This setup allows for the simultaneous measurement of both longitudinal and transverse Josephson currents in response to a phase bias and provides a platform to probe the planar Hall effect in superconducting transport. We find that the system exhibits anomalous Josephson effect (AJE) and Josephson diode effect (JDE) when the symmetry between opposite momentum modes is broken in SOC region. Specifically, breaking the symmetry between $k_x$ and $-k_x$ results in JDE and AJE in the longitudinal Josephson current, while breaking the symmetry between $k_y$ and $-k_y$ leads to a finite transverse Josephson current that also exhibits JDE and AJE. Transverse Josephson diode effect coefficient attains values as large as $500\%$ for realistic set of parameters. Furthermore, for specific parameter choices, the current-phase relation in the transverse direction supports unidirectional transport, highlighting its potential for superconducting circuit applications. Our setup offers a new route to engineering nonreciprocal superconducting transport.</description>

      <title>Upper limit for superconducting transition temperature in electron-phonon superconductors: very strong coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19326v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a brief review of some recent work on the problem of highest achievable temperature of superconducting transition $T_c$ in electron-phonon systems. The discovery of record-breaking values of $T_c$ in quite a number of hydrides under high pressure was an impressive demonstration of capabilities of electron-phonon mechanism of Cooper pairing. This lead to an increased interest on possible limitations of Eliashberg-McMillan theory as the main theory of superconductivity in a system of electrons and phonons. We shall consider some basic conclusions following from this theory and present some remarks on the limit of very strong electron-phonon coupling. We shall discuss possible limitations on the value of the coupling constant related to possible lattice and specific heat instability and conclude that within the stable metallic phase the effective pairing constant may acquire very large values. We discuss some bounds for $T_c$ derived in the strong coupling limit and propose an elementary estimate of an upper limit for $T_c$, expressed via combination of fundamental physical constants. Finally we also briefly discuss some pessimistic estimates for $T_c$ of metallic hydrogen obtained in ``jellium'' model.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of superconductivity outside Abrikosov vortex core in a tightly bound Cooper pair superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abrikosov vortices play a central role in the disruption of superconductivity in type-II superconductors. It is commonly accepted that as one moves away from the vortex's axis of an $s$-wave superconductor, the density of superconductive electrons gradually increases from zero to its bulk value. However, we demonstrate that this behavior is qualitatively altered in the zero-temperature limit provided that the Cooper pairs comprising the superconductive liquid are sufficiently tightly bound. Specifically, outside the vortex core, the density of superconductive electrons reaches a maximum surpassing its bulk value. This phenomenon has electrostatic origins: since normal electrons are absent and there exists a charged ionic background, the spatial variation of the charge density of superconductive electrons violates local neutrality, leading to the generation of an electric field. This electric field shrinks the vortex core and turns the density profile into that with a maximum, ensuring global neutrality. The effect is most pronounced in the limit of strong electrostatic screening, where the field configurations describing the vortex attain a universal form, with the electric field screened over a length scale determined by the London penetration depth.</description>

      <title>Reviving the Search for Indium-Based Superconductors: First-Principles Prediction of Semimetallic Superconductivity in Cubic Nd$_3$In</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11123v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quest for materials that simultaneously exhibit superconductivity and non trivial topology has drawn significant attention in recent years, driven by their potential to host exotic quantum states. Their unique coexistence often leads to rich physics and potential applications in quantum technologies. Here, we predict cubic Nd$_3$In as an exceptional candidate in this class, combining strong-coupling superconductivity with distinctive topological features. Using first-principles calculations, we find that the strong-coupling superconductivity in Nd$_3$In arises primarily due to pronounced Fermi surface nesting, leading to an electron-phonon coupling constant of $\lambda = 1.39$. Our fully anisotropic Migdal--Eliashberg analysis predicts a superconducting transition temperature $T_c \approx 14$ K at ambient pressure, which is the highest value reported so far among cubic semimetallic superconductors. When subjected to a pressure of 15 GPa, $T_c$ increases further to 18 K. Beyond superconductivity, Nd$_3$In is found to be a Weyl semimetal, as evidenced by the presence of Fermi arcs and nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants, confirming its topological nature. The combination of strong-coupling superconductivity and nontrivial topological states makes Nd$_3$In a promising candidate for quantum transport and topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Roadmap to fault tolerant quantum computation using topological qubit arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12252v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a concrete device roadmap towards a fault-tolerant quantum computing architecture based on noise-resilient, topologically protected Majorana-based qubits. Our roadmap encompasses four generations of devices: a single-qubit device that enables a measurement-based qubit benchmarking protocol; a two-qubit device that uses measurement-based braiding to perform single-qubit Clifford operations; an eight-qubit device that can be used to show an improvement of a two-qubit operation when performed on logical qubits rather than directly on physical qubits; and a topological qubit array supporting lattice surgery demonstrations on two logical qubits. Devices that enable this path require a superconductor-semiconductor heterostructure that supports a topological phase, quantum dots and coupling between those quantum dots that can create the appropriate loops for interferometric measurements, and a microwave readout system that can perform fast, low-error single-shot measurements. We describe the key design components of these qubit devices, along with the associated protocols for demonstrations of single-qubit benchmarking, Clifford gate execution, quantum error detection, and quantum error correction, which differ greatly from those in more conventional qubits. Finally, we comment on implications and advantages of this architecture for utility-scale quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Intertwined Density Waves in La$_4$Ni$_{3-x}$Cu$_x$O$_{10+\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity in La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ has been reported to emerge upon suppression of intertwined spin and charge density wave (SDW/CDW) order, suggesting a possible connection to the pairing mechanism. Here we report a systematic investigation of La$_{4}$Ni$_{3-x}$Cu$_{x}$O$_{10+\delta}$ ($0 \leq x \leq 0.7$), focusing on the evolution of the SDW/CDW order as a function of chemical substitution. Temperature-dependent resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and Hall effect measurements reveal a linear suppression of density wave transition temperature $T{\text{dw}}$ and a concurrent enhancement of hole concentration with increasing Cu content. At higher substitution levels ($x &gt; 0.15$), the transition-induced anomaly in the resistivity becomes undetectable while a magnetic signature persists, indicating a partial decoupling of spin and charge components and the possible survival of short-range spin correlations. The absence of superconductivity across the substitution series highlights the importance of additional factors in stabilizing the superconducting state in pressurized La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$.</description>
