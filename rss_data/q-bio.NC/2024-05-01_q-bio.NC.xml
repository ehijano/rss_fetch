      <title>Reliability and predictability of phenotype information from functional connectivity in large imaging datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the central objectives of contemporary neuroimaging research is to create predictive models that can disentangle the connection between patterns of functional connectivity across the entire brain and various behavioral traits. Previous studies have shown that models trained to predict behavioral features from the individual's functional connectivity have modest to poor performance. In this study, we trained models that predict observable individual traits (phenotypes) and their corresponding singular value decomposition (SVD) representations - herein referred to as latent phenotypes from resting state functional connectivity. For this task, we predicted phenotypes in two large neuroimaging datasets: the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). We illustrate the importance of regressing out confounds, which could significantly influence phenotype prediction. Our findings reveal that both phenotypes and their corresponding latent phenotypes yield similar predictive performance. Interestingly, only the first five latent phenotypes were reliably identified, and using just these reliable phenotypes for predicting phenotypes yielded a similar performance to using all latent phenotypes. This suggests that the predictable information is present in the first latent phenotypes, allowing the remainder to be filtered out without any harm in performance. This study sheds light on the intricate relationship between functional connectivity and the predictability and reliability of phenotypic information, with potential implications for enhancing predictive modeling in the realm of neuroimaging research.</description>

      <title>Discovering robust biomarkers of neurological disorders from functional MRI using graph neural networks: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNN) have emerged as a popular tool for modelling functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets. Many recent studies have reported significant improvements in disorder classification performance via more sophisticated GNN designs and highlighted salient features that could be potential biomarkers of the disorder. In this review, we provide an overview of how GNN and model explainability techniques have been applied on fMRI datasets for disorder prediction tasks, with a particular emphasis on the robustness of biomarkers produced for neurodegenerative diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders. We found that while most studies have performant models, salient features highlighted in these studies vary greatly across studies on the same disorder and little has been done to evaluate their robustness. To address these issues, we suggest establishing new standards that are based on objective evaluation metrics to determine the robustness of these potential biomarkers. We further highlight gaps in the existing literature and put together a prediction-attribution-evaluation framework that could set the foundations for future research on improving the robustness of potential biomarkers discovered via GNNs.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model of the visual MacKay effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07338v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the intricate connection between visual perception and the mathematical modelling of neural activity in the primary visual cortex (V1). The focus is on modelling the visual MacKay effect [Mackay, Nature 1957]. While bifurcation theory has been a prominent mathematical approach for addressing issues in neuroscience, especially in describing spontaneous pattern formations in V1 due to parameter changes, it faces challenges in scenarios with localized sensory inputs. This is evident, for instance, in Mackay's psychophysical experiments, where the redundancy of visual stimuli information results in irregular shapes, making bifurcation theory and multi-scale analysis less effective. To address this, we follow a mathematical viewpoint based on the input-output controllability of an Amari-type neural fields model. In this framework, we consider sensory input as a control function, a cortical representation via the retino-cortical map of the visual stimulus that captures its distinct features. This includes highly localized information in the center of MacKay's funnel pattern "MacKay rays". From a control theory point of view, the Amari-type equation's exact controllability property is discussed for linear and nonlinear response functions. For the visual MacKay effect modelling, we adjust the parameter representing intra-neuron connectivity to ensure that cortical activity exponentially stabilizes to the stationary state in the absence of sensory input. Then, we perform quantitative and qualitative studies to demonstrate that they capture all the essential features of the induced after-image reported by MacKay.</description>
