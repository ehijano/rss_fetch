      <title>Maps preserving the truncation of triple products on Cartan factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\{C_i\}_{i\in \Gamma_1},$ and $\{D_j\}_{j\in \Gamma_2},$ be two families of Cartan factors such that all of them have dimension at least $2$, and consider the atomic JBW$^*$-triples $A=\bigoplus\limits_{i\in \Gamma_1}^{\ell_{\infty}} C_i$ and $B=\bigoplus\limits_{j\in \Gamma_2}^{\ell_{\infty}} D_j$. Let $\Delta :A \to B$ be a {\rm(}non-necessarily linear nor continuous{\rm)} bijection preserving the truncation of triple products in both directions, that is, $$\begin{aligned}
  \boxed{a \mbox{ is a truncation of } \{b,c,b\}} \Leftrightarrow \boxed{\Delta(a) \mbox{ is a truncation of } \{\Delta(b),\Delta(c),\Delta(b)\}}
  \end{aligned}$$ Assume additionally that the restriction of $\Delta$ to each rank-one Cartan factor in $A$, if any, is a continuous mapping. Then we show that $\Delta$ is an isometric real linear triple isomorphism. We also study some general properties of bijections preserving the truncation of triple products in both directions between general JB$^*$-triples.</description>

      <title>Contractive representations of odometer semigroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a natural number $n \geq 1$, the odometer semigroup $O_n$, also known as the adding machine or the Baumslag-Solitar monoid with two generators, is a well-known object of study in group theory. This is also a central object of study for various algebraic-analytic structures. This paper examines the odometer semigroup in relation to representations of bounded linear operators. We focus on noncommutative operators and prove that contractive representations of $O_n$ always admit to nicer isometric representations of $O_n$ on vector-valued Fock spaces. We give a complete description of representations of $O_n$ on the Fock space and relate it to the dilation theory and invariant subspaces of Fock representations of $O_n$. Along the way, we also classify Nica covariant representations of $O_n$.</description>

      <title>Small Banach bundles and modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize those (continuously-normed) Banach bundles $\mathcal{E}\to X$ with compact Hausdorff base whose spaces $\Gamma(\mathcal{E})$ of global continuous sections are topologically finitely-generated over the function algebra $C(X)$, answering a question of I. Gogi\'c's and extending analogous work for metrizable $X$. Conditions equivalent to topological finite generation include: (a) the requirement that $\mathcal{E}$ be locally trivial and of finite type along locally closed and relatively $F_{\sigma}$ strata in a finite stratification of $X$; (b) the decomposability of arbitrary elements in $\ell^p(\Gamma(\mathcal{E}))$, $1\le p&lt;\infty$ as sums of $\le N$ products in $\ell^p(C(X))\cdot \Gamma(\mathcal{E})$ for some fixed $N$; (c) the analogous decomposability requirement for maximal Banach-module tensor products $F\widehat{\otimes}_{C(X)}\Gamma(\mathcal{E})$ or (d) equivalently, only for $F=\ell^1(C(X))$.</description>

      <title>Rigidity results for $L^p$-operator algebras and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03612</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.03612v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $p\in [1,\infty)$, we show that every unital $L^p$-operator algebra contains a unique maximal $C^*$-subalgebra, which is always abelian if $p\neq 2$. Using this, we canonically associate to every unital $L^p$-operator algebra $A$ an \'etale groupoid $\mathcal{G}_A$, which in many cases of interest is a complete invariant for $A$. By identifying this groupoid for large classes of examples, we obtain a number of rigidity results that display a stark contrast with the case $p=2$; the most striking one being that of crossed products by topologically free actions.
  Our rigidity results give answers to questions concerning the existence of isomorphisms between different algebras. Among others, we show that for the $L^p$-analog $\mathcal{O}_2^p$ of the Cuntz algebra, there is no isometric isomorphism between $\mathcal{O}_2^p$ and $\mathcal{O}_2^p\otimes^p\mathcal{O}_2^p$, when $p\neq 2$. In particular, we deduce that there is no $L^p$-version of Kirchberg's absorption theorem, and that there is no $K$-theoretic classification of purely infinite simple amenable $L^p$-operator algebras for $p\neq 2$. Our methods also allow us to recover a folklore fact in the case of C*-algebras ($p=2$), namely that no isomorphism $\mathcal{O}_2^p\cong \mathcal{O}_2^p\otimes\mathcal{O}_2^p$ preserves the canonical Cartan subalgebras.</description>

      <title>Peripheral Poisson Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07731v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that the operator space generated by peripheral eigenvectors of a unital completely positive map on a von Neumann algebra has a $C^*$-algebra structure. This extends the notion of non-commutative Poisson boundary by including the point spectrum of the map contained in the unit circle. The main ingredient is dilation theory. This theory provides a simple formula for the new product. The notion has implications to our understanding of quantum dynamics. For instance, it is shown that the peripheral Poisson boundary remains invariant in discrete quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>The CCAP for graph products of operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a simple graph $\Gamma$ and for unital $C^*$-algebras with GNS-faithful states $(\mathbf{A}_v,\varphi_v)$ for $v\in V\Gamma$, we consider the reduced graph product $(\mathcal{A},\varphi)=*_{v,\Gamma}(\mathbf{A}_{v},\varphi_v)$ , and show that if every $C^*$-algebra $\mathbf{A}_{v}$ has the completely contractive approximation property (CCAP) and satisfies some additional condition, then the graph product has the CCAP as well. The additional condition imposed is satisfied in natural cases, for example for the reduced group $C^*$-algebra of a discrete group $G$ that possesses the CCAP.
  Our result is an extension of the result of Ricard and Xu in [Proposition 4.11, 25] where they prove this result under the same conditions for free products. Moreover, our result also extends the result of Reckwerdt in [Theorem 5.5, 24], where he proved for groups that weak amenability with Cowling-Haagerup constant $1$ is preserved under graph products. Our result further covers many new cases coming from Hecke-algebras and discrete quantum groups.</description>

      <title>Inner conjugate pair of Hadamard subfactors and vertex model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01664v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that any two Hadamard subfactors arising from a pair of distinct complex Hadamard matrices of order 3 are either equal or inner conjugate via a unitary in the relative commutant of their intersection. Moreover, when the Hadamard subfactors are not equal, we prove the factoriality of their intersection, and quite interestingly, it turns out to be a vertex model subfactor. We compute the first relative commutant and characterize this subfactor by identifying it with a particular type of Krishnan-Sunder subfactor. A few key invariants, including the Pimsner-Popa probabilistic number, the angle, and the Connes- St{\o}rmer relative entropy for the pair of Hadamard subfactors are computed to understand their relative position.</description>

      <title>A rigidity framework for Roe-like algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13624v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a complete solution to the problem of C*-rigidity for (extended) locally compact metric spaces. Namely, we show that (stable) isomorphisms among Roe algebras always give rise to coarse equivalences. To do so, we develop a framework to study rigidity problems for Roe-like C*-algebras of countably generated coarse spaces. This allows us to provide a unified proof of C*-rigidity for Roe algebras, algebras of operators of controlled propagation, and algebras of quasi-local operators. As further applications, we prove that the outer automorphism groups of all of these algebras are isomorphic to the group of coarse equivalences of the starting coarse space.</description>
