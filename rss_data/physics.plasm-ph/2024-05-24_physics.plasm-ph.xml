      <title>A generative machine learning surrogate model of plasma turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art techniques in generative artificial intelligence are employed for the first time to construct a surrogate model for plasma turbulence that enables long time transport simulations. The proposed GAIT (Generative Artificial Intelligence Turbulence) model is based on the coupling of a convolutional variational auto-encoder, that encodes precomputed turbulence data into a reduce latent space, and a deep neural network and decoder that generate new turbulence states 400 times faster than the direct numerical integration. The model is applied to the Hasegawa-Wakatani (HW) plasma turbulence model, that is closely related to the quasigeostrophic model used in geophysical fluid dynamics. Very good agreement is found between the GAIT and the HW models in the spatio-temporal Fourier and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition spectra as well as in the flow topology characterized by the Okubo-Weiss decomposition. Agreement is also found in the probability distribution function of particle displacements and the effective turbulent diffusivity.</description>

      <title>Assessing Proton-Boron Fusion Feasibility under non-Thermal Equilibrium Conditions: Rider's Inhibition Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared to the D-T reaction, the neutron-free proton-boron (p-$^{11}$B) fusion has garnered increasing attention in recent years. However, significant Bremsstrahlung losses pose a formidable challenge in p-$^{11}$B plasmas in achieving $Q&gt;1$ in thermal equilibrium. The primary aim of this study is to corroborate Todd H. Rider's seminal work in the 1997 Physics of Plasmas, who investigated the feasibility of sustaining p-$^{11}$B fusion under non-thermal equilibrium conditions. Employing a series of simulations with new fusion cross-section, we assessed the minimum recirculating power that must be recycled to maintain the system's non-thermal equilibrium and found that it is substantially greater than the fusion power output, aligning with Rider's conclusions, whether under the conditions of non-Maxwellian electron distribution or Maxwellian electron distribution, reactors reliant on non-equilibrium plasmas for p-$^{11}$B fusion are unlikely to achieve net power production without the aid of highly efficient external heat engines. However, maintaining the ion temperature at 300 keV and the Coulomb logarithm at 15, while increasing the electron temperature beyond 23.33 keV set by Rider, leads to diminished electron-ion energy transfer and heightened Bremsstrahlung radiation. When the electron temperature approaches approximately 140 keV, this progression ultimately leads to a scenario where the power of Bremsstrahlung loss equals the power of electron-ion interactions, yet remains inferior to the fusion power. Consequently, this results in a net gain in energy production.</description>

      <title>Turbulent Thermal Equilibration of Collisionless Magnetospheric Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How thermal equilibrium is determined in a weakly collisional plasma is a fundamental question in plasma physics. This letter shows that the turbulence driven by the magnetic curvature and density gradient tends to equilibrate the temperature between species without collisions in a magnetospheric plasma. The classical stability analysis in terms of energetic consideration reveals the interchangeable roles of electrons and ions for destabilization depending on their temperatures. Nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations confirm that the higher-temperature destabilizing species gives free energy to heat the other species to achieve the equal temperature state.</description>

      <title>Extension of the SpK Atomic Physics Code to Generate Global Equation of State Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global microphysics models are required for the modelling of high-energy-density physics (HEDP) experiments, the improvement of which are critical to the path to inertial fusion energy. This work presents further developments to the atomic and microphysics code, SpK, part of the numerical modelling suite of Imperial College London and First Light Fusion. We extend the capabilities of SpK to allow the calculation of the equation of state (EoS). The detailed configuration accounting calculations are interpolated into finite-temperature Thomas-Fermi calculations at high coupling to form the electronic component of the model. The Cowan model provides the ionic contribution, modified to approximate the physics of diatomic molecular dissociation. By utilising bonding corrections and performing a Maxwell construction, SpK captures the EoS from states ranging from the zero-pressure solid, through the liquid-vapour coexistence region and into plasma states. This global approach offers the benefit of capturing electronic shell structure over large regions of parameter space, building highly-resolved tables in minutes on a simple desktop. We present shock Hugoniot and off-Hugoniot calculations for a number of materials, comparing SpK to other models and experimental data. We also apply EoS and opacity data generated by SpK in integrated simulations of indirectly-driven capsule implosions, highlighting physical sensitivities to the choice of EoS models.</description>

      <title>Laboratory-scale Perpendicular Collisionless Shock Generation and Ion Acceleration in Magnetized Head-on Colliding Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetized collisionless shocks drive particle acceleration broadly in space and astrophysics. We perform the first large-scale particle-in-cell simulations with realistic laboratory parameters (density, temperature, and velocity) to investigate the magnetized shock in head-on colliding plasmas with an applied magnetic field of tens of Tesla. It is shown that a perpendicular collisionless shock is formed with about fourfold density jump when two pre-magnetized flows collide. This shock is also characterized by rapid increase of neutron yield, triggered by the beam-beam nuclear reactions between injected deuterons and ones reflected by the shock. Distinct from the shocks arising from the interaction of injected flows with a magnetized background, the self-generated magnetic field in this colliding plasmas experiences a significant amplification due to the increasing diamagnetic current, approximately 30 times of upstream magnetic field. Moreover, we find that ions, regardless of whether they pass through or are reflected by the shock, can gain energy by the shock surfing acceleration, generating a power-law energy spectrum. In addition, we also demonstrate that the shock mediated only by filamentation instability cannot be generated under the prevailing unmagnetized experimental parameters. These results provide a direct connection of astrophysical field amplification to the magnetized shock formation and nonthermal ion generation.</description>

      <title>Generation of mega-gauss axial and azimuthal magnetic fields in a solid plasma by ultrahigh intensity, circularly polarised femtosecond laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of intense linearly polarized femtosecond laser pulses with solids is known to generate azimuthal magnetic fields, while circularly polarized light has been shown to create axial fields. We demonstrate through experiments and particle-in-cell simulations that circularly polarized light can generate both axial and azimuthal fields of comparable magnitude in a plasma created in a solid. Angular distributions of the generated fast electrons at target front and rear show significant differences between the results for the two polarization states, with circular polarization enforcing more axial confinement. The measurement of the spatial distribution of both types of magnetic fields captures their turbulent evolution.</description>

      <title>Experimental investigation of an electronegative cylindrical capacitively coupled geometrically asymmetric plasma discharge with an axisymmetric magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we have investigated the production of negative ions by mixing electronegative oxygen gas with electropositive argon gas in a geometrically asymmetric cylindrical capacitively coupled radio frequency plasma discharge. The plasma parameters such as density (electron, positive and negative ion), negative ion fraction, and electron temperature are investigated for fixed gas pressure and increasing axial magnetic field strength. The axisymmetric magnetic field creates an ExB drift in the azimuthal direction, leading to the confinement of high-energy electrons at the radial edge of the chamber, resulting in decreased species density and negative ion fraction in the plasma bulk. However, the electron temperature increases with the magnetic field. It is concluded that low magnetic fields are better suited for negative ion production in such devices. Furthermore, in addition to the percentage ratio of the two gases, the applied axial magnetic field also plays a vital role in controlling negative ion fraction.</description>

      <title>Experimental observations of bifurcated power decay lengths in the near Scrape-Off Layer of tokamak plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scrape-off layer parallel heat flux decay lengths measured at ST40, a high field, low aspect ratio spherical tokamak, have been observed to bifurcate into two groups. The wide group matches closely with the scale of ion poloidal Larmour radius and follows existing H-mode scalings, while the narrow group falls up to 10 times below scalings, on the scale of ion total Larmour radius. The onset of the narrow scrape-off layer width is observed to be associated with suppressed magnetic fluctuations, suggesting reduced electromagnetic turbulence levels in the SOL.</description>

      <title>Effect of magnetic field configuration on double layer formation and reverse discharge ignition in bipolar HiPIMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reverse discharge (RD) phenomenon in bipolar HiPIMS has been observed when a sufficiently long positive pulse is applied to the magnetron. Due to the magnetic field, electrons accumulated behind the magnetic trap are prevented from reaching the positive target. Consequently, a space charge double layer (DL) is formed between the positive target and the plasma behind the magnetic trap, leading to electron acceleration across the DL and RD ignition. This study reveals the significant impact of the magnetic field configuration on RD ignition. Experiments are performed using a Ti target involving magnetic field variation, wire probe measurements of floating potential, and optical emission spectroscopy imaging. It is found that adjusting the magnetic field to a more balanced configuration leads to earlier RD ignition, while a more unbalanced one delays or even prevents it. Specifically, the time of RD ignition decreases with an increase in the magnetic null point distance from the target. Moreover, the size and shape of optical emission in the RD varies with nearby probe placement, suggesting sensitivity to external electrodes.</description>

      <title>Phase Separations of Strongly Coupled Fine Particles and Fine Particle Mixtures in Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase separations in strongly coupled fine particles in plasmas are discussed and two-component mixtures are simulated by molecular dynamics with the background plasma being treated as continuum. The system size of laboratory experiments is assumed and separations into phases with a common electron density of the background plasma are analyzed. Since the charge on fine particles increases approximately in proportion to the size, we expect the larger component with stronger coupling condensates from the mixture. Results expressed in terms of strengths of Coulomb coupling and screening of the larger component seem to be mostly similar to the one-component case, at least in cases where the ratio of fine particle sizes is 2 and the mixing ratio is in the range from 0.25 to 0.75.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1808.06706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A compact Marx generator was built to mimic a spark-gap Tesla transformer. The generator produced radio-frequency pulses of up to $\pm$200 kV and $\pm$15 A with a frequency between 110 to 280 kHz at a repetition rate of 120 Hz. The generator tolerated larger circuit-parameter perturbations than is expected for conventional Tesla transformers. Possible applications include research on the control and laser guiding of spark discharges.</description>

      <title>Numerical Simulations of 3D Ion Crystal Dynamics in a Penning Trap using the Fast Multipole Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulate the dynamics, including laser cooling, of 3D ion crystals confined in a Penning trap using a newly developed molecular dynamics-like code. The numerical integration of the ions' equations of motion is accelerated using the fast multipole method to calculate the Coulomb interaction between ions, which allows us to efficiently study large ion crystals with thousands of ions. In particular, we show that the simulation time scales linearly with ion number, rather than with the square of the ion number. By treating the ions' absorption of photons as a Poisson process, we simulate individual photon scattering events to study laser cooling of 3D ellipsoidal ion crystals. Initial simulations suggest that these crystals can be efficiently cooled to ultracold temperatures, aided by the mixing of the easily cooled axial motional modes with the low frequency planar modes. In our simulations of a spherical crystal of 1,000 ions, the planar kinetic energy is cooled to several millikelvin in a few milliseconds while the axial kinetic energy and total potential energy are cooled even further. This suggests that 3D ion crystals could be well-suited as platforms for future quantum science experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.12592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay of strong-field QED and collective plasma effects is important for explaining extreme astrophysical environments like magnetars. It has been shown that QED pair plasmas is possible to be produced and observed by passing a relativistic electron beam through an intense laser field. This paper presents in detail multiple sets of 3D QED-PIC simulations to show the creation of pair plasmas in the QED cascade. The beam driven method enables a high pair particle density and also a low particle gamma factor, which both play equal rolls on exhibiting large collective plasma effects. Finite laser frequency upshift is observed with both ideal parameters (24 PW laser laser colliding with 300 GeV electron beam) and with existing technologies (3 PW laser laser colliding with 30 GeV electron beam).</description>

      <title>Influence of ion-to-electron temperature ratio on tearing instability and resulting subion-scale turbulence in a low-$\beta_e$ collisionless plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A two-field gyrofluid model including ion finite Larmor radius (FLR) corrections, magnetic fluctuations along the ambient field and electron inertia is used to study two-dimensional reconnection in a low $\beta_e$ collisionless plasma, in a plane perpendicular to the ambient field. Both moderate and large values of the ion-to-electron temperature ratio $\tau$ are considered. The linear growth rate of the tearing instability is computed for various values of $\tau$, confirming the convergence to reduced electron magnetodynamics (REMHD) predictions in the large $\tau$ limit. Comparisons with analytical estimates in several limit cases are also presented. The nonlinear dynamics leads to a fully-developed turbulent regime that appears to be sensitive to the value of the parameter $\tau$. For $\tau = 100$, strong large-scale velocity shears trigger Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, leading to the propagation of the turbulence through the separatrices, together with the formation of eddies of size of the order of the electron skin depth. In the $\tau = 1$ regime, the vortices are significantly smaller and their accurate description requires that electron FLR effects be taken into account.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of circular polarization in giant pulses and fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some giant pulses and fast radio bursts exhibit notable circular polarization, which remains inexplicable and carries significant implications for their emission mechanisms. In this study, we unveil the presence of multiple nanoshot pairs uniformly spaced by approximately 21 $\mu$s within a giant pulse emitted by the Crab pulsar. Among these pairs, a subset displays left-hand and right-hand circular polarization in two distinct nanoshots. We propose that the occurrence of such nanoshot pairs with dual circular polarizations arises from the fragmentation of a linearly-polarized nanoshot under the extreme Faraday effect, leveraging highly-asymmetrical pair plasma and the ultra-intense field of nanoshots. The asymmetry in pair plasmas is likely linked to discharge activities in pulsars. Moreover, the intense field of nanoshots induces cyclotron resonance within the magnetosphere, effectively slowing down the propagation velocity of the circularly polarized mode. Our findings suggest that giant pulses originate within the inner magnetosphere and lend support to a magnetospheric origin for fast radio bursts.</description>

      <title>Physical insights from the aspect ratio dependence of turbulence in negative triangularity plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the impact of aspect ratio A = R0 /r (the ratio of major radius R0 to minor radius r) on the confinement benefits of Negative Triangularity (NT) plasma shaping. We use high-fidelity flux tube gyrokinetic GENE simulations and consider several different scenarios: four of them inspired by TCV experimental data, a scenario inspired by DIII-D experimental data and a scenario expected in the new SMART spherical tokamak. The present study reveals a surprising and non-trivial dependence. NT improves confinement at any value of A for ITG turbulence, while for TEM turbulence confinement is improved only in the case of large and conventional aspect ratios. Additionally, through a detailed study of a large aspect ratio case with pure ITG drive, we develop an intuitive physical picture that explains the beneficial effect of NT at large and conventional aspect ratios. This picture does not hold in TEM-dominated regimes, where a complex synergistic effect of many factors is found. Finally, we performed the first linear gyrokinetic simulations of SMART, finding that both NT and PT scenarios are dominated by micro-tearing-mode (MTM) turbulence and that NT is more susceptible to MTMs at tight aspect ratio. However, we found that a regime where ITG dominates in SMART can be found, and in this regime NT is more linearly stable.</description>

      <title>Exploring relaxation dynamics in warm dense plasmas by tailoring non-thermal electron distributions with a free electron laser</title>

Abstract: Knowing the characteristic relaxation time of free electrons in a dense plasma is crucial to our understanding of plasma equilibration and transport. However, experimental investigations of electron relaxation dynamics have been hindered by the ultra-fast, sub-femtosecond time scales on which these interactions typically take place. Here we propose a novel approach that uses x-rays from a free electron laser to generate well-defined non-thermal electron distributions, which can then be tracked via emission spectroscopy from radiative recombination as they thermalize. Collisional radiative simulations reveal how this method can enable the measurement of electron relaxation time scales {\it in situ}, shedding light on the applicability and accuracy of the Coulomb Logarithm framework for modelling collisions in dense plasmas.</description>

      <title>Progress in Electron Energy Modeling for Hypersonic Plasma Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel formulation of the electron energy relaxation terms is presented here, which is applicable to high-speed plasma flows and discharges wherein the electron temperature could be higher or lower than the gas temperature. It is demonstrated that the electron energy losses due to inelastic collisions can be expressed as a function of only two species-dependent parameters: the reduced electric field and the reduced electron mobility. This formulation is advantageous over previous ones, being simpler to implement and more accurate when experimental data of the reduced electric field and reduced mobility are available. Curve fits to empirical data of these two properties are outlined here for all important air molecular species. The approach accounts for all inelastic electron energy relaxation processes without needing individual cross-sections or rates, reducing potential errors associated with independently handling each process. Several test cases are presented to validate the proposed electron energy source terms including hypersonic plasma flows for which the electron temperature is less than the gas temperature, as well as discharges in which the electron temperature reaches values in excess of 30 eV. In all cases, the agreement with experimental data is observed to be very good to excellent, significantly surpassing prior electron energy models for high-speed flows.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithm for collisionless Boltzmann simulation of self-gravitating systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The collisionless Boltzmann equation (CBE) is a fundamental equation that governs the dynamics of a broad range of astrophysical systems from space plasma to star clusters and galaxies. It is computationally expensive to integrate the CBE directly in a multi-dimensional phase space, and thus the applications to realistic astrophysical problems have been limited so far. Recently, Todorova &amp; Steijl (2020) proposed an efficient quantum algorithm to solve the CBE with significantly reduced computational complexity. We extend the algorithm to perform quantum simulations of self-gravitating systems, incorporating the method to calculate gravity with the major Fourier modes of the density distribution extracted from the solution-encoding quantum state. Our method improves the dependency of time and space complexities on Nv , the number of grid points in each velocity coordinate, compared to the classical simulation methods. We then conduct some numerical demonstrations of our method. We first run a 1+1 dimensional test calculation of free streaming motion on 64*64 grids using 13 simulated qubits and validate our method. We then perform simulations of Jeans collapse, and compare the result with analytic and linear theory calculations. It will thus allow us to perform large-scale CBE simulations on future quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Comparative simulations of Kelvin-Helmholtz induced magnetic reconnection at the Earth's magnetospheric flanks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents three-dimensional (3D) resistive Hall-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) dynamics at Earth's magnetospheric flanks during northward interplanetary magnetic field periods. By comparing two simulations with and without initial magnetic shear, we analyze the impact of distinct magnetic field orientations on plasma dynamics and magnetic reconnection events taking into account 3D mechanisms, such as KHI high latitude stabilization. The identical nature of the simulations, except for the presence/absence of an initial magnetic shear, enables, for the first time, a complete and coherent comparative analysis of the latitudinal distribution of KH vortices, current sheets, reconnection events, and the evolution of the mixing layer. In one configuration, a uniform magnetic field leads to double mid-latitude reconnection (MLR), while in the other, magnetic shear induces both type I vortex-induced reconnection (VIR) and MLR. Notably, the type I VIR observed in this second scenario results from the combined action of line advection and vortex-induced current sheet pinching (the classic mechanism driving two-dimensional type I VIR). Of particular importance is our quantification of newly closed field lines that experienced double reconnection, ultimately becoming embedded in solar wind plasma at low latitudes while remaining connected to magnetospheric plasma at high latitudes. The varying abundance of such lines in the two simulations holds implications for plasma transport at the magnetopause.</description>
