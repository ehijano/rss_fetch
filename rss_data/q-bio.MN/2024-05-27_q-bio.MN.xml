      <title>An Update to the SBML Human-Readable Antimony Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antimony is a high-level, human-readable text-based language designed for defining and sharing models in the systems biology community. It enables scientists to describe biochemical networks and systems using a simple and intuitive syntax. It allows users to easily create, modify, and distribute reproducible computational models. By allowing the concise representation of complex biological processes, Antimony enhances collaborative efforts, improves reproducibility, and accelerates the iterative development of models in systems biology. This paper provides an update to the Antimony language since it was introduced in 2009. In particular, we highlight new annotation features, support for flux balance analysis, a new rateOf method, support for probability distributions and uncertainty, named stochiometries, and algebraic rules. Antimony is also now distributed as a C/C++ library, together with python and Julia bindings, as well as a JavaScript version for use within a web browser.

      <title>Noise robustness and metabolic load determine the principles of central dogma regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The processes of gene expression are inherently stochastic, even for essential genes required for growth. How does the cell maximize fitness in light of noise? To answer this question, we build a mathematical model to explore the trade-off between metabolic load and growth robustness. The model predicts novel principles of central dogma regulation: Optimal protein expression levels for many genes are in vast overabundance. Essential genes are transcribed above a lower limit of one message per cell cycle. Gene expression is achieved by load balancing between transcription and translation. We present evidence that each of these novel regulatory principles is observed. These results reveal that robustness and metabolic load determine the global regulatory principles that govern central dogma function, and these principles have broad implications for cellular function.</description>

      <title>Waves, patterns and bifurcations: a tutorial review on the vertebrate segmentation clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proper vertebrae formation relies on a tissue-wide oscillator called the segmentation clock. Individual cellular oscillators in the presomitic mesoderm are modulated by intercellular coupling and external signals, leading to the propagation of oscillatory waves of genetic expression eventually stabilizing into a static pattern. Here, we review 4 decades of biophysical models of this process, starting from the pioneering Clock and Wavefront model by Cooke and Zeeman, and the reaction-diffusion model by Meinhardt. We discuss how modern descriptions followed advances in molecular description and visualization of the process, reviewing phase models, delayed models, systems-level, and finally geometric models. We connect models to high-level aspects of embryonic development from embryonic scaling to wave propagation, up to reconstructed stem cell systems. We provide new analytical calculations and insights into classical and recent models, leading us to propose a geometric description of somitogenesis organized along two primary waves of differentiation.</description>
