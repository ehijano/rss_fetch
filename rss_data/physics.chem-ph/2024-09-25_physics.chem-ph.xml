      <title>AI and Machine Learning Approaches for Predicting Nanoparticles Toxicity The Critical Role of Physiochemical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research investigates the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to predict the toxicity of nanoparticles, a pressing concern due to their pervasive use in various industries and the inherent challenges in assessing their biological interactions. Employing models such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost, the study focuses on analyzing physicochemical properties like size, shape, surface charge, and chemical composition to determine their influence on toxicity. Our findings highlight the significant role of oxygen atoms, particle size, surface area, dosage, and exposure duration in affecting toxicity levels. The use of machine learning allows for a nuanced understanding of the intricate patterns these properties form in biological contexts, surpassing traditional analysis methods in efficiency and predictive power. These advancements aid in developing safer nanomaterials through computational chemistry, reducing reliance on costly and time-consuming experimental methods. This approach not only enhances our understanding of nanoparticle behavior in biological systems but also streamlines the safety assessment process, marking a significant stride towards integrating computational techniques in nanotoxicology.</description>

      <title>An Informatics Framework for the Design of Sustainable, Chemically Recyclable, Synthetically-Accessible and Durable Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to design durable and chemically recyclable ring-opening polymerization (ROP) class polymers. This approach employs digital reactions using virtual forward synthesis (VFS) to generate over 7 million ROP polymers and machine learning techniques to rapidly predict thermal, thermodynamic and mechanical properties crucial for application-specific performance and recyclability. This combined methodology enables the generation and evaluation of millions of hypothetical ROP polymers from known and commercially available molecules, guiding the selection of approximately 35,000 candidates with optimal features for sustainability and practical utility. Three of these recommended candidates have passed validation tests in the physical lab - two of the three by others, as published previously elsewhere, and one of them is a new thiocane polymer synthesized, tested and reported here. This paper presents the framework, methodology, and initial findings of our study, highlighting the potential of VFS and machine learning to enable a large-scale search of the polymer universe and advance the development of recyclable and environmentally benign polymers.</description>

      <title>Martignac: Computational workflows for reproducible, traceable, and composable coarse-grained Martini simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their wide use and far-reaching implications, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suffer from a lack of both traceability and reproducibility. We introduce Martignac: computational workflows for the coarse-grained (CG) Martini force field. Martignac describes Martini CG MD simulations as an acyclic directed graph, providing the entire history of a simulation -- from system preparation to property calculations. Martignac connects to NOMAD, such that all simulation data generated are automatically normalized and stored according to the FAIR principles. We present several prototypical Martini workflows, including system generation of simple liquids and bilayers, as well as free-energy calculations for solute solvation in homogeneous liquids and drug permeation in lipid bilayers. By connecting to the NOMAD database to automatically pull existing simulations and push any new simulation generated, Martignac contributes to improving the sustainability and reproducibility of molecular simulations.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of mixtures containing aromatic nitriles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coexistence curves of liquid-liquid equilibrium (LLE) for the mixtures: phenylacetonitrile + heptane, + octane, + nonane, + cyclooctane, or + 2,2,4-trimethylpentane and for 3-phenylpropionitrile + heptane, or + octane are reported. Aromatic nitrile + alkane, + aromatic hydrocarbon or + 1 alkanol systems are investigated using a set of thermophysical properties: phase equilibria (solid-liquid, SLE, vapour-liquid, VLE and LLE), excess molar functions, enthalpies ($H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$), isochoric internal energies, isobaric heat capacities ($C_{p \text{m}}^{\text{E}}$) and volumes ($V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$), and the Kirkwood correlation factor. Due to proximity effects between the phenyl and the CN groups, dipolar interactions between molecules of aromatic nitriles are stronger than those between molecules of isomeric linear nitriles. Dipolar interactions become weaker in the order: 3-phenylpropionitrile &gt; phenylacetonitrile &gt; benzonitrile. Benzonitrile + aromatic hydrocarbon mixtures are characterized by dispersive interactions and structural effects. The latter are more important in systems with phenylacetonitrile. Structural effects are also present in benzonitrile + n-alkane, or + 1-alkanol + mixtures. The systems mentioned above have been studied using DISQUAC. Interaction parameters for contacts where the CN group in aromatic nitriles participates are given and DISQUAC results on excess properties and phase equilibria are discussed. 1-Alkanol + benzonitrile mixtures are also investigated by means of the ERAS model. ERAS represents well $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ of these systems. The $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ curves of solutions with longer 1-alkanols are more poorly described, which has been explained in terms of the existence of structural effects.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of amide+amine mixtures. 4. Relative permittivities of N,N-dimethylacetamide+N-propylpropan-1-amine, +N-butylbutan-1-amine, +butan-1-amine, or +hexan-1-amine and of N,N-dimethylformamide+aniline mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relative permittivities at 1 MHz, $\varepsilon_{\text{r}}$, and at (293.15-303.15) K are reported for the binary systems N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) + N-propylpropan-1-amine (DPA), + N-butylbutan-1-amine (DBA), + butan-1-amine (BA) or + hexan-1-amine (HxA) and for N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) + aniline. The excess permittivities, $\varepsilon_{\text{r}}^{\text{E}}$, are large and negative for systems with DMA, whereas they are large and positive for the aniline mixture. From the analysis of these $\varepsilon_{\text{r}}^{\text{E}}$ data and of measurements previously reported, it is concluded: (i) the main contribution to $\varepsilon_{\text{r}}^{\text{E}}$ in systems with linear amines arises from the breaking of interactions between like molecules; (ii) in the DMF + aniline mixture, interactions between unlike molecules contribute positively to $\varepsilon_{\text{r}}^{\text{E}}$, and such a contribution is dominant; (iii) longer linear amines are better breakers of the amide-amide interactions; (iv) interactions between unlike molecules are more easily formed when shorter linear amines, or DMF, participate. These findings are confirmed by a general study conducted in terms of excess values of molar orientational and induced polarizabilities and of the relative Kirkwood correlation factors for systems and components. The ERAS model is also applied to amide + amine mixtures. ERAS represents rather accurately the excess enthalpies and volumes of the mentioned systems. The variation of the cross-association equilibrium constants, determined using ERAS, with the molecular structure is in agreement with that observed for $\varepsilon_{\text{r}}^{\text{E}}$.</description>

      <title>Liquid-liquid equilibria for (2-hydroxy benzaldehyde + n-alkane) mixtures. Intermolecular and proximity effects in systems containing hydroxyl and aldehyde groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The liquid-liquid equilibrium (LLE) curves have been determined for the 2-hydroxyl-benzaldehyde (salicylaldehyde, SAC) + CH$_3$(CH$_2$)$_n$CH$_3$ mixtures ($n$ = 5,6,7,8,9). The equilibrium temperatures were determined observing, by means of a laser scattering technique, the turbidity produced on cooling when a second phase takes place. All the systems show an upper critical solution temperature, which linearly increases with $n$. Intermolecular effects have been investigated in alkanol + benzaldehyde systems using data from the literature. Interactions in 1-alkanol mixtures are mainly of dipolar type. The corresponding excess molar enthalpies, $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$, are large and positive, which reveals that interactions between like molecules are dominant. Interactions between unlike molecules are stronger for the methanol-containing system. For the other mixtures, the enthalpy of the (1-alkanol)-benzaldehyde interactions remains more or less constant. At 298.15 K and equimolar composition, the replacement of a linear polar solvent by the isomeric aromatic one leads to increased $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ values in systems with a given 1-alkanol. The phenol + benzaldehyde system shows strongly negative deviations from the Raoult's law. Proximity effects have been examined in SAC + hydrocarbon mixtures. Alkane-containing systems are essentially characterized by dipolar interactions, while dispersive interactions are prevalent in the solution with benzene. All the mixtures have been treated in terms of DISQUAC. The interaction parameters for the OH/CHO contacts and for the SAC/aromatic and SAC/alkane contacts have been reported. DISQUAC provides a correct description of the thermodynamic properties considered. In the case of SAC systems, this is done by defining a new specific group HO-C-C-CHO for salicylaldehyde.</description>

      <title>AUGUR, A flexible and efficient optimization algorithm for identification of optimal adsorption sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel flexible optimization pipeline for determining the optimal adsorption sites, named AUGUR (Aware of Uncertainty Graph Unit Regression). Our model combines graph neural networks and Gaussian processes to create a flexible, efficient, symmetry-aware, translation, and rotation- invariant predictor with inbuilt uncertainty quantification. This predictor is then used as a surrogate for a data-efficient Bayesian Optimization scheme to determine the optimal adsorption positions. This pipeline determines the optimal position of large and complicated clusters with far fewer iterations than current state-of-the-art approaches. Further, it does not rely on hand-crafted features and can be seamlessly employed on any molecule without any alterations. Additionally, the pooling properties of graphs allow for the processing of molecules of different sizes by the same model. This allows the energy prediction of computationally demanding systems by a model trained on comparatively smaller and less expensive ones</description>

      <title>An alternative approach to the osmotic second virial coefficient of protein solutions and its application to liquid liquid phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The osmotic second virial coefficient B2 is an important parameter to describe the interactions and phase behavior of protein solutions, including colloidal systems and macromolecular solutions. Another key parameter to describe the driving force of the nucleation of a new phase is the supersaturation, which is used in the classical nucleation theory framework and is connected with the favorable contribution in the Gibbs free energy in the bulk solution. In this article, we establish a connection between B2 calculated from small angle Xray scattering (SAXS) data and the values of B2 obtained from supersaturation measurements using thermodynamics considerations. The values of the second virial coefficient calculated employing this method agree with those determined via SAXS in the region near the liquid liquid phase separation border for human serum albumin and bovine serum albumin. The general relations adopted are shown to be useful for the estimation of the second virial coefficient B2 for globular proteins, in the proximity of the binodal biphasic coexistent region.</description>

      <title>Smirk: An Atomically Complete Tokenizer for Molecular Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular Foundation Models are emerging as powerful tools for accelerating molecular design, material science, and cheminformatics, leveraging transformer architectures to speed up the discovery of new materials and drugs while reducing the computational cost of traditional ab initio methods. However, current models are constrained by closed-vocabulary tokenizers that fail to capture the full diversity of molecular structures. In this work, we systematically evaluate thirteen chemistry-specific tokenizers for their coverage of the SMILES language, uncovering substantial gaps. Using N-gram language models, we accessed the impact of tokenizer choice on model performance and quantified the information loss of unknown tokens. We introduce two new tokenizers, &lt;i&gt;smirk&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;smirk-gpe&lt;/i&gt;, which can represent the entirety of the OpenSMILES specification while avoiding the pitfalls of existing tokenizers. Our work highlights the importance of open-vocabulary modeling for molecular foundation models and the need for chemically diverse benchmarks for cheminformatics.</description>

      <title>Smallest [5,6]fullerene as building blocks for 2D networks with superior stability and enhanced photocatalytic performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The assembly of molecules with covalent networks can form varied lattice structures with distinct physical and chemical properties from conventional atomic lattices. Using the smallest stable [5,6]fullerene units as building blocks, various 2D C$_{24}$ networks can be formed with superior stability and strength compared to the recently synthesised monolayer polymeric C$_{60}$. Monolayer C$_{24}$ harnesses the properties of both carbon crystals and fullerene molecules, such as stable chemical bonds, suitable band gaps and large surface area, facilitating photocatalytic water splitting. The electronic band gaps of C$_{24}$ are comparable to TiO$_2$, providing appropriate band edges with sufficient external potential for overall water splitting over the acidic and neutral pH range. Upon photoexcitation, strong solar absorption enabled by strongly bound bright excitons can generate carriers effectively, while the type-II band alignment between C$_{24}$ and other 2D monolayers can separate electrons and holes in individual layers simultaneously. Additionally, the number of surface active sites of C$_{24}$ monolayers are three times more than that of their C$_{60}$ counterparts in a much wider pH range, providing spontaneous reaction pathways for hydrogen evolution reaction. Our work provides insights into materials design using tunable building blocks of fullerene units with tailored functions for energy generation, conversion and storage.</description>

      <title>The Viscosity of Liquids in the Dual Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A reliable model of viscosity in liquids using a dual liquid model framework is developed. The analytical expression arrived at exhibits the correct T-dependence Arrhenius-like. It is compared with the values of viscosity for water with acceptable accuracy and those related to the mechano-thermal effect in liquids under low-frequency shear. It has even been shown that a numerical approach of viscosity in liquids dealt with as dual systems provides good agreement with experimental data. The expression of viscosity shows an explicit dependence upon the sound velocity and the collective vibratory degrees of freedom excited at a given temperature. The terms involved depend upon the Boltzmann and Planck constants. Finally, the physical model is coherent with the postulate of microscopic reversibility as well as with the time's arrow for macroscopic dissipative mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Theoretical insights into the role of lattice fluctuations on the excited behavior of lead halide perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unravelling the role of charge-lattice interactions on the optoelectronic properties in lead halide perovskites is of great interest due to their unique photophysical properties. While there is broad consensus on the importance of the structural deformations and polar fluctuations on the behavior of charge carriers and quasiparticles, the strongly anharmonic nature of these fluctuations and their strong interactions render theoretical descriptions of lead halides challenging. In this Account, we review our recent efforts to understand how the soft, polar lattice of this class of materials alter their quasiparticle binding energies and fine structure, charge mobilities, and lifetimes of phonons and excess charges. This is reviewed in the context of the effective models we have built, and the novel theoretical methods we have developed to understand bulk crystalline materials, as well as nanostructures, and lower dimensionality lattices. The perspective we detail provides both some design principles for optoelectronic materials and a set of theoretical tools to study them when charge-lattice interactions are important.</description>

      <title>Strong-field effects in the photo-induced dissociation of the hydrogen molecule on a silver nanoshell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasmonic catalysis is a rapidly growing field of research, both from experimental and computational perspectives. Experimental observations demonstrate an enhanced dissociation rate for molecules in the presence of plasmonic nanoparticles under low-intensity visible light. The hot-carrier transfer from the nanoparticle to the molecule is often claimed as the mechanism for dissociation. However, the charge transfer time scale is on the order of few femtoseconds and cannot be resolved experimentally. In this situation, ab initio non-adiabatic calculations can provide a solution. Such simulations, however, have their own limitations related to the computational cost. To accelerate plasmonic catalysis simulations, many researchers resort to applying high-intensity external fields to nanoparticle-molecule systems. Here, we show why such an approach can be problematic and emphasize the importance of considering strong-field effects when interpreting the results of time-dependent density functional theory simulations of plasmonic catalysis. By studying the hydrogen molecule dissociation on the surface of a silver nanoshell and analyzing the electron transfer at different field frequencies and high intensities, we demonstrate that the molecule dissociates due to multiphoton absorption and subsequent ionization.</description>

      <title>Does basis set superposition error significantly affect post-CCSD(T) corrections?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have investigated the title question for both a subset of the W4-11 total atomization energies benchmark, and for the A24x8 noncovalent interactions benchmark. Overall, counterpoise corrections to post-CCSD(T) contributions are about two orders of magnitude less important than those to the CCSD(T) interaction energy. Counterpoise corrections for connected quadruple substitutions (Q) are negligible, and $(Q)_\Lambda - (Q)$ or $T_4 - (Q)$ especially so. In contrast, for atomization energies, the $T_3-(T)$ counterpoise correction can reach about 0.05 \kcalmol~for small basis sets like cc-pVDZ, thought it rapidly tapers off with cc-pVTZ and especially aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets. It is reduced to insignificance by the extrapolation of $T_3-(T)$ applied in both W4 and HEAT thermochemistry protocols. In noncovalent dimers, the differential BSSE on post-CCSD(T) correlation contributions is negligible even in basis sets as small as the unpolarized split-valence cc-pVDZ(no d).</description>

      <title>Solvable toy model of negative energetic elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have established negative energetic elasticity, the negative contribution of energy to the elastic modulus, as a universal property of polymer gels. To reveal the microscopic origin of this phenomenon, Shirai and Sakumichi investigated a polymer model on a cubic lattice with the energy effect from the solvent in finite-size calculations [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 148101 (2023)]. Motivated by this work, we provide a simple platform to study the elasticity of polymer chains by considering a one-dimensional random walk with the energy effect. This model can be mapped onto the classical Ising chain, leading to an exact form of the free energy in the thermodynamic or continuous limit. Our analytical results are qualitatively consistent with Shirai and Sakumichi's work. Our model serves as a fundamental benchmark for studying negative energetic elasticity.</description>

      <title>Influence of Polymer on Shock-Induced Pore Collapse: Hotspot Criticality through Reactive Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The shock initiation of energetic materials is mediated by the localization of mechanical energy into hotspots. These originate through the interaction of the shock and material microstructure; the most potent hotspots are formed by the collapse of porosity. Recent work using molecular dynamics (MD) has shed light on the molecular mechanisms responsible for the shock-to-deflagration transition following pore collapse in pure energetic materials. However, explosive formulations are composites of energetic crystals and a polymer binder, which differs from the prior focus on pure materials. The role of polymer phases on hotspot formation and its criticality is not well-understood. We use reactive MD simulations to investigate the role of polystyrene and polyvinyl nitrate films around pores in the shock-induced pore collapse of RDX. The polymer affects the hotspots' temperature and their criticality. While the presence of inert polymer often delays or hinders chemical reactions of the energetic material, certain geometries accelerate chemistry. The simulations provide a mechanistic understanding of these phenomena.</description>

      <title>Non-Clifford diagonalization for measurement shot reduction in quantum expectation value estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating expectation values on near-term quantum computers often requires a prohibitively large number of measurements. One widely-used strategy to mitigate this problem has been to partition an operator's Pauli terms into sets of mutually commuting operators. Here, we introduce a method that relaxes this constraint of commutativity, instead allowing for entirely arbitrary terms to be grouped together, save a locality constraint. The key idea is that we decompose the operator into arbitrary tensor products with bounded tensor size, ignoring Pauli commuting relations. This method -- named $k$-NoCliD ($k$-local non-Clifford diagonalization) -- allows one to measure in far fewer bases in most cases, often (though not always) at the cost of increasing the circuit depth. We introduce several partitioning algorithms tailored to both fermionic and bosonic Hamiltonians. For electronic structure, vibrational structure, Fermi-Hubbard, and Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonians, we show that $k$-NoCliD reduces the number of circuit shots, often by a very large margin.</description>
