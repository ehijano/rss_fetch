      <title>Improving Wolbachia-Based Control Programs in Urban Settings: Insights from Spatial Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arboviral diseases remain a major public health concern, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions where mosquito populations thrive. One promising strategy to curb transmission is the release of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia, a bacterium that reduces their ability to spread viruses. However, past large-scale releases have not always been successful, especially in complex urban settings, where restricted access to certain areas often leads to infection establishment failures and wasted resources. To address this, we developed and analyzed a partial differential equation model that simulates how Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes are established in different urban environments. We also explored strategies to improve their success under constraints on release size and the efficacy level of insecticide used for pre-release interventions. Our findings suggest that targeted releases are most effective in areas with limited mosquito movement without additional insecticide use. In higher mosquito dispersal areas, reducing at least 35% of wild mosquitoes before release significantly improves establishment within nine months. Additionally, distributing releases over 2-5 weekly batches enhances success more than a single large release, even without other interventions. These findings offer practical insights for designing cost-effective and efficient Wolbachia-based mosquito control programs, reducing the burden of mosquito-borne diseases on vulnerable communities.</description>

      <title>Biodiversity conservation and strategies of public awareness, case study: The natural landscape of central Tunisia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research examines global issues concerning the development of mountain areas considered as territories difficult to manage. The case study area is part of the sub-region of High Alpine Steppes belonging to the Tunisian Ridge and reaching Tebessa Mountains in Algeria. The central question of this article is based on the analysis of the links between the representations produced by mountain landscapes and the construction of a border line that must meet the requirements of sustainable development. Eco-landscape determinants and the role of public authorities and population must be better defined so that the products of this space provide a better quality of life endowed with the alternatives of local and sustainable development. Our hypothesis is that the mountain areas of West Central Tunisia still have a real ecological potential little disturbed by a chimerical development, and can constitute assets for the territorial development of the area. The approach adopted by this work is a scoping audit based on the floristic richness and the monitoring of its spatiotemporal dynamics. The results of this research allowed us to draw rich conclusions; the phyto-ecology approach has shown a relative floristic richness that remains highly dependent on the climatic cycles and intervention of human action; this area must be considered as a priority of the public planning policies aimed at improving the quality of lives in these fragile zones in the context of sustainable development.</description>

      <title>Heterogenous graph neural networks for species distribution modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs) are necessary for measuring and predicting occurrences and habitat suitability of species and their relationship with environmental factors. We introduce a novel presence-only SDM with graph neural networks (GNN). In our model, species and locations are treated as two distinct node sets, and the learning task is predicting detection records as the edges that connect locations to species. Using GNN for SDM allows us to model fine-grained interactions between species and the environment. We evaluate the potential of this methodology on the six-region dataset compiled by National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) for benchmarking SDMs. For each of the regions, the heterogeneous GNN model is comparable to or outperforms previously-benchmarked single-species SDMs as well as a feed-forward neural network baseline model.</description>

      <title>Carbon capture capacity estimation of taiga reforestation and afforestation at the western boreal edge using spatially explicit carbon budget modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Canada's northern boreal has considerable potential for tree planting related climate change mitigation solutions, considering the sparsity of trees and large portions of non-forested land at the northern forest edge. Moreover, afforestation at the northern boreal edge would enable further the observed gradual tree-line advancement of the taiga into the southern arctic, assisting forests in their migration northward while capitalizing on their carbon capture capacity. However, significant uncertainties remain about the carbon capture capacity of large-scale tree planting in the northern boreal ecozones under changing climatic conditions due to lack of spatially explicit ecozone specific modeling. In this paper, we provide monte carlo estimates of carbon capture capacity of taiga reforestation and afforestation at the north-western boreal edge using spatially explicit carbon budget modeling. We combine satellite-based forest inventory data and probabilistic fire regime representations to simulate how total ecosystem carbon (TEC) might evolve from 2025 until 2100 under different scenarios composed of fire return intervals (FRI), historical land classes, planting mortality, and climatic variables. Our findings suggest that afforestation at the north-western boreal edge could provide meaningful carbon sequestration toward Canada's climate targets, potentially storing approximately 3.88G Tonnes of $CO_{2}$e over the next 75 years in the average case resulting from afforestation on approximately 6.4M hectares, with the Northwest Territories (NT)-Taiga Shield West (TSW) zone showing the most potential. Further research is needed to refine these estimates using improved modeling, study economic viability of such a project, and investigate the impact on other regional processes such as permafrost thaw, energy fluxes, and albedo feedbacks.</description>

      <title>Evolution of a trait distributed over a large fragmented population: Propagation of chaos meets adaptive dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a metapopulation made up of $K$ demes, each containing $N$ individuals bearing a heritable quantitative trait. Demes are connected by migration and undergo independent Moran processes with mutation and selection based on trait values. Mutation and migration rates are tuned so that each deme receives a migrant or a mutant in the same slow timescale and is thus essentially monomorphic at all times for the trait (adaptive dynamics). In the timescale of mutation/migration, the metapopulation can then be seen as a giant spatial Moran model with size $K$ that we characterize. As $K\to \infty$ and physical space becomes continuous, the empirical distribution of the trait (over the physical and trait spaces) evolves deterministically according to an integro-differential evolution equation. In this limit, the trait of every migrant is drawn from this global distribution, so that conditional on its initial state, traits from finitely many demes evolve independently (propagation of chaos). Under mean-field dispersal, the value $X_t$ of the trait at time $t$ and at any given location has a law denoted $\mu_t$ and a jump kernel with two terms: a mutation-fixation term and a migration-fixation term involving $\mu_{t-}$ (McKean-Vlasov equation). In the limit where mutations have small effects and migration is further slowed down accordingly, we obtain the convergence of $X$, in the new migration timescale, to the solution of a stochastic differential equation which can be referred to as a new canonical equation of adaptive dynamics. This equation includes an advection term representing selection, a diffusive term due to genetic drift, and a jump term, representing the effect of migration, to a state distributed according to its own law.</description>

      <title>When Less is More: Evolutionary Dynamics of Deception in a Sender-Receiver Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spread of disinformation poses a significant threat to societal well-being. We analyze this phenomenon using an evolutionary game theory model of the sender-receiver game, where senders aim to mislead receivers and receivers aim to discern the truth. Using a combination of replicator equations, finite-size scaling analysis, and extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the long-term evolutionary dynamics of this game. Our central finding is a counterintuitive threshold phenomenon: the role (sender or receiver) with the larger difference in payoffs between successful and unsuccessful interactions is surprisingly more likely to lose in the long run. We show that this effect is robust across different parameter values and arises from the interplay between the relative speeds of evolution of the two roles and the ability of the slower evolving role to exploit the fixed strategy of the faster evolving role. Moreover, for finite populations we find that the initially less frequent strategy of the slower role is more likely to fixate in the population. The initially rarer strategy in the less-rewarded role is, paradoxically, more likely to prevail.</description>
