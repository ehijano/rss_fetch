      <title>Transformations induced by hydrostatic pressure on lead metasilicate phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For most silicates, controlling the crystallization - through the nucleation, growth, and stabilization of distinct crystalline phase - is critical to achieving the desired physical properties in the final glass-ceramic product. In this context, lead metasilicate PbSiO3 (PS) represents an ideal model system for investigating structural evolution under varying pressure and temperature conditions. This is primarily due to its distinct Raman signatures and the capability of resolving its structure with high precision through diffraction measurements. These attributes enable a comprehensive evaluation of the thermodynamic quantities involved in this complex process, which are essential for the physical description of the crystallization of glasses undergoing heterogeneous nucleation. We report on high-pressure in situ analyses of three crystalline phases of PS: a stable monoclinic structure, a metastable hexagonal structure, and a lower symmetry metastable phase. Combined high-pressure Raman and synchrotron X-ray diffraction indicate that the structures are highly sensitive to the application of hydrostatic pressure and that significant structural rearrangements can be achieved in moderate pressure regimes. Such analyses also enabled determining important thermodynamic variables of those systems, such as compressibility. From an applied perspective, our findings demonstrate that the application of pressure achievable using large-volume presses and capable of altering the energy states of such phases, can be regarded as a promising strategy to influence the stages of the overall crystallization process. This approach opens new avenues for the development of novel structures and properties in the resulting glass-ceramic materials</description>

      <title>Vibrational properties of photochromic yttrium oxyhydride and oxydeuteride thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive study of the vibrational properties of photochromic yttrium oxyhydride (YHO) and oxydeuteride (YDO) thin films is presented. These films are deposited using reactive magnetron sputtering, followed by post-oxidation. Our investigation employs vibrational Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, in conjunction with first-principles Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The FTIR spectra of the films reveal broad vibrational bands, primarily attributed to the disordered structure containing small crystallites (&lt;10 nm), as confirmed by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray diffraction measurements. An isotopic shift from approximately 900 to 745 cm-1 is observed in the hydrogen/deuterium-related vibration band, while the lower frequency bands (&lt; 600 cm-1) remain unaffected upon replacement of hydrogen with deuterium. These experimental observations are consistent with the DFT theoretical calculations for various stable YHO lattices reported in the literature. Illumination of the films with ultraviolet light at 3.3 eV leads to additional absorption not only in the visible light range but also up to approximately 2000 cm-1 in the mid-infrared region. However, no phase transformation change or formation of hydroxyl (OH) groups are observed following illumination. Our findings provide valuable insight into the vibrational and photochromic properties of YH(D)O thin films.</description>

      <title>Implicit Geometric Descriptor-Enabled ANN Framework for a Unified Structure-Property Relationship in Architected Nanofibrous Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchically architected nanofibrous materials, such as the vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) foams, draw their exceptional mechanical properties from the interplay of nanoscale size effects and inter-nanotube interactions within and across architectures. However, the distinct effects of these mechanisms, amplified by the architecture, on different mechanical properties remain elusive, limiting their independent tunability for targeted property combinations. Reliance on architecture-specific explicit design parameters further inhibits the development of a unified structure-property relationship rooted in those nanoscale mechanisms. Here, we introduce two implicit geometric descriptors -- multi-component shape invariants (MCSI) -- in an artificial neural network (ANN) framework to establish a unified structure-property relationship that governs diverse architectures. The MCSIs effectively capture the key nanoscale mechanisms that give rise to the bulk mechanical properties such as specific-energy absorption, peak stress, and average modulus. Exploiting their ability to predict mechanical properties for designs that are even outside of the training data, we propose generalized design strategies to achieve desired mechanical property combinations in architected VACNT foams. Such implicit descriptor-enabled ANN frameworks can guide the accelerated and tractable design of complex hierarchical materials for applications ranging from shock-absorbing layers in extreme environments to functional components in soft robotics.</description>

      <title>Robust Super-Moir\'e in Large Angle Single-Twist Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forming long wavelength moir\'e superlattices (MSL) at small-angle twist van der Waals (vdW) bilayers has been a key approach to creating moir\'e flat bands. The small-angle twist, however, leads to strong lattice reconstruction, causing domain walls and moir\'e disorders, which pose considerable challenges in engineering such platforms. At large twist angles, the rigid lattices render a more robust, but shorter wavelength MSL, making it difficult to engineer flat bands. Here, we depict a novel approach to tailoring robust super-moir\'e (SM) structures that combines the advantages of both small-twist and large-twist transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) bilayers using only a single twist angle near a commensurate angle. Structurally, we unveil the spontaneous formation of a periodic arrangement of three inequivalent commensurate moir\'e (CM) stacking, where the angle deviation from the commensurate angle can tune the periodicity. Electronically, we reveal a large set of van Hove singularities (VHSs) that indicate strong band hybridization, leading to flat bands near the valence band maximum. Our study paves the way for a new platform of robust SM bilayers with structural rigidity and controllable wavelength, extending the investigation of the interplay among band topology, quantum geometry, and moir\'e superconductivity to the large twist angle regime.</description>

      <title>Edge non-collinear magnetism in nanoribbons of Fe3GeTe2 and Fe3GaTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fe3GeTe2 and Fe3GaTe2 are ferromagnetic conducting materials of van der Waals-type with unique magnetic properties that are highly promising for the development of new spintronic, orbitronic and magnonic devices. Even in the form of two-dimensional-like ultrathin films, they exhibit relatively high Curie temperature, magnetic anisotropy perpendicular to the atomic planes and multiple types of Hall effects. We explore nanoribbons made from single layers of these materials and show that they display non-collinear magnetic ordering at their edges. This magnetic inhomogeneity allows angular momentum currents to generate magnetic torques at the sample edges, regardless of their polarization direction, significantly enhancing the effectiveness of magnetization manipulation in these systems. We also demonstrate that it is possible to rapidly reverse the magnetization direction of these nanostructures by means of spin-orbit and spin-transfer torques with rather low current densities, making them quite propitious for non-volatile magnetic memory units.</description>

      <title>Study of amorphous alumina coatings for next-generation nuclear reactors: hightemperature in-situ and post-mortem Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work focuses on the investigation of the thermal stability and structural integrity of amorphous alumina coatings intended for use as protective coatings on cladding tubes in Generation IV nuclear reactors, specifically in the Lead-cooled Fast Reactor (LFR) type. Hightemperature Raman spectroscopy and high-temperature X-ray diffraction analyses were carried out up to 1050 C on a 5 um coating deposited by the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique on a 316L steel substrate. The experiments involved the in-situ examination of structural changes in the material under increasing temperature, along with ex-situ Raman imaging of the surface and cross-section of the coating after thermal treatments of different lengths. As it was expected, the presence of alpha-alumina was detected with the addition of other polymorphs, gamma- and theta-Al2O3, found in the material after longer high-temperature exposure. The use of two structural analysis methods and two lasers excitation wavelengths with Raman spectroscopy allowed us to detect all the mentioned phases despite different mode activity. Alumina analysis was based on the emission spectra, while substrate oxidation products were identified through the structural bands. The experiments depicted a dependence of the phase composition of oxidation products and alumina's degree of crystallization on the length of the treatment. Nevertheless, the observed structural changes did not occur rapidly, and the coating's integrity remained intact. Moreover, oxidation signs occurred locally at temperatures exceeding the LFR reactor's working temperature, confirming the material's great potential as a protective coating in the operational conditions of LFR nuclear reactors.</description>

      <title>Reversibly Strain Engineering and Electric-Field Control of Crystal Symmetry in Multiferroic Oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiferroic oxides, such as BiFeO3, have garnered significant attention due to their coupled ferroelectric, magnetic, and elastic properties, offering exciting opportunities for multifunctional device applications. Controlling phase transitions in these materials is critical for tuning their physical properties and achieving desired functionalities. While numerous studies have focused on ferroelectric-ferroelectric transitions at rhombohedral-tetragonal morphotropic phase boundaries, far less attention has been given to the ferroelectric-antiferroelectric phase boundaries. Such systems hold promise for discovering novel physical phenomena, such as reversible phase transitions, enhanced piezoelectricity, and magnetoelectric coupling. In this work, we report a reversible antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric phase transition in La doped BiFeO3 thin films. By modulating the residual strain via film thickness, an antiferroelectric orthorhombic phase is stabilized within a ferroelectric rhombohedral phase matrix. Under an external electric field, the phase transitions reversibly between these two states. This discovery not only enriches the understanding of orthorhombic-rhombohedral morphotropic phase boundaries but also provides a potential pathway for developing magnetoelectric devices with enhanced functionality.</description>

      <title>Roles of Defects and Sb-doping in the Thermoelectric Properties of Full-Heusler Fe2TiSn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential of Fe2TiSn full-Heusler compounds for thermoelectric applications has been suggested theoretically, but not yet grounded experimentally, due to the difficulty of obtaining reproducible, homogeneous, phase pure and defect free samples. In this work, we study Fe2TiSn1-xSbx polycrystals (x from 0 to 0.6), fabricated by high-frequency melting and long-time high-temperature annealing. We obtain fairly good phase purity, homogeneous microstructure and good matrix stoichiometry. Although intrinsic p-type transport behavior is dominant, n-type charge compensation by Sb doping is demonstrated. Calculations of formation energy of defects and electronic properties carried out in the density functional theory formalism reveal that charged iron vacancies VFe2- are the dominant defects responsible for the intrinsic p-type doping of Fe2TiSn in all types of growing conditions except Fe-rich. Additionally, Sb substitutions at Sn site give rise either to SbSn, SbSn1+ which are responsible for n-type doping and magnetism (SbSn) or to magnetic SbSn1- which act as additional p-type dopants. Our experimental data highlight good thermoelectric properties close to room temperature, with Seebeck coefficients up to 56 microV/K in the x=0.2 sample and power factors up to 4.8x10^-4 W m^-1 K^-2 in the x=0.1 sample. Our calculations indicate the appearance of a pseudogap in Ti-rich conditions and large Sb doping, possibly improving further the thermoelectric properties.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of magnetic bubbles in [Ni/Co]$_{n}$ multilayers on an oxygen-reconstructed Nb(110) surface via an ultra-thin Cu interlayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic thin films hosting topological spin textures, such as magnetic skyrmions, hold high potential for breakthroughs in the field of spintronics, due to good scalability and energy efficiency. Novel computational architectures such as memory-in-logic devices rely on material platforms able to host those topological spin textures. Furthermore, recently proposed designs of novel quantum information technologies are based on heterostructures where topological spin textures are in direct proximity to a superconducting layer. Here, we demonstrate the stabilization of out-of-plane magnetic bubbles in highly ordered [Ni/Co]$_{n}$ multilayers on a Nb(110) single crystal. This is achieved without the need for removal of the well-known Nb(110)-oxide surface reconstruction, due to the introduction of a one-atom-thick Cu interlayer in between the Nb substrate and the magnetic multilayer. The Cu interlayer generates a well-ordered hexagonal surface, which is key for the epitaxial growth of the [Ni/Co]$_{n}$ multilayers hosting the desired out-of-plane anisotropy. The magnetic ground state of the prepared material stacks is directly imaged via spin-polarized low energy electron microscopy (SPLEEM), revealing the presence of magnetic bubble domains with lateral sizes as small as 450 nm.</description>

      <title>A thin film source in a solid-state diffusion experiment: CoO on SrTiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To realize a chemical diffusion experiment for simple quantitative analysis of one-dimensional diffusion profiles requires the fabrication of a planar and chemically sharp interface between two phases, one serving as the diffusion source and the other as the material to be studied. We demonstrate a thin film source on top of single crystals or epitaxial films for the example of cobalt (II) oxide (CoO) grown on top of SrTiO3 (STO) by ion beam sputtering. After deposition at room temperature, a nanocrystalline film with flat and chemically sharp interface is present. Diffusion annealing leads to a partial formation of the Co3O4 phase and recrystallization accompanied by a strong increase of the surface and the interface roughness. We report the conditions, where compact and stable CoO layers with flat interface can be maintained, serving as a constant source for Co diffusion. Exemplarily, the formation of a Co-diffusion profile is demonstrated after annealing of 240 h at 1163 K and comparatively studied by using three different methods: Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) in a transmission electron microscope (TEM), atom probe tomography (APT) and time of flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOF SIMS). Local and rather macroscopic concentration profiling do well agree within error.</description>

      <title>Machine learning exploration of topological polarization pattern in hexagonal boron nitride moir\'e superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted moir\'e supercells, which can be approximated as a combination of sliding bilayers and constitute various topologically nontrivial polarization patterns, attract extensive attention recently. However, because of the excessive size of the moir\'e supercell, most studies are based on effective models and lack the results of first-principles calculation. In this work, we use machine learning to determine the topological structure of the polarization pattern in twisted and strained bilayer of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). We further confirm that the topological pattern can be effectively modulated by the vertical electric field and lattice mismatch. Finally, local polarization also exists in the antiparallel stacked h-BN twisted and strained bilayers. Our work provides a detailed study of the polarization pattern in the moir\'e superlattice, which we believe can facilitate more research in moir\'e ferroelectricity, topological physics, and related fields.</description>

      <title>2D Layered Heterojunctions for Photoelectrocatalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) layered nanomaterials heterostructures, arising from the combination of 2D materials with other low-dimensional species, feature large surface area to volume ratio, which provides a high density of active sites for catalytic ap-plications and in particular for (photo)electrocatalysis (PEC). Meanwhile, their unique electronic band structure and high electrical conductivity enable efficient charge transfer (CT) between the active material and the substrate, which is essential for catalytic activity. In recent years, researchers have demonstrated the potential of a range of 2D material interfaces, such as graphene, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), metal chalcogenides (MCs), and MXenes, for (photo)electrocatalytic applica-tions. For instance, MCs such as MoS2 and WS2 have shown excellent catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution, while gra-phene and MXenes have been used for the reduction of carbon dioxide to higher value chemicals. However, despite their great potential, there are still major challenges that need to be addressed in order to fully realize the potential of 2D materials for PEC. For example, their stability under harsh reaction conditions, as well as their scalability for large-scale production are important factors to be considered. Generating heterojunctions (HJs) by combining 2D layered structures with other na-nomaterials is a promising method to improve the photoelectrocatalytic properties of the former. In this review, we inspect thoroughly the recent literature, to demonstrate the significant potential that arises from utilizing 2D layered heterostructures in PEC processes across a broad spectrum of applications, from energy conversion and storage to environmental remediation. With the ongoing research and development, it is likely that the potential of these materials will be fully expressed in the near future.</description>

      <title>Realization of strain induced multiple topological phases in Cu$_2$SnS$_3$: An $ab$-$initio$ study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search of multiple topological phases (TPs) and their transitions by tuning different parameters through chemical substitutions, electric field, magnetic field, strain and Floquet engineering, etc has garnered a widespread attention in recent time. In spite of great effort, the observations of multiple TPs in a single material and multiple TP transitions in the presence of one parameter remain elusive. Here we demonstrate the presence of multiple TPs and their transitions with uniaxial compressive strain (UCS) in orthorhombic Cu$_2$SnS$_3$ by using $state$-$of$-$the$-$art$ $ab$-$initio$ calculations. In the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the Cu$_2$SnS$_3$ exhibits a single (type-II) nodal-ring and in the presence of SOC, it hosts Weyl phase with seven Weyl points (three at $\Gamma$ and four at general positions) along with nodal arcs. On the application of UCS, it remains type-II nodal-ring $&lt;5.5$\%, which further evolves into type-III nodal-ring for $5.5\% \leq$ UCS $&lt;5.6$\%. Interestingly, at 5.6\% of UCS, it shows Weyl phase with four Weyl nodes even in the absence of SOC. All the above-mentioned seven Weyl points persist below $5$\% of UCS. For 5\% $\leq$ UCS $&lt;5.6$\%, four Weyl points (at general positions) disappear and nodal-arcs remain intact in all the studied range of UCS. The TPs observed in the absence of SOC appears to arise due to the presence of strain driven topological flat band, which is typically reported to be seen in kagome and Lieb lattices.</description>

      <title>Antisymmetry rules of response properties in certain chemical spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding chemical compound space (CCS), a set of molecules and materials, is crucial for the rational discovery of molecules and materials. Concepts of symmetry have recently been introduced into CCS to account for near degeneracies and differences in electronic energies between iso-electronic materials. In this work, we present approximate relationships of response properties based on a first-principles view of CCS. They have been derived from perturbation theory and antisymmetry considerations involving nuclear charges. These rules allow approximate predictions of relative response properties of pairs of distinct compounds with opposite nuclear charge variations from a highly symmetric reference material, without the need for experiments or quantum chemical calculations of each compound. We numerically and statistically verified these rules for electric and magnetic response properties (electric dipole moment, polarizabilities, hyperpolarizabilities, and magnetizabilities) among charge-neutral and iso-electronic BN-doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivatives of naphthalene, anthracene, and pyrene. Our analysis indicates that, despite their simplicity, antisymmetry rule-based predictions are remarkably accurate, enabling dimensionality reduction of CCS. Response properties in alchemical perturbation density functional theory were investigated to clarify the origin of this predictive power. The origin of this predictive power was clarified based on alchemical perturbation density functional theory.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast annealing process of MTJ using hybrid microwave annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discovers that the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) structure is successfully magnetized with hybrid microwave annealing, confirmed by the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) and Coercivity (Hc) results. Hybrid microwave annealing can transform CoFeB into a single crystal and form the Fe-O bond at the interface between CoFeB and MgO without adding an extra magnet. The annealing time is significantly reduced from the original 120 minutes to just 1 minute, allowing for rapid low-temperature annealing of the MTJ structure. The TEM results are used to determine the change in the lattice structure of CoFeB from amorphous to a single crystal, and the EELS result indicates the diffusion distribution of atoms in the MTJ structure. This hybrid annealing process can save a significant amount of fabrication time and is an energy-efficient alternative to the current fabrication process of MRAM.</description>

      <title>Effect of Annealing on Al Diffusion and its Impact on the Properties of Ga$_2$O$_3$ Thin Films Deposited on c-plane Sapphire by RF Sputtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gallium oxide is a wide-bandgap semiconductor which has been steadily growing in popularity due to its ultra-wide bandgap, suitability for harsh environments and distinctive opto-electrical properties. Notable applications include deep-UV photodetectors, low loss waveguides or even transparent solar cells. RF sputtering stands out among possible techniques for the epitaxial deposition of Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ thin films with high quality and at a low cost. By using sapphire substrates, and through thermal annealing, we can form a $\beta$-(Al$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_{2}$O$_{3}$ alloy by Al diffusion, which has tunable opto-electrical properties such as the bandgap and breakdown electric field.
  In this work, techniques such as X-ray diffraction, Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and optical transmission are used to determine the optical properties, morphology and composition of Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ deposited and annealed thin films. To explore the formation of the $\beta$-(Al$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_{2}$O$_{3}$ alloy, annealing was performed at variable temperature, in ambient air. It was determined that the bandgap can indeed be tuned between 4.85 and 5.30 eV by varying the annealing temperature, corresponding to an Al content between 0$-$68.5.</description>

      <title>Artificially creating emergent interfacial antiferromagnetism and its manipulation in a magnetic van-der-Waals heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) magnets, with their two-dimensional (2D) atomic structures, provide a unique platform for exploring magnetism at the nanoscale. Although there have been numerous reports on their diverse quantum properties, the emergent interfacial magnetism--artificially created at the interface between two layered magnets--remains largely unexplored. This work presents observations of such emergent interfacial magnetism at the ferromagnet/antiferromagnet interface in a vdW heterostructure. We report the discovery of an intermediate Hall resistance plateau in the anomalous Hall loop, indicative of emergent interfacial antiferromagnetism fostered by the heterointerface. This plateau can be stabilized and further manipulated under varying pressures but collapses under high pressures over 10 GPa. Our theoretical calculations reveal that charge transfer at the interface is pivotal in establishing the interlayer antiferromagnetic spin-exchange interaction. This work illuminates the previously unexplored emergent interfacial magnetism at a vdW interface comprised of a ferromagnetic metal and an antiferromagnetic insulator, and highlights its gradual evolution under increasing pressure. These findings enrich the portfolio of emergent interfacial magnetism and support further investigations on vdW magnetic interfaces and the development of next-generation spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Dielectric-Dependent Range-Separated Hybrid Functional Calculations for Metal Oxides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, we introduced the screened-exchange range-separated hybrid (SE-RSH) functional to account for spatially dependent dielectric screening in complex materials. The SE-RSH functional has shown good performance in predicting the electronic properties of a large variety of semiconductors and insulators, and of heterogeneous systems composed of building blocks with large dielectric mismatch. Here, we assess the performance of SE-RSH for oxide materials, including antiferromagnetic transition-metal oxides. Through a comparison with other dielectric-dependent hybrid functionals, we demonstrate that SE-RSH yields improved predictions of dielectric constants and band gaps, bringing them into a closer agreement with experimental values. The functional also provides accurate values of magnetic moments of several oxides.</description>

      <title>UV photodetectors and field-effect transistors based on $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ nanomembranes produced by ion-beam-assisted exfoliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ nanomembranes, obtained by ion-beam-assisted exfoliation, are used in the fabrication of simple metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) structures, that are tested as photodetectors (PD) and field-effect transistors (FET). Ti/Au contacts to the membrane are found to be rectifying. However, through thermal treatment in a nitrogen atmosphere for one minute at 500 {\deg}C, it is possible to modify this junction to have an ohmic behavior. An MSM PD is studied, reaching a high responsivity of 2.6$\times$10$^{4}$ A/W and a detectivity of 2.4$\times$10$^{14}$ Jones, under 245 nm wavelength illumination, and an applied voltage of 40 V. In order to better understand the behavior of the two junctions, in particular the iono/photocurrent mechanisms, an ion microprobe system is used to assess the response of these PD when excitation is localized in the different regions of the device. Finally, a depletion-mode FET is obtained, with an on/off current ratio of 7.7$\times$10$^{7}$ in the linear regime, at a drain-to-source voltage of 5 V, and with a threshold voltage around $-$3 V. The success in obtaining FET, and most notably, MSM photodetectors, while using a simple device structure, indicates a great potential of the nanomembranes produced by ion-beam-assisted exfoliation for the development of high-performance devices.</description>

      <title>Dynamical pathways for the interaction of O2, H2O, CH4, and CO2 with a-alumina surfaces: Density functional tight-binding calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigated the physisorption mechanisms of O2, H2O, CH4, and CO2 molecules on alumina and their effect on electronic properties. We employed quantum-classical molecular dynamics simulations and the self-consistent-charge density-functional tight-binding (SCC-DFTB) approach to dynamically model these mechanisms. Our results revealed the binding pathways of O, H, and C atoms in the various molecules to Al and O atoms at the top atomic layers of the alpha-alumina surface. We examined several adsorption sites and molecular orientations relative to Al-terminated and Ox-terminated alumina surfaces and found that the most stable physisorbed state on the Al-terminated surface is located above the Al atom, while the Ox-terminated state is found above the oxygen, resulting in enhanced optical adsorbance. The dissociation of CH4 into CH2+H2 after interaction with the surface resulted in hydrogen production, but with low adsorbate rates. While, O2 molecules primarily bond to the Al atoms, leading to the highest adsorbance rate among the other molecules. Our findings provide important insights into the physisorption mechanisms of molecules on alumina and their impact on electronic properties</description>

      <title>Many-body and QED effects in electron-atom inelastic scattering in EELS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The elemental composition and electronic structure analysis of materials in Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) is probed by the inner shell ionization of atoms. This is a localized process in the material which can be well approximated by the scattering of a beam electron from a free atom. The inelastic differential cross section is calculated in the context of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). The interaction of the incoming electron with the atom factorizes and it is treated perturbatively in QED. The atomic transition currents are calculated in the context of the relaxed Dirac-Hartree-Fock method. Correlation effects, which are induced by the relaxation of the atomic orbitals due to the created core-hole, are analyzed. Such effects are particularly important for quantum many-body systems and they are shown to have important impact on the shape of the differential cross section near the ionization threshold in Electron Energy Loss Spectra. In addition to the ionization spectrum, we calculate the excitation spectrum of Sc and Dy oxides using the crystal field multiplet theory. The calculation is compared to experimental EELS data and shows good agreement.</description>

      <title>Geometric dependence of critical current magnitude and nonreciprocity in planar Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planar Josephson junctions in a magnetic field exhibit the superconducting diode effect, by which the critical current magnitude depends on the polarity of the transport current. A number of different mechanisms for the effect have been proposed.Here, we study symmetric, T-shaped planar Josephson junctions with semiconducting weak links in an in-plane magnetic field perpendicular to an applied current bias. In particular, we vary the longitudinal width (i.e.\ parallel to the current) of the superconducting contacts and the voltage of an electrostatic gate. We observe an increase in both critical current and diode efficiency with increasing contact width and relate the critical current behavior to the induced coherence length of the Andreev bound states that mediate the supercurrent flow through the junction. We further observe a linear trend, with respect to inverse contact width, of the field at which the diode efficiency is maximized, which saturates as the contact width becomes large compared to the coherence length. The smaller field at which the critical current is maximized additionally exhibits a strong gate dependence. We interpret these observations in the context of multiple underlying mechanisms, including spin--orbit coupling and orbital effects.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Origin of Viscosity in 2D Simple Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shear viscosity plays a fundamental role in liquid dynamics from heavy-ion collisions to biological processes. Still, its physical origin at the individual particle kinetic level remains strongly debated. In this work, we systematically investigate the shear viscosity ($\eta$) of two-dimensional (2D) simple liquids using computer simulations of Lennard-Jones, Yukawa, and one-component plasma systems. By combining Frenkel's liquid description, consisting of solid-like quasi-harmonic vibrations interrupted by thermally activated hops, with the concept of lifetime of local atomic connectivity $\tau_{LC}$, we find a surprisingly simple formula for the kinematic viscosity that is solely determined by $\tau_{LC}$ and the average kinetic particle speed $\bar{v}_p$. The derived analytical expression provides a direct link between macroscopic and microscopic dynamics, which shows excellent agreement with the simulation data in all the 2D liquids considered. Moreover, it is discovered that, $\tau_{LC}$ in 2D liquids is universally determined by the effective potential difference between the first peak and valley of the pair correlation function, implying a direct connection between macroscopic shear transport and microscopic structure. Finally, we demonstrate that the characteristic length scale $l_p= \bar{v}_p \tau_{LC}$, which governs the macroscopic shear viscosity, aligns with the elastic length-scale that defines the propagation limit of collective shear waves in liquids. These findings establish that shear viscosity in 2D liquids arises from the diffusive transport of average particle momentum across the elastic length scale. Moreover, they highlight that shear dynamics are fundamentally governed by localized configurational excitations within the atomic connectivity network.</description>

      <title>Orientation Dependent Resistivity Scaling in Mesoscopic NbP Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scaling of Si transistor technology has resulted in a remarkable improvement in the performance of integrated circuits over the last decades. However, scaled transistors also require reduced electrical interconnect dimensions, which lead to greater losses and power dissipation at circuit level. This is mainly caused by enhanced surface scattering of charge carriers in copper interconnect wires at dimensions below 30 nm. A promising approach to mitigate this issue is to use directional conductors, i.e. materials with anisotropic Fermi surface, where proper alignment of crystalline orientation and transport direction can minimize surface scattering. In this work, we perform a resistivity scaling study of the anisotropic semimetal NbP as a function of crystalline orientation. We use here focused ion beam to pattern and scale down NbP crystallites to dimensions comparable to the electron scattering length at cryogenic temperatures. The experimental transport properties are correlated with the Fermi surface characteristics through a theoretical model, thus identifying the physical mechanisms that influence the resistivity scaling of anisotropic conductors. Our methodology provides an effective approach for early evaluation of anisotropic materials as future ultra-scalable interconnects, even when they are unavailable as epitaxial films.</description>

      <title>Exciton-Polariton Dynamics in Multilayered Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupling excitons with quantized radiation has been shown to enable coherent ballistic transport at room temperature inside optical cavities. Previous theoretical works employ a simple description of the material, depicting it as a single layer placed in the middle of the optical cavity, thereby ignoring the spatial variation of the radiation in the cavity quantization direction. In contrast, in most experiments, the optical cavity is filled with organic molecules or multilayered materials. Here, we develop an efficient mixed-quantum-classical approach, introducing a {\it bright layer} description, to simulate the exciton-polariton quantum dynamics. Our simulations reveal that, for the same Rabi splitting, a multilayer material extends the quantum coherence lifetime and enhances transport compared to a single-layer material. We find that this enhanced coherence can be traced to a synchronization of phonon fluctuations over multiple layers, wherein the collective light-matter coupling in a multilayered material effectively suppresses the phonon-induced dynamical disorder.</description>

      <title>Evidence for topological origin of large spin-shift current in antiferromagnetic Ti$_{4}$C$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shift current is a non-linear photocurrent generally associated with the underlying quantum geometry. However, a topological origin for the shift photocurrent in non-centrosymmetric systems has recently been proposed. The corresponding topological classification goes beyond the ten-fold paradigm and is associated with the presence of a reverting Thouless pump (RTP). In this work we examine an antiferromagnetic monolayer within the family of MXenes, Ti$_{4}$C$_{3}$. This material is centrosymmetric, however, magnetic ordering violates inversion symmetry. We demonstrate evidence of an RTP in each spin-sector which has been perturbed, destroying quantization of the invariant. Nevertheless, a giant spin-resolved shift current persists. We further investigate the mid-gap edge states and classification of the system as a fragile topological insulator to which trivial bands have been coupled.</description>

      <title>Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an agentic, autonomous graph expansion framework that iteratively structures and refines knowledge in situ. Unlike conventional knowledge graph construction methods relying on static extraction or single-pass learning, our approach couples a reasoning-native large language model with a continually updated graph representation. At each step, the system actively generates new concepts and relationships, merges them into a global graph, and formulates subsequent prompts based on its evolving structure. Through this feedback-driven loop, the model organizes information into a scale-free network characterized by hub formation, stable modularity, and bridging nodes that link disparate knowledge clusters. Over hundreds of iterations, new nodes and edges continue to appear without saturating, while centrality measures and shortest path distributions evolve to yield increasingly distributed connectivity. Our analysis reveals emergent patterns, such as the rise of highly connected 'hub' concepts and the shifting influence of 'bridge' nodes, indicating that agentic, self-reinforcing graph construction can yield open-ended, coherent knowledge structures. Applied to materials design problems, we present compositional reasoning experiments by extracting node-specific and synergy-level principles to foster genuinely novel knowledge synthesis, yielding cross-domain ideas that transcend rote summarization and strengthen the framework's potential for open-ended scientific discovery. We discuss other applications in scientific discovery and outline future directions for enhancing scalability and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Josephson Junction Barrier Variation -- a Combined STEM, Breakdown and Monte-Carlo Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Josephson junctions manufactured to tight tolerances are necessary components for superconducting quantum computing. Developing precise manufacturing techniques for Josephson junctions requires an understanding of their make-up and robust feedback metrics against which to optimise. Here we consider complementary techniques assessing what conclusions they allow us to draw about the barriers in junctions. Monte-Carlo simulations of barriers show that standard deviations of 15-20 % of the total barrier thickness are compatible with our experimental data. Electrical breakdown allows us to probe the weakest points in barriers. Narrowing the distribution of this breakdown provides a promising feedback mechanism for barrier optimisation. Grouping junctions by breakdown voltage allows us to identify sub-ensembles of junctions with different median resistance, highlighting the importance of weak spots in junction parameters such as resistance. Transmission electron microscopy can be used to find average barrier thickness, although we highlight challenges forming robust conclusions on the distribution of thicknesses in a barrier from these experiments.</description>

Abstract: This study proposes a materials search method combining a data assimilation technique based on a multivariate Gaussian distribution with Bayesian optimization. The efficiency of the search using this method was demonstrated using a pair of example functions. By combining Bayesian optimization with the data assimilation technique, the maximum value of the example function was found more efficiently compared to ordinary Bayesian optimization without the data assimilation. A practical demonstration was also conducted by constructing a data assimilation model for the bandgap of (Sr$_{1-x_{1}-x_{2}}$La$_{x_{1}}$Na$_{x_{2}}$)(Ti$_{1-x_{1}-x_{2}}$Ga$_{x_{1}}$Ta$_{x_{2}}$)O$_{3}$. The concentration dependence of the bandgap was analyzed, and synthesis was performed with chemical compositions in the sparse region of the training data points to validate the predictions.</description>

      <title>Magnetic order induced chiral phonons in a ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral phonons are vibrational modes in a crystal that possess a well-defined handedness or chirality, typically found in materials that lack inversion symmetry. Here we report the discovery of chiral phonon modes in the kagome ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2, a material that preserves inversion symmetry but breaks time-reversal symmetry. Using helicity-resolved magneto-Raman spectroscopy, we observe the spontaneous splitting of the doubly degenerate in-plane Eg modes into two distinct chiral phonon modes of opposite helicity when the sample is zero-field cooled below the Curie temperature, in the absence of an external magnetic field. As we sweep the out-of-plane magnetic field, this Eg phonon splitting exhibits a well-defined hysteresis loop directly correlated with the material's magnetization. The observed spontaneous splitting reaches up to 1.27 cm-1 at low temperatures, progressively diminishes with increasing temperature, and completely vanishes near the Curie temperature. Our findings highlight the role of the magnetic order in inducing chiral phonons, paving the way for novel methods to manipulate chiral phonons through magnetization and vice versa. Additionally, our work introduces new possibilities for controlling chiral Weyl fermions using chiral phonons.</description>

Abstract: A solid electrolyte having the ionic conductivity comparable to that of conventional liquid electrolyte can be used in All Solid State Batteries (ASSB's). The series Li6.75+xLa3-xSrxZr1.75Ta0.25O12 (x = 0 to 0.20) was synthesized to improve the ionic conductivity of garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO). The structural, physical and morphological investigations have been carried out for all the synthesized samples using X ray diffraction, density measurement and scanning electron microscopy respectively. The results of electrochemical analysis showed that the maximum room temperature ionic conductivity of 3.5 x 10-4 S/cm and minimum activation energy of 0.29 eV is achieved by the 0.05 Sr ceramic sample sintered at 1050^oC. The DC conductivity measurement confirmed the dominance of ionic conduction in the prepared ceramic samples. The highest ionic conductivity with the minimum activation energy makes the 0.05 Sr ceramic sample a suitable choice as solid electrolyte for All Solid State Lithium Ion Batteries (ASSLIB's).</description>

      <title>Multiscale nanoindentation modeling of concentrated solid solutions: A continuum plasticity model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.11833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently developed single-phase concentrated solid-solution alloys (CSAs) contain multiple elemental species in high concentrations with different elements randomly arranged on a crystalline lattice. These chemically disordered materials present excellent physical properties, including high-temperature thermal stability and hardness, with promising applications to industries at extreme operating environments. The aim of this paper is to present a continuum plasticity model accounting for the first time for the behaviour of a equiatomic five-element CSA, that forms a face-centered cubic lattice. The inherent disorder associated with the lattice distortions caused by an almost equiatomic distribution of atoms, is captured by a single parameter {\alpha} that quantifies the relative importance of an isotropic plastic contribution to the model. This results in multiple plasticity mechanisms that go beyond crystallographic symmetry-based ones, common in the case of conventional single element metals. We perform molecular dynamics simulations of equiatomic CSAs: NiFe, NiFeCr, NiFeCrCo, and Cantor alloys to validate the proposed continuum model which is implemented in the finite element method and applied to model nanoindentation tests for three different crystallographic orientations. We obtain the representative volume element model by tracking the combined model yield surface.</description>

      <title>CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ Adsorption Mechanisms on Monolayer Graphenylene and their Effects on Optical and Electronic Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13472v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we employ a computational chemistry-based modeling approach to investigate the adsorption mechanisms of CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ on monolayer GPNL, with a specific focus on their effects on optical adsorption and electrical transport properties at room temperature. To simulate the adsorption dynamics as closely as possible to experimental conditions, we utilize the self-consistent charge tight-binding density functional theory (SCC-DFTB). Through semi-classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we observe the formation of H$_2$ molecules from the dissociation of CH$_4$ and the formation of CO+O species from carbon dioxide molecules. This provides insights into the adsorption and dispersion mechanisms of CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ on GPNL. Furthermore, we explore the impact of molecular adsorption on optical absorption properties. Our results demonstrate that CH$_4$ and CH$_2$ affects drastically the optical adsorption of GPNL, while CO$_2$ does not significantly affect the optical properties of the two-dimensional material. To analyze electron transport, we employ the open-boundary non-equilibrium Green's function method. By studying the conductivity of GPNL and graphene under voltage bias up to 300 mV, we gain valuable insights into the electrical transport properties of GPNL under optical absorption conditions. The findings from our computational modeling approach might contribute to a deeper understanding of the potential applications of GPNL in hydrogen production and advanced electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Valley polarization of Landau levels driven by residual strain in the ZrSiS surface band</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a multi-valley electronic band structure, lifting of the valley degeneracy is associated with rotational symmetry breaking in the electronic fluid, and may emerge through spontaneous symmetry breaking order, or through a large response to a small external perturbation such as strain. In this work we use scanning tunneling microscopy to investigate an unexpected rotational symmetry breaking in Landau levels formed in the unusual floating surface band of ZrSiS. We visualize a ubiquitous splitting of Landau levels into valley-polarized sub-levels. We demonstrate methods to measure valley-selective Landau level spectroscopy, to infer unknown Landau level indices, and to precisely measure each valley's Berry phase in a way that is agnostic to the band structure and topology of the system. These techniques allow us to obtain each valley's dispersion curve and infer a rigid valley-dependent contribution to the band energies. Ruling out spontaneous symmetry breaking by establishing the sample-dependence of this valley splitting, we explain the effect in terms of residual strain. A quantitative estimate indicates that uniaxial strain can be measured to a precision of $ \lt 0.025 \% $. The extreme valley-polarization of the Landau levels results from as little as $ \sim 0.1 \% $ strain, and this suggests avenues for manipulation using deliberate strain engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Introducing superconductivity into group IV elements by doping has long promised a pathway to introduce quantum functionalities into well-established semiconductor technologies. The non-equilibrium hyperdoping of group III atoms into Si or Ge has successfully shown superconductivity can be achieved, however, the origin of superconductivity has been obscured by structural disorder and dopant clustering. Here, we report the epitaxial growth of hyperdoped Ga:Ge films by molecular beam epitaxy with extreme hole concentrations ($n_\textup{h} = 4.15 \times 10^{21}$~cm$^{-3}$, ~17.9\% Ga substitution) that yield superconductivity with a critical temperature of $T_{\textup{c}} = 3.5$~K and an out-of-plane critical field of 1~T at 270~mK. Synchrotron-based X-ray absorption and scattering methods reveal that Ga dopants are substitutionally incorporated within the Ge lattice, introducing a tetragonal distortion to the crystal unit cell. Our findings, corroborated by first-principles calculations, suggest that the structural order of Ga dopants creates a narrow band for the emergence of superconductivity in Ge, establishing hyperdoped Ga:Ge as a low-disorder, epitaxial superconductor-semiconductor platform.</description>
