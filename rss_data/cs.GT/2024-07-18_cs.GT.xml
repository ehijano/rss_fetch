      <title>Maximin Fair Allocation of Indivisible Items under Cost Utilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of fairly allocating indivisible goods among a set of agents. Our focus is on the existence of allocations that give each agent their maximin fair share--the value they are guaranteed if they divide the goods into as many bundles as there are agents, and receive their lowest valued bundle. An MMS allocation is one where every agent receives at least their maximin fair share. We examine the existence of such allocations when agents have cost utilities. In this setting, each item has an associated cost, and an agent's valuation for an item is the cost of the item if it is useful to them, and zero otherwise.
  Our main results indicate that cost utilities are a promising restriction for achieving MMS. We show that for the case of three agents with cost utilities, an MMS allocation always exists. We also show that when preferences are restricted slightly further--to what we call laminar set approvals--we can guarantee MMS allocations for any number of agents. Finally, we explore if it is possible to guarantee each agent their maximin fair share while using a strategyproof mechanism.</description>

      <title>Truthful and Almost Envy-Free Mechanism of Allocating Indivisible Goods: the Power of Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of fairly and truthfully allocating $m$ indivisible items to $n$ agents with additive preferences. Specifically, we consider truthful mechanisms outputting allocations that satisfy EF$^{+u}_{-v}$, where, in an EF$^{+u}_{-v}$ allocation, for any pair of agents $i$ and $j$, agent $i$ will not envy agent $j$ if $u$ items were added to $i$'s bundle and $v$ items were removed from $j$'s bundle. Previous work easily indicates that, when restricted to deterministic mechanisms, truthfulness will lead to a poor guarantee of fairness: even with two agents, for any $u$ and $v$, EF$^{+u}_{-v}$ cannot be guaranteed by truthful mechanisms when the number of items is large enough. In this work, we focus on randomized mechanisms, where we consider ex-ante truthfulness and ex-post fairness. For two agents, we present a truthful mechanism that achieves EF$^{+0}_{-1}$ (i.e., the well-studied fairness notion EF$1$). For three agents, we present a truthful mechanism that achieves EF$^{+1}_{-1}$. For $n$ agents in general, we show that there exist truthful mechanisms that achieve EF$^{+u}_{-v}$ for some $u$ and $v$ that depend only on $n$ (not $m$).
  We further consider fair and truthful mechanisms that also satisfy the standard efficiency guarantee: Pareto-optimality. We provide a mechanism that simultaneously achieves truthfulness, EF$1$, and Pareto-optimality for bi-valued utilities (where agents' valuation on each item is either $p$ or $q$ for some $p&gt;q\geq0$). For tri-valued utilities (where agents' valuations on each item belong to $\{p,q,r\}$ for some $p&gt;q&gt;r\geq0$) and any $u,v$, we show that truthfulness is incompatible with EF$^{+u}_{-v}$ and Pareto-optimality even for two agents.</description>

      <title>Optimal Strategies in Ranked-Choice Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) and Single Transferable Voting (STV) are widely valued; but are complex to understand due to intricate per-round vote transfers. Questions like determining how far a candidate is from winning or identifying effective election strategies are computationally challenging as minor changes in voter rankings can lead to significant ripple effects - for example, lending support to a losing candidate can prevent their votes from transferring to a more competitive opponent. We study optimal strategies - persuading voters to change their ballots or adding new voters - both algorithmically and theoretically. Algorithmically, we develop efficient methods to reduce election instances while maintaining optimization accuracy, effectively circumventing the computational complexity barrier. Theoretically, we analyze the effectiveness of strategies under both perfect and imperfect polling information. Our algorithmic approach applies to the ranked-choice polling data on the US 2024 Republican Primary, finding, for example, that several candidates would have been optimally served by boosting another candidate instead of themselves.</description>

      <title>Safe Pareto Improvements for Expected Utility Maximizers in Program Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05103v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agents in mixed-motive coordination problems such as Chicken may fail to coordinate on a Pareto-efficient outcome. Safe Pareto improvements (SPIs) were originally proposed to mitigate miscoordination in cases where players lack probabilistic beliefs as to how their delegates will play a game; delegates are instructed to behave so as to guarantee a Pareto improvement on how they would play by default. More generally, SPIs may be defined as transformations of strategy profiles such that all players are necessarily better off under the transformed profile. In this work, we investigate the extent to which SPIs can reduce downsides of miscoordination between expected utility-maximizing agents. We consider games in which players submit computer programs that can condition their decisions on each other's code, and use this property to construct SPIs using programs capable of renegotiation. We first show that under mild conditions on players' beliefs, each player always prefers to use renegotiation. Next, we show that under similar assumptions, each player always prefers to be willing to renegotiate at least to the point at which they receive the lowest payoff they can attain in any efficient outcome. Thus subjectively optimal play guarantees players at least these payoffs, without the need for coordination on specific Pareto improvements. Lastly, we prove that renegotiation does not guarantee players any improvements on this bound.</description>

      <title>Serial Monopoly on Blockchains with Quasi-patient Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the face of limited block size, miners (e.g., in Bitcoin) prioritize high-bid transactions, forming a large part of their revenue. If the block size were to expand significantly, meeting all transaction demand due to infrastructure or protocol improvements, bids could drop to zero or to a minimum fee, reducing mining incentives and potentially affecting security. To address this, Lavi et al. (2022) introduced a monopolistic pricing mechanism where miners only include transactions paying a minimum price, ensuring some revenue but resulting in an unbounded loss in welfare. Nisan (2023) expands this by modeling bidders as patient, who wait indefinitely long for lower prices, causing price fluctuations even with stable demand. In order to capture users' diminishing interest in having their transactions added to the ledger over time, we consider a more realistic setting with quasi-patient users, where only a fraction $\delta \in [0,1]$ of pending transactions remains in the next round. This richer model encompasses both Lavi et al.'s impatient users ($\delta=0$) and Nisan's patient users ($\delta=1$) as special cases. We demonstrate that Nisan's fluctuating dynamics persist for $\delta$ close to 1, while for $\delta$ close to 0, the dynamics resemble the impatient case. For $\delta \in (0,1)$, we establish new bounds on price dynamics, revealing unexpected effects. Unlike the fully patient case, the bounds of the dynamics for $\delta&lt;1$ depend on the demand curve and undergo a "transition phase". For some $\delta$, the model mirrors the fully patient setting, and for smaller $\delta' &lt; \delta$, it stabilizes at the highest monopolist price, thus collapsing to the impatient case. We provide quantitative bounds and analytical results, showing that the bounds for $\delta=1$ are generally not tight for $\delta&lt;1$, and we give guarantees on the minimum ("admission") price for transactions.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Rounding Functions in Nearest-Neighbor Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.06885v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel evaluation study of the most appropriate round function for nearest-neighbor (NN) image interpolation is presented. Evaluated rounding functions are selected among the five rounding rules defined by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 754-2008 standard. Both full- and no-reference image quality assessment (IQA) metrics are used to study and evaluate the influence of rounding functions on NN interpolation image quality. The concept of achieved occurrences over targeted occurrences is used to determine the percentage of achieved occurrences based on the number of test images used. Inferential statistical analysis is applied to deduce from a small number of images and draw a conclusion of the behavior of each rounding function on a bigger number of images. Under the normal distribution and at the level of confidence equals to 95%, the maximum and minimum achievable occurrences by each evaluated rounding function are both provided based on the inferential analysis-based experiments.</description>

      <title>Communicating with Anecdotes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a communication game between a sender and a receiver. The sender chooses one of her signals about the state of the world (i.e., anecdotes) and communicates to the receiver who takes an action affecting both players. The sender and the receiver both care about the state of the world but are also influenced by personal preferences, so their ideal actions can differ. We characterize perfect Bayesian equilibria. The sender faces a temptation to persuade: she wants to select a biased anecdote to influence the receiver's action. Anecdotes are still informative to the receiver (who will debias at equilibrium) but the attempt to persuade comes at a cost to precision. This gives rise to informational homophily where the receiver prefers to listen to like-minded senders because they provide higher-precision signals. Communication becomes polarized when the sender is an expert with access to many signals, with the sender choosing extreme outlier anecdotes at equilibrium (unless preferences are perfectly aligned). This polarization dissipates all gains from communication with an increasingly well-informed sender when the anecdote distribution is heavy-tailed. Experts can therefore face a curse of informedness: receivers will prefer to listen to less-informed senders who cannot pick biased signals as easily.</description>
