      <title>Noise-induced shallow circuits and absence of barren plateaus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13927</link>

Abstract: Motivated by realistic hardware considerations of the pre-fault-tolerant era, we comprehensively study the impact of uncorrected noise on quantum circuits. We first show that any noise `truncates' most quantum circuits to effectively logarithmic depth, in the task of computing Pauli expectation values. We then prove that quantum circuits under any non-unital noise exhibit lack of barren plateaus for cost functions composed of local observables. But, by leveraging the effective shallowness, we also design a classical algorithm to estimate Pauli expectation values within inverse-polynomial additive error with high probability over the ensemble. Its runtime is independent of circuit depth and it operates in polynomial time in the number of qubits for one-dimensional architectures and quasi-polynomial time for higher-dimensional ones. Taken together, our results showcase that, unless we carefully engineer the circuits to take advantage of the noise, it is unlikely that noisy quantum circuits are preferable over shallow quantum circuits for algorithms that output Pauli expectation value estimates, like many variational quantum machine learning proposals. Moreover, we anticipate that our work could provide valuable insights into the fundamental open question about the complexity of sampling from (possibly non-unital) noisy random circuits.</description>

      <title>Hybridization induced triplet superconductivity with $S^z=0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kitaev superconducting chain is a model of spinless fermions with triplet-like superconductivity. It has raised interest since for some values of its parameters it presents a non-trivial topological phase that host Majorana fermions. The physical realization of a Kitaev chain is complicated by the scarcity of triplet superconductivity in real physical systems. Many proposals have been put forward to overcome this difficulty and fabricate artificial triplet superconducting chains. In this work we study a superconducting chain of spinful fermions forming Cooper pairs, in a triplet $S=1$ state, but with $S^z=0$. The motivation is that such pairing can be induced in chains that couple through an antisymmetric hybridization to an s-wave superconducting substrate. We study the nature of edge states and the topological properties of these chains. In the presence of a magnetic field the chain can sustain gapless superconductivity with pairs of Fermi points. The momentum space topology of these Fermi points is non-trivial, in the sense that they can only disappear by annihilating each other. For small magnetic fields, we find well defined degenerate edge modes with finite Zeemann energy. These modes are not symmetry protected and decay abruptly in the bulk as their energy merges with the continuum of excitations.</description>

      <title>Fractonic Quantum Quench in Dipole-constrained Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13156v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quench dynamics in the dipolar Bose-Hubbard model (DBHM) in one dimension. The boson hopping is constrained by dipole conservation and show fractonic dynamics. The ground states at large Hubbard interaction $U$ are Mott insulators at integer filling and a period-2 charge density wave (CDW) at half-integer filling. We focus on Mott-to-Mott and CDW-to-CDW quenches and find that dipole correlation spreading shows the light-cone behavior with the Lieb-Robinson (LR) velocity proportional to the dipole kinetic energy $J$ and the square of the density in the case of Mott quench at integer filling. Effective model for post-quench dynamics is constructed under the dilute-dipole approximation and fits the numerical results well. For CDW quench we observe a much reduced LR velocity of order $J^2/U$ and additional periodic features in the time direction. The emergence of CDW ground state and the reduced LR velocity at half-integer filling can both be understood by careful application of the second-order perturbation theory. The oscillatory behavior arises from quantum scars in the quadrupole sector of the spectrum and is captured by a PXP-like model that we derive by projecting the DBHM to the quadrupolar sector of the Hilbert space.</description>
