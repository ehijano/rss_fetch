      <title>Mechanical Properties of the Proton from a Deformed AdS Holographic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the gravitational form factors of the proton and some of its mechanical properties. We use a holographic model based on the AdS/CFT correspondence, in which a deformation in the anti-de Sitter background geometry is considered. By describing the proton as a Dirac field in this background, we numerically evaluate the gloun contribution of its gravitational form factors $A$ and $C$ from its energy-momentum tensor. A comparison of our numerical results with respect to some lattice QCD results and previous results in holography is made. In general, a good agreement is found. We also evaluate the term $D$ and make use of it to compute the pressure and shear distributions in the system, which result in a stable composed particle interpretation consistent with the von Laue stability condition. The energy distribution in the system is also obtained. Internal forces are investigated to support this picture. We are also able to compute the radii associated with these distributions in the proton.</description>

      <title>The Intrinsic Dimension of Collider Events and Model-Independent Searches in 100 Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase space of hadron collider events spans hundreds of dimensions, generating an intricate geometry that we are just starting to explore. The number of possible new physics signals is exponential in the number of dimensions and detecting all of them is currently impossible for any human or artificial intelligence. In this work we introduce a method to search for new physics model-independently in this high-dimensional space. It is based on the measurement of the most basic property of the manifold of collider events, its dimensionality. Our proposed technique does not suffer from a look-elsewhere effect that grows exponentially with the number of dimensions of the dataset, and by construction is insensitive to energy scale uncertainties. We illustrate its potential by finding new physics in simulated events with hundreds of phase space dimensions, taking as input single particles rather than jets. This study sets the stage for new model-independent search strategies based on global properties of collider data manifolds.</description>

      <title>Discovery prospects for photophobic axion-like particles in the $WWjj$ final state at the High-Luminosity LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate discovery prospects for photophobic axion-like particles (ALPs) in the $WWjj$ final state at the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC; $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV, $L=3$ ab$^{-1}$). In the photophobic limit ($g_{a\gamma\gamma}=0$), ALPs couple to electroweak gauge bosons and are produced in association with two jets ($pp\to jj a$) via both $s$-channel electroweak exchange and vector-boson-fusion (VBF)-like topologies, followed by $a\to W^+W^-$ decay. We target the different-flavour dilepton mode $W^+W^-\to e^\pm\mu^\mp\nu \bar{\nu}$ with two jets and moderate missing transverse momentum. The analysis employs a two-step strategy: an initial preselection that defines the signal-like final state, followed by a multivariate analysis (MVA) trained on dijet and dileptonic-$WW$ kinematics from both the $s$-channel and VBF-like production mechanisms to separate signal from background; the MVA threshold is optimized independently at each $m_a$. We present $2\sigma$ and $5\sigma$ discovery sensitivities for the ALP-$W$ coupling $g_{aWW}$ across the $170$--$4000$ GeV mass range. For $260$ GeV $\le m_a \le 1500$ GeV, the $2\sigma$ ($5\sigma$) sensitivity is approximately flat around 0.61 (0.76) TeV$^{-1}$. We also report model-independent discovery thresholds for the fiducial quantity $\sigma(pp\to jj a)\,\mathrm{Br}(a\to W^+W^-)$ over the same mass range to enable reinterpretation for other models. These results indicate that the $WWjj$ topology offers competitive and complementary sensitivity to heavy photophobic ALPs at the HL-LHC.</description>

      <title>Exotic-interaction searches on small scales via near-threshold enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exotic interactions between fermions mediated by new bosons beyond the Standard Model may hold the key to several fundamental conundrums on the frontier of physics.However, laboratory searching for exotic interactions on small length scales is fundamentally held back by the short force range.Here we propose that the force range of exotic interactions tends to infinity when the oscillation frequency of exotic interactions approaches the mass of the new bosons, i.e., the new bosons become nearly on-shell. This is named as the near-threshold enhancement. Through the near-threshold enhancement, even fermions at distances larger than the original force range can make considerable contributions to exotic interactions. Therefore, the size of the experimental apparatus can break the limitation of the force range, and thus both the signal of exotic interactions and the sensitivity of sensors can be greatly enhanced. We also propose a method to search for the exotic interactions in the mass range between 80 $\mu$eV and 800 $\mu$eV taking advantage of the near-threshold enhancement. For the coupling $g_{\rm A}^{\rm e}g_{\rm A}^{\rm e}$, we expect an improvement on its upper bounds of 10 orders of magnitude at 800 $\mu$eV. This method can be further extended to enhance the search for other types of exotic interactions and boost the study of new physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Neutral Magnetic Monopole in the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard model has the electroweak monopole which has the magnetic charge $4\pi/e$, as a hybrid between the Dirac and 'tHooft-Polyakov monopoles. We argue that it may have new type of monopoles, in particular the neutral monopole (``the Z monopole") which is electromagnetically neutral but has the neutral magnetic charge $4\pi/\be$, where $\be$ is the neutral charge. The mass of the new monopole could be less than the Cho-Maison monopole, around 3.28 TeV. We show how to construct the neutral monopole and clarify the origin of the topology of the new monopole. We discuss the implications of the new monopoles in physics.</description>

      <title>Exploring muonphilic dark matter with the $Z_2$-even mediator at muon colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Galactic Center GeV Excess (GCE) remains a compelling but enigmatic signal from the inner region of our galaxy. Muonphilic dark matter (DM), which couples exclusively to muons via a new mediator, provides a viable explanation for the GCE and relic density while naturally evading constraints from direct detection, collider searches and other multi-messenger observations. Based on the viable non-resonant parameter space identified in previous global fits, we perform a comprehensive study exploring the prospects for discovering such muonphilic DM in the context of a future $3$ TeV muon collider, focusing on simplified models with a $Z_2$-even mediator. Three distinct search strategies are investigated: visible on-shell mediator decays ($\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\gamma$ final state), invisible on-shell mediator decays (mono-photon plus missing energy), and mono-photon production via off-shell mediators. Through a detailed signal-background analysis using cut-and-count methods, we project the exclusion limits at $95\%$ confidence level for seven representative models across a wide range of mediator masses. Our results demonstrate that the projected limits cover a significant portion of the viable parameter space that explains the GCE, establishing a muon collider as a decisive machine for testing the muonphilic DM hypothesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We estimate the accuracy with which the coefficient of the lepton flavour-violating dimension-six operators can be measured at the proposed electron-proton collider. Cuts-based analysis is performed to compute the signal significance at the centre of mass energy of 1.3 TeV, with a total integrated luminosity upto $\sim$ab$^{-1}$. Using the optimal observables method for the kinematic distributions, we study the sensitivity of the effective couplings. We also study the impact of the initial electron beam polarisation.</description>

      <title>Production of excited $\Lambda_c^+$ baryons through $\Lambda_b$ hadronic weak decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, to establish a more abundant $\Lambda_c$ baryon spectrum, we discuss the production potentials of the excited $\Lambda_c$ baryons through $\Lambda_b$ hadronic weak decays within a constituent quark model. Based on our successful explanations of the existing experimental data for the $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c(\pi^-, K^{-}, D^{-}, D^{-}_s, D_s^{*-})$ processes, we further calculate the decay rates of the $\Lambda_b$ baryon into the $1P$-, $1D$-, $2S$-, $3S$-, $2P$-, $1F$-, and $2D$-wave $\Lambda_c$ excited states. It is found that these $\Lambda_c$ excitations have a large production rate in the $\Lambda_b$ hadronic weak decay process associated $\pi^-$ meson emitting, i.e., $\Lambda_b\to \Lambda_c^{*}\pi^-$, their branching fractions can reach up to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$. To search for the higher $3S$-, $2P$-, $1F$-, and $2D$-wave $\Lambda_c$ states, the $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c (3S) \pi^-\to D^{*0}p \pi^-$, and $\Lambda_b\to \Lambda_c(2P,2D,1F) \pi^-\to D^{(*)0}p\pi^-$ decays are worth observing in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Analysis of the Complex Singlet Model with Phase Transition Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the prospects of probing the Complex Singlet Extension of the Standard Model (CxSM) with gravitational waves from the Electroweak phase transition. The study establishes a connection of the scalar potential parameters, the thermodynamic properties of the phase transition, with the directly measured stochastic gravitational-wave background in the presence of astrophysical background and foreground. Considering the space-based gravitational wave detector Taiji, we construct a frequency-domain likelihood that incorporates instrumental and astrophysical noises, and perform both Fisher-matrix forecasts and Bayesian Nested Sampling analysis. The comparison of these two approaches demonstrates consistent parameter recovery and highlights the sensitivity of Taiji to millihertz gravitational-wave signals. We further propagate the inferred constraints on the gravitational-wave spectrum back to the underlying CxSM parameters, obtaining meaningful limits on the Higgs self-couplings. The results emphasize the complementarity between gravitational-wave observations and collider measurements, showing that future missions such as Taiji can serve as a powerful probe of electroweak-scale new physics and the dynamical origin of the Higgs sector.</description>

      <title>Freeze-in at Low Reheating and Direct Detection of Fermion Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a low-reheating-temperature freeze-in scenario within a minimal model of fermionic dark matter interacting through a pseudoscalar mediator. In this setup, dark matter is produced via the decay of the pseudoscalar, which remains in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model bath. We derive the thermalization and non-thermalization conditions for the new fields and obtain the corresponding direct-detection constraints and projections on the model based on LZ and DARWIN experiments, respectively.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Probes of Lepton Parity Freeze-in Dark Matter: $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ &amp; Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the canonical type-I seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses, a residual symmetry known as lepton parity: $(-1)^L$, remains preserved. Introducing a Majorana fermion $S$ with even lepton parity renders it naturally stable, making it a viable dark matter (DM) candidate. The addition of a lepton parity odd singlet scalar $\sigma$ allows for the coupling $N S \sigma$, where $N$ is the right-handed neutrino. If $S$ is not thermalized, then DM relic can be produced in two distinct ways: (i) for reheating temperature, $T_{\rm rh}&gt;m_{N}$, dominantly through the decay of $N$ ($N\rightarrow S\sigma$), and (ii) for $T_{\rm EW}&lt;T_{\rm rh}\ll m_{N}$, via standard model Higgs ($h$) decay ($h\rightarrow SS$ at one loop). If the $\sigma-h$ quartic coupling is large, then it can lead to a strong first-order electroweak phase transition even if $\langle\sigma\rangle=0$. Alternatively, if $\sigma-h$ coupling is small, then $\sigma$ can freeze out with a larger abundance, and hence its decay ($\sigma\rightarrow S\nu$) at late epochs can give rise to additional relativistic degrees of freedom ($\Delta{N}_{\rm eff}$). Thus, the framework gives a viable DM with mass range varying from MeV to TeV and leaves observable imprints, via gravitational waves and $\Delta{N}_{\rm eff}$, which offer complementary probes, potentially detectable in future gravitational wave and CMB experiments.</description>

      <title>Updated bounds on the (1,2) neutrino oscillation parameters after first JUNO results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the standard $3\nu$ framework, we discuss updated bounds on the leading oscillation parameters related to the $(\nu_1,\,\nu_2)$ states, namely, the squared mass difference $\delta m^2=m^2_2-m^2_1$ and the mixing parameter $\sin^2\theta_{12}$. A previous global analysis of 2024 oscillation data estimated $\delta m^2$ and $\sin^2\theta_{12}$ with fractional $1\sigma$ errors of about $2.3\%$ and $4.5\%$, respectively. First we update the analysis by applying the latest SNO+ constraints, that slightly shift the $(\delta m^2,\,\sin^2\theta_{12})$ best fits. Then we apply the constraints placed by the first JUNO results, that significantly reduce the uncertainties of both parameters. Our updated global bounds (as of 2025) can be summarized as: $\delta m^2/10^{-5}{\rm eV}^2 = 7.48\pm 0.10$ and $\sin^2\theta_{12}=0.3085\pm0.0073$ (with correlation $\rho=-0.20$), corresponding to $1\sigma$ uncertainties as small as $1.3\%$ and $2.4\%$, respectively. We also comment on minor physical and statistical effects that, in the future, may contribute to lift the current mass-ordering degeneracy of $(\delta m^2,\,\theta_{12})$ estimates.</description>

      <title>Locality constraints in AdS$_2$ without parity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study bulk locality constraints in quantum field theories in AdS$_2$. The known derivation of locality sum rules in AdS$_{d+1}$ does not apply for $d=1$ due to the different singularity structure of the conformal blocks and the inequivalence of operator orderings on the boundary. Assuming unitarity and a mild growth condition, we establish power-law bounds for correlators, derive dispersion relations and an expansion in terms of ``even'' and ``odd'' local blocks that converges in the entire AdS$_2$. These yield two novel families of symmetric and antisymmetric locality sum rules. We test these sum rules explicitly in the free scalar field theory.</description>

      <title>Reanalyzing DESI DR1: 2. Constraints on Dark Energy, Spatial Curvature, and Neutrino Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We carry out an independent re-analysis of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) public dataset, focusing on extensions to the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM. Utilizing the dataset and Effective Field Theory (EFT)-based pipeline described in Paper 1, we constrain cosmological models with massive neutrinos ($\Lambda$CDM+$M_\nu$), spatial curvature ($o\Lambda$CDM), dynamical dark energy ($w_0w_a$CDM), and their combinations using the power spectrum and bispectrum of DESI galaxies and quasars. Our work also presents the first measurements of relevant non-minimal cosmological parameters from the combination of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and DESI full-shape (FS) data, which are made possible thanks to carefully chosen priors on EFT parameters. We find that the addition the FS likelihood to DESI's baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data improves the limits on the spatial curvature by a factor of two over the BAO only results, though the improvements are less significant with the CMB data. The dark energy equation of state figure-of-merit increases both with and without the supernovae data (SNe), by $\approx30\%$ and $\approx20\%$ relative to the CMB+BAO and CMB+BAO+SNe results, respectively. Our FS likelihood also yields the strongest CMB-independent constraint on the total neutrino mass $M_\nu&lt;0.32\,{\rm eV}$, with the $30\%$ improvement due to the bispectrum. In combination with the CMB, we find a $14\%$ improvement assuming the $\Lambda$CDM+$M_\nu$ model (yielding $M_\nu&lt;0.059\,{\rm eV}$), but this increases to $22\%$ when using non-minimal backgrounds: $M_\nu&lt;0.097\,{\rm eV}$ in $o\Lambda$CDM+$M_\nu$ and $M_\nu&lt;0.13\,{\rm eV}$ in $w_0w_a$CDM+$M_\nu$. Overall, our work illustrates that robust and substantial gains in constraining power can be obtained by incorporating the FS power spectrum and bispectrum measurements in analyses of non-minimal cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Caustic crossings in giant arcs with extended dark matter objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Caustic-crossing stars observed in giant arcs behind galaxy clusters provide a powerful probe of dark matter substructure. While previous work has focused on point-like lenses such as primordial black holes, we extend this framework to extended dark objects (EDOs), including ultracompact minihalos formed from the collapse of primordial overdensities. We develop an analytic model of microlensing by EDOs embedded in a macrolensing cluster potential and derive the resulting caustics and light curves. Depending on the EDO size relative to the effective Einstein radius, we show that they may generate additional narrow caustics, leading to novel features in the light curve. Applying our framework to the MACS J1149 LS1 ``Icarus'' event, we constrain EDOs with radii up to $10^7 R_\odot$. Our results demonstrate that caustic-crossing events complement galactic microlensing searches, as they can probe EDOs with larger physical size. We discuss the implications for current and future observations, which promise to deliver a statistical sample of caustic transients and correspondingly sharper constraints on dark objects.</description>

      <title>Towards six W-boson amplitude at two loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the planar integrand of the six-leg amplitude of massive W-bosons on the special Coulomb branch of the maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory to two-loop order. We use the six-dimensional supersymmetric spinor-helicity formalism and the generalized unitarity-cut sewing technique to perform this analysis. The thus-found expression corresponds in the massless limit to the six-gluon maximally helicity-violating amplitude. The upshot of the current consideration is that the former is just an uplift of the latter from four to six dimensions. This repeats the pattern found earlier for four- and five-leg amplitudes of massive W-bosons.</description>

      <title>Is there a retrograde accretion disk around 4U 1626$-$67? Tracking torque reversals with a state-space model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray timing studies of the persistent, Galactic, accretion-powered pulsar 4U 1626$-$67 reveal torque reversals, during which the pulse frequency $\nu(t)$ alternates between multiyear episodes of secular acceleration and deceleration, separated by transitions lasting $\lesssim 150 \, \rm{days}$. Here an unscented Kalman filter is applied to track the $\nu(t)$ fluctuations observed in 22.7 years (3340 samples) of publicly available Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory and Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope data to test the canonical picture of magnetocentrifugal accretion for consistency with prograde-prograde and retrograde-prograde accretion disk configurations on either side of the 2008 torque reversal. It is found that the retrograde-prograde model is preferred, with a log Bayes factor equal to 0.44 and maximum a posteriori log likelihood ratio equal to 2.5. The mass accretion rate $Q(t)$ and magnetocentrifugal fastness $\omega(t)$ transition smoothly between episodes of deceleration and acceleration; $Q(t)$ shifts by $\leq 0.34 \, {\rm dex}$ across the reversal, and one measures $\omega(t) \approx 0.25$ and $\omega(t) \approx 0.30$ during deceleration and acceleration, respectively. The angular acceleration $\dot{\Omega}(t)$ satisfies $-9 \lesssim \dot{\Omega}(t)/(10^{-12} \, \rm{rad \, s^{-2}}) \lesssim -5$ and $2 \lesssim \dot{\Omega}(t)/(10^{-12} \, \rm{rad \, s^{-2}}) \lesssim 9$ before and after the 2008 reversal, respectively, compared to $\dot{\Omega} \approx -3.0 \times 10^{-12} \, \rm{rad \, s^{-2}}$ before reversal and $\dot{\Omega} \approx 2.5 \times 10^{-12} \, \rm{rad \, s^{-2}}$ after reversal, as inferred from previous long-term X-ray timing and spectral analysis of 4U 1626$-$67.</description>

      <title>Oscillations of dark matter halos in galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Baryonic matter and dark matter in galaxies represent two substances linked by the gravitational interaction. Collisions of galaxies may create an offset between the centers of mass of these two components. Ignoring internal dynamics of particles in the dark matter halo and Keplerian rotations of stars in the galaxy, we focus on possible relative oscillations of the visible matter in the dark matter halo. This two-fluid model is somewhat similar to the ``giant dipole resonances'' in nuclei. We estimate possible amplitude and frequency of such oscillations assuming that the offset of the centers of mass is small as compared with the size of the galaxy. Such oscillations, if exist, should manifest themselves in anomalies of velocities of stars in the galaxy, such as the density waves and runaway stars which have orbit periods in resonance with oscillations. These matter -- dark matter oscillations may affect direction and magnitude of the dark matter wind coming to Earth.</description>

      <title>Deuteron yields near the QCD phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of QCD phase transition and critical fluctuations of the critical end point (CEP) on the deuteron yield within the functional renormalization group (fRG) approach, by using the nucleon coalescence model and a low energy effective field theory of quarks and mesons. It is found that the two-point baryon density correlation function is enhanced in a narrow region radiated from the CEP along the phase boundary. The deuteron yield arising from the two-point baryon correlation is small compared to the leading-order contribution, which is attributed to the fact that in the regime of low collision energy, i.e., the region of large baryon chemical potential, the freeze-out curves deviate from the critical region, resulting in that the enhancement of the deuteron yield stemming from the critical fluctuations near the CEP is mild.</description>

      <title>A Bottom-Up EFT Approach To Superdense Baryonic Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How to arrive at the densest matter in massive compact stars starting from Walecka's linear $\omega$-$\sigma$ mean-field model is described in a series of arguments anchored on hidden local symmetry, hidden scale symmetry and emergent parity-doublet symmetry. I follow the bottom-up approach from chiral symmetry with pions, coupled to hidden local and scale symmetry degrees of freedom. Exploiting the renormalization-group treatment \`a la Shankar and Polchinski of the fermionic interactions on the Fermi sphere, leading to Landau-Migdal Fermi-liquid, one obtains a sort of generalized ``Density Functional" that allows via a topology change hadrons transform to quarks without phase changes at the center of massive stars. The highly dense matter is ``pseudo-conformal" with the sound velocity $v_{pcs}^2/c^2\approx 1/3$ but the trace of the energy-momentum tensor is not equal to zero, hence the matter is non-conformal.</description>

      <title>Weak gravity at micron scales from dark bubble cosmology and its cosmological consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dark bubble model makes a positive cosmological constant natural in string theory, and predicts several new physical phenomena within reach in the near future. In this paper we study the experimental consequences of the model for the strength of gravity at scales of order $10^{-5}$m. Contrary to other models of gravity involving extra dimensions, the dark bubble model predicts gravity to become weaker rather than stronger at small scales, compared to Newtonian gravity. In particular, we provide explicit predictions of measurable deviations using table top experiments. We also show how the same effect reduces the effective force of gravity at high energy densities in cosmology, leading to a period of early inflation without the need for anything beyond radiation. We also discuss the quantum origin of the universe with a 5D black hole acting as a catalyst for the nucleation of the dark bubble and how it accounts for the present matter content in the universe. This leads to a prediction of $\Omega_c \approx 5\times 10^{-4}$ for a positive curvature of the universe, suggesting an explanation of the why-now-problem of the cosmological constant. We end by speculating on how to incorporate AdS black shells as black hole mimickers within the dark bubble model.</description>

      <title>Friction in Stochastic Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve time-reversed stochastic inflation in the semi-infinite flat potential with a constant drift term and derive an exact expression for the probability distribution of the curvature fluctuations. It exhibits exponential decaying tails which contrast to the Levy-like power law behaviour encountered without friction. Such a non-vanishing drift acts as a regulator for the conventional ``forward'' stochastic $\delta N$-formalism, which is otherwise ill-defined in the unbounded and flat potentials typical of plateau models of inflation. This setup therefore allows us to compare the curvature distribution derived from both approaches, reverse and forward in time. Up to similar exponential tails, we find quantitative differences. In particular, in the classical-like limit of very large drift, the tails become Gaussian but only in the time-reversed picture. As a toy model of eternal inflation, we finally discuss the case of negative drift in which inflation never ends for many field trajectories. The forward approach becomes pathological whereas the reverse formalism gives back a finite curvature distribution with always exponential tails. All these differences end up being related to the very definition of the background which is ambiguous when a classical trajectory does not exist.</description>

Abstract: The Fourier transform of two-point momentum-space Feynman integrals with massless propagators and two off-shell legs can be used to prove identities between their periods, exemplified by the glue-and-cut identity. We generalize this framework to massless momentum-space Feynman integrals with three off-shell legs and obtain a similar family of identities that can be used to calculate these integrals, especially for a non-planar subset of them, which naturally arise in the off-shell Sudakov form factors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the emergence of a Yang-Mills symmetry in theories with massless spin 1 particles from fundamental physical properties of scattering amplitudes. In the standard proofs, some symmetry and reality properties of the coupling constants in three-point amplitudes are assumed. These properties cannot be justified using only three-point amplitudes but we show that they arise as consequences of the consistent factorization of four-particle amplitudes, for particular choices of the particle basis. This applies to self-interactions of massless spin 1 particles and also to their interactions with spin 0 and 1/2 particles. CP invariance is a derived property, not an additional assumption. The situation for gravity interactions is analogous and it is dealt with in the same fashion.</description>

      <title>Axion Constraints from White Dwarf Cooling in 47 Tucanae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the cooling of white dwarfs in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae to look for evidence of axion emission affecting the rate of white dwarf cooling. If axions exist and couple to electrons, then axions could be produced at an appreciable rate in the electron-degenerate core of a white dwarf through axion bremsstrahlung from electrons. The emission of these axions would provide an additional cooling mechanism for white dwarfs that would affect the cooling rate, and hints of axions have been suggested based on observations of anomalous cooling reported for white dwarfs in the Galactic disc and halo. We performed stellar evolution simulations of white dwarf cooling that accounted for the additional energy loss due to axion bremsstrahlung from electrons, producing a suite of white dwarf cooling models for different values of the axion-electron coupling constant, as well as the white dwarf mass and envelope thickness. These cooling models are compared to observations of white dwarfs in 47 Tucanae from the Hubble Space Telescope through an unbinned likelihood analysis. The optimal model found by this analysis corresponds to the case of no axion emission with a thick white dwarf envelope, and we find a new bound on the axion-electron coupling of $g_{aee} \leq 0.81 \times 10^{-13}$ at 95% confidence level. This improves upon the previous white dwarf cooling bound for this coupling and excludes the range of values favoured by the axion hints from the anomalous cooling of Galactic white dwarfs.</description>

Abstract: The cosmic time dependencies of $G$, $\alpha$, $\hbar$ and of Standard Model parameters like the Higgs vev and elementary particle masses are studied in the framework of a new dark energy interpretation. Due to the associated time variation of rulers, many effects turn out to be invisible. However, a rather large time dependence is claimed to arise in association with dark energy measurements, and smaller ones in connection with the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Theoretical and Experimental Constraints on $\mathbb{Z}_{2n}$ Multi-Component Dark Matter Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19489v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A complete assessment of any dark matter model requires confronting its low-energy phenomenology with its high-scale theoretical viability. We undertake such a dual analysis for a class of two-component scalar dark matter models stabilized by $\mathbb{Z}_{2n}$ symmetries, specifically the $\mathbb{Z}_4$, $\mathbb{Z}_6(23)$, and $\mathbb{Z}_6(13)$ frameworks. Each model is tested against the latest observational data, including the Planck relic abundance and stringent direct detection limits from the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment. Simultaneously, we evaluate their theoretical integrity up to the GUT and Planck scales by enforcing vacuum stability and perturbative unitarity with one-loop Renormalization Group Equations. This combined approach reveals a rich and varied landscape of possibilities. We demonstrate that the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ model offers a broadly viable parameter space sustained by efficient semi-annihilation. In stark contrast, the $\mathbb{Z}_6(13)$ scenario is shown to be highly fine-tuned, with solutions confined to the Higgs resonance. Our most significant finding concerns the $\mathbb{Z}_6(23)$ model: we show that an apparent conflict between experimental data and high-scale consistency is resolved when the model is viewed as an effective field theory, yielding a concrete prediction for new physics at or below the $10^6$ GeV scale. This work provides a definitive guide to the viability of these $\mathbb{Z}_{2n}$ scenarios and serves as a compelling demonstration of how high-energy consistency checks can yield crucial insights into the nature of dark matter.</description>

Abstract: We consider an abelian extension of the Standard Model (SM) comprising a new gauge group $U(1)^\prime$, with the neutral gauge boson $Z^\prime$ having flavour violating couplings to quarks and leptons. The fermion content is the same as in SM except for the addition of three right-handed neutrinos. The model, proposed in \cite{Aebischer:2019blw}, describes the couplings of $Z^\prime$ to fermions in terms of three rational parameters $\epsilon_{1,2,3}$ that sum to zero imposing the cancellation of the gauge anomalies. Each $\epsilon_i$ is common to all fermions in a generation, a feature producing correlations among quark and lepton observables. We focus on $b \to s \ell_1^- \ell_2^+$ transitions for the lepton flavour conserving $\ell_1=\ell_2$ and lepton flavour violating case $\ell_1 \neq \ell_2$. Small deviations with respect to the SM predictions are found in the first case, which reflects a feature of the model where quark and lepton sectors prevent each other to manifest large discrepancies with respect to SM. We investigate the correlations between rare $B$ and $B_s$ decays and the leptonic processes $\tau^- \to \mu^- \mu^+ \mu^-$, $\mu^- \to e^- \gamma$, $\mu^- \to e^- e^+ e^-$ and the $ \mu^- \to e^-$ conversion in nuclei. We show that the current experimental upper bounds on these four channels play an increasingly important role in constraining the branching fractions of lepton flavour violating $B$ and $B_s$ decays. While the present bound on $\tau^- \to \mu^- \mu^+ \mu^-$ does not impose significant restrictions, the other three modes set progressively more stringent limits, an important information for the planned new experimental facilities.</description>

      <title>Investigating New Physics through the Observables of Semileptonic $B_{s}\to K^{\ast}(\to K \pi)\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ Decay</title>

Abstract: The rare four-fold decay $B_s \to K^*(\to K\pi)\mu^+\mu^- $, governed by the flavor-changing neutral current transition $b \to d\mu^+\mu^-$, provides a sensitive probe for testing the Standard Model (SM) and investigating signatures of new physics (NP). This work presents a comprehensive model-independent analysis of the decay using the framework of the weak effective field theory. We compute a set of key physical observables, including the differential branching ratio, forward-backward asymmetry, longitudinal polarization fraction, and several normalized angular coefficients $\langle I_i\rangle$, as a function of the dilepton invariant mass squared $q^2$. The impact of NP is explored via both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) scenarios involving NP Wilson coefficients $C_7^{\text{NP}}$, $C_9^{(\prime)\text{NP}}$, and $C_{10}^{(\prime)\text{NP}}$. Our findings reveal notable deviations from the SM predictions across multiple observables. Furthermore, we analyze the correlations between different observables and their 2D contour plots which would be useful to further constrain the parametric space of possible NP contributions. This study reinforces the potential of $B_s \to K^* \mu^+ \mu^-$ decay as a complementary channel in the search for physics beyond the SM.</description>

      <title>Collins function for pion-in-jet production in polarized $pp$ collisions: a test of universality and factorization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21959v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an updated study of the Collins azimuthal asymmetries for pion-in-jet production in polarized $pp$ collisions. To this aim, we employ a recent extraction of the transversity and Collins fragmentation functions from semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering and $e^+ e^-$ annihilation into hadron pairs processes, obtained within a simplified transverse momentum dependent (TMD) approach at leading order in the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$. In the present case we adopt a collinear configuration for the initial state, keeping transverse momentum effects only in the fragmentation mechanism. Our theoretical estimates, when compared against 200~GeV and 510~GeV data from the STAR Collaboration, show a generally good agreement for the distributions in the transverse momentum of the jet, the pion longitudinal momentum fraction and its transverse momentum with respect to the jet direction. While not being a proof, due the assumptions and limitations behind the entire approach, these findings corroborate the hypothesis of TMD factorization for such processes as well as of the universality of the Collins function and, once again, of a reduced impact of the proper TMD evolution on azimuthal asymmetries.
  We will also present predictions based on an extraction of the Collins and transversity distributions where information from data on single spin asymmetry for inclusive pion production in $p^\uparrow p$ collisions is included through a Bayesian reweighting procedure.</description>

      <title>Meson-Exchange Currents in Quasielastic Charged-Current Neutrino Reactions with Single-Nucleon Knockout</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effect of meson-exchange currents on charged-current quasielastic neutrino scattering with single-nucleon emission is computed and analyzed within the relativistic Fermi gas model. This contribution arises primarily from the interference between one-body and two-body currents, where the two-body operator excites a 1p1h state in the presence of a second, spectator nucleon. The results obtained show a reduction of the vector, axial and vector-axial transverse response functions and, consequently, a decrease in the total neutrino cross section. In addition to a comparison with the non-relativistic limit, other models are also explored, such as the relativistic mean field model for nuclear matter and the superscaling analysis with relativistic effective mass, both of which yield qualitatively similar results.</description>

      <title>$Z_4$ scotogenic model with a Higgs portal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18713v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new Scotogenic type model based on a global $Z_4$ symmetry involving dark matter candidates. After the symmetry breaking as $Z_4$ to $Z_2$ via the singlet scalar vacuum expectation value (VEV), the lightest Majorana fermion works as a viable thermal freeze-out dark matter (DM) candidate, and the mass terms for active neutrinos are generated as a finite quantum correction at the 1-loop level. A key point of realising our Scotogenic structure is to introduce two types of Majorana fermions (heavy right-handed neutrinos) and inert Higgs doublets with opposite $Z_4$ parities. Since a large VEV for the singlet scalar is not so harmful in an appropriate realisation of the Higgs mechanism for the SM gauge symmetry, we can naturally realise a TeV-scale fermionic DM candidate, where constraints via direct detection experiments are less than those for sub-TeV DM. Our scenario involves the Higgs-portal DM interactions, which help the realisation of the correct DM relic abundance. Relying on the structure of the model, it is possible to find a natural partner for coannihilation. Our scenario can be investigated via the measurement of the Higgs trilinear self-coupling at the Large Hadron Collider. The simplest way to evade the domain-wall problem by adding a tiny soft $Z_2$ breaking term works, keeping a sufficient longevity of the decaying DM lifetime.</description>

Abstract: The evolution of neutrinos in a fluctuating classical axion-like particles (ALPs) field is investigated. The equation for the neutrino density matrix is obtained in the Redfield form, and the corresponding dissipative matrix is derived. Estimates on the correlation time of the ALPs field fluctuations and on the ALP-neutrino coupling constants are obtained using the limits on the decoherence parameter determined from the analysis of reactor neutrino experiments data.</description>

      <title>More Effective RS Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we derive the effective theory for a stabilized five-dimensional warped geometry, addressing several outstanding issues in this derivation. These include allowing for a non-zero 4d cosmological constant, accounting for constraints from both the UV and IR branes, and determining how the stabilized theory responds to an energy perturbation on each brane. We show how a consistent low-energy effective theory from a stable warped solution must respect a constraint that follows from the higher-dimensional Einstein equation. Satisfying the constraint requires that the 4d cosmological constant must be the same everywhere throughout the bulk, which means the stabilizing fields must adjust to allow for the same 4d curvature everywhere in the extra dimension. We show explicitly how this works in a 5d model, and how the correct 4d effective potential reproduces this behavior. We find that the cosmological constant generated from adding energy to one of the branes is unaffected by the details of the stabilization mechanism at leading order, despite the need for the stabilizing fields to adjust. In anticipation of a companion paper, we also briefly discuss how supersymmetry can be realized consistently in the 5d theory. In particular, we show how the stabilization mechanism remains consistent with sequestering, even as the supersymmetry-breaking energy is reflected in the stabilizing field throughout the bulk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The QCD axion can successfully solve the strong CP problem under the condition that the Peccei-Quinn symmetry is respected to extremely high standard. We explore a class of gauge theories that accommodate a high-quality axion, known as the Barr-Seckel models, paying special attention to the cosmology of topological defects. In models with domain wall number equal to unity, we show that axion strings with winding number larger than one can always be decomposed into a number of unit-winding axion strings and pure gauge strings. This mechanism enables the axion string-wall network to be destroyed timely to render a viable cosmology. The subsequent decay of gauge strings into gravitational waves generically produces a double-plateau in frequency space allowing the mechanism to be tested by upcoming experiments.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to superallowed beta decays at $\mathcal O(\alpha^2 Z)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute $\mathcal O(\alpha^2 Z)$ radiative corrections to superallowed $\beta$ decays with a heavy-particle effective field theory that systematically describes the interactions of low-energy ultrasoft photons with nuclei. We calculate two-loop virtual and one-loop real-virtual amplitudes by reducing the Feynman integrals to a set of master integrals, which we solve analytically using a variety of techniques. These techniques can be applied to other phenomenologically interesting observables. The ultrasoft corrections can then be combined with contributions arising from the exchange of potential photons to obtain the complete $\mathcal O(\alpha^2 Z)$ correction to the decay rate, with resummation of large logarithms of the electron energy times the nuclear radius. We find that $\mathcal O(\alpha^2 Z)$ ultrasoft loops induce a relative correction to the decay rate that ranges from $0.7 \cdot 10^{-3}$ in the decay of $^{10}$C to $3.6 \cdot 10^{-3}$ in the decay of $^{54}$Co, and will thus impact the extraction of $V_{ud}$ at the permille level. We show that the inclusion of these corrections reduces the residual renormalization scale dependence of the decay rate to a negligible level, making missing ultrasoft perturbative corrections a subdominant source of theoretical error.</description>

      <title>Flavor blocking of dark matter thermalization in neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) provide exceptional laboratories for probing dark matter (DM) interactions beyond the reach of terrestrial experiments. We investigate a scenario in which DM couples to electrons and muons through a lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) coupling. In the strong gravitational field of NSs, infalling DM attains semi-relativistic velocities that activate inelastic transitions $\chi e \leftrightarrow \chi \mu$, leading to efficient energy deposition through scattering and annihilation. We show that this latter heating mechanism remains efficient even for $p$-wave suppressed annihilations. This is due to \textsl{flavor blocking} of DM thermalization with the NS, as LFV interactions become forbidden for low kinetic energies of $\chi$. The resulting DM-induced heating can sustain NS surface temperatures of $T_s \gtrsim 2 \times 10^3~\mathrm{K}$, providing an observable signature for future infrared searches. This establishes NS heating as a powerful probe of flavor-violating DM portals, capable of probing thermal targets beyond the reach of direct, indirect, and accelerator-based searches, as we illustrate for the axion-like particle (ALP) mediator.</description>

      <title>Is the large uncertainty of $\delta_{CP}$ fundamentally encoded in the neutrino quantum state?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precise measurement of the leptonic CP-violating phase $\delta_{CP}$ remains one of the major open challenges in neutrino physics, as current experiments achieve only very limited accuracy. We address this issue through the lens of quantum estimation theory. A distinctive feature of neutrino oscillation experiments is that they cannot freely optimize the probe or measurement, since both are constrained by the production and detection of flavor eigenstates. We therefore examine whether the large uncertainty in $\delta_{CP}$ originates from intrinsic reasons, either of the neutrino quantum state or of flavor measurements, or if it instead stems from experimental limitations. By comparing quantum and classical Fisher information, we demonstrate that the limited sensitivity to $\delta_{CP}$ originates primarily from the information content of flavor measurements. Furthermore, we show that targeting the second oscillation maximum, as in the ESS$\nu$SB proposal, substantially enhances $\delta_{CP}$ information compared to experiments centered on the first maximum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17621v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using an extended Polyakov-looped Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model to describe the baryon density fluctuations of quark matter along the isentropic trajectories corresponding to different $s/\rho_B$ values extracted from Au+Au collisions at energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7-200$ GeV, we investigate the effects of the first-order phase transition on the light nucleus yield ratio $N_t \times N_p/N_d^2$. The results indicate that the second-order scaled density moment $y_2$, used to quantify density fluctuations, rapidly increases to form a peak when the isentropic trajectories pass through the phase coexistence region. We extract the yield ratios $N_t\times N_p/N_d^2$ at chemical freeze-out from the isentropic trajectories at different collision energies and found significant enhancements at 19.6 GeV and 27 GeV. This is similar to the trends observed by the STAR experiment, suggesting that the enhancements in the yield ratios $N_t\times N_p/N_d^2$ observed in the STAR experiment could be explained by the density fluctuations generated in the first-order phase transition region.</description>

      <title>Violation of non-Abelian Bianchi identity and QCD topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13434v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When Abelian monopoles due to violation of the non-Abelian Bianchi identity J{\mu}(x) condense in the vacuum, color confinement of QCD is realized by the Abelian dual Meissner effect. Moreover VNABI affects also topological features of QCD drastically. Firstly, self-dual instantons can not be a classical solution of QCD. Secondly, the topological charge density is not expressed by a total derivative of the Chern-Simons density K{\mu}(x), but has an additional term L(x)=2Tr(J{\mu}(x)A{\mu}(x)). Thirdly, the axial U(1) anomaly is similarly modified, while keeping the Atiyah-Singer index theorem unchanged. However, unless the integrated additional term \chi=(g^2/16\pi^2)\int d^4xL(x) is not zero, these modified relations are not compatible with gauge invariance. The additional term \chi is evaluated in the framework of Monte-Carlo simulations on SU(2) lattices in details with partial gauge fixings such as the Maximal Center gauge (MCG). The term \chi is largely fluctuating around zero before the gradient flow and tends to vanish after small gradient flow time (\tau). The bosonic definition of the topological charge Q_t and its Abelian counterpart Q_a written by Abelian field strengths are measured also on the lattices. When \chi is zero, Q_a=3Q_t is expected theoretically, but a simple lattice definition of Q_a is fluctuating between -2 and -3 in MCG, when Q_t is stabilized around -1.</description>

      <title>Long-time soliton dynamics via a coarse-grained space-time method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12286v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the long-time dynamics of the Sine-Gordon (SG) model under a class of perturbations whose quantum field theoretic analog - via bosonization - corresponds to the massive Schwinger model describing 1+1D relativistic QED of Dirac fermions. Classical SG solutions offer critical insight into non-perturbative effects in this quantum theory, but capturing their long-time behavior poses significant numerical challenges. To address this, we extend a coarse-graining method to spacetime using a dual-mesh construction based on the Minkowski-metric. We first validate the approach against the well-studied variant of the SG model describing magnetic fluxon dynamics in Josephson transmission lines (JTLs), where analytical and numerical benchmarks exist. We then apply the method to the Schwinger-inspired SG model and uncover long-lived bound states - "Schwinger atoms" - in which a soliton is trapped by a fixed central charge. In certain regimes, the system exhibits limit cycles that give rise to positronium-like states of oppositely charged solitons, while in others such formation is suppressed. Accessing such long-time solutions requires a rigorous implementation of outgoing boundary conditions on a finite computational domain that provide radiative dissipation to allow relaxation toward states that exist only in an infinite domain. Here we provide such a construction. Our results also suggest the possibility of analog quantum simulation of relativistic quantum field theories with JTLs. These results demonstrate the utility of spatio-temporal coarse-graining methodology for probing non-perturbative structure formation in non-linear field theories.</description>

Abstract: Cosmic inflation may exhibit stochastic periods during which quantum fluctuations dominate over the semi-classical evolution. Extracting observables in these regimes is a notoriously difficult program as quantum randomness makes them fully probabilistic. However, among all the possible quantum histories, the ones which are relevant for Cosmology are conditioned by the requirement that stochastic inflation ended. From an observational point of view, it would be more convenient to model stochastic periods as starting from the time at which they ended and evolving backwards in times. We present a time-reversed approach to stochastic inflation, based on a reverse Fokker-Planck equation, which allows us to derive non-perturbatively the probability distribution of the field values at a given time before the end of the quantum regime. As a motivated example, we solve the flat semi-infinite potential and derive a new and exact formula for the probability distribution of the quantum-generated curvature fluctuations. It is normalisable while exhibiting tails slowly decaying as a Levy distribution. Our reverse-time stochastic formalism could be applied to any inflationary potentials and quantum diffusion eras, including the ones that can lead to the formation of primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>A Continuous Galactic Line Source of Axions: The Remarkable Case of 23Na</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that $^{23}$Na is a potentially significant source of galactic axions. For temperatures $\gtrsim 7 \times 10^8$K -- characteristic of carbon burning in the massive progenitors of supernovae and ONeMg white dwarfs -- the 440 keV first excited state of $^{23}$Na is thermally populated, with its repeated decays pumping stellar energy into escaping axions. Odd-A nuclear abundances are typically very low in high-temperature stellar environments (or absent entirely due to burn-up). $^{23}$Na is an exception: $\approx 0.1 M_\odot$ of the isotope is synthesized during carbon burning then maintained at $\approx 10^9$K for times ranging up to $6 \times 10^4$y. Using MESA simulations, a galactic model, and sampling over progenitor masses, locations, and evolutionary stages, we find a continuous flux at earth of $\langle \phi_a \rangle \approx 22$/cm$^2$s for $g^\mathrm{eff}_{aNN} = 10^{-9}$. Some fraction of these axions convert to photons as they propagate through the galactic magnetic field, producing a distinctive 440 keV line $\gamma$ ray detectable by all-sky detectors like the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI). Assuming a 1$\mu$G galactic magnetic field and a sufficiently light axion mass, we find that COSI will be able to probe $| g_{aNN}^\mathrm{eff} g_{a \gamma \gamma} | \gtrsim1.8 \times 10^{-22}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at $3\sigma$ after two years of surveying.</description>

      <title>Insights in $f(Q)$ cosmology: the relevance of the connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03506v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the role of the affine connection in $f(Q)$ gravity, a modified theory where gravity is governed by non-metricity within the symmetric teleparallel framework. Although the connection is constrained to be flat and torsionless, it is not uniquely determined by the metric, allowing for multiple physically distinct formulations. We analyze three such connections compatible with a homogeneous and isotropic universe to show that they yield markedly different cosmological dynamics, even under the same functional form of $f(Q)$. Using both analytical and numerical methods, including a Born-Infeld type model of $f(Q)$, we demonstrate that specific connections can resolve cosmological singularities like the Big Bang and Big Rip, replacing them with smooth de Sitter phases. Others retain singularities but with notable modifications in their behavior. These findings highlight the physical relevance of connection choice in $f(Q)$ gravity and its potential to address fundamental cosmological questions.</description>

      <title>Qumode Tensor Networks for False Vacuum Decay in Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: False vacuum decay in scalar quantum field theory (QFT) is a cornerstone of early Universe cosmology and high energy physics, yet its real-time dynamics is essentially inaccessible to classical computation due to its non-perturbative, highly entangled dynamics. We introduce a general Hamiltonian framework for simulating full interacting QFTs, using a spatial lattice of continuos-variable ``qumodes'' -- bosonic local oscillators whose high-dimensional local Hilbert space faithfully captures interacting field dynamics. This construction is rooted in continuous-variable quantum computing (CVQC), and provides a unified platform spanning efficient classical tensor-network methods and emerging photonic quantum hardware. The first key advance of this work is a robust and scaleable method for preparing the QFT in its correct initial vacuum state. We develop an imaginary-time preparation algorithm tailored to qumode lattices, that efficiently projects onto the vacuum even in strongly coupled regimes. This provides a controllable starting point for studying nonperturbative dynamics such as tunnelling and real-time decay. Building on this, we use a time-evolving block decimation algorithm to capture the real-time dynamics of the scalar field. Our second key advance is the identification and excitation of the negative fluctuation mode of the bounce configuration on the qumode lattice. A small displacement along this mode produces the expected tachyonic growth, driving fully coherent bubble nucleation without requiring classically supercritical seeds. This demonstrates that the qumode lattice captures non-perturbative quantum dynamics that lie beyond the classical treatments. Our results establish the qumode network as a scalable framework for non-equilibrium scalar QFT phenomena and pave the way for higher-dimensional studies and continuous-variable quantum computing implementations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an algorithm for the solution of a large system of radial Schr\"odinger equations for scattering states. The system of differential equations is approximated as an ordinary linear nonhomogeneous system using the finite difference method. Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed at the origin and at an arbitrary large radius. The $K$-matrix for physical energies is calculated from the numerical solutions of the system by comparison to the analytical real solutions at large distances. Scattering poles and amplitudes are calculated from the physical $K$-matrix.</description>

      <title>Effects of Lorentz invariance violation on charged particles and photon production in astrophysical sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06766v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) on radiation processes in astrophysical sources, focusing on synchrotron and inverse Compton interactions. We derive modified expressions for radiated power and photon energy under LIV assumptions and incorporate them into first-order Fermi acceleration models. Our analysis reveals energy thresholds beyond which LIV, within a kinematic framework, significantly alters particle dynamics and photon spectra, introducing non-physical divergences that highlight limitations in perturbative approaches. We model synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission in the presence of LIV and assess its consequences for photon fluxes from blazars, including Markarian 501 and the BL Lac population. LIV introduces distinct high-energy emission regions that deviate from standard expectations. Comparisons with observational data, particularly upper limits from the Pierre Auger Observatory, suggest that future multi-messenger observations, together with the full analysis of particle's trajectories, could constrain LIV parameters through the non-detection of such excesses.</description>

      <title>Testing the cosmic distance duality relation with baryon acoustic oscillations and supernovae data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most fundamental relationships in modern cosmology is the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR), which describes the relationship between the angular diameter distance ($D_{\rm A}$) and the luminosity distance ($D_{\rm L}$), and is expressed as: $\eta(z)=D_{\rm L}(z)(1+z)^{-2}/D_{\rm A}(z)=1$. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive test of the CDDR by combining baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the SDSS and DESI surveys with type Ia supernova (SN) data from PantheonPlus and DESY5. We utilize an artificial neural network approach to match the SN and BAO data at the same redshift. To explore potential violations of the CDDR, we consider three different parameterizations: (i) $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0z$; (ii) $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0z/(1+z)$; (iii) $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0\ln(1+z)$. Our results indicate that the calibration of the SN absolute magnitude $M_{\rm B}$ plays a crucial role in testing potential deviations from the CDDR, as there exists a significant negative correlation between $\eta_0$ and $M_{\rm B}$. For PantheonPlus analysis, when $M_{\rm B}$ is treated as a free parameter, no evidence of CDDR violation is found. In contrast, fixing $M_{\rm B}$ to the $M_{\rm B}^{\rm D20}$ prior with $-19.230\pm0.040$ mag leads to a deviation at approximately the $2\sigma$ level, while fixing $M_{\rm B}$ to the $M_{\rm B}^{\rm B23}$ prior with $-19.396\pm0.016$ mag remains in agreement with the CDDR. Furthermore, overall analyses based on the SDSS+DESY5 and DESI+DESY5 data consistently show no evidence of the deviation from the CDDR.</description>

      <title>Long-Range $N-J/\psi$ Interaction from an Operator Product Expansion Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04980v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent lattice QCD study has shown that the $N-J/\psi$ potential is attractive at all distances, and its long-range tail is well described by two-pion exchange. Here, we study to what extent the long-range part of the attraction can be reproduced from the perspective of the operator product expansion (OPE). This is accomplished by extracting the leading-order four-quark operator that couples to two pions and calculating its contribution to the $J/\psi$ mass in nuclear matter, to linear order in density, within the QCD sum rule framework. Using previous estimates of the four-quark operators for the chiral symmetric and breaking parts, we obtain a mass decrease that is smaller in magnitude but qualitatively consistent with the attraction obtained in the lattice QCD calculation. By expressing the interaction in terms of four-quark operators, we can analyze the effects of chiral symmetry restoration in dense matter on the masses of the $J/\psi$ and other mesons composed of heavy quarks.</description>

Abstract: Supersymmetric models in singular extra dimensional spaces feature prominently in many interesting phenomenological models, including those derived from string theory. In this paper we explicitly derive the low energy theory of phenomenologically viable supersymmetric theories in five dimensions, and highlight several aspects of these models that are not obvious from working solely in the 4d effective theory. Important deviations arise for anomaly mediation, which is purported to be a predictive mechanism to mediate supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking that is naturally most relevant in extra dimensional theories. Despite this, most analyses of anomaly mediation have been performed in the 4d effective theory. We fill this gap in the literature by constructing stabilized supersymmetric theories in 5d and studying supersymmetry breaking and anomaly mediation. Studying Sequestered Conformal Anomaly-Mediated (SCAM) in full generality reveals important deviations from the 4d EFT expectations, particularly for the role of boundary superpotentials, the radion and the predicted universality of anomaly mediation. We discuss the requirements for viable extra dimensional models of SUSY-breaking, and demonstrate when and how the anomaly-mediated masses in 5d reduce to the na{\i}ve 4d supersymmetric result. In many cases supersymmetry is necessarily broken at the 5d level, leading to anomaly-mediated and other supersymmetry breaking masses that are not derivable in a simple supersymmetric 4d EFT, but need to be included as matching corrections. We comment on the potential implications of our methods for phenomenology and singular higher-dimensional constructions, such as the KKLT scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermal plasma induces a plasmon-like mass shift for gravitational perturbations, which can modify their dynamics near the horizon scale in the early radiation-dominated universe. However, there are several seemingly reasonable ways to introduce this mass shift, reflecting an ambiguity in how one specifies the initial plasma state on a perturbed FLRW background. Invariance under small diffeomorphisms and Weyl rescalings singles out the (grand) canonical ensemble defined in the decoupling limit of gravitational interactions, while excluding ensembles that violate the Weyl identity, including those perturbed by the metric. Large diffeomorphisms further require the mass shift to vanish in the infrared limit. With this consistent choice, primordial tensor modes exhibit stable damping, in agreement with Weinberg's kinetic theory analysis. This cosmological example indicates a more general picture in which local equilibrium in thermal quantum field theory is not an external input but an emergent, dynamical notion.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions with qubits and qumodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a hybrid qubit-qumode framework for simulating quantum electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions. In this approach, fermionic matter fields are represented by qubits, while U(1) gauge fields are encoded in continuous-variable bosonic modes whose canonical quadratures capture the electric and vector-potential components of the theory. To reconcile the non-compact phase space of the qumodes with the compact U(1) gauge symmetry, we introduce and compare two complementary constraint-enforcement strategies: (i) a squeezing-based projection that confines qumode states to the unit circle through an effective modification of the inner product, and (ii) a method that dynamically enforces compactness via a penalty Hamiltonian term. We construct the corresponding hybrid Hamiltonian, derive its decomposition into experimentally accessible qubit-qumode gates, and analyze its spectrum in the analytically tractable single-plaquette limit. The hybrid formulation reproduces the correct gauge-invariant dynamics and provides a scalable route toward simulating Abelian lattice gauge theories coupled to fermionic matter on near-term hybrid quantum architectures. Ground-state preparation and convergence are demonstrated using a continuous-variable extension of the Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE) algorithm, establishing a general framework for hybrid discrete-continuous quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories.</description>
