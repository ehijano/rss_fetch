      <title>Vacancy Engineering in Metals and Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vacancy engineering, the intentional control of atomic-scale vacancies in metals and alloys, is emerging as a powerful yet underexplored strategy for tailoring microstructures and optimizing performance across diverse applications. By enabling excess vacancy populations through quenching, severe deformation, thermomechanical treatments, or additive manufacturing, new microstructures can be obtained that achieve unique combinations of strength, ductility, fatigue life, corrosion resistance, and conductivity. Vacancies are distinct among lattice defects: they are non-conserved entities essential for solute diffusion, yet variably coupled to solutes, dislocations, and phase boundaries. They can accelerate transformations such as nucleation and precipitation or retard kinetics when trapped in clusters, and their transient trapping and release can drive microstructural evolution across time and length scales. This Review synthesizes recent advances in generating, modeling, and characterizing vacancies, highlighting their role in diffusion, precipitation, and phase stability. Case studies in lightweight, high-temperature, fatigue-resistant, electrical, and biomedical materials demonstrate the broad potential of vacancy control. We conclude by emphasizing the opportunity for the metallurgical community to fully exploit excess vacancies as controllable, design-relevant defects that enable new pathways for microstructure and property optimization in next-generation alloys.</description>

      <title>Towards superior van der Waals density functionals for molecular crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ubiquitous van der Waals (vdW) interactions play a subtle yet crucial role in determining the precise atomic arrangements in solids, particularly in molecular crystals where these weak forces are the primary link between constituent building blocks. Within density functional (DF) theory, the most natural approach for addressing vdW forces is the use of vdW-inclusive density functionals. Through a detailed analysis of the underlying formalism, we have developed a computational scheme that combines vdW functionals of type DF1 and DF2 and serves as a well optimizable tool to improve the theoretical description and prediction of molecular crystals and other sparse materials. The proof of principle is demonstrated by our consideration of the molecular crystals from the X23 dataset.</description>

      <title>CHIPS-TB: Evaluating Tight-Binding Models For Metals, Semiconductors, and Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As semiconductor technologies continue to scale down to the nanoscale, the efficient prediction of material properties becomes increasingly critical. The tight-binding (TB) method is a widely used semi-empirical approach that offers a computationally tractable alternative to Density Functional Theory (DFT) for large-scale electronic structure calculations. However, conventional TB models often suffer from limited transferability and lack standardized benchmarking protocols. In this study, we introduce a computational framework (CHIPS-TB) for evaluating and comparing tight-binding parameterizations across diverse material systems relevant to semiconductor design, focusing on properties such as electronic bandgaps, band structures, and bulk modulus. We assess model parameterizations including Density Functional Tight-Binding (DFTB)-based MatSci, PBC, PTBP, SlaKoNet and TB3PY against OptB88vdW, TBmBJ-DFT and experimental reference data from the JARVIS-DFT database for 50+ materials pertinent to semiconductor applications. The CHIPS-TB code will be made publicly available on GitHub and benchmarks will be available on JARVIS-Leaderboard.</description>

      <title>Cr2O3/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 Heterojunction Diodes with Orientation-Dependent Breakdown Electric Field up to 12.9 MV/cm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the fabrication of Cr2O3/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 heterojunction diodes using reactive magnetron sputtering of Cr2O3 on highly doped \b{eta}-Ga2O3 bulk substrates along (100), (010), (001), (110), and (011) orientation dependence of high electric field handling capability in \b{eta}-Ga2O3. Additional relative permittivity values in (110) and (011) orientations of \b{eta}-Ga2O3 were computed by using first-principles calculation methods for accurate apparent charge density (ND-NA) extraction and breakdown electric field analysis from capacitance-voltage measurements. The HJDs fabricated on n+ (110) exhibited breakdown electric fields &gt;10 MV/cm up to 12.9 MV/cm, showing the highest experimentally observed parallel-plane junction electric field among \b{eta}-Ga2O3-based junctions. Breakdown electric fields among (100), (010), (001), and (011) orientations showed distinct distribution in the range of 5.13-5.26 MV/cm, 5.10-7.05 MV/cm, 2.70-3.33 MV/cm, and 3.88-4.38 MV/cm, respectively, validating the orientational dependence of parallel-plane junction electric field at breakdown in low-symmetry monoclinic \b{eta}-Ga2O3. The parallel-plane breakdown electric fields (EBr,||) reported in this work were extracted when the device experienced catastrophic breakdown at 100 mA/cm^2 current density compliance, and should not be confused with critical electric field (Ec) as a function of drift layer doping concentration, which accounts for electric-field dependent impact ionization coefficients in Si, SiC and GaN. This study can guide the choice of crystal orientation for high performance gallium oxide-based devices that require high electric field handling capability.</description>

      <title>Photo-induced carrier dynamics in InSb probed with broadband THz spectroscopy based on BNA crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an optical pump - terahertz (THz) probe study of the photoinduced transient carrier dynamics in the low bandgap semiconductor Indium Antimonide (InSb). Using an organic N-benzyl-2-methyl-nitroaniline (BNA) crystal as a broadband THz source, we access the full spectral response over more than 5 THz, for varying pump-probe delay following the optical excitation. Using the Drude-Lorentz model accounting for differences between the excited length in material and the penetration depth of THz beam in pumped InSb, we extract the absolute carrier density as a function of the pump-probe delay, and provide insights on the diffusion length at given carrier densities, for different pump fluences. The mismatch between the THz penetration depth and the actual excited sample depth after carrier diffusion is discussed, since their evolutions with time and pump fluence are not intuitive as both quantities depend on carrier density.</description>

      <title>Optical contrast-based determination of number of layers for two-dimensional van der Waals magnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in revealing intrinsic magnetism in two-dimensional (2D) materials have highlighted their potential for future spintronic applications, driven by their novel physical properties, promising for future spintronic devices. In order to explore layer dependent magnetic behavior, in general, mechanically exfoliated flakes from high-quality single crystals are used. It is crucial to determine the number of layers of these materials accurately. In the absence of an efficient and quick method, researchers often rely on atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging to identify their number of layers. In this work, we report an optical contrast study as a quick and cost-effective technique to determine the number of layers of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ (FGT). Here, we observed a linear relationship between the optical contrast (derived from optical microscopic images) observed for mechanically exfoliated FGT nano-flakes and their thickness, as measured by the AFM imaging method. This technique requires no additional equipment; it relies solely on a conventional optical microscope. Additionally, our results reveal a thickness-dependent evolution of the intensity; in contrast, the Raman frequency demonstrates no significant dependence on layer thickness. Also, our studies reveal two additional Raman modes of FGT, at the frequency of 129\,cm$^-1$ \&amp; 190\,cm$^-1$. Both modes show the intensity dependence on the thickness of FGT, same as out-of-plane (A$_{1g}$) Raman modes.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical high-throughput screening of alkaline-stable lithium-ion conductors combining machine learning and first-principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of solid-state batteries depends on the development of lithium-ion conductors that exhibit both high ionic conductivity and stability across a wide range of electrochemical and chemical conditions. In this paper, we investigate the chemical factors that control the stability of Li-NASICONs and garnets in highly alkaline aqueous environment. While this is of general importance, it is particularly important for the operation of Li-air cells with humidified air. Humid air promotes the formation of LiOH as the discharge product, creating a highly alkaline environment on the surface of cathode and solid-state electrolyte. In this work, we combine machine learning and first-principles calculations to conduct a high-throughput computational screening of alkaline-stable oxide-based Li-ion conductors in order to better characterize the tradeoff between the various relevant properties. We evaluate the material stability in terms of pH, voltage, and species present in the environment (LiOH and H2O) across a vast range of chemical compositions with NASICON and garnet crystal structures. We utilize the CHGNet universal machine learning interatomic potential for pre-screening, followed by DFT calculations. Such a hierarchical screening procedure enables the evaluation of over 320,000 chemical compositions, encompassing nearly the entire periodic table. From this set 209 alkaline-stable NASICON and garnet compounds are selected as final candidates. We identify the specific cation substitutions that improve alkaline stability in NASICON and garnet compounds, and reveal the underlying mechanism. We also discover the trade-offs for designing alkaline-stable Li-ion conductors, highlighting the need to carefully optimize compositions so that it can simultaneously enhance all the material properties required for practical battery applications.</description>

      <title>Ion Jump Motion as the Background for Muon Diffusion in Battery Materials Research Using $\mu$SR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown by numerical simulations of muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) spectra and analysis of these using the Kubo-Toyabe relaxation function $G_z^{\rm KT}(t)$ that the anomalous peak in the fluctuation rate $\nu_{\rm KT}$ around a specific temperature $T^*$ and associated decrease of the linewidth $\Delta_{\rm KT}$ above $T^*$, often observed in the previous $\mu$SR studies on ion diffusion, originate from the sharp increase in the ion jump rate $\nu_{\rm i}$ against that of the muon $\nu_\mu$ with increasing temperature. This indicates that a more detailed reanalysis of the vintage data using the "extended" Kubo-Toyabe relaxation function $G_z^{\rm EA}(t)$ incorporating the jump motion of both ions and implanted muon (which was also used to simulate the $\mu$SR spectra) is useful for the proper evaluation of $\nu_{\rm i}$ and $\nu_\mu$. Meanwhile, it also suggests that the $\mu$SR results showing no such anomaly convey little information on ion diffusion.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Discovery of Crystalline Materials with Record Ultralow Lattice Thermal Conductivity via a Universal Descriptor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralow glass-like lattice thermal conductivity in crystalline materials is crucial for enhancing energy conversion efficiency in thermoelectrics and thermal insulators. We introduce a universal descriptor for thermal conductivity that relies only on the atomic number in the primitive cell and the sound velocity, enabling fast and scalable materials screening. Coupled with high-throughput workflows and universal machine learning potentials, we identify the candidate materials with ultralow thermal conductivity from over 25, 000 materials. We further validate this approach by experimentally confirming record-low thermal conductivity values of 0.15-0.16 W/m/K from 170 to 400 K in the halide metal CsAg2I3. Combining inelastic neutron scattering with first-principles calculations, we attribute the ultralow thermal conductivity to the intrinsically small sound velocity, strong anharmonicity, and structural complexity. Our work illustrates how a universal descriptor, combined with high-throughput screening, machine-learning potential and experiment, enables the efficient discovery of materials with ultralow thermal conductivity.</description>

      <title>Lattice-to-total thermal conductivity ratio: a phonon-glass electron-crystal descriptor for data-driven thermoelectric design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectrics (TEs) are promising candidates for energy harvesting with performance quantified by figure of merit, $ZT$. To accelerate the discovery of high-$ZT$ materials, efforts have focused on identifying compounds with low thermal conductivity $\kappa$. Using a curated dataset of 71,913 entries, we show that high-$ZT$ materials reside not only in the low-$\kappa$ regime but also cluster near a lattice-to-total thermal conductivity ratio ($\kappa_\mathrm{L}/\kappa$) of approximately 0.5, consistent with the phonon-glass electron-crystal design concept. Building on this insight, we construct a framework consisting of two machine learning models for the lattice and electronic components of thermal conductivity that jointly provide both $\kappa$ and $\kappa_\mathrm{L}/\kappa$ for screening and guiding the optimization of TE materials. Among 104,567 compounds screened, our models identify 2,522 ultralow-$\kappa$ candidates. Follow-up case studies demonstrate that this framework can reliably provide optimization strategies by suggesting new dopants and alloys that shift pristine materials toward the $\kappa_\mathrm{L}/\kappa$ approaching 0.5 regime. Ultimately, by integrating rapid screening with PGEC-guided optimization, our data-driven framework effectively bridges the critical gap between materials discovery and performance enhancement.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of Resistive Switching in 2D Monolayer and Multilayer Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The power and energy consumption of resistive switching devices can be lowered by reducing their active layer dimensions. Efforts to push this low-energy switching property to its limits have led to the investigation of active regions made with two-dimensional layered materials (2DLM). Despite their small dimensions, 2DLM exhibit a rich variety of switching mechanisms, each involving different types of atomic structure reconfigurations. In this review, we highlight and classify the mechanisms of resistive switching in mono and bulk 2DLM, with a subsequent focus on those occurring in a monolayer and/or localized to point defects in the crystalline sheet. We discuss the complex energetics involved in these fundamentally defect-assisted processes, including the co-existence of multiple mechanisms and influence of the contacts used. Examining the highly localized 'atomristor'-type switching, we provide insights into the atomic motions and electronic transport across the metal-2D interfaces underlying their operation. Finally, we present the progress and our perspective on the challenges associated with the development of 2D resistive switching devices. Promising application areas and material systems are identified and suggested for further research.</description>

      <title>Coupled Structural and Electronic Requirements in Alpha-FASnI3 Imposed by the Sn(II) Lone Pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alpha-Formamidinium-tin-iodide (alpha-FASnI3) is a leading candidate for lead-free photovoltaic applications, adopting a nearly cubic structure at room temperature, but its stability remains limited by oxidation-driven degradation. Reliable first-principles modelling of the photovoltaic alpha-phase is further complicated by inconsistent structural models and levels of theory in the literature. Here, we identify the structural and electronic requirements needed for a physically sound description of alpha-FASnI3, whose behaviour is governed by a pseudo-Jahn-Teller (PJT) instability arising from the stereochemically active Sn(II) lone pair.
  Using 0 K relaxations, cross-code hybrid-functional benchmarks, and finite-temperature ab initio molecular dynamics, we show that a 4x4x4 supercell with randomly oriented FA+ cations is the smallest model that removes macroscopic dipoles, preserves cubic symmetry, recovers local octahedral tilts, and captures the characteristic PJT-driven Sn off-centering. Accurate band edges and a reliable band gap require a PBE0-level hybrid functional with spin-orbit coupling to treat Sn relativistic effects, together with nonlocal dispersion (rVV10) to capture the enhanced Sn-I covalency. Finite-temperature simulations reveal that Sn off-centering remains local, &lt;111&gt;-oriented, and robust against thermal fluctuations, and that reproducing the experimental 300 K band gap requires a 6x6x6 supercell. These results define the essential ingredients for reliable modelling of alpha-FASnI3 and provide a rigorous foundation for studying lone-pair-driven physics in tin halide perovskites.</description>

      <title>Active Learning Driven Materials Discovery for Low Thermal Conductivity Rare-Earth Pyrochlore for Thermal Barrier Coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-Entropy/multicomponent rare-earth oxides (HECs and MCCs) show promise as alternative materials for thermal barrier coatings (TBC) with the ability to tailor properties based on the combination of rare-earth elements present. By enabling the substitution of scarce or supply-risk rare-earths with more readily available alternatives while maintaining comparable material performance, HECs and MCCs offer a valuable path towards alternative TBC material design. However, navigating this search space of compositionally complex materials is both time and resource intensive. In this study, an active learning (AL) framework was employed to identify HEC/MCC materials with a pyrochlore structure, with acceptable thermal conductivity (TC) for TBC applications. The AL framework was applied through a Bayesian optimisation (BO) strategy, coupled with a random forest surrogate model. TC was selected as the optimisation criterion as that is the most basic requirement of TBC materials. Over two iterations of the AL cycle, four compositions were generated and synthesized in the lab for experimental evaluation. The first iteration yielded two single-phase pyrochlores, $(La_{0.29}Nd_{0.36}Gd_{0.36})_2Zr_2O_7$ and $(La_{0.333}Nd_{0.26}Gd_{0.15}Ho_{0.15}Yb_{0.111})_2Zr_2O_7$, with measured thermal conductivities of 2.03 and 1.90 $W/mK$, respectively. The surrogate model predicted a TC of 2.009 $W/mK$ for both compositions, demonstrating it's accuracy for completely new compositions. The second iteration compositions showed dual-phase when synthesized, highlighting the need to take into account phase formation in the AL framework.</description>

      <title>Discovery and recovery of crystalline materials with property-conditioned transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models have recently shown great promise for accelerating the design and discovery of new functional materials. Conditional generation enhances this capacity by allowing inverse design, where specific desired properties can be requested during the generation process. However, conditioning of transformer-based approaches, in particular, is constrained by discrete tokenisation schemes and the risk of catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. This work introduces CrystaLLM-{\pi} (property injection), a conditional autoregressive framework that integrates continuous property representations directly into the transformer's attention mechanism. Two architectures, Property-Key-Value (PKV) Prefix attention and PKV Residual attention, are presented. These methods bypass inefficient sequence-level tokenisation and preserve foundational knowledge from unsupervised pre-training on Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs) as textual input. We establish the efficacy of these mechanisms through systematic robustness studies and evaluate the framework's versatility across two distinct tasks. First, for structure recovery, the model processes high-dimensional, heterogeneous X-ray diffraction patterns, achieving structural accuracy competitive with specialised models and demonstrating applications to experimental structure recovery and polymorph differentiation. Second, for materials discovery, the model is fine-tuned on a specialised photovoltaic dataset to generate novel, stable candidates validated by Density Functional Theory (DFT). It implicitly learns to target optimal band gap regions for high photovoltaic efficiency, demonstrating a capability to map complex structure-property relationships. CrystaLLM-{\pi} provides a unified, flexible, and computationally efficient framework for inverse materials design.</description>

      <title>Large longitudinal and anomalous transverse Magneto-thermoelectric effect in kagome antiferromagnet FeGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological Kagome magnets, characterized by nontrivial electronic band structures featuring flat band, Dirac cone and van Hove singularities, provide a new avenue for the realization of thermoelectric devices. Unlike the conventional longitudinal Seebeck effect, transverse thermoelectric (TE) effects like the Nernst effect have attracted growing interest due to their unique transverse geometry and potential advantages. Here, we report the observation of a significant transverse thermoelectric conductivity alpha A_zx of 15 A K-1m-1 at low temperatures, together with a pronounced anomalous Nernst effect in the Kagome antiferromagnet FeGe, which exhibits a charge density wave inside the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. This value is the highest record among known AFM materials. Furthermore, the thermopower at 14 T increases by 102-104% around the canted-AFM (CAFM) transition temperature, Tcant, comparable to that of the well-known AFM thermoelectric materials. These effects are attributed to large Berry curvature arising from the non-collinear spin texture in FeGe, highlighting its potential for enhancing thermoelectric performance and its candidacy for magneto-TE applications in Kagome antiferromagnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Revealing Fast Ionic Conduction in Solid Electrolytes through Machine Learning Accelerated Raman Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast ionic conduction is a defining property of solid electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries. Previous studies have suggested that liquid-like cation motion associated with fast ionic transport can disrupt crystalline symmetry, thereby lifting Raman selection rules. Here, we exploit the resulting low-frequency, diffusive Raman scattering as a spectral signature of fast ionic conduction and develop a machine learning-accelerated computational pipeline to identify promising solid electrolytes based on this feature. By overcoming the steep computational barriers to calculating Raman spectra of strongly disordered materials at finite temperatures, we achieve near-ab initio accuracy and demonstrate the predictive power of our approach for sodium-ion conductors, revealing clear Raman signatures of liquid-like ion conduction. This work highlights how machine learning can bridge atomistic simulations and experimental observables, enabling data-efficient discovery of fast-ion conductors.</description>

      <title>Controlled nucleation in methylamine-treated perovskite films by artificial seeding and phase-field simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large perovskite crystals with reduced defect density enable superior charge transport and stability. Therefore, controlling their nucleation and growth is key to advancing high-performance optoelectronic devices based on perovskite semiconductors. Millimeter-scale perovskite crystals can be synthesized as a continuous film through methylamine treatment, with nucleation sites directed by pre-patterned seeds. Nonetheless, certain configurations may lead to unwanted parasitic nucleation. To predict and mitigate this effect, we employ phase-field simulations alongside an analytical model. Their predictive capability is demonstrated across three distinct material-substrate systems, enabling precise control over nucleation and subsequent crystal growth. Notably, the only material-specific input required is the nucleation density (i.e., the number of crystals nucleated per unit area on an unpatterned substrate). This generality makes the models broadly applicable to diverse material systems for achieving controlled two-dimensional crystallization for improved optoelectronic device performance.</description>

      <title>Lattice-Distortion-Mediated Proton Pairing and Trapping in Solid State Oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments have evidenced proton pairing in Y-doped BaZrO3. However, the nature of proton pairing and its impact on conduction remain insufficiently understood theoretically. Here, through quantitative computational analysis of proton-proton interactions in Y-doped BaZrO3, we identify lattice-distortion-mediated elastic interaction as the key factor determining whether two protons form a stable pair or exhibit net repulsion. When a proton resides at an inward-bending distortion site induced by another proton, the resulting net repulsive interaction leads to an unstable configuration. In contrast, the proton tends to be trapped at a nearby outward-bending site that favors the formation of a stable proton pair. Moreover, the site where the two protons form the lowest-energy configuration also corresponds to a proton trapping site. By calculating the long-range diffusion pathways accessible to protons under different local environments in both single- and two-proton cases, we find that the range of rate-limiting barriers is 0.24-0.45 eV for two-proton conduction and 0.19-0.39 eV for single-proton conduction. The higher and more experimentally consistent barriers in the two-proton pathways indicate that the proton trapping effect induced by pairing hinders proton conduction. Our study elucidates the multi-proton diffusion mechanism, providing a theoretical foundation for the experimental design of electrolytes with enhanced proton conductivity.</description>

      <title>Fast machine learned ${\alpha}$-Fe-H interatomic potential for hydrogen embrittlement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a machine-learned interatomic potential for the ${\alpha}$-Fe-H system based on the tabulated Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP) formalism. Trained on a Density Functional Theory (DFT) dataset of atomic configurations, energies, forces, and virials, the potential is designed to address the issue of H-induced acceleration of mechanical failure of metals, generally known as hydrogen embrittlement (HE). The proposed potential is shown to outperform the widely used classical and machine-learned interatomic potentials in fundamental properties of the ${\alpha}$-Fe-H system. We show that the tabGAP model reproduces H-point defect properties, H-dislocation interaction, H-H interaction, and elastic constants with nearly DFT-level accuracy at a computational cost that is competitive with the efficient classical Embedded Atom Method (EAM) potentials. We further demonstrate the utility of the tabGAP model in molecular dynamics simulations of tensile tests of a perfect, and a $(111)[11\bar{2}]$-notched ${\alpha}$-Fe structure with and without the load of H atoms. The simulations show evidence of HE via observation of accelerated decohesion of Fe atoms at the tip of the notch, and an increase in vacancy concentration driven by H-dislocation interactions. Hence, the results of the presented simulations support the hypotheses of hydrogen-enhanced decohesion (HEDE) alongside hydrogen-enhanced strain induced vacancies (HESIV) as important mechanisms for H-induced mechanical failure of iron systems.</description>

      <title>Unified interface dipole theory for Fermi level pinning effect at metal-semiconductor contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified bond dipole theory for metal-semiconductor interfaces to explain the microscopic origin of interface dipoles and Fermi level pinning (FLP) in terms of Harrison's bond-orbital model. By combining first-principles calculations with tight-binding analysis, we show that localized bonding between semiconductor surface dangling bonds and metal orbitals is sufficient to generate a large interface dipole and induce strong FLP, even when only a single metal monolayer is present. Within this framework, metal-induced gap states (MIGS), dangling-bond-induced surface states (DBSS), and bonding states embedded in the valence band are all understood as different outcomes of the same underlying interface bonding mechanism, rather than as independent causes of FLP. We further establish that the key parameter governing FLP strength is the density of surface dangling bonds that can form new chemical bonds with the metal, which directly controls the magnitude of the bond-induced interface dipole. This picture naturally explains the weaker pinning observed in more ionic semiconductors than in covalent ones and provides practical guidance for engineering metal-semiconductor interfaces and tuning Schottky barrier heights.</description>

      <title>On the generalized Keffer form of the Dzyaloshinskii constant: its consequences for the spin, momentum and polarization evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different analytical features of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction are related to different contribution to the Dzyaloshinskii constant in the microscopic Hamiltonian. Consequences appear in the macroscopic Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert equation. It leads to various phenomena. Three contributions to the Dzyaloshinskii constant are reviewed and combined in the generalized Keffer form of the Dzyaloshinskii constant. Macroscopic consequences of these three mechanisms are well-known, but further possible generalizations of the Keffer form of the Dzyaloshinskii constant are suggested. Consequences for the spin evolution equations, the momentum balance equations, and polarization evolution equations are considered. Some analog of the Keffer form is suggested for the exchange integral in symmetric Heisenberg Hamiltonian demonstrating the nontrivial contribution of the ligands in this regime.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the Inter-system Crossing of the Nitrogen-Vacancy Center up to Megabar Pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Nitrogen-Vacancy color centers into diamond anvil cells has opened the door to quantum sensing at megabar pressures. Despite a multitude of experimental demonstrations and applications ranging from quantum materials to geophysics, a detailed microscopic understanding of how stress affects the NV center remains lacking. In this work, using a combination of first principles calculations as well as high-pressure NV experiments, we develop a complete description of the NV's optical properties under general stress conditions. In particular, our ab initio calculations reveal the complex behavior of the NV's inter-system crossing rates under stresses that both preserve and break the defect's symmetry. Crucially, our proposed framework immediately resolves a number of open questions in the field, including: (i) the microscopic origin of the observed contrast-enhancement in (111)-oriented anvils, and (ii) the surprising observation of NV contrast-inversion in certain high-pressure regimes. Our work lays the foundation for optimizing the performance of NV high-pressure sensors by controlling the local stress environment, and more generally, suggests that symmetry-breaking stresses can be utilized as a novel tuning knob for generic solid-state spin defects.</description>

      <title>Analytical Interaction Potentials for Disks in Two Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact analytical forms are derived for the interactions involving thin disks in two dimensions using an integration approach. These include interactions between a disk and a material point, between two disks, and between a disk and a wall. Each object is treated as a continuous medium of materials points interacting by the Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential. By integrating this potential in a pairwise manner, expressions for the potentials and resultant forces between extended objects are obtained. All the results are validated with numerical integrations. The analytical potentials are implemented in LAMMPS and used to simulate two-dimensional suspension of disks with an explicit solvent modeled as a Lennard-Jones liquid. In monodisperse disk suspensions, a disorder-to-order transition of disk packing is observed as the area fraction of disks is increased or as the solvent evaporates. In bidisperse disk suspensions being rapidly dried, stratification is found with the smaller disks enriched at the evaporation front. Such "small-on-top" stratification echoes the similar phenomenon occurring in three-dimensional polydisperse colloidal suspensions that undergo fast drying. These potentials can be applied to a wide range of two-dimensional systems involving disk-like objects.</description>

      <title>Giant critical current peak induced by pressure in kagome superconductor RbV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity can coexist or compete with other orders such as magnetism or density waves. Optimizing superconductivity requires identifying competing orders that may disrupt Cooper pair coherence. Here, we use the self-field critical current ($I_{\rm c,sf}$) to probe pressure-tuned superconductivity in the kagome superconductor RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. As pressure destabilizes the charge-density wave (CDW) state, $I_{\rm c,sf}$ drastically enhances, peaking near the critical pressure where the CDW state is completely suppressed at zero temperature. Surprisingly, a weaker $I_{\rm c,sf}$ peak emerges within the CDW phase. Near the pressure of the weaker peak, the superconducting phase transition temperature shifts from an increasing trend with pressure to a near plateau. Our analysis suggests the possibility of a sudden change in the CDW pattern or a Lifshitz transition, highlighting the need for microscopic examinations of the CDW state for understanding the pressure evolution of superconductivity in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$.</description>

      <title>The effects of decoherence on Fermi's golden rule</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fermi's golden rule which describes the transition rates between two electronic levels under external stimulations is used ubiquitously in different fields of physics. The original Fermi's golden rule was derived from perturbative time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger's equation without the direct contribution by decoherence effect. However, as a result of recent developments of quantum computing and ultra fast carrier dynamics, the decoherence becomes a prominent topic in fundamental research.Here, by using the non-adiabatic molecular dynamics which goes beyond the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger's equation by introducing decoherence, we study the effect of decoherence on Fermi's golden rule for the fixed basis and the adiabatic basis, respectively. We find that when the decoherence time becomes short, there is a significant deviation from the Fermi's golden rule for both bases. By using monolayer $\mathrm{WS_2}$ as an example, we investigate the decoherence effect in the carrier transitions induced by the electron-phonon coupling with first-principle method.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of excitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitons, bound electron-hole pairs, are responsible for strong optical resonances near the bandgap in low-dimensional materials and wide-bandgap insulators. Although current ab initio methods can accurately determine exciton energies and eigenstates, their symmetries have been much less explored. In this work, we employ standard group-theory methods to analyse the transformation properties of excitonic states, obtained by solving the BSE, under crystal symmetry operations. We develop an approach to assign irreducible-representation labels to excitonic states, providing a state-of-the-art framework for analysing their symmetries and selection rules (including, for example, the case of exciton-phonon coupling). Complementary to the symmetry classification, we introduce the concept of total crystal angular momentum for excitons in the presence of rotational symmetries, allowing the derivation of conservation laws. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these symmetry properties can be exploited to greatly enhance the computational efficiency of exciton calculations with the BSE. We apply our methodology to three prototypical systems to understand the role of symmetries in different contexts: (i) For LiF, we present the symmetry analysis of the entire excitonic dispersion and examine the selection rules for optical absorption. (ii) In the calculation of resonant Raman spectra of monolayer MoSe2, we demonstrate how the conservation of total crystal angular momentum governs exciton-phonon interactions, leading to the observed resonant enhancement. (iii) In bulk hBN, we analyze the role of symmetries for the coupling of finite-momentum excitons to finite-momentum phonons and their manifestation in the phonon-assisted luminescence spectra. This work establishes a general and robust framework for understanding the symmetry properties of excitons in crystals, providing a foundation for future studies.</description>

      <title>High resolution 3D imaging of diamonds with multiphoton microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diamonds offer unique benefits for optical technology development due to their optical, chemical, electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties. These attributes also contribute to their aesthetic appeal, high commercial value, and utility in geological studies. Thus, there is high demand for nondestructive techniques that enable rapid analysis of natural and synthetic diamonds as well as diamond-like simulants. Here, we demonstrate sub-micrometer, nondestructive, three-dimensional imaging and spectral analysis of diamonds using multiphoton microscopy (MPM). This approach stimulates nonlinear optical emissions to provide unique insights into the interior structure, fluorescent defects, and formational conditions of diamonds. As a result, MPM can be used to investigate gemstone quality, vacancy centers used in quantum technologies, and the various inclusions and fluorescent emitters that may trace gemstone provenance and treatment history.</description>

      <title>Phonon-tunable THz magnonic emission in multiferroic heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective excitations such as magnons and polar phonons provide natural access to the terahertz (THz) regime, but efficient generation and tunability remain elusive. Multiferroic BiFeO3 combines both orders at room temperature, offering a unique platform for narrowband THz emission. Here, we achieve efficient sub-bandgap optical rectification of coupled phonon-polaritons near 2 THz in bare epitaxial thin films. In Pt/BiFeO3 bilayers, we demonstrate that coupling the electromagnon branch with ultrafast strain waves, optically generated in Pt layers with various thicknesses, can produce tunable and narrowband emission between 0.4-0.8 THz. These results uncover the intertwined role of phonons, magnons, and magneto-acoustic dynamics in antiferromagnetic multiferroics, and establish these hybrid platforms as versatile engineered narrowband THz sources.</description>

      <title>Phase Transformation Kinetics Model for Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00250v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new model for phase transformation kinetics in metals by generalizing the Levitas-Preston (LP) phase field model of martensite phase transformations (see Levitas and Preston (2002a,b); Levitas, Preston and Lee (2003)) to arbitrary pressure. Furthermore, we account for and track: the interface speed of the pressure driven phase transformation, properties of critical nuclei, as well as nucleation at grain sites and on dislocations and homogeneous nucleation. The volume fraction evolution of each phase is described by employing KJMA (Kolmogorov, 1937; Johnson and Mehl, 1939; Avrami, 1939, 1940, 1941) kinetic theory. We then test our new model for iron under ramp loading conditions and compare our predictions for the $\alpha\to\epsilon$ iron phase transition to experimental data of Smith et al. (2013). More than one combination of material and model parameters (such as dislocation density and interface speed) led to good agreement of our simulations to the experimental data, thus highlighting the importance of having accurate characterization data for the microstructure of the sample under consideration.</description>

      <title>Exploring Charge Density Waves in two-dimensional NbSe2 with Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Niobium diselenide (NbSe$_2$) has garnered significant attention due to the coexistence of superconductivity and charge density waves (CDWs) down to the monolayer limit. However, realistic modeling of CDWs-capturing effects such as layer number, twist angle, and strain-remains challenging due to the high computational cost of first-principles methods. Here, we develop a physically informed workflow for training machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) based on the E(3)-equivariant Allegro architecture, tailored to capture the subtle structural and dynamical signatures of CDWs in mono- and bilayer NbSe$_2$.We find that while CDW lattice distortions are relatively easy to learn, modeling vibrational properties remains more challenging. It requires targeted dataset design and careful hyperparameter tuning, pushing the boundaries and testing the extensibility of current MLIP frameworks. Our MLIPs enable reliable simulations of commensurate and incommensurate CDW phases, including their sensitivity to dimensionality and stacking, as well as CDW dynamics, phonons, and transition temperatures estimated via the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. This work opens new possibilities for studying and tuning CDWs in NbSe$_2$ and other two-dimensional systems, with implications for electron-phonon coupling, superconductivity, and advanced materials design.</description>

      <title>Direct Thermal Imaging of Domain Wall Hot Spots in LiNbO3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ferroelectric domain wall devices offer a promising route to low-voltage, reconfigurable nanoelectronics by confining currents to nanoscale conducting interfaces within an insulating bulk. However, the potential for resistive heating and unregulated temperature increases due to domain wall conduction remains unexplored. Here, scanning thermal microscopy is employed to directly image hot spots in thin-film lithium niobate domain wall devices. Piezoresponse force microscopy shows that the hot spots correlate with nanodomain structure, and thermal mapping reveals surface temperature rises of ~20 K at most, levels that are unlikely to negatively affect device performance. This is due to the moderate electrical conductivity of domain walls, their voltage-tunable erasure, and distributed current pathways, which inherently limit power dissipation and peak temperatures. Finite element electrothermal modelling indicates that domain walls behave as pseudo-planar heat sources, distinct from the filament-based heating typically observed in resistive switching oxides. These findings highlight the potential for domain wall devices as an energy-efficient, thermally stable platform for emerging memory and logic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of antiferron modes in ferroelectric materials as dynamically stabilized collective excitations over inverted polarization states that decrease the system energy. While ferrons represent quantized oscillations around the stable polarization minimum, antiferrons require dynamic stabilization via high-frequency driving. Using a generalized Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire framework, we derive the effective curvature corrections from external driving, demonstrate the conditions for stabilizing metastable wells, and present the quantized Hamiltonian. Antiferrons could be a promising candidate for developing electrical sensing devices, offering tunable, dynamically controllable excitations with high sensitivity to external electric fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present MACE-Field, a field-aware $O(3)$-equivariant interatomic potential that provides a compact, derivative-consistent route to dielectric properties (such as polarisation $\mathbf P$, Born effective charges $Z^*$ and polarisability $\boldsymbol\alpha$) and finite-field simulations across chemistry for inorganic solids. MACE-Field preserves the standard MACE readout and can inherit existing MACE foundation weights, turning pretrained models into field-aware ones with minimal change. To demonstrate, we fine-tune MACE-MP-0 on multiple heads covering BECs and polarisabilities ($\sim$6k MP dielectrics spanning 81 elements), polarisations (2.5k MP nonpolar-to-polar polarisation branches), and energies, forces, and stresses (10,000 structure-replay set from MPtraj), resulting in a field-aware foundation model, MACE-Field-MP-0. We show that MACE-Field can evaluate polarisation branches and spontaneous polarisations, predict $Z^*$ and dielectric constants across diverse chemistries, and reproduce finite-field MD simulations, such as BaTiO$_3$ polarisation hysteresis and the IR/Raman and dielectric spectra of $\alpha$-quartz, benchmarking against Allegro-pol and DFPT.</description>

      <title>GoodRegressor: A General-Purpose Symbolic Regression Framework for Physically Interpretable Materials Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18325v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symbolic regression offers a promising route toward interpretable machine learning, yet existing methods suffer from poor predictability and computational intractability when exploring large expression spaces. I introduce GoodRegressor, a general-purpose C++-based framework that resolves these limitations while preserving full physical interpretability. By combining hierarchical descriptor construction, interaction discovery, nonlinear transformations, statistically rigorous model selection, and stacking ensemble, GoodRegressor efficiently explores symbolic model spaces such as $1.44 \times 10^{457}$, $5.99 \times 10^{124}$, and $4.20 \times 10^{430}$ possible expressions for oxygen-ion conductors, NASICONs, and superconducting oxides, respectively. Across these systems, it produces compact equations that surpass state-of-the-art black-box models and symbolic regressors, improving $R^2$ by $4 \sim 40$ %. The resulting expressions reveal physical insights, for example, into oxygen-ion transport through coordination environment and lattice flexibility. Independent ensemble runs yield nearly identical regressed values and the identical top-ranked candidate, demonstrating high reproducibility. With scalability up to $10^{4392}$ choices without interaction terms, GoodRegressor provides a foundation for general-purpose interpretable machine intelligence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The planar Hall effect (PHE) is typically symmetric under magnetic field reversal, as required by the Onsager reciprocity relations. Recent advances have identified the antisymmetric PHE (under magnetic field reversal) as an intriguing extension in magnetic systems. While new mechanisms have been proposed, the role of conventional anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) in this phenomenon remains unclear. Here, we report the experimental discovery of an antisymmetric (with respect to both magnetic field and magnetization) PHE and magnetoresistance in single-crystal $Co_{30}Pt_{70}$ (111) thin films with $C_{3}$ rotational symmetry and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). We demonstrate that both antisymmetric effects arise naturally from the intrinsic fourth-rank AMR tensor inherent to C3-symmetric planes, assisted by PMA. Our findings link conventional AMR to antisymmetric galvanomagnetic responses, offering new insights into symmetry-governed transport in crystalline ferromagnets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advancing the functional performance of bismuth ferrite (BiFeO$_3$) requires precise control over phase stability and microstructure, challenges often complicated by secondary phase formation within the Bi$_2$O$_3$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ system. In this work, we employ a phase-diagram-guided synthesis strategy to clarify the processing-structure-property relationships governing BiFeO$_3$ ceramics. Based on previous reports and our experimental observations, a refined Bi$_2$O$_3$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ phase diagram was constructed identifing the onset of liquid-phase formation near 835$^\circ$C in Bi-rich compositions. Solid-state synthesis using non-stoichiometric precursor ratios (55$\colon$45 and 70$\colon$30 Bi$_2$O$_3$ $\colon$ Fe$_2$O$_3$) reveals that the 55$\colon$45 composition sintered at 775$^\circ$C favours phase-pure rhombohedral $R3c$ BiFeO$_3$ with suppressed sillenite- and mullite-type impurities, lattice contraction, and improved grain uniformity. These structural refinements result in near-Debye dielectric relaxation and a four-orders-of-magnitude enhancement in electrical conductivity relative to lower-temperature or Bi-rich conditions. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of phase-diagram control as a scalable route to tuning dielectric response in BFO-based multiferroics and provides a foundation for processing optimization in complex oxide ceramics.</description>

      <title>Crystal Growth and Physical Properties of Orthorhombic Kagome Lattice Magnets $R$Fe$_6$Ge$_6$ ($R$=Y, Tb, Dy)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kagome magnets represent a promising class of materials that exhibit intriguing electronic and magnetic properties, and they have recently garnered significant attention. While most kagome-lattice compounds are hexagonal, we report here single-crystal growth and physical property measurements of $R$Fe$_6$Ge$_6$ ($R$ = Y, Dy, Tb) compounds, which crystallize in an orthorhombic structure. The structure can be derived from a hexagonal prototype $R$Fe$_3$Ge$_2$ by replacing every other $R$ atom with a covalent Ge$_2$ dimer. Ordering of these dimers renders the structure orthorhombic, slightly distorts the kagome net, and makes the three Fe sites formally inequivalent. The iron and rare-earth sublattices order independently. Fe moments order above 400 K, forming ferromagnetic kagome planes stacked antiferromagnetically, while rare-earth moments order below 9 K. TbFe$_6$Ge$_6$ exhibits a single magnetic ordering transition associated with the Tb atoms, whereas DyFe$_6$Ge$_6$ shows two distinct magnetic phase transitions, strongly influenced by crystal electric field effects on the Dy$^{3+}$ ions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the ferromagnetic ordering of the Fe planes is driven by a high density of states at the Fermi energy. They also reveal three dramatically different structural energy scales: $R$ and Ge$_2$ form alternating 1D chains perpendicular to the kagome planes, and violating this alternation incurs a large energy cost. Aligning these chains is less costly, and achieving a two-dimensional order of anti-aligned chains requires very little energy. These compounds represent a unique class of materials, offering new opportunities to investigate the interplay between the distinct crystal lattice geometry and the underlying electronic and magnetic properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic orbitals underpin our understanding of electronic structure, providing intuitive descriptions of bonding, charge transfer, magnetism, and correlation effects. Despite their utility, an atomic basis that is adaptable, strictly localized on atomic centers, and enables accurate tight-binding interpolation has remained elusive. Here, we introduce Crystal Orbital Guided Iteration To atomic-Orbitals (COGITO), a framework that constructs an optimal atomic orbital basis by identifying and resolving key mathematical obstacles inherent to nonorthogonal bases--particularly uncontrolled orbital mixing, and the fixed-overlap constraint between orbitals. We demonstrate that COGITO enables tight-binding models as accurate as MLWF-based approaches, while preserving the ability of tight-binding parameters to represent the projected atomic basis--an essential feature lost in schemes that enforce orbital orthogonality or maximal localization. By creating accurate and chemically interpretable models of electronic structure, COGITO reveals the orbital-resolved covalent bonds and charge transfer that is encoded in the Kohn-Sham wavefunctions of DFT. Our method thus offers a powerful tool for any physics- or chemistry-based application that relies on a faithful description of local electronic structure.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Heat Transfer at Silica-Water Interfaces via Hydroxyl and Methyl Surface Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01141v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient thermal transport across solid-liquid interfaces is essential for optimizing heat dissipation in modern technological applications. This study employs molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the impact of surface functionalization on heat transfer at the silica/water interface. It has been shown that the surface functionalization changes significantly the wetting characteristics of silica surface: from one hand hydroxyl groups render such surfaces more hydrophilic, while methyl groups more hydrophobic. Here, we reveal that modifying the surface functionalization from methylated to hydroxylated groups results in: (i) up to an approximately eightfold increase in adhesion energy, (ii) a reorientation of interfacial water molecules to align perpendicular to the surface normal, (iii) a reduction in the liquid depletion length near the interface, and (iv) an overall enhancement of interfacial heat conduction. We quantify interfacial thermal resistance through the calculation of the contribution of each functional group to the total heat flux, providing insights into the physical mechanisms governing heat transfer at functionalized interfaces. We demonstrated that manipulation of the concentrations of the functional groups can be used to tailor interfacial thermal transport.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Electric conductivity of graphene: Kubo model versus a nonlocal quantum field theory model (arXiv:2403.02279v3)"</title>

Abstract: Recently, Rodriguez-Lopez, Wang, and Antezza [Phys. Rev. B v.111, 115428 (2025)] compared the theoretical descriptions of electric conductivity of graphene given by the Kubo model and quantum field theory in terms of the polarization tensor. According to this article, in the spatially nonlocal case, the quantum field theoretical description contains ``hard inconsistencies". By modifying the equality, which relates the conductivity and polarization expressions, the predictions of quantum field theory were revised and brought in agreement with those following from the nonrelativistic Kubo model. Here, it is shown that this modification violates the requirement of gauge invariance and, thus, is unacceptable. By comparing both theoretical approaches, we demonstrate that all the results obtained within quantum field theory are physically well justified whereas an application of the modified expression for the conductivity of graphene leads to the consequences of nonphysical character.</description>

      <title>From localized 4f electrons to anisotropic exchange interactions in ferromagnetic CeRh6Ge4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: CeRh6Ge4 is a cerium-based ferromagnetic material exhibiting a quantum critical behavior under pressure. We derive effective exchange interactions, using the framework of density functional theory combined with dynamical mean-field theory. Our results reveal that the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic interaction along the c axis is isotropic in spin space, leading to a formation of spin chains. On the other hand, the inter-chain coupling is highly anisotropic: The in-plane moment weakly interacts ferromagnetically in the a--b plane to stabilize the ferromagnetic state, whereas the z-component couples antiferromagnetically, contributing to its destabilization. The magnetic anisotropy of the interchain interactions as well as of the local 4f wavefunctions characterizes the magnetic properties underlying the ferromagnetic transition and the quantum critical behavior in CeRh6Ge4.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical Kerr-effect measurements under pulsed magnetic fields over 40 T using a compact sample fixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnetic field is one of the most fundamental control parameters in materials science. A pulsed magnetic-field apparatus can generate high magnetic fields that are inaccessible by conventional DC-field magnets. One important issue is that measurement techniques compatible with pulsed fields are rather limited due to short pulse duration and large electromagnetic or mechanical noise originating from field pulses. The magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE), the change in the state of light polarization upon reflection from magnetic materials, has the potential to become a powerful tool for investigation of magnetic properties of a wide range of materials including non-transparent materials or thin films in pulsed fields. Nevertheless, since the MOKE response is typically very small, MOKE measurements under pulsed fields are quite challenging. Here, we present a new method to measure polar MOKE under high pulsed magnetic fields of 2-ms pulse width. The keys of this new technique are a ferrule-based compact sample-fiber fixture and a phase-resolved numerical lock-in analysis, combined with the high-resolution optical apparatus based on an all-fiber loop-less Sagnac interferometer. We succeeded in measuring MOKE signals from various ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic samples above 40 T and down to 77 K, significantly extending the limits of previously reported pulse-field MOKE measurements. Our apparatus is simple enough to be compatible with larger-scale experiments in pulse-field facilities, thus becoming a new promising tool to optically investigate material properties in pulsed fields.</description>

      <title>Stability theory of flat band solitons in nonlinear wave systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a sharp criterion for the stability of a class of compactly supported, homogeneous density``minimal compact solitons'' or MCS states, of the time-dependent discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on a multi-lattice, $\mathbb L$ ($\mathbb L$-DNLS). MCS states arise for multi-lattices where a nearest neighbor Laplace-type operator on $\mathbb L$ has a flat band. Our stability criterion is in terms of the explicit form of the nonlinearity and the projection of distinguished vectors onto the flat band eigenspace. We apply our general results to MCS states of DNLS for the diamond, Kagom{\'e} and checkerboard lattices. In lattices where MCS states are unstable, we demonstrate how to engineer the nonlinearity to stabilize small amplitude MCS states. Finally, via systematic numerical computations, we put our analytical results in the context of global bifurcation diagrams.</description>

      <title>Floquet-engineered Valley Topology with Anisotropic Response in 1T'-WSe$_2$ and Janus WSeTe monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Valley topology has emerged as a key concept for realizing new classes of quantum states. Here, we investigate Floquet-engineered topological phase transitions in anisotropic 1T'-WSe$_2$ and its Janus derivative WSeTe monolayers, which exhibit valley-degenerate and valley-polarized characteristics, respectively. In 1T'-WSe$_2$, a single topological-phase-transition (TPT) occurs from the quantum-spin-Hall state (QSH) to the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) state, involving one spin channel at both valleys simultaneously. In contrast, Janus WSeTe undergoes a two-stage Floquet-driven TPT that occurs within a single valley and sequentially involves two spin components. The intermediate phase manifests as a valley-polarized QAH (vp-QAH) state with a finite valley Chern number, while the final phase evolves into a high-Chern-number QAH state with distinct valley gaps. Furthermore, an in-plane anisotropic response of the TPTs is predicted under oblique light incidence, reflecting the intrinsic low-symmetry nature of the lattice. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of Floquet-engineered valley-based topological properties and offer guidance for designing light-controllable valleytronic and topological devices.</description>
