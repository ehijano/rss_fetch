      <title>Dynamic Plastic Deformation Delocalization in FCC Solid Solution Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metallic materials undergo irreversible deformation under mechanical loading, leading to intense local plastic localization that reduces their mechanical performance. We identify a new mechanism of plastic deformation localization that dynamically promotes the homogenization of plasticity in face-centered cubic solid solution-strengthened metallic alloys. We observe that this mechanism occurs within a narrow range of stacking fault energies and involves competing deformation between nanoscale twinning and slip. This phenomenon is attributed to a new mechanism referred to as dynamic plastic deformation delocalization, which opens a new design space for enhancing the mechanical performance of metallic materials. We demonstrate that the activation of this mechanism has a significant impact on fatigue properties, greatly enhancing fatigue strength when it occurs.</description>

      <title>Grain Size and Temperature-Dependent Response of 5-mol% Gd-Doped Ceria to Swift Heavy Ion Irradiation with 80 MeV Ag and 120 MeV Au Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The response of 5-mol% Gd-doped ceria to swift heavy ion beam irradiation has been studied to observe the effects of changes in ion energies and environmental temperature. The study involved irradiating two different grain sizes (nano and bulk) with two different ion energies: 80 MeV Ag and 120 MeV Au. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis of Gd-doped ceria's response to ion beam irradiation at high temperatures (1000 K) was conducted, taking into account the effect of grain size dependency. Based on GIXRD and Raman spectroscopy, it is evident that electronic excitation from 80 MeV Ag and 120 MeV Au ions at a fluence $1 \times 10^{14}$ ions/cm$^2$ caused damage to Gd-doped ceria samples. However, bulk grain size shows significant stability against SHI in all cases. These findings align with thermal spike simulations and indicate the formation of ion tracks due to electronic excitation by Swift Heavy Ion beam irradiation.</description>

      <title>Fast nanothermometry based on direct electron detection of electron backscattering diffraction patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate temperature measurement at the nanoscale is crucial for thermal management in next-generation microelectronic devices. Existing optical and scanning-probe thermometry techniques face limitations in spatial resolution, accuracy, or invasiveness. In this work, we demonstrate a fast and non-contact nanothermometry method based on temperature-induced changes in electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD) patterns captured by a high-performance direct electron detector within a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Using dynamical electron simulations, we establish the theoretical temperature sensitivity limits for several semiconductors (Si, Ge, GaAs, and GaN), showing that thermal diffuse scattering (TDS) leads to a measurable smearing of Kikuchi bands in the EBSD patterns. We develop a Fourier analysis method that captures these subtle changes across the full diffraction pattern, achieving a simulated temperature sensitivity of approximately 0.15\% per K. Experimental results on silicon confirm a sensitivity of 0.14\% per K and achieve a 13-K temperature uncertainty with a 10-second acquisition time, and enable spatial temperature mapping under thermal gradients. Our approach offers a pathway toward practical and high-resolution thermal mapping directly in SEMs, expanding the toolbox for device-level thermal diagnostics.</description>

      <title>MBFormer: A General Transformer-based Learning Paradigm for Many-body Interactions in Real Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, radical progress in machine learning (ML) has revolutionized computational materials science, enabling unprecedentedly rapid materials discovery and property prediction, but the quantum many-body problem -- which is the key to understanding excited-state properties, ranging from transport to optics -- remains challenging due to the complexity of the nonlocal and energy-dependent interactions. Here, we propose a symmetry-aware, grid-free, transformer-based model, MBFormer, that is designed to learn the entire many-body hierarchy directly from mean-field inputs, exploiting the attention mechanism to accurately capture many-body correlations between mean-field states. As proof of principle, we demonstrate the capability of MBFormer in predicting results based on the GW plus Bethe Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) formalism, including quasiparticle energies, exciton energies, exciton oscillator strengths, and exciton wavefunction distribution. Our model is trained on a dataset of 721 two-dimensional materials from the C2DB database, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a low prediction mean absolute error (MAE) on the order of 0.1-0.2 eV for state-level quasiparticle and exciton energies across different materials. Moreover, we show explicitly that the attention mechanism plays a crucial role in capturing many-body correlations. Our framework provides an end-to-end platform from ground states to general many-body prediction in real materials, which could serve as a foundation model for computational materials science.</description>

      <title>Identifying Exceptional Points in Two-Dimensional Excitons Coupled to an Open Optical Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong coupling in the conventional sense requires that the Rabi cycling process between two interacting states is faster than other dissipation rates. Some recent experimental findings show intriguing properties that were attributed to polaritonic states (e.g., plexcitons) even though the above criterion is not satisfied. Here, we theoretically predict and provide experimental evidence of polariton-like behavior in a system that does not show Rabi splitting. The photoluminescence of an exciton-cavity system consisting of a two-dimensional exciton monolayer (tungsten disulfide, WS2) coupled to a planar, open, one-mirror optical cavity configuration is studied. We experimentally observed a transition from the weak coupling regime crossing an exceptional point to form polariton-like states by varying the coupling strength and the cavity loss. Our observations are fully in agreement with a theoretical quasi-normal mode analysis, which predicts this transition and confirms the presence of exceptional points in the system. These results provide evidence that polaritonic effects can be experimentally observed even when the conventional strong coupling condition is not satisfied.</description>

      <title>Self-organized first-order transition from foreshock to mainshock in earthquake sequences induced by heat, fluid pressure, and porosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earthquake cycles are studied by taking into account the interactions among slip, fluid pressure, temperature, and porosity on the fault planes, which are known to play a crucial role in earthquake dynamics. The spring-block model with a single block is employed. A first-order transition from foreshock to mainshock occurring spontaneously in earthquake sequences is discovered both analytically and numerically. This transition is induced by these interactions. It is shown that the function of the slip distance $u$, $F(u)$, defined as the sum of the difference between the energies stored in the driving spring before and after the slippage, and the energy dissipated during the slippage, governs the transition. The equation, $F(u)=0$, represents the energy balance before and after the slippage, and the solution $u=u_f$ describes the realized slip distance for each slippage event. The solutions discontinuously transition from small to large slippages in the sequence of earthquakes. This transition can be interpreted to be a self-organized first-order transition from small to large slippages. The former slippage is governed by pore generation, whereas the latter is governed by thermal pressurization. A phase diagram of the foreshocks and mainshocks, which is also considered a phase diagram of slow and fast earthquakes, is obtained.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MP-ALOE, a dataset of nearly 1 million DFT calculations using the accurate r2SCAN meta-generalized gradient approximation. Covering 89 elements, MP-ALOE was created using active learning and primarily consists of off-equilibrium structures. We benchmark a machine learning interatomic potential trained on MP-ALOE, and evaluate its performance on a series of benchmarks, including predicting the thermochemical properties of equilibrium structures; predicting forces of far-from-equilibrium structures; maintaining physical soundness under static extreme deformations; and molecular dynamic stability under extreme temperatures and pressures. MP-ALOE shows strong performance on all of these benchmarks, and is made public for the broader community to utilize.</description>

      <title>Uncovering coupled ionic-polaronic dynamics and interfacial enhancement in Li$_x$FePO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling coupled ionic-polaronic dynamics is crucial for optimizing electrochemical performance in battery materials. However, studying such coupled dynamics remains challenging due to the intricate interplay between Li-ion configurations, polaron charge ordering, and lattice vibrations. Here, we develop a fine-tuned machine-learned force field (MLFF) for Li$_x$FePO$_4$ that captures coupled ion-polaron behavior. Our simulations reveal picosecond-scale polaron flips occurring orders of magnitude faster than Li-ion migration, featuring strong correlation to Li configurations. Notably, polaron charge fluctuations are further enhanced at Li-rich/Li-poor phase boundaries, suggesting a potential interfacial electronic conduction mechanism. These results demonstrate the capability of fine-tuned MLFFs to resolve complex coupled transport and provide insight into emergent ionic-polaronic dynamics in multivalent battery cathodes.</description>

      <title>Defect migration and phase transformations in 2D iron chloride inside bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intercalation of metal chlorides, and particularly iron chlorides, into graphitic carbon structures has recently received lots of attention, as it can not only protect this two-dimensional (2D) magnetic system from the effects of the environment, but also substantially alter the magnetic, electronic, and optical properties of both intercalant and host material. At the same time, the intercalation can result in the formation of structural defects, or defects can appear under external stimuli, which can affect materials performance. These aspects have received so far little attention in the dedicated experiments. In this study, we investigate the behavior of atomic-scale defects in iron chlorides intercalated into bilayer graphene (BLG) by using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and first-principles calculations. We observe transformations between the FeCl2 and FeCl3 phases and elucidate the role of defects in the transformations. Specifically, three types of defects are identified: Fe vacancies in FeCl2 domains, Fe adatoms and interstitials in FeCl3 domains, each exhibiting distinct dynamic behaviors. We also observed a crystalline phase with an unusual stoichiometry of Fe5Cl18 which has not been reported before. Our findings not only advance the understanding of intercalation mechanism of 2D materials but also highlight the profound impact of atomic-scale defects on their properties and potential technological applications.</description>

      <title>Unified Statistical Theory of Heat Conduction in Nonuniform Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theory of heat conduction that encompasses and extends the classical paradigm defined by Fourier law and the Kapitza interfacial conductance model. Derived from the Zwanzig projection operator formalism, our approach introduces a spatiotemporal kernel function of heat conduction, which governs the spatiotemporal response of the local heat flux in nonuniform media to surrounding temperature gradients while incorporating temporal memory effects. Our statistical analysis shows that memory, nonlocality, and interfacial temperature discontinuities emerge naturally from the microscopic coupling between two classes of irrelevant degrees of freedom: flux mode and nonlocal mode variables. Although these irrelevant variables are not directly observable at the macroscopic level, their integrated influence on the heat flux is fully encoded in the kernel function. In the diffusive limit, the kernel recovers and generalizes Fourier law by replacing the thermal conductivity with an infinite hierarchy of position dependent higher order tensors that capture nanoscale nonlocality. We also outline atomistic strategies for computing the spatiotemporal kernel in various classes of material media, enabling predictive modeling of heat transport in structurally complex and compositionally inhomogeneous systems. These include nanostructured, anisotropic, and interfacial materials where classical local models break down. Finally, the kernel function formalism is extensible to electronic, spin, or magnetic systems, providing a broadly applicable platform for next generation transport theory at ultrafast and nanoscale regimes.</description>

      <title>Surface Reduction Boosts Free Electron Concentration in MXene for Enhanced Photothermal Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photothermal properties of MXenes originate from their high free electron concentration, which drives localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). However, their intrinsic electron concentration is limited by suboptimal d-orbital occupancy, while electronegative surface terminations actively deplete free electrons through orbital-selective withdrawal. Herein, we report a sodium (Na)-mediated surface reduction strategy in molten salts to transform Ti3C2Clx into electronically tunable Ti3C2. Specifically, Na atoms remove -Cl terminations to eliminate electron withdrawal and simultaneously inject electrons into the MXene lattice via a reduction reaction. This dual effect saturates Ti 3d-orbital vacancies while reducing surface coordination sites, achieving an increase in carrier concentration to 4.92-fold, an increase in mobility to 2.63-fold, and an enhancement in conductivity to 12.96-fold. Consequently, the optimized reduced MXene achieves a record photothermal conversion efficiency of 92.36% under 808 nm laser irradiation. As a proof-of-concept, a photothermal antibacterial woundplast with ultralow MXene content demonstrates a 91.39% bacterial kill rate. This work not only shows an effective way to tune the photothermal properties of MXenes but also inspires applications that require high electron concentration, such as energy storage, sensors, and electromagnetic interference shielding.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the configurations of hydrogen impurities in SrTiO3: Insights from first-principles local vibration mode calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The specific configurations of hydrogen impurities in SrTiO3 (STO) are still ambiguous. In this study, we systematically investigate the configurations and vibrational properties of hy-drogen impurities in cubic STO using first-principles local vibration mode calculations. Em-ploying the appropriate hybrid exchange correlation functional with the fraction of exact ex-change setting to 0.2, we revisit the interstitial hydrogen (Hi), Hi complexes (2Hi), and various intrinsic cation vacancy complexes with Hi, including VSr-Hi, VSr-2Hi, VTi-Hi, and VTi-2Hi. Comparison of the computed vibrational frequencies with experimental infrared absorption bands reveals that Hi, with a frequency of 3277 cm-1, is unlikely to account for the dominant absorption bands near 3500 cm-1. Instead, strontium vacancy complexes with interstitial hydro-gen (VSr-Hi and VSr-2Hi) exhibit vibrational frequencies that align with the main absorption bands, whereas titanium vacancy complex with two interstitial hydrogen (VTi-2Hi) corresponds to additional absorption bands around 3300 cm-1. These findings provide insights into the im-portance of hydrogen-related complexes in governing the electronic properties of STO, and meanwhile underscore the necessity of employing accurate exchange correlation functionals for reliable theoretical predictions of vibrational properties.</description>

      <title>Strong acoustic phonon suppression leads to ultralow thermal conductivity and enhanced thermoelectric performance in BaCuGdTe$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitations and scatterings among the quantized lattice vibrations, i.e., phonons, govern the lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_l$) in crystalline solids. Therefore, effective modulation of $\kappa_l$ can be achieved through selective manipulation of phonon modes that strongly participate in the heat transport mechanisms. Here, combining accurate first-principles density functional theory calculations and Boltzmann transport theory, we report a layered quaternary chalcogenide semiconductor, BaCuGdTe$_3$, which exhibits unusually low $\kappa_l$ ($\sim$ 0.14 W/mK at room temperature) despite its ordered crystalline structure. Our analysis reveals that the ultralow $\kappa_l$ arises mainly from a strong suppression of acoustic phonon modes induced by local distortion, shear vibrations among the layers, and large acoustic-optical avoided-crossing between phonons, which collectively enhances the phonon-scattering rates. Further calculations of the electrical transport properties with explicit consideration of electron-phonon interactions reveal a high thermoelectric figure of merit exceeding unity for this compound at moderate temperature (400-700 K) and carrier concentration $(1\text{--}5 \times 10^{19}\ \text{cm}^{-3})$ ranges. Our theoretical predictions warrant experimental investigations of the intriguing phonon dynamics, thermal transport mechanisms, and thermoelectric properties in this compound. Moreover, insights from our analysis can be used to design and engineer compounds with ultralow $\kappa_l$.</description>

      <title>Influence of interphase boundary coherency in high-entropy alloys on their hydrogen storage performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have potential for storing hydrogen reversibly at room temperature due to their tunable thermodynamics; however, they usually suffer from the issue of difficult activation. This study shows that while interphase boundaries are effective in activating some HEAs, some other dual-phase HEAs still require extra high-temperature activation. To understand why interphase boundaries are not always effective for activation, microstructural features and hydrogen storage performance of six HEAs with dual phases are compared. Detailed analysis confirms that interphase boundaries are effective for hydrogen absorption without the need for activation treatment, provided that: (i) their fraction is high enough, and (ii) they are not coherent. These findings are discussed in terms of free volume and boundary energy. Coherent interphase boundaries are associated with lower free volume and thus do not act as fast hydrogen diffusion paths. Moreover, the boundary energy of coherent boundaries is lower than incoherent boundaries, making them less favorable sites for heterogeneous hydride nucleation. This research thus suggests that the introduction of incoherent interphase boundaries with a proper fraction is a solution for activating hydrogen storage materials.</description>

      <title>Model of luminescence and delayed luminescence correlated blinking in single CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystals</title>

Abstract: Cesium lead halide nanocrystals and quantum dots are prominent materials for different types of applications because of their remarkable photophysical properties. However, they are also known to exhibit the same effects observed for non-perovskite colloidal semiconductor quantum dots such as blinking, photobleaching, delayed luminescence, etc. In this study we reveal the correlations between fast and delayed emission components for both the intensity and characteristic decay time for single CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystals. In order to explain the phenomena observed, we propose a novel model of single CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystals luminescence blinking based on the hypothesis of slow variations in the electron-phonon coupling.</description>

      <title>Reference compositions for bismuth telluride thermoelectric materials for low-temperature power generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06101v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectric (TE) technology enables direct heat-to-electricity conversion and is gaining attention as a clean, fuel-saving, and carbon-neutral solution for industrial, automotive, and marine applications. Despite nearly a century of research, apart from successes in deep-space power sources and solid-state cooling modules, the industrialization and commercialization of TE power generation remain limited. Since the new millennium, nanostructured bulk materials have accelerated the discovery of new TE systems. However, due to limited access to high-temperature heat sources, energy harvesting still relies almost exclusively on BiTe-based alloys, which are the only system operating stably near room temperature. Although many BiTe-based compositions have been proposed, concerns over reproducibility, reliability, and lifetime continue to hinder industrial adoption. Here, we aim to develop reference BiTe-based thermoelectric materials through data-driven analysis of Starrydata2, the world's largest thermoelectric database. We identify Bi0.46Sb1.54Te3 and Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 as the most frequently studied ternary compositions. These were synthesized using hot pressing and spark-plasma sintering. Thermoelectric properties were evaluated with respect to the processing method and measurement direction. The results align closely with the median of reported data, confirming the representativeness of the selected compositions. We propose these as reference BiTe materials, accompanied by transparent data and validated benchmarks. Their use can support the standardization of TE legs and modules while accelerating performance evaluation and industrial integration. We further estimated the performance of a thermoelectric module made from the reference composition, which gives the power output of over 2.51 W and an efficiency of 3.58% at a temperature difference of 120 K.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Graph Neural Networks to Reconstruct Local Fields Considering Finite Strain Hyperelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a physics-informed machine learning framework called P-DivGNN to reconstruct local stress fields at the micro-scale, in the context of multi-scale simulation given a periodic micro-structure mesh and mean, macro-scale, stress values. This method is based in representing a periodic micro-structure as a graph, combined with a message passing graph neural network. We are able to retrieve local stress field distributions, providing average stress values produced by a mean field reduced order model (ROM) or Finite Element (FE) simulation at the macro-scale. The prediction of local stress fields are of utmost importance considering fracture analysis or the definition of local fatigue criteria. Our model incorporates physical constraints during training to constraint local stress field equilibrium state and employs a periodic graph representation to enforce periodic boundary conditions. The benefits of the proposed physics-informed GNN are evaluated considering linear and non linear hyperelastic responses applied to varying geometries. In the non-linear hyperelastic case, the proposed method achieves significant computational speed-ups compared to FE simulation, making it particularly attractive for large-scale applications.</description>

      <title>Model-based study of a nanowire heating and dynamic axisymmetric necking by surface electromigration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axisymmetric solid-state necking of a single-crystal metallic nanowire in a thermal contact with a substrate and subjected to a surface electromigration current is accompanied by a local current crowding and a sharp rise of a resistivity of a wire material in a thinning neck. This results in a temperature spike at the neck, which feedback affects the necking via thermomigration and the temperature-dependent surface diffusivity of the adatoms. A model that incorporates these effects and couples the nonlinear dynamics of a wire temperature and a wire radius for a necking wire is presented. Conditions on the physical parameters are derived that ensure a straight wire is in the solid state prior to an onset of a morphological instability that ultimately breaks a wire via a pinch-off. The impacts of a wire radius and a wire length on the temperature spike at the break junction are studied.</description>

      <title>The role of electron interactions in a failed insulator revealed by shot noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In materials known as failed insulators, electrical resistivity increases as temperature decreases, yet does not diverge - a phenomenon inconsistent with single-particle theories. We investigate the origin of this behavior by measuring shot noise in nanojunctions of nitrogen-doped beta-Ta, a prototypical failed insulator. Junctions as short as 8 nanometers exhibit hot-electron shot noise, indicating strong electron interactions. We show that charge hopping mediated by these interactions explains the anomalous electronic properties. Our findings open new avenues for exploiting electron interactions in spin-orbitronic and superconducting applications of failed insulators.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Void-Size Distribution of Silica Glass using Persistent Homology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oxide glasses have proven to be useful across a wide range of technological applications. Nevertheless, their medium-range structure has remained elusive. Previous studies focused on the ring statistics as a metric for the medium-range structure, which, however, provides an incomplete picture of the glassy structure. Here, we use atomistic simulations and state-of-the-art topological analysis tools, namely persistent homology (PH), to analyze the medium-range structure of the archetypal oxide glass (Silica) at ambient temperatures and with varying pressures. PH presents an unbiased definition of loops and voids, providing an advantage over other methods for studying the structure and topology of complex materials, such as glasses, across multiple length scales. We captured subtle topological transitions in medium-range order and cavity distributions, providing new insights into glass structure. Our work provides a robust way for extracting the void distribution of oxide glasses based on persistent homology.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of locally modified excitonic effect within a moir\'e unit cell in twisted bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bilayer graphene, forming moir\'e superlattices, possesses distinct electronic and optical properties derived from the hybridization of energy band and the emergence of van Hove singularities depending on its twist angle. Extensive research has been conducted on the global characteristics of moir\'e superlattice induced by long-range periodicity. However, limited attention has been given to the local properties within a moir\'e unit cell, which undoubtedly differ due to the variations in three-dimensional atomic arrangement. Here we demonstrate the highly localized excitations of carbon 1s electrons to unoccupied van Hove singularities in a twisted bilayer graphene using an electron energy loss spectroscopy based on a monochromated transmission electron microscope. The core-level excitations associated with the van Hove singularities show a systematic twist angle dependence which is analogous to the optical excitations. Furthermore, local variations in those core-level van Hove singularity peaks within a moir\'e unit cell have been corroborated for the first time, which can originate from core-exciton lifetimes and band modifications influenced by the local stacking geometry.</description>

      <title>Real-space titration and manipulation of particle-like correlated electrons in doped Mott insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The localized (particle-like) correlated electrons deserve particular attention as they govern various exotic quantum phenomena, such as quantum spin liquids, Wigner crystals, and Mott insulators in correlated systems. However, direct observation and manipulation of these particle-like electrons at the atomic or single-electron scale remain highly challenging. Here, we successfully realize and directly visualize particle-like correlated electrons in 1T-TaS2 through hole doping. The potential-dependent local electronic structure of single particle-like electron is revealed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) combined with theoretical calculations. The complex correlated interactions including nearest-neighbor attractive interactions and many-body repulsive interactions are further demonstrated and discussed based on the spatial distribution of particle-like electrons. Furthermore, the tentative manipulation of the particle-like electrons is successfully achieved by the energy-excitation mechanism. Our results not only provide profound insights into particle-like electrons in correlated systems, but also establish a versatile platform for designing and controlling quantum states at the atomic scale.</description>

      <title>Tailored-light photocurrent spectroscopy for probing time-reversal symmetry-broken phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light-field-driven photocurrents represent a powerful tool for generating photocurrents without external bias in light-matter systems that lack inversion symmetry. While these photocurrents are used in electronic applications, such as current sources, switches, and photovoltaics, their presence can also be used to probe material properties in and out of equilibrium, such as topology.Here we advance this path of light-field-driven photocurrent spectroscopy by utilizing tailored laser fields for ultrafast photocurrent generation. We employ combinations of bichromatic linearly-polarized laser beams that individually respect mirror and time-reversal symmetry (TRS). Hence they do not lead to a field-driven photocurrent individually, but when superposed can break individual symmetries and generate photocurrents. For unique choices of the relative polarization angle and two-color phase the tailored light exhibits TRS while breaking all other crystal symmetries, which imposes a forbidden photocurrent selection rule in TRS-invariant systems as we show both theoretically and experimentally. We employ state-of-the-art \textit{ab-initio} simulations to validate this physical mechanism, and, crucially, predict its breaking in materials with intrinsically-broken TRS, creating a background free signal for magnetism and Chern physics. Our work paves way for probing TRS-broken phases of matter in an ultrafast time-resolved manner, not requiring the application of external magnetic fields or even circularly-polarized electric fields.</description>

      <title>Janus-faced influence of oxygen vacancy in high entropy oxide films with Mott electrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrary to traditional approaches, high entropy oxides (HEOs) strategically employ cationic disorder to engineer tunable functionalities. This disorder, stemming from multiple elements at the same crystallographic site, disrupts local symmetry and induces local distortions. By examining a series of single-crystalline [La$_{0.2}$Pr$_{0.2}$Nd$_{0.2}$Sm$_{0.2}$Eu$_{0.2}$]NiO$_{3-\delta}$ thin films, we demonstrate herein that the creation of oxygen vacancies (OVs) further offers a powerful means of tailoring electronic behavior of HEOs by concurrently introducing disorder in the oxygen sublattice and doping electrons into the system. Increasing OV concentration leads to a monotonic increase in room-temperature sheet resistance. A striking feature is the Janus-faced response of the metal-insulator transition (MIT) to OVs due to the interplay among correlation energy scales, electron doping, and disorder. Unlike the monotonous influence of OV observed for the MIT in VO$_2$ and V$_2$O$_3$, initial OV doping lowers the MIT temperature here, whereas higher OV levels completely suppress the metallic phase. Magnetotransport measurements further reveal weak localization, strong localization as a function of $\delta$. Moreover, the disorder on both $RE$ and oxygen sublattices is responsible for the Mott-Anderson insulator state. These findings surpass the scope of the recently featured `electron antidoping' effect and demonstrate the promising opportunity to utilize OV engineering of HEOs for Mottronics and optoelectronics applications.</description>

Abstract: Understanding and predicting the glassy dynamics of polymers remain fundamental challenges in soft matter physics. While the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory has been successful in describing relaxation dynamics, its practical application to polymers depends on a thermal mapping to connect theory with experiment, which in turn requires detailed thermodynamic data. Such data may not be available for chemically complex or newly designed polymers. In this work, we propose a simple approach that integrates machine learning-predicted glass transition temperatures (Tg) with a simplified thermal mapping based on an effective thermal expansion coefficient to overcome these limitations. This approach can provide quantitatively accurate predictions of relaxation dynamics across a broad range of polymers. Rather than replacing the original thermal mapping, our method complements it by trading formal rigor for computational efficiency and broader applicability in high-throughput screening and materials with limited available data. Moreover, we introduce a physically motivated modification to the thermal mapping that resolves discrepancies in the description of low-Tg polymers. Our results establish a generalizable approach for predictive modeling of glassy polymer dynamics and point toward new directions for theory-guided materials discovery.</description>

Abstract: Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) behavior in one-dimensional systems has been predicted and shown to occur at semiconductor-to-metal transitions within two-dimensional materials. Reports of one-dimensional defects hosting a Fermi liquid or a TLL have suggested a dependence on the underlying substrate, however, unveiling the physical details of electronic contributions from the substrate require cross-correlative investigation. Here, we study TLL formation within defectively engineered WS$_2$ atop graphene, where band structure and the atomic environment is visualized with nano angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, and non-contact atomic force microscopy. Correlations between the local density of states and electronic band dispersion elucidated the electron transfer from graphene into a TLL hosted by one-dimensional metal (1DM) defects. It appears that the vertical heterostructure with graphene and the induced charge transfer from graphene into the 1DM is critical for the formation of a TLL.</description>

      <title>Strong Temperature Dependence of Thermal Conductivity in High-Purity Cubic Boron Arsenide</title>

Abstract: Materials with high thermal conductivity are needed to conduct heat away from hot spots in high power electronics and optoelectronic devices. Cubic boron arsenide (c-BAs) has a high thermal conductivity due to its special phonon dispersion relation. Previous experimental studies of c-BAs report a room-temperature thermal conductivity between 1000 and 1300 W m-1 K-1. We synthesized high purity isotopically enriched c-BAs single crystals with room-temperature thermal conductivity of around 1500 W m-1 K-1. Using time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR), we measured thermal conductivity and found a 1/T2 temperature dependence between 300 K and 600 K - slightly stronger than predictions from state-of-the-art theoretical models. Brillouin and Raman scattering revealed minimal changes in phonon frequencies over the same temperature range, suggesting that the observed 1/T2 dependence is not caused by temperature dependent changes in phonon dispersion. To probe defect densities in the BAs crystals we studied, we conducted transient reflectivity microscopy (TRM) measurements of absorption at sub-bandgap photon energies. We observe a correlation between TRM signal intensity and thermal conductivity. Notably, samples with thermal conductivity near 1500 W m-1 K-1 still exhibited nonzero TRM signals, suggesting the presence of defects despite the high thermal conductivity.</description>

      <title>Slip-dominated structural transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04066v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use molecular dynamics to show that plastic slip is a crucial component of the transformation mechanism of a square-to-triangular structural transition. The latter is a stylized analog of many other reconstructive phase transitions. To justify our conclusions we use a novel atomistically-informed mesoscopic representation of the field of lattice distortions in molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach reveals a hidden alternating slip distribution behind the seemingly homogeneous product phase which points to the fact that lattice invariant shears play a central role in this class of phase transformations. While the underlying pattern of anti-parallel displacements may be also interpreted as microscopic shuffling, its precise crystallographic nature strongly suggests the plasticity-centered interpretation.</description>

      <title>Competing phases of HfO$_2$ from unstable flat phonon bands of an unconventional high-symmetry structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carry out first-principles calculations to demonstrate that the complex energy landscape and competing phases of HfO$_2$ can be understood from the four unstable flat phonon bands of an unconventional high-symmetry structure of HfO$_2$ with the space group $Cmma$. We consider structures generated from the $Cmma$ reference structure by all possible combinations of the zone center and zone boundary modes belonging to the unstable flat phonon branches. We find 12 distinct locally-stable structures, of which 5 correspond to well-known phases. We also show that 8 of these 12 structures can be described as period-2 superlattices of the ferroelectric $Pca2_1$ (oIII), ferroelectric $Pnm2_1$ (oIV), monoclinic $P2_1/c$ (m) and distorted monoclinic $P2_1/c$ (dm) structures. We demonstrate how the unstable flat phonon bands can explain the atomically thin grain boundaries in the various types of superlattices. Finally, we point out that arbitrary-period HfO$_2$ superlattices derived from the 6 different types of period-2 superlattices are expected to form based on the flatness of the unstable phonon branches. The organizing principle provided by this work deepens our understanding of the underlying physics in the phase stability of HfO$_2$ and provides guidance for functional phase stabilization.</description>

      <title>Embrittling bulk metals into hydride in acidic medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogen embrittlement (HE), in which the hydrogen infiltrates metal lattices to form hydrides, typically causes catastrophic failure. Inspired by HE effects, we synthesized 18 high-purity metal hydrides (MgH2, ScH2, YH2, LaH2, LaH2.3, SmH2, LuH2, TiH2, {\delta}-ZrH1.6, {\epsilon}-ZrH2, HfH1.7, HfH2, VH0.8, VH2, NbH, NbH2, Ta2H, and TaH) , using bulk metal foils as precursors and sulfuric/oleic acid as hydrogen donors. Through high-pressure experiments and theoretical calculations, the physical critical pressure ({\Delta}Pph) and equivalent pressure ({\Delta}Peq) concept were introduced to elucidate the mechanisms of the synthesizing and stabilizing metal hydrides. Quantitative analysis of 18 metal hydrides establishes that the criterion |{\Delta}Peq| &gt; {\Delta}Pph governs HE-driven hydride synthesis. Conversely, when |{\Delta}Peq| &lt; {\Delta}Pph , hydrogen-induced brittle fracture initiates. This mechanism enables the synthesis of challenging hydrides (LiH) while concurrently explaining failure modes in metals such as Fe. Our approach successfully converts HE from a primary culprit of material failure to an effective contributor in hydride synthesis.</description>

      <title>Floquet-Engineering Weyl Points and Linked Fermi Arcs from Straight Nodal Lines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Floquet engineering provides a powerful and flexible method for modifying the band structures of quantum materials. While circularly polarized light has been shown to convert curved nodal lines in three-dimensional semimetals into Weyl points, such a transformation is forbidden for an isolated straight nodal line. In this work, we uncover a dramatic shift in this paradigm when multiple straight nodal lines intersect. We observe that circularly polarized light not only gaps them into Weyl points but also induces unprecedented surface-state Fermi arcs that extend across the entire surface Brillouin zone and form a linked topological structure. These findings advance our fundamental understanding of light-driven transitions in topological semimetals and unveil a unique Weyl semimetal phase defined by linked Fermi arcs. We discuss potential exotic phenomena arising from this phase, applications of our predictions to spin-splitting antiferromagnets, and the extension of this Weyl semimetal phase to classical systems.</description>

      <title>DFT-Guided Operando Raman Characterization of Ni-Based Phases Relevant to Electrochemical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a phase-resolved investigation of Ni-based oxides and hydroxides relevant to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), combining ground-state DFT+U calculations with operando and in situ Raman spectroscopy, supported by high-resolution TEM. Five crystalline phases-cubic and hexagonal NiO, monoclinic and trigonal Ni(OH)2, and NiOOH-are systematically characterized in terms of their vibrational and electronic structure. Although the DFT models are idealized (0 K, defect-free, no solvation), they serve as clean, phase-specific references for interpreting complex experimental spectra. Cubic NiO is confirmed to be dynamically and electronically stable, consistent with dominant Raman modes observed experimentally. Despite dynamic instabilities in phonon dispersions, hexagonal NiO is structurally verified via TEM, suggesting substrate- or defect-stabilized metastability. Ni(OH)2 polymorphs are both vibrationally stable semiconductors, with the trigonal phase exhibiting stronger spin polarization. NiOOH exhibits spin-polarized electronic states across the Brillouin zone, consistent with its asymmetric band structure under ferromagnetic ordering. Independently, phonon calculations reveal soft modes near the Gamma-point, indicating dynamic instability under idealized conditions, yet operando Raman spectra align closely with calculated zone-center modes. However, introducing 0.03 Angstrom symmetry-breaking displacements relaxes the NiOOH lattice off its saddle point, removing imaginary phonon modes and stabilizing the phase. This integrated framework demonstrates how idealized DFT can reveal intrinsic fingerprints that anchor the interpretation of vibrational and electronic responses in catalytically active, dynamically evolving Ni-based materials.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Study of the Surface Reconstructions of Cu$_{2}$O(111) Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The atomic structure of the most stable reconstructed surface of cuprous oxide (Cu$_{2}$O)(111) surface has been a longstanding topic of debate. In this study, we develop on-the-fly machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) to systematically investigate the various reconstructions of the Cu$_{2}$O(111) surface under stoichiometric as well as O- and Cu-deficient or rich conditions, focusing on both ($\sqrt{3}$$\times$$\sqrt{3}$)R30{\deg} and (2$\times$2) supercells. By utilizing parallel tempering simulations supported by MLFFs, we confirm that the previously described nanopyramidal and Cu-deficient (1$\times$1) structures are the lowest energy structures from moderately to strong oxidizing conditions. In addition, we identify two promising nanopyramidal reconstructions at highly reducing conditions, a stoichiometric and a Cu-rich one. Surface energy calculations performed using spin-polarized PBE, PBE+U, r$^{2}$SCAN, and HSE06 functionals show that the previously known Cu-deficient configuration and nanopyramidal configurations are at the convex hull (and, thus, equilibrium structures) for all functionals, whereas the stability of the other structures depends on the functional and is therefore uncertain. Our findings demonstrate that on-the-fly trained MLFFs provide a simple, efficient, and rapid approach to explore the complex surface reconstructions commonly encountered in experimental studies, and also enhance our understanding of the stability of Cu$_{2}$O(111) surfaces.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic weighted sums with magnetic skyrmions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating magnetic skyrmions into neuromorphic computing could help improve hardware efficiency and computational power. However, developing a scalable implementation of the weighted sum of neuron signals - a core operation in neural networks - has remained a challenge. Here, we show that weighted sum operations can be performed in a compact, biologically-inspired manner by using the non-volatile and particle-like characteristics of magnetic skyrmions that make them easily countable and summable. The skyrmions are electrically generated in numbers proportional to an input with an efficiency given by a non-volatile weight. The chiral particles are then directed using localized current injections to a location where their presence is quantified through non-perturbative electrical measurements. Our experimental demonstration, which currently has two inputs, can be scaled to accommodate multiple inputs and outputs using a crossbar array design, potentially nearing the energy efficiency observed in biological systems.</description>

      <title>Fingerprints of a charge ice state in the doped Mott insulator Nb$_3$Cl$_8$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between strong electronic correlations and the inherent frustration of certain lattice geometries is a common mechanism for the formation of nontrivial states of matter. In this work, we theoretically explore the collective electronic effects in the monolayer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$, a recently discovered triangular lattice Mott insulator. Our advanced many-body numerical simulations predict the emergence of a phase separation region upon doping this material. Notably, in close proximity to the phase separation, the static charge susceptibility undergoes a drastic change and reveals a distinctive bow-tie structure in momentum space. The appearance of such a fingerprint in the context of spin degrees of freedom would indicate the formation of a spin ice state. This finding allows us to associate the observed phase separation to a charge ice state, a state with a remarkable power law dependence of both the effective exchange interaction and correlations between electronic densities in real space.</description>

      <title>LiV2O4: Hund-Assisted Orbital-Selective Mottness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the remarkably small Fermi-liquid coherence scale and large effective mass observed in LiV$_2$O$_4$ are due to the proximity of a Hund-assisted orbital-selective Mott state. Our work is based on an ab initio dynamical mean-field approach, combining several quantum impurity solvers to capture the physics from high to very low temperature. We find that the Hund coupling plays a crucial role in rearranging the orbital populations and in generating the heavy mass and low coherence scale. The latter is found to be approximately 1-2 Kelvin, even though the most correlated orbital is found to be significantly doped ~10% away from half-filling. A flat quasiparticle band appears near the Fermi level as a result of the strong electronic correlations. Finally, we discuss our results in comparison to experiments.</description>

      <title>Adsorb-Agent: Autonomous Identification of Stable Adsorption Configurations via Large Language Model Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16658v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adsorption energy is a key reactivity descriptor in catalysis. Determining adsorption energy requires evaluating numerous adsorbate-catalyst configurations, making it computationally intensive. Current methods rely on exhaustive sampling, which does not guarantee the identification of the global minimum energy. To address this, we introduce Adsorb-Agent, a Large Language Model (LLM) agent designed to efficiently identify stable adsorption configurations corresponding to the global minimum energy. Adsorb-Agent leverages its built-in knowledge and reasoning to strategically explore configurations, significantly reducing the number of initial setups required while improving energy prediction accuracy. In this study, we also evaluated the performance of different LLMs, including GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and DeepSeek-Chat, as the reasoning engine for Adsorb-Agent, with GPT-4o showing the strongest overall performance. Tested on twenty diverse systems, Adsorb-Agent identifies comparable adsorption energies for 84% of cases and achieves lower energies for 35%, particularly excelling in complex systems. It identifies lower energies in 47% of intermetallic systems and 67% of systems with large adsorbates. These findings demonstrate Adsorb-Agent's potential to accelerate catalyst discovery by reducing computational costs and enhancing prediction reliability compared to exhaustive search methods.</description>

      <title>Subnanometric control of coupling between WS$_2$ monolayers with a molecular spacer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stacking monolayer semiconductors into heterostructures allows for control of their optical and electronic properties, offering advantages for nanoscale electronics, optoelectronics, and photonics. Specifically, adding a thin spacer between monolayers can yield bulk materials that retain interesting monolayer properties, such as a direct bandgap and a high emission quantum efficiency. The interaction mechanisms between monolayers, including interlayer coupling, charge transfer, and energy transfer, might be tuned through subnanometric control over the spacer thickness. Traditional spacer materials like bulk oxides or other layered materials can suffer from poor material interfaces or inhomogeneous thickness over large areas. Here, we use a spin-cast organic molecular spacer to adjust interlayer coupling in WS$_2$ monolayer stacks. We vary the molecular spacer thickness to tune the interlayer distance, significantly altering the optical properties of the resulting organic-inorganic heterostructures. Additionally, we demonstrate a dependence of the valence-band splitting on molecular spacer thickness manifested as a change in the energy difference between A and B excitons resulting from spin-orbit coupling and interlayer interactions. Our results illustrate the potential of molecular spacers to tailor the properties of monolayer heterostructures. This accessible approach opens new routes to advance atomically thin devices and could enable sensing technologies at the subnanometer scale.</description>
