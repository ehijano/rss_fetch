Abstract: Bibliometric measures, such as total citations and h-index, have become a cornerstone for evaluating academic performance; however, these traditional metrics, being non-weighted, inadequately capture the nuances of individual contributions. To address this constraint, we developed GScholarLens, an open-access browser extension that integrates seamlessly with Google Scholar to enable detailed bibliometric analysis. GScholarLens categorizes publications by authorship roles, adjusts citation weightings accordingly, and introduces Scholar h-index, Sh-index, an authorship-contribution normalized h-index. This tool proportionally weights citations based on authorship position using heuristic percentages, i.e., corresponding 100 percent, first 90 percent, second 50 percent, co-authors in publications with less than six authors 25 percent, and co-authors with more than six authors 10 percent. Currently, there is no empirical data available for author-contribution weights, however, this proof-of-concept framework can easily adapt more precise author-contribution weightage data decided by authors at the time of manuscript submission along with CRediT, which journals and publishers can mandate. Furthermore, this tool incorporates retraction detection by mapping data from retraction databases into the Google Scholar interface. By aligning bibliometric evaluation more closely with actual scholarly contribution, GScholarLens presents a better open-access framework for academic recognition, particularly within interdisciplinary and highly collaborative research environments. This tool is freely accessible at https://project.iith.ac.in/sharmaglab/gscholarlens/.</description>
