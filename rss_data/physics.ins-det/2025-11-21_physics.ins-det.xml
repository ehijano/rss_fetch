      <title>Geant4 based library SCoRe4 for Surface Contamination and Roughness Effects simulations in rare event search experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface simulations are important for accurately modeling particle interactions in experiments where background contributions from surface contaminants can significantly affect detector performance. In rare event searches, such as dark matter or neutrinoless double beta decay experiments, standard Geant4 simulations typically assume perfectly smooth surfaces, neglecting the microscopic roughness that exists in real materials. This simplification can lead to inaccurate predictions of energy deposition. To address this limitation, I developed SCoRe4, a Geant4-based library designed to simulate more realistic surface roughness based on experimentally measurable parameters. The code allows users to generate patches of simplified rough surface geometries across a wide range of scales - from square millimeters to square meters - while maintaining computational efficiency. SCoRe4 is open source and can be easily integrated into existing Geant4 setups. This work presents the structure, implementation, and example application of SCoRe4,as well as its potential use in improving the accuracy of background modeling in rare event physics.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Low-energy Ionization Signals in Silicon Detectors for the Nab Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nab (Neutron a b) experiment is designed to measure the beta-antineutrino angular correlation in free neutron $\beta$ decay with an ultimate precision goal of 0.1%, providing input for tests of Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix unitarity. This measurement is performed via detection of electrons and protons in delayed coincidence using custom large-area segmented silicon drift detectors. We present the characterization of one such detector system to establish the proton energy and timing response, using a dedicated proton accelerator. The detected proton peak was studied for 25 keV, 30 keV, and 35 keV incident protons on a set of detector segments and multiple cooling cycles over a one year period. Ionization losses were consistent with models of the detector dead layer with thicknesses less than 100nm. The detected proton peak was stable within the uncertainty from energy calibration (0.2 keV). The rise times of detector pulses from $^{109}$Cd and $^{113}$Sn conversion electron sources were used to extract the impurity density profile and establish a precise model for the detector timing response. The observed impurity density profile varied from $(2 \pm 2) \times 10^9$ cm$^{-3}$ at the center to $(26 \pm 2) \times 10^9$ cm$^{-3}$ at the edge. This impurity density profile was then used to characterize systematic effects in proton time-of-flight measurements due to detector pulse-shape effects; the resultant proton timing systematic uncertainties were below 0.3 ns, which is sufficient for the Nab experiment.</description>

      <title>Multiplexed SiPM Readout of Plastic Scintillating Fiber Detector for Muon Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Muon tomography is a non-destructive imaging technique that uses cosmic-ray muons to probe dense materials. A plastic scintillating fiber (SciFi) detector with a one-dimensional SiPM array offers a compact, high-resolution solution. However, scaling up the detector area and spatial resolution demands reducing the number of readout channels while maintaining detector performance. To address this challenge, this work presents a multiplexing scheme based on a diode-based symmetric charge division circuit combined with a position-encoding algorithm. Circuit simulations confirm the feasibility of the multiplexing design and guide the selection of suitable diodes to preserve SiPM signal integrity. Electronic tests show that the proposed design exhibits low crosstalk among electronic channels, and preserves linearity over a dynamic range spanning a few to several hundred photoelectrons. Cosmic-ray measurements further demonstrate that the multiplexed SciFi detector achieves a detection efficiency above 95\% and a spatial resolution of about 0.65~mm, with only minor degradation compared to direct readout. These results verify that the proposed method offers a scalable and cost-effective readout solution for large-area muon tomography systems.</description>

      <title>Development &amp; Characterization of Electrodes for large-scale Xenon Time Projection Chambers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual-phase liquid xenon time projection chambers are the core detector elements of many experiments that conduct searches for Dark Matter and rare events, as well as in neutrino and high-energy physics. As part of this detector technology, high-voltage electrodes are instrumental for the generation of observable signals and their physical interpretation. Thus, electrode design and manufacturing has to fulfill stringent requirements, and their production is associated with significant engineering challenges. In this work we describe the successful development of electrodes on the 1.5 m-scale, from their design and simulation to subsequent assembly and high-voltage testing in a gaseous argon environment. The produced electrodes were recently installed as an anode and a cathode during an upgrade to the XENONnT experiment.</description>

      <title>Efficient and affordable thermoelectric measurement setup using Arduino and LabVIEW for education and research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials can convert thermal energy into electricity, making them promising candidates for harvesting waste heat, an increasingly important challenge in the energy-intensive modern world. The search for improved thermoelectric materials is therefore an active area of research in materials physics. Despite their fundamental and practical significance, thermoelectric properties - such as the Seebeck coefficient and power factor - are rarely explored in student labs due to the complexity in measurement schemes and requirement for sophisticated equipment. In this work, we present a user-friendly, low-cost and efficient thermoelectric measurement system built with Arduino and LabVIEW, which can simultaneously measure Seebeck coefficients and power factors as a function of temperature. This was made possible by improving the resolution of Arduino over ~1000 times with amplifiers and noise reduction schemes. With a total cost of only ~$100 and simple measurement protocols, this setup is well suited not only for student labs but also for efficient thermoelectric research.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design and construction of a neutron shielding for the SND@LHC detector, which utilizes a combination of plexiglass and borated polyethylene, is presented. FLUKA simulations were employed to optimize the shielding configuration and assess its efficiency. Results indicate a significant reduction in neutron flux, ensuring the long-term stability of the emulsion films used in the target of the SND@LHC detector.</description>

      <title>Advancing the CMS Level-1 Trigger: Jet Tagging with DeepSets at the HL-LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the High Luminosity LHC, selecting important physics processes such as (di-) Higgs production will be a high priority. The Phase-2 Upgrade of the CMS Level-1 Trigger will reconstruct particle candidates and use pileup mitigation for the 200 simultaneous proton-proton interactions. A fast cone algorithm will reconstruct jets from these particles, providing access to jet constituents for the first time. We introduce a new multi-class jet tagger with a small, quantized DeepSets neural network. The tagger, trained on a mix of simulated CMS events, predicts various hadronic and leptonic classes. We present the tagger, its performance, and its improvements for triggering on (di-) Higgs events.</description>
