      <title>A Data-Driven Model for the Field Emission from Broad-Area Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron emission from cathodes in high field gradients is a quantum tunneling effect. The Fowler-Nordheim (FN) equation has traditionally been key in describing cold-field emissions, offering estimates for emitters for almost a century. Nevertheless, applying FN theory in practice is often constrained by the lack of data on the distribution and geometry of the emission sites. Predictions become more challenging with an uneven electric field distribution at the cathode surface. Consequently, FN formulations are frequently calibrated using current-voltage data after test, reducing their effectiveness as truly predictive models.
  This study proposes the development of a data-informed predictive model of field emission that leverages (1) vast experimental data, (2) electrostatic simulations of the cathode surface, and (3) detailed material and geometric properties to overcome these limitations. The goal is to harness this comprehensive dataset to train a machine learning model capable of providing precise predictions of the cathode current, thereby enhancing the understanding and application of field emission phenomena. More than 259 hours of experimental data have been processed to train and benchmark some of the well-known machine learning models. After two stages of optimization, a coefficient of determination $&gt;98\%$ is achieved in the prediction total field emission current using ensemble models.</description>

      <title>Elastic wave control in reticulated plates using Schwarz primitive cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the Schwarz primitive unit cell is used as the building block of different types of metastructures for steering and focusing elastic vibrations. The emergence of a Bragg-type bandgap when constructing a two-dimensional plate from such unit cells is experimentally validated. It is demonstrated that increasing both mass and porosity of the Schwarz primitive leads to a decrease in the frequency of the out-of-plane propagating wave targeted in this study. By arranging these modified Schwarz primitive unit cells in constant and graded layouts, two-dimensional plates with an embedded metabarrier and a metalens are numerically designed. The metabarrier protects an interior area of the plate from the propagating waves on a wide frequency band (approx. 1.4-3.4 kHz). Equally, the refractive index profile necessary for gradient index lenses is obtained via a progressive variation of the added mass or, alternatively, the porosity of the unit cell over a rectangular area. For the first time, bending of the out-of-plane mode towards the focusing point is practically validated in a challenging mesoscale experiment requiring the assembly of different three-dimensional printed sections of the plate. The increased porosity design is advantageous not only in terms of overall lightweight, but also towards additive manufacturing as it requires less material.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Boosted Entropy-Engineered Synthesis of stable Nanometric Solid Solution CuCo Alloys for Efficient Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanometric solid solution alloys are utilized in a broad range of fields, including catalysis, energy storage, medical application, and sensor technology. Unfortunately, the synthesis of these alloys becomes increasingly challenging as the disparity between the metal elements grows, due to differences in atomic sizes, melting points, and chemical affinities. This study utilized a data-driven approach incorporating sample balancing enhancement techniques and multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms to improve the model's ability to handle imbalanced data, significantly boosting the efficiency of experimental parameter optimization. Building on this enhanced data processing framework, we developed an entropy-engineered synthesis approach specifically designed to produce stable, nanometric copper and cobalt (CuCo) solid solution alloys. Under conditions of -0.425 V (vs. RHE), the CuCo alloy exhibited nearly 100% Faraday efficiency (FE) and a high ammonia production rate of 232.17 mg h-1 mg-1. Stability tests in a simulated industrial environment showed that the catalyst maintained over 80% FE and an ammonia production rate exceeding 170 mg h-1 mg-1 over a testing period of 120 hours, outperforming most reported catalysts. To delve deeper into the synergistic interaction mechanisms between Cu and Co, in situ Raman spectroscopy was utilized for realtime monitoring, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations further substantiated our findings. These results not only highlight the exceptional catalytic performance of the CuCo alloy but also reflect the effective electronic and energy interactions between the two metals.</description>

      <title>Invariant Discovery of Features Across Multiple Length Scales: Applications in Microscopy and Autonomous Materials Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical imaging is a foundational characterization method in areas from condensed matter physics and chemistry to astronomy and spans length scales from atomic to universe. Images encapsulate crucial data regarding atomic bonding, materials microstructures, and dynamic phenomena such as microstructural evolution and turbulence, among other phenomena. The challenge lies in effectively extracting and interpreting this information. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have emerged as powerful tools for identifying underlying factors of variation in image data, providing a systematic approach to distilling meaningful patterns from complex datasets. However, a significant hurdle in their application is the definition and selection of appropriate descriptors reflecting local structure. Here we introduce the scale-invariant VAE approach (SI-VAE) based on the progressive training of the VAE with the descriptors sampled at different length scales. The SI-VAE allows the discovery of the length scale dependent factors of variation in the system. Here, we illustrate this approach using the ferroelectric domain images and generalize it to the movies of the electron-beam induced phenomena in graphene and topography evolution across combinatorial libraries. This approach can further be used to initialize the decision making in automated experiments including structure-property discovery and can be applied across a broad range of imaging methods. This approach is universal and can be applied to any spatially resolved data including both experimental imaging studies and simulations, and can be particularly useful for exploration of phenomena such as turbulence, scale-invariant transformation fronts, etc.</description>

      <title>Microwave resonator-enabled broadband on-chip electro-optic frequency comb generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical frequency combs play a crucial role in optical communications, time-frequency metrology, precise ranging, and sensing. Among various generation schemes, resonant electro-optic combs are particularly attractive for its excellent stability, flexibility and broad bandwidths. In this approach, an optical pump undergoes multiple electro-optic modulation processes in a high-Q optical resonator, resulting in cascaded spectral sidebands. However, most resonant electro-optic combs to date make use of lumped-capacitor electrodes with relatively inefficient utilization of the input electrical power. This design also reflects most electrical power back to the driving circuits and necessitates costly RF isolators in between, presenting substantial challenges in practical applications. To address these issues, we present an RF circuit friendly electro-optic frequency comb generator incorporated with on-chip coplanar microwave resonator electrodes, based on a thin-film lithium niobate platform. Our design achieves more than three times electrical power reduction with minimal reflection at the designed comb repetition rate of ~ 25 GHz. We experimentally demonstrate broadband electro-optic frequency comb generation with a comb span of &gt;85 nm at a moderate electrical driving power of 740 mW (28.7 dBm). Our power-efficient and isolator-free electro-optic comb source could offer compact, low-cost and simple-to-design solution for applications in spectroscopy, high-precise metrology, optical communications.</description>

      <title>Using low-cost Blu-Ray Optical Pickup Units for Measurement of Single Photon Emission from NV-Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a cost-effective method for collecting single photons emitted from single nitrogen-vacancy centers in nanodiamonds. Conventional components of a confocal laser-scanning microscope, such as microscope objectives and the piezo translation stages, are replaced by two affordable Blu-ray optical pickup units. A Hanbury Brown and Twiss setup is used to identify single photon emission. The proposed approach is inexpensive and simple and lowers the entry-level to single photon research for quantum technologies. This enables student lab experiments or demonstration experiments at schools and shows that efficient sources of quantum light can be made from standard components compatible with established industry processes.</description>

      <title>Polarization-controlled non-Hermitian metasurfaces for ultra-sensitive terahertz sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), where eigenvalues and eigenstates coalesce, offer significant advantages in sensor design. However, the extreme sensitivity near EPs poses significant challenges due to fabrication errors and noises, which degrade sensing performance. To address this, we introduce a novel approach leveraging the polarization degree of freedom to achieve controllable EPs. By expressing tunable polarization as equivalent gain, we establish a direct relation between the polarization of the incident light and the phase of the coupled system, and achieve the polarization-controlled singularity even post-fabrication. The polarization angle can be utilized as a sensing index, which enables indirect and accurate measurement near the EPs. The theoretical approach is experimentally validated using a general design of THz non-Hermitian metasurface sensors. Our results indicate that this method enhances robustness and sensitivity, opening new avenues for practical applications in ultra-sensitive sensing.</description>

      <title>Controlled improvement in the radar absorption by bilayer magnetic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A strong increase of the reflection loss (from 25 up to 35 dBs) and an extension of the absorption bandwidth up to 20% under far-field real radar conditions are experimentally reported in this work by creating a functional bilayer system. Each layer consists of a composite material, typically a dielectric matrix filled with magnetic entities (powder or wires). Combining the two types of materials into a bilayer structure has shown unprecedented improvements in microwave absorption capacities compared to the former absorption of each layer. The potential of random magnets to create thin broadband absorbers is also demonstrated. The capacity to improve the shielding behavior is strongly related to each layer's permittivity, permeability, and thickness. This provides strong control over the design of novel materials for stealth applications.</description>

Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate an innovative stock index prediction method using a weighted optical reservoir computing system. We construct fundamental market data combined with macroeconomic data and technical indicators to capture the broader behavior of the stock market. Our approach shows significant higher performance than state-of-the-art methods such as linear regression, decision trees, and neural network architectures including long short-term memory. It captures well the market's high volatility and nonlinear behaviors despite limited data, demonstrating great potential for real-time, parallel, multi-dimensional data processing and predictions.</description>

      <title>Hybrid electroluminescence device for on-demand single photon generation at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research focused on single photon emitters (SPEs) hosted by layered semiconductors, particularly hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), has revealed a promising alternative to quantum dots (QDs) for generating single, indistinguishable photons. hBN-based SPEs offer lower material costs, room temperature emission, and easy integration into potential optoelectronic devices due to the layered structure of the host crystal. This work presents compact hybrid electroluminescence devices, in which GaN laser diodes (LDs) are used for bottom-to-top excitation of hBN nanoflakes deposited on the laser facets. Our approach circumvents the issue of electroluminescence generation from hBN and provides access to the SPE's signal without optical driving by an external laser. Using laser diodes upgraded with Bragg reflectors a room-temperature generation of single photons from hBN is confirmed by an 80%-dip in their g(2) second-order correlation. The on-demand emission of single photons at room temperature is demonstrated by driving the laser diodes in pulsed operation, with confidence supported by a measured g(2)(0) value of 0.37.</description>

      <title>Thermal Conductivity Predictions with Foundation Atomistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have led to foundation models for atomistic materials chemistry, potentially enabling quantum-accurate descriptions of interatomic forces at reduced computational cost. These models are benchmarked by predicting materials' properties over large databases; however, these computationally intensive tests have been limited to basic quantities related to harmonic phonons, leaving uncertainty about the reliability for complex, technologically and experimentally relevant anharmonic heat-conduction properties. Here we present an automated framework that relies on foundation models to compute microscopic vibrational properties, and employs them within the Wigner formulation of heat transport to predict the macroscopic thermal conductivity in solids with arbitrary composition and structure. We apply this framework with the foundation models M3GNet, CHGNet, MACE-MP-0, and SevenNET to 103 diverse compounds, comparing predictions against first-principles references and introducing a benchmark metric based on conductivity. This framework paves the way for physics-aware, accurate predictions of vibrational and thermal properties, and for uncovering materials that violate semiclassical Boltzmann transport and feature exceptional heat-shielding or thermoelectric performance.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate an efficient swithcable spintronic THz emission from a Co(2nm)/Pt(2nm) bilayer split into a grating of micro- or nanostripes in applied external magnetic field of the order of 10mT. The THz signal is effectively emitted if the samples are magnetized perpendicular to the stripes direction and decreases upon a 90-degree rotation of a sample. The maximal 27-fold ratio of amplitude change is achieved for the sample with a $2 \mu m$ width of stripes. For the samples with easy magnetization axis directed perpendicular to stripes the THz signal is linearly polarized in the direction of the stripes and abruptly switches during the sample re-magnetization process. If the easy axis is along the stripes the THz source is almost switched off in a zero magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Pyramid diffractive optical networks for unidirectional image magnification and demagnification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffractive deep neural networks (D2NNs) are composed of successive transmissive layers optimized using supervised deep learning to all-optically implement various computational tasks between an input and output field-of-view (FOV). Here, we present a pyramid-structured diffractive optical network design (which we term P-D2NN), optimized specifically for unidirectional image magnification and demagnification. In this design, the diffractive layers are pyramidally scaled in alignment with the direction of the image magnification or demagnification. This P-D2NN design creates high-fidelity magnified or demagnified images in only one direction, while inhibiting the image formation in the opposite direction - achieving the desired unidirectional imaging operation using a much smaller number of diffractive degrees of freedom within the optical processor volume. Furthermore, P-D2NN design maintains its unidirectional image magnification/demagnification functionality across a large band of illumination wavelengths despite being trained with a single wavelength. We also designed a wavelength-multiplexed P-D2NN, where a unidirectional magnifier and a unidirectional demagnifier operate simultaneously in opposite directions, at two distinct illumination wavelengths. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by cascading multiple unidirectional P-D2NN modules, we can achieve higher magnification factors. The efficacy of the P-D2NN architecture was also validated experimentally using terahertz illumination, successfully matching our numerical simulations. P-D2NN offers a physics-inspired strategy for designing task-specific visual processors.</description>

      <title>The hBN defects database: a theoretical compilation of color centers in hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have become an intensively researched system due to their potential applications in quantum technologies. There has been a large variety of defects being fabricated, yet, for many of them, the atomic origin remains unclear. The direct imaging of the defect is technically very challenging, in particular since, in a diffraction-limited spot, there are many defects and then one has to identify the one that is optically active. Another approach is to compare the photophysical properties with theoretical simulations and identify which defect has a matching signature. It has been shown that a single property for this is insufficient and causes misassignments. Here, we publish a density functional theory (DFT)-based searchable online database covering the electronic structure of hBN defects (257 triplet and 211 singlet configurations), as well as their photophysical fingerprint (excited state lifetime, quantum efficiency, transition dipole moment and orientation, polarization visibility, and many more). All data is open-source and publicly accessible at https://h-bn.info and can be downloaded. It is possible to enter the experimentally observed defect signature and the database will output possible candidates which can be narrowed down by entering as many observed properties as possible. The database will be continuously updated with more defects and new photophysical properties (which can also be specifically requested by any users). The database therefore allows one to reliably identify defects but also investigate which defects might be promising for magnetic field sensing or quantum memory applications.</description>
