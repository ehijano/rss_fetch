      <title>Modeling bacterial flow field with regularized singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The flow field generated by a swimming bacterium serves as a fundamental building block for understanding hydrodynamic interactions between bacteria. Although the flow field generated by a force dipole (stresslet) well captures the fluid motion in the far field limit, the stresslet description does not work in the near-field limit, which can be important in microswimmer interactions. Here we propose the model combining an anisotropically regularized stresslet with an isotropically regularized source dipole, and it nicely reproduces the flow field around a swimming bacterium, which is validated by the experimental measurements of the flow field around \textit{E. coli} and our boundary-element-method simulations of a helical microswimmer, in both cases of the free space and the confined space with a no-slip wall. This work provides a practical tool for obtaining the flow field of the bacterium, and can be utilised to study the collective responses of bacteria in dense suspensions.</description>

      <title>Intensity-based Segmentation of Tissue Images Using a U-Net with a Pretrained ResNet-34 Encoder: Application to Mueller Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manual annotation of the images of thin tissue sections remains a time-consuming step in Mueller microscopy and limits its scalability. We present a novel automated approach using only the total intensity M11 element of the Mueller matrix as an input to a U-Net architecture with a pretrained ResNet-34 encoder. The network was trained to distinguish four classes in the images of murine uterine cervix sections: background, internal os, cervical tissue, and vaginal wall. With only 70 cervical tissue sections, the model achieved 89.71% pixel accuracy and 80.96% mean tissue Dice coefficient on the held-out test dataset. Transfer learning from ImageNet enables accurate segmentation despite limited size of training dataset typical of specialized biomedical imaging. This intensity-based framework requires minimal preprocessing and is readily extensible to other imaging modalities and tissue types, with publicly available graphical annotation tools for practical deployment.</description>

      <title>The unified cross-disciplinary model of the operation of neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11448v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics perfectly describes neuronal operation, provided that we take into account that biology uses slow, positively charged ions rather than electrons as charge carriers and remove untested ad hoc hypotheses that contradict science's first principles. We also incorporate recent experimental discoveries into the outdated classic theoretical description. Lipid mechanisms are really very important for cellular biology, but they are certainly not suitable for describing the phenomena we discuss. We introduce the correct physical model, significantly enhancing the classic \gls{HH} model; furthermore, the fundamentally bio-electrically triggered operation leads to changes in the electrical, mechanical, and thermodynamic properties of living matter. We derive the resting potential from first principles of science, showing that it is unrelated to an ad hoc linear combination of mobilities or reversal potentials, as the \gls{GHK} equation claims. Furthermore, we derive an "equivalent thermodynamic electric field" that enables discussion of, among others, the operation of ion channels, their ion selectivity, and voltage sensing. We demonstrate that a simple electrical-thermodynamic control circuit regulates neuronal operation, setting and maintaining a stable resting potential and handling an unstable transient process known as the \gls{AP}. Its setpoint entirely defines the resting potential, explaining its robustness during growth and evolution. Our cross-disciplinary approach naturally fuses the electrical and mechanical/thermodynamic description of neuronal operation, resolves the decades-old mystery of "heat absorption" and "leakage current" (with their far-reaching consequences), and derives the thermodynamic description of neural computing. We defy that science cannot describe life.</description>

      <title>Protocellular energetics: Free energy estimates for all metabolic, self-assembly and vesicle fission processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24095v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As minimal cells or protocells are dramatically simpler than modern unicells it is possible to quantitatively estimate free energy changes for every process in the lifecycle of a protocell and compare these with estimates of the free energy changes for lifecycles in modern unicells. We present quantitative estimates of all metabolic changes in part by new density function theory (DFT) estimations, in part by compiling previously measured or estimated free energy changes, and in part by new thermodynamic calculations for all self-assembly, vesicle bending, and fission energies.</description>

      <title>General Binding Affinity Guidance for Diffusion Models in Structure-Based Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD) aims to generate ligands that bind strongly and specifically to target protein pockets. Recent diffusion models have advanced SBDD by capturing the distributions of atomic positions and types, yet they often underemphasize binding affinity control during generation. To address this limitation, we introduce \textbf{\textnormal{\textbf{BADGER}}}, a general \textbf{binding-affinity guidance framework for diffusion models in SBDD}. \textnormal{\textbf{BADGER} }incorporates binding affinity awareness through two complementary strategies: (1) \textit{classifier guidance}, which applies gradient-based affinity signals during sampling in a plug-and-play fashion, and (2) \textit{classifier-free guidance}, which integrates affinity conditioning directly into diffusion model training. Together, these approaches enable controllable ligand generation guided by binding affinity. \textnormal{\textbf{BADGER} } can be added to any diffusion model and achieves up to a \textbf{60\% improvement in ligand--protein binding affinity} of sampled molecules over prior methods. Furthermore, we extend the framework to \textbf{multi-constraint diffusion guidance}, jointly optimizing for binding affinity, drug-likeness (QED), and synthetic accessibility (SA) to design realistic and synthesizable drug candidates.</description>
