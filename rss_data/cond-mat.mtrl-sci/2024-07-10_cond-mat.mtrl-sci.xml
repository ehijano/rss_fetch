      <title>Modeling of Hot-Carrier Degradation driven by silicon-hydrogen bond dissociation in SPADs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel approach for modeling Dark Count Rate (DCR) drift in Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) is proposed based on Hot-Carrier Degradation (HCD) inducing silicon-hydrogen bond dissociation at the Si/SiO2 interface. The energy and the quantity of hot-carriers are modeled by the interplay of carrier energy distribution and current density. The carrier energy distribution, achieved by a Full-Band Monte-Carlo simulation considering the band structure and the scattering mechanisms, establishes a crucial link to the degradation of the top SPAD interface, primarily influenced by hot electrons due to their broader energy spread. The current density is determined by analyzing the generation rates of carriers under dark and photo conditions, along with the multiplication rate, through a combination of experimental data and modeling techniques. Subsequently,these hot carriers are correlated with the distribution of bond dissociation energy, which is modeled by the disorder-induced local variations among the Si-H bond energy at the Si/SiO2 interface. The impact-ionization probability between hot carriers and Si-H bonds is then calculated by differentiating their energies, thereby determining the degradation kinetics. This enables the capture of the rise in dark current density with stress duration by the increasing number of defects, which in turn affects the modeling of degradation rate. For the first time, a direct correlation between the dark current and DCR, along with their drift over stress time, has been established, relying on the carrier generation rate originating from these defects together with the position-dependent breakdown probability Pt.This physic-based model allows to predict DCR for unprecedented long-term stress measurement time up to 10e6s, covering a whole set of characterization and stress conditions for SPAD devices.</description>

      <title>Disorder Enhances the Fracture Toughness of Mechanical Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials with engineered failure properties typically rely on periodic unit cell geometries or bespoke microstructures to achieve their unique properties. We demonstrate that intelligent use of disorder in metamaterials leads to distributed damage during failure, resulting in enhanced fracture toughness with minimal losses of strength. Toughness depends on the level of disorder, not a specific geometry, and the confined lattices studied exhibit a maximum toughness enhancement at an optimal level of disorder. A mechanics model that relates disorder to toughness without knowledge of the crack path is presented. The model is verified through finite element simulations and experiments utilizing photoelasticity to visualize damage during failure. At the optimal level of disorder, the toughness is more than 2.6x of an ordered lattice of equivalent density.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic polar metals via epitaxial strain: a case study of SrCoO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While polar metals are a metallic analogue of ferroelectrics, magnetic polar metals can be considered as a metallic analogue of multiferroics. There have been a number of attempts to integrate magnetism into a polar metal by synthesizing new materials or heterostructures. Here we use a simple yet widely used approach--epitaxial strain in the search for intrinsic magnetic polar metals. Via first-principles calculations, we study strain engineering of a ferromagnetic metallic oxide SrCoO$_3$, whose bulk form crystallizes in a cubic structure. We find that under an experimentally feasible biaxial strain on the $ab$ plane, collective Co polar displacements are stabilized in SrCoO$_3$. Specifically, a compressive strain stabilizes Co polar displacements along the $c$ axis, while a tensile strain stabilizes Co polar displacements along the diagonal line in the $ab$ plane. In both cases, we find an intrinsic ferromagnetic polar metallic state in SrCoO$_3$. In addition, we also find that a sufficiently large biaxial strain ($&gt; 4\%$) can yield a ferromagnetic-to-antiferromagnetic transition in SrCoO$_3$. Our work demonstrates that in addition to yielding emergent multiferroics, epitaxial strain is also a viable approach to inducing magnetic polar metallic states in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Invisible sweat sensor: ultrathin membrane mimics skin for stress monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epidermal skin sensors have emerged as a promising approach for continuous and noninvasive monitoring of vital health signals, but to maximize their performance, these sensors must integrate seamlessly with the skin, minimizing impedance while maintaining the skin's natural protective and regulatory functions.In this study, we introduce an imperceptible sweat sensor that achieves this seamless skin integration through interpenetrating networks formed by a porous, ultra-thin, ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) nanomembrane. Upon attachment to the skin by van der Waals force, the amphiphilic sweat extrudates infuse into the interconnected nanopores inside the hydrophobic UHWMPE nanomembrane, forming "pseudo skin" nanochannels for continuous sweat perspiration. This integration is further enhanced by the osmotic pressure generated during water evaporation. Leveraging the efficient transport of biomarkers through the "skin" channels within the porous membrane, we developed an organic electrochemical transducer (OECT) cortisol sensor via in-situ synthesis of a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) and poly(3,4 ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) within the nanomembrane. This demonstrates the capability to detect cortisol concentrations from 0.05 to 0.5 {\mu}M for seamless monitoring of stress levels. This work represents a significant advancement in self-adhesive sweat sensors that offer imperceptible and real-time non-invasive health monitoring capabilities.</description>

      <title>Inoculating solid-state homogeneous precipitation by impurity atoms through a spinodal decomposition like pathway</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state homogeneous precipitation of nano-sized precipitates is one of the most effective processes to strengthen metal alloys, where the final density and size distribution of precipitates are largely controlled by the precipitation kinetics. Here, we report a strategy to inoculate the homogeneous precipitation of coherent precipitates to enhance the precipitation strengthening. Using the technologically important dilute Al-Zr alloys as an example, we demonstrate that an addition of a trace level of economical and readily available, non-L1$_{2}$ phase forming impurity atoms, X (X= Sn, Sb, Bi or Cd) and Si, can significantly enhance the diffusivity of Zr atoms and overturn the precipitation of L1$_{2}$-structured Al$_{3}$Zr nanoparticles from the classical homogeneous nucleation and growth pathway into a nonclassical nucleation pathway: Al$_{3}$Zr forms through the spontaneous formation of nano-scale local concentration fluctuations of Zr atoms on Zr-X(-Si)-vacancy clusters followed by a continuous increase of the concentration and chemical short-range ordering (CSRO). Such an impurity atoms induced heterogeneous nucleation based on a "spinodal decomposition like" mechanism dramatically accelerates the precipitation kinetics, leading to an order of magnitude higher number density of precipitates and a record high hardening efficiency of solute Zr atoms. By formulating the generalized selection principles for inoculating impurity elements, this inoculation strategy should be extendable to a broader range of materials to further explore the precipitation strengthening potentials.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of asymmetrically deformed skyrmion driven by internal forces and strain force in a flower-shaped magnetic nanostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions emerge as promising quasi-particles for encoding information in nextgeneration spintronic devices. Their innate flexibility in shape is essential for the applications although they were often ideally treated as rigid particles. In this work, we investigated the voltagecontrolled uniform strain mediated dynamics of deformed skyrmions in heterostructures with a flower-shaped magnetic nanostructure, using micromagnetic simulations. The simulated results revealed the possible states of isolated skyrmion nucleated in the nanostructure, which can be mutually switched by applying suitable in-plane strain pulses. In addition, it was found that the skyrmion motions are driven by the emerging internal forces and strain force, which originate from the asymmetric deformation of skyrmion structures. Furthermore, an analytical model of deformed skyrmions was proposed to interpret the dependences of internal forces and strain force on the asymmetric deformation of skyrmion, with some formulae derived for these forces in a semi-analytical approach. Further calculations based on these formulae verified the forces appearing in the skyrmion motion, with the resulting forces showing consistence with the simulated data. This suggested that our semi-analytical model successfully captures the main physics responsible for the motion of deformed skyrmion in the nanostructure. Our work extends the understanding of the mechanics emerging in deformed skyrmion, and provides an effective approach for deterministic manipulation of deformed skyrmion motion via strain forces and internal forces, which may be instructive to design of skyrmion-based spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Low temperature conductivity of BaFe$_{0.5}$Nb$_{0.5}$O$_3$ double perovskite structure ceramics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the origin and type of charge carriers, and their transport mechanism in polycrystalline barium-iron-niobate (BFN, BaFe$_{0.5}$Nb$_{0.5}$O$_3$) ceramics, at lower temperatures between 20K and 300K. The observed point defects at grain andsurface defects at grain boundary region are responsible for the electronic conductivity, whereas dipoles at grain boundary region are responsible for the ionic conductivity, these independent electronic and ionic conductivity were responsible for the total conductivity of our BFN sample. The required activation energy for conduction of electrons in grain boundary region and ions in grain region were calculated to be 317 meV and 17 meV respectively. The electronic conductivity of grain region obey Jonscher's power law. Analysis of the temperature dependent frequency exponent suggest that the electronic conductivity of grain follows the overlapping large polaron tunneling (OLP) model. The temperature dependent conductivity follows the Mott variable range hopping model(VRH), showing hopping range increases with decreasing temeprature. The defect density of the grain obtained to be $3.17 \times 10^{17}$ eV/cm$^3$. The contribution of phonon to the conductivity understood by considering Schankenberg model, activation energy of 110 meV corresponds to the multiphonon (both optical and acoustic) and 1.6 meV corresponds to acoustic phonon only. Our systematic study provides in-depth understanding of the low temperature conductivity mechanism of polycrystalline BFN ceramics.</description>

      <title>Water-resistant hybrid perovskite solar cell -- drop triboelectric energy harvester</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability and reproducibility issues related to metal halide Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs) have prevented so far from exploiting this highly efficient photovoltaic technology under rainy or even moisture conditions and in combination with drop triboelectric nanogenerators (D-TENGs). Protecting the PSCs with a waterproof encapsulator could overcome such a disadvantage. Herein, we propose the implementation of fluorinated carbon (CFx) coatings produced by PECVD, enabling waterproof capability for the PSC and working as an energy harvesting surface for D-TENGs. These 100 nm - films present optimal optical transmittance, fully preserving the photovoltaic parameters of the cell. The improved long-term stability of the water-resistant PSCs prevents degradation under illumination in outdoor or simulated adverse environments with high humidity, high temperature, water immersion, or rain. As a remarkable result, the 50% Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE) has been retained after ten days of illumination under 100% relative humidity at 50 degrees Celsius. Also, the CFx coatings were successfully tested as a promoter agent to integrate commercial UV-curable sealants compatible with Spiro-OMeTAD, enhancing the performance stability of up to 80 % of PCE after 100 hours under illumination in a humid environment. This PSC was tested in a top-bottom electrode configuration for harvesting kinetic energy from droplets. Devices were compatible with simultaneously working as D-TENG and photovoltaic cells, yielding voltage outputs up to 12 V with maximum peak power density reaching 2.75 uW/cm2 defined by the D-TENG and PCE of 11.5 % and 8.46 mA/cm2 of short circuit current determined by the PSC under dripping and for an illumination angle of 45 degrees. The durability of the multisource device was tested under constant illumination and periodical drop impacting for more than 5 hours.</description>

      <title>Influence of buffer/protective layers on the structural and magnetic properties of SmCo films on Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integration of Samarium Cobalt hard magnets on silicon requires buffer/protective layers that can enhance the magnetic properties of the magnet while preserving its structure and chemical composition after post-annealing treatments needed for the formation of the magnetically hard phase. In this work, a comparison of Samarium-Cobalt films for five different buffer/protective layers, namely Ti, W, TiW, Ta, Cr and two different annealing temperatures, 650{\deg}C and 750{\deg}C, is presented. Depending on materials and annealing temperatures, magnetic properties such as saturation and coercivity of the SmCo film can be finely tuned. We show that coercivity up to 3.65 T or saturation magnetization up to 0.95 T can be reached by proper choice of the relevant process parameters: deposition temperature, material for the buffer/protective layer and annealing temperature. Such value of coercivity is among the highest found in literature for thin films of SmCo.</description>

      <title>Large spin-orbit torque in a-plane $\alpha$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$/Pt bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realization of efficient spin-orbit torque switching of the N\'eel vector in insulating antiferromagnets is a challenge, often complicated by spurious effects. Quantifying the spin-orbit torques in antiferromagnet/heavy metal heterostructures is an important first step towards this goal. Here, we employ magneto-optic techniques to study damping-like spin-orbit torque (DL-SOT) in a-plane $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ (hematite) with a Pt spin-orbit overlayer. We find that the DL-SOT efficiency is two orders of magnitude larger than reported in c- and r-plane hematite/Pt using harmonic Hall techniques. The large magnitude of DL-SOT is supported by direct imaging of current-induced motion of antiferromagnetic domains that happens at moderate current densities. Our study introduces a new method for quantifying spin-orbit torque in antiferromagnets with a small canted moment and identifies a-plane $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ as a promising candidate to realize efficient SOT switching.</description>

      <title>In-plane staging in lithium-ion intercalation of bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ongoing efforts to optimize Li-ion batteries led to the interest in intercalation of nanoscale layered compounds, including bilayer graphene. Its lithium intercalation has been demonstrated recently but the mechanisms underpinning the storage capacity remain poorly understood. Here, using magnetotransport measurements, we report in-operando intercalation dynamics of bilayer graphene. Unexpectedly, we find four distinct intercalation stages that correspond to well-defined Li-ion densities. We refer to these stages as 'in-plane', with no in-plane analogues in bulk graphite. The fully intercalated bilayers represent a stoichiometric compound C14LiC14 with a Li density of 2.7x10^{14} cm^{-2}, notably lower than fully intercalated graphite. Combining the experimental findings and DFT calculations, we show that the critical step in bilayer intercalation is a transition from AB to AA stacking which occurs at a density of 0.9x10^{14} cm^{-2}. Our findings reveal the mechanism and limits for electrochemical intercalation of bilayer graphene and suggest possible avenues for increasing the Li storage capacity.</description>

      <title>Domains in ferroelectric nitrides superlattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric nitrides have emerged as promising semiconductor materials for modern electronics. However, their domain structures and associated properties are basically unknown, despite their potential to result in optimized or new phenomena. Density functional theory calculations are performed to investigate the effect of epitaxial strain on multidomains of (Al,Sc)N nitride systems and to compare it with the monodomain case. The multidomain systems are predicted to have five strain-induced regions, to be denoted as Regions I to V, respectively. Each of these regions is associated with rather different values or behaviors of physical properties such as axial ratio, polarizations, internal parameters, bond lengths, etc. Of particular interest is the prediction of bent domains under compressive strain extending beyond $-$5.5%, which indicates that domain walls may play a key role in the mechanical failure properties of these systems. Interestingly, such bending induces the creation of a finite in-plane polarization (in addition to out-of-plane dipoles) due to geometric and symmetry considerations. Strikingly too, the bent domains have lower energy than the wurtzite monodomains and have atomically sharp boundaries. Our findings may pave the way for domain wall engineering in ferroelectric nitrides.</description>

      <title>Uniaxial plasmon polaritons $\textit{via}$ charge transfer at the graphene/CrSBr interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene is a privileged 2D platform for hosting confined light-matter excitations known as surface plasmon-polaritons (SPPs), as it possesses low intrinsic losses with a high degree of optical confinement. However, the inherently isotropic optical properties of graphene limit its ability to guide and focus SPPs, making it less suitable than anisotropic elliptical and hyperbolic materials as a platform for polaritonic lensing and canalization. Here, we present the graphene/CrSBr heterostructure as an engineered 2D interface that hosts highly anisotropic SPP propagation over a wide range of frequencies in the mid-infrared and terahertz. Using a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM), and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate mutual doping in excess of 10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$ holes/electrons between the interfacial layers of graphene/CrSBr heterostructures. SPPs in graphene activated by charge transfer interact with charge-induced anisotropic intra- and interband transitions in the interfacial doped CrSBr, leading to preferential SPP propagation along the quasi-1D chains that compose each CrSBr layer. This multifaceted proximity effect both creates SPPs and endows them with anisotropic transport and propagation lengths that differ by an order-of-magnitude between the two in-plane crystallographic axes of CrSBr.</description>

      <title>Efficient Electron Spin Relaxation by Chiral Phonons in WSe$_2$ Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductor monolayers the spin dynamics of electrons is controlled by the original spin-valley locking effect resulting from the interplay between spin-orbit interaction and inversion asymmetry. As a consequence, for electrons occupying bottom conduction bands, a carrier spin flip occurs only if there is a simultaneous change of valley. However, very little is known about the intra-valley spin relaxation processes. In this work we have performed stationary and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements in high quality WSe$_2$ monolayers. Our experiments highlight an efficient relaxation from bright to dark excitons, due to a fast intra-valley electron transfer from the top to the bottom conduction band with opposite spins. A combination of experiments and theoretical analysis allows us to infer a spin relaxation time of about $\tau_s\sim10~$ps, driven by the interplay between $\Gamma$-valley chiral phonons and spin-orbit mixing.</description>

Abstract: The vector cross product and pseudoscalar dot products of electric (E) and magnetic (H) fields are separately finite in vacuum transverse electric and magnetic (TEM) plane waves, and angular momentum structured light. Current theories of interactions beyond the standard model of particle physics invoke non-zero dot(E,H) as the source term in the axion law that describes interactions with the cosmological dark matter axion particles outside of the quartet of Maxwells equations. The non-zero dot(E,H) also drives relativistic spin-charge magnetoelectric excitations of axion quasiparticles at a distinctively higher condensed matter scale in magnetic and topological materials. Yet, how to drive coherent dot(E,H) responses is unknown, and provides motivation to examine the field polarizations in structured light on a deep sub-diffraction limited spatial scale and sub-optical cycle temporal scale by ultrafast nonlinear photoemission electron microscopy. By analytical theory and ultrafast coherent photoemission electron microscopy, we image dot(E,H) fields in surface plasmon polariton vortex cores at subwavelength scales, where we find that the magnetoelectric relative to the dipole density is intensified on a ~10 nm diameter scale as a universal property of plasmonic vortex fields. The generation and nanoscale localization of dot(E,H) fields introduces the magnetoelectric symmetry class, having the parity and time reversal broken, but the joint parity-time reversal symmetry preserved. The ability to image the optical fields of plasmonic vortex cores opens the research of ultrafast microscopy of magnetoelectric responses and interactions with axion quasiparticles in solid state materials.</description>

      <title>Infrared band strengths of dangling OH features in amorphous water at 20 K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared (IR) spectra of vapor-deposited amorphous water at low temperatures show two weak peaks at around 3720 and 3696 cm-1 assigned to free-OH stretching modes of two- and three-coordinated water molecules (so-called dangling OH bonds), respectively, on the ice surface. A recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observation first succeeded in detection of a potential dangling OH feature at 3664 cm-1 for ices in molecular clouds, highlighting the importance of dangling OH bonds in interstellar ice chemistry. A lack of band strengths of these features at low temperatures restricts the quantification of dangling OH bonds from IR spectra, hindering development of a molecular-level understanding of the surface structure and chemistry of ice. Using IR multiple-angle incidence resolution spectrometry, we quantified the band strengths of two- and three-coordinated dangling OH features in amorphous water at 20 K as being 4.6 plus-minus 1.6 times 10-18 and 9.1 plus-minus 1.0 times 10-18 cm molecule-1, respectively. These values are more than an order of magnitude lower than band strengths of bulk water molecules in ice and liquid water and are similar to those of H2O monomers confined in solid matrices. Adsorption of carbon monoxide with dangling OH bonds results in the appearance of a new broad dangling OH feature at 3680-3620 cm-1, with a band strength of 1.8 plus-minus 0.1 times 10-17 cm molecule-1. The band strengths of dangling OH features determined in this study advance our understanding of the surface structure of interstellar ice analogs and recent IR observations of the JWST.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Asymmetry in Density within the Shear Bands of Metallic Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plastic deformation in metallic glasses at room temperature leads to the development of shear bands due to shear localization. In many experiments, shear bands have shown local density variations along their path, with a distinct imbalance in magnitude between local densification and dilation. However, a comprehensive mechanistic understanding or theory to explain this asymmetry has been lacking until now. Here, we introduce a new model that consists of a sequential arrangement of alternating topological 'charges', generating a dipolar field. The resulting microscopic displacement field, when integrated into the deformation gradient tensor, provides an accurate analytical solution for the observed imbalances in the density variations. The implications of this method are discussed, highlighting the potential to elucidate a broader range of observations in shear bands.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Frequency-Dependent Optical Spectrum for Solid Materials: A Multi-Output &amp; Multi-Fidelity Machine Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The frequency-dependent optical spectrum is pivotal for a broad range of applications, from material characterization to optoelectronics and energy harvesting. Data-driven surrogate models, trained on density functional theory (DFT) data, have effectively alleviated the scalability limitations of DFT while preserving its chemical accuracy, expediting material discovery. However, prevailing machine learning (ML) efforts often focus on scalar properties such as the band gap, overlooking the complexities of optical spectra. In this work, we employ deep graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict the frequency-dependent complex-valued dielectric function across the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet spectra directly from crystal structures. We explore multiple architectures for multi-output spectral representation of the dielectric function and utilize various multi-fidelity learning strategies, such as transfer learning and fidelity embedding, to address the challenges associated with the scarcity of high-fidelity DFT data. Additionally, we model key solar cell absorption efficiency metrics, demonstrating that learning these parameters is enhanced when integrated through a learning bias within the learning of the frequency-dependent absorption coefficient. This study demonstrates that leveraging multi-output and multi-fidelity ML techniques enables accurate predictions of optical spectra from crystal structures, providing a versatile tool for rapidly screening materials for optoelectronics, optical sensing, and solar energy applications across an extensive frequency spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We computationally study suspensions of slow and fast active Brownian particles that have undergone motility induced phase separation and are at steady state. Such mixtures, of varying non-zero activity, remain largely unexplored even though they are relevant for a plethora of systems and applications ranging from cellular biophysics to drone swarms. Our mixtures are modulated by their activity ratios ($\mathrm{Pe}^\mathrm{R}$), which we find to encode information by giving rise to three regimes, each of which display their unique emergent behaviors. Specifically, we found non-monotonic behavior of macroscopic properties, e.g. density and pressure, as a function of activity ratio, microphase separation of fast and slow particle domains, increased fluctuations on the interface and severe avalanche events compared to monodisperse active systems. Our approach of simultaneously varying the two activities of the particle species allowed us to discover these behaviors and explain the microscopic physical mechanisms that drive them.</description>

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) is an emerging analysis tool across sciences and engineering. Encouraged by the successes of DL in revealing quantitative trends in massive imaging data, we applied this approach to nano-scale deeply sub-diffractional images of propagating polaritonic waves in complex materials. We developed a practical protocol for the rapid regression of images that quantifies the wavelength and the quality factor of polaritonic waves utilizing the convolutional neural network (CNN). Using simulated near-field images as training data, the CNN can be made to simultaneously extract polaritonic characteristics and materials parameters in a timescale that is at least three orders of magnitude faster than common fitting/processing procedures. The CNN-based analysis was validated by examining the experimental near-field images of charge-transfer plasmon polaritons at Graphene/{\alpha}-RuCl3 interfaces. Our work provides a general framework for extracting quantitative information from images generated with a variety of scanning probe methods.</description>

      <title>Prediction of the Cu Oxidation State from EELS and XAS Spectra Using Supervised Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) provide detailed information about bonding, distributions and locations of atoms, and their coordination numbers and oxidation states. However, analysis of XAS/EELS data often relies on matching an unknown experimental sample to a series of simulated or experimental standard samples. This limits analysis throughput and the ability to extract quantitative information from a sample. In this work, we have trained a random forest model capable of predicting the oxidation state of copper based on its L-edge spectrum. Our model attains an $R^2$ score of 0.85 and a root mean square valence error of 0.24 on simulated data. It has also successfully predicted experimental L-edge EELS spectra taken in this work and XAS spectra extracted from the literature. We further demonstrate the utility of this model by predicting simulated and experimental spectra of mixed valence samples generated by this work. This model can be integrated into a real time EELS/XAS analysis pipeline on mixtures of copper containing materials of unknown composition and oxidation state. By expanding the training data, this methodology can be extended to data-driven spectral analysis of a broad range of materials.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric texture of individual barium titanate nanocrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ferroelectric materials display exotic polarization textures at the nanoscale that could be used to improve the energetic efficiency of electronic components. The vast majority of studies were conducted in two dimensions on thin films, that can be further nanostructured, but very few studies address the situation of individual isolated nanocrystals synthesized in solution, while such structures could open other field of applications. In this work, we experimentally and theoretically studied the polarization texture of ferroelectric barium titanate (BaTiO$_3$, BTO) nanocrystals (NC) attached to a conductive substrate and surrounded by air. We synthesized NC of well defined quasi-cubic shape and 160 nm average size, that conserve the tetragonal structure of BTO at room temperature.
  We then investigated the inverse piezoelectric properties of such pristine individual NC by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), taking particular care of suppressing electrostatic artifacts. In all the NC studied, we could not detect any vertical PFM signal, and the maps of the lateral response all displayed larger displacements on the edges. Using field-phase simulations dedicated to ferroelectric nanostructures, we were able to predict the equilibrium polarization texture. These simulations revealed that the NC core is composed of 180{\deg} up and down domains defining the polar axis, that rotate by 90{\deg} in the two facets orthogonal to this axis, eventually lying within these planes forming a layer of about 10 nm thickness mainly composed of 180{\deg} domains along an edge. From this polarization distribution we predicted the lateral PFM response, that revealed to be in very good qualitative agreement with the experimental observations. This work positions PFM as a relevant tool to evaluate the potential of complex ferroelectric nanostructures to be used as sensors.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the origin of antiferromagnetic coupling at YIG/permalloy interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14553v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the structural and electronic origin of antiferromagnetic (AFM) coupling in the Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) and permalloy (Py) bilayer system at the atomic level. Ferromagnetic Resonance (FMR) reveal unique hybrid modes in samples prepared with surface ion milling, indicative of antiferromagnetic exchange coupling at the YIG/Py interface. Using atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we found that AFM coupling appears at the YIG/Py interface of the tetrahedral YIG surface formed with ion milling. The STEM measurements suggest that the interfacial AFM coupling is predominantly driven by an oxygen-mediated super-exchange coupling mechanism, which is confirmed by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations to be energetically favorable. Thus, the combined experimental and theoretical results reveal the critical role of interfacial atomic structure in determining the type magnetic coupling in a YIG/ferromagnet heterostructure, and prove that the interfacial structure can be experimentally tuned by surface ion-milling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is brittle, however, its atomic-scale structural engineering can lead to unprecedented physical properties. Here we report the bulk synthesis of high-density crystalline h-BN solids by using high-temperature spark plasma sintering (SPS) of micron size h-BN powders. In addition to the high mechanical strength and ductile response of such materials, we have obtained anomalous values of dielectric constant beyond theoretical limits, high thermal conductivity, and exceptional neutron radiation shielding capability. Through exhaustive characterizations we reveal that SPS induces non-basal plane crystallinity, twisting of layers, and facilitates inter-grain fusion with a high degree of in-plane alignment across macroscale dimensions, resulting in near-theoretical density and anomalous properties. Our findings highlight the importance of material design, via new approaches such as twisting and interconnections between atomically thin layers, to create novel ceramics with properties that could go beyond their intrinsic theoretical predictions.</description>

Abstract: Lead-free antiferroelectric perovskite $\rm AgNbO_3$ is nowadays attracting extensive research interests due to its promising applications in energy storage. Although great progress has been made in optimizing the material performance, fundamental questions remain regarding the mechanism stabilizing the antiferroelectric $Pbcm$ phase. Here, combining structural symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identified crucial anharmonic couplings of oxygen octahedra rotations and cation antipolar motions which contribute significantly to lowering the energy of the $Pbcm$ phase. The stabilization of this phase shows close similarities with the stabilization of the $Pbam$ phase in $\rm PbZrO_3$ except that in $\rm AgNbO_3$ the octahedra rotations are the primary distortions while the antipolar cation motions appear to be secondary. The appearance and significant amplitude of the latter are explained from the combination of hybrid-improper and triggered mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting quantum operator matrices such as Hamiltonian, overlap, and density matrices in the density functional theory (DFT) framework is crucial for understanding material properties. Current methods often focus on individual operators and struggle with efficiency and scalability for large systems. Here we introduce a novel deep learning model, SLEM (strictly localized equivariant message-passing) for predicting multiple quantum operators, that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while dramatically improving computational efficiency. SLEM's key innovation is its strict locality-based design, constructing local, equivariant representations for quantum tensors while preserving physical symmetries. This enables complex many-body dependence without expanding the effective receptive field, leading to superior data efficiency and transferability. Using an innovative SO(2) convolution technique, SLEM reduces the computational complexity of high-order tensor products and is therefore capable of handling systems requiring the $f$ and $g$ orbitals in their basis sets. We demonstrate SLEM's capabilities across diverse 2D and 3D materials, achieving high accuracy even with limited training data. SLEM's design facilitates efficient parallelization, potentially extending DFT simulations to systems with device-level sizes, opening new possibilities for large-scale quantum simulations and high-throughput materials discovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Doped Iron Chalcogenide (FeCh) superconductors are extensively studied in the context of topological superconductivity. However, the evidence of topological surface states in electrical transport measurements of the doped FeCh system is yet warranted. In the present letter, we performed angle-dependent magneto transport measurements on a single crystal of a doped FeCh system, i.e., FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$. A non-saturating linear magnetoresistance (MR) has been observed under the magnetic field up to 14 T in the normal state of FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$. The MR is shown to possess anisotropy, which indicates the presence of topological surface states in FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$. Angle-dependent Magneto-conductivity (MC) at low magnetic fields has been modelled by Hikami Larkin Nagaoka (HLN) formalism, which shows the presence of weak antilocalization (WAL) effect in FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$. The observed WAL effect is found to be 2D in nature through angle-dependent magneto transport measurements. Theoretical calculations based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) are also performed to get more confidence on the presence of topological surface states in FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$.</description>

      <title>Facilities and practices for linear response Hubbard parameters U and J in Abinit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06284</link>

Abstract: Members of the DFT+U family of functionals are increasingly prevalent methods of addressing errors intrinsic to (semi-) local exchange-correlation functionals at minimum computational cost, but require their parameters U and J to be calculated in situ for a given system of interest, simulation scheme, and runtime parameters. The SCF linear response approach offers ab initio acquisition of the U and has recently been extended to compute the J analogously, which measures localized errors related to exchange-like effects. We introduce a renovated post-processor, the lrUJ utility, together with this detailed best-practices guide, to enable users of the popular, open-source Abinit first-principles simulation suite to engage easily with in situ Hubbard parameters and streamline their incorporation into material simulations of interest. Features of this utility, which may also interest users and developers of other DFT codes, include $n$-degree polynomial regression, error analysis, Python plotting facilities, didactic documentation, and avenues for further developments. In this technical introduction and guide, we place particular emphasis on the intricacies and potential pitfalls introduced by the projector augmented wave (PAW) method, SCF mixing schemes, and non-linear response, several of which are translatable to DFT+U(+J) implementations in other packages.</description>

      <title>i-PI 3.0: a flexible and efficient framework for advanced atomistic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomic-scale simulations have progressed tremendously over the past decade, largely due to the availability of machine-learning interatomic potentials. These potentials combine the accuracy of electronic structure calculations with the ability to reach extensive length and time scales. The i-PI package facilitates integrating the latest developments in this field with advanced modeling techniques, thanks to a modular software architecture based on inter-process communication through a socket interface. The choice of Python for implementation facilitates rapid prototyping but can add computational overhead. In this new release, we carefully benchmarked and optimized i-PI for several common simulation scenarios, making such overhead negligible when i-PI is used to model systems up to tens of thousands of atoms using widely adopted machine learning interatomic potentials, such as Behler-Parinello, DeePMD and MACE neural networks. We also present the implementation of several new features, including an efficient algorithm to model bosonic and fermionic exchange, a framework for uncertainty quantification to be used in conjunction with machine-learning potentials, a communication infrastructure that allows deeper integration with electronic-driven simulations, and an approach to simulate coupled photon-nuclear dynamics in optical or plasmonic cavities.</description>

      <title>Optoionic Impedance Spectroscopy (OIS): a model-less technique for in-situ electrochemical characterization of mixed ionic electronic conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Functional properties of mixed ionic electronic conductors (MIECs) can be radically modified by (de)insertion of mobile charged defects. A complete control of this dynamic behaviour has multiple applications in a myriad of fields including advanced computing, data processing, sensing or energy conversion. However, the effect of different MIECs state-of-charge is not fully understood yet and there is a lack of strategies for fully controlling the defect content in a material. In this work we present a model-less technique to characterize ionic defect concentration and ionic insertion kinetics in MIEC materials: Optoionic Impedance Spectroscopy (OIS). The proof of concept and advantages of OIS are demonstrated by studying the oxygen (de)insertion in thin films of hole-doped perovskite oxides. Ion migration into/out of the studied materials is achieved by the application of an electrochemical potential, achieving stable and reversible modification of its optical properties. By tracking the dynamic variation of optical properties depending on the gating conditions, OIS enables to extract electrochemical parameters involved in the electrochromic process. The results demonstrate the capability of the technique to effectively characterize the kinetics of single- and even multi- layer systems. The technique can be employed for studying underlying mechanisms of the response characteristics of MIEC-based devices.</description>
