      <title>An Integrated Sensing and Communication System for Time-Sensitive Targets with Random Arrivals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 6G networks, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is envisioned as a key technology that enables wireless systems to perform joint sensing and communication using shared hardware, antennas and spectrum. ISAC designs facilitate emerging applications such as smart cities and autonomous driving. Such applications also demand ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC). Thus, an ISAC-enabled URLLC system can prioritize time-sensitive targets and ensure information delivery under strict latency and reliability constraints. We propose a bi-static MIMO ISAC system to detect the arrival of URLLC messages and prioritize their delivery. In this system, a base station (BS) communicates with a user equipment (UE) and a sensing receiver (SR) is deployed to collect echo signals reflected from a target of interest. The BS regularly transmits messages of enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services to the UE. During each eMBB transmission, if the SR senses the presence of a target of interest, it immediately triggers the transmission of an additional URLLC message. To reinforce URLLC transmissions, we propose a dirty-paper coding (DPC)-based technique that mitigates the interference of both eMBB and sensing signals. To decode the eMBB message, we consider two approaches for handling the URLLC interference: treating interference as noise and successive interference cancellation. For this system, we formulate the rate-reliability-detection trade-off in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime by evaluating the communication rate of the eMBB transmissions, the reliability of the URLLC transmissions and the probability of the target detection. Our numerical analysis show that our proposed DPC-based ISAC scheme significantly outperforms power-sharing and traditional time-sharing schemes. In particular, it achieves higher eMBB transmission rate while satisfying both URLLC and sensing constraints.</description>

      <title>MIMO Systems Aided by Microwave Linear Analog Computers: Capacity-Achieving Architectures with Reduced Circuit Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To meet the demands of future wireless networks, antenna arrays must scale from massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) to gigantic MIMO, involving even larger numbers of antennas. To address the hardware and computational cost of gigantic MIMO, several strategies are available that shift processing from the digital to the analog domain. Among them, microwave linear analog computers (MiLACs) offer a compelling solution by enabling fully analog beamforming through reconfigurable microwave networks. Prior work has focused on fully-connected MiLACs, whose ports are all interconnected to each other via tunable impedance components. Although such MiLACs are capacity-achieving, their circuit complexity, given by the number of required impedance components, scales quadratically with the number of antennas, limiting their practicality. To solve this issue, in this paper, we propose a graph theoretical model of MiLAC facilitating the systematic design of lower-complexity MiLAC architectures. Leveraging this model, we propose stem-connected MiLACs as a family of MiLAC architectures maintaining capacity-achieving performance while drastically reducing the circuit complexity. Besides, we optimize stem-connected MiLACs with a closed-form capacity-achieving solution. Our theoretical analysis, confirmed by numerical simulations, shows that stem-connected MiLACs are capacity-achieving, but with circuit complexity that scales linearly with the number of antennas, enabling high-performance, scalable, gigantic MIMO.</description>

      <title>Linear and Numerical SDoF Bounds of Active RIS-Assisted MIMO Wiretap Interference Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wiretap interference channel (IC) serves as a canonical model for information-theoretic security, where a multiple-antenna eavesdropper attempts to intercept communications in a two-user MIMO IC system. The secure degrees-of-freedom (SDoF) of an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted MIMO wiretap IC is with practical interests but remains unexplored. In this paper, we establish both sum-SDoF lower and upper bounds through linear beamforming conditions and numerical methods. Specifically, our proposed lower bound is derived from transmission scheme design and corresponding solutions to the sum-SDoF maximization problem, formulated by linear integer programming. The solutions to this optimization problem addresses RIS element allocation for leakage and interference cancellation. The proposed upper bound is obtained by solving a nuclear norm minimization problem, leveraging the fact that nuclear norm serves as a convex relaxation of the rank function. For symmetry antenna configurations, we derive a closed-form lower bound. Extensive numerical simulations show that our proposed lower and upper bounds coincide across many antenna configurations, and our proposed lower bound outperforms the existing benchmark.</description>

      <title>New Constructions of Full Flag Codes Based on Partial Spreads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flag codes are a class of multishot network codes comprising sequences of nested subspaces (flags) within the vector space $\mathbb{F}_q^n$, where $q$ is a prime power. In this paper, we propose a family of constructions for full flag codes based on partial spreads. The distances of this family include maximum distance (optimum distance flag codes), second-maximum distance (quasi-optimum distance flag codes), as well as other feasible values. The structure of these flag codes resembles that of a \textquotedblleft sandwich", consisting of one layer of companion matrix and two layers of partial spreads. Furthermore, we present an efficient decoding algorithm for these codes.</description>

      <title>LLM Agent for Hyper-Parameter Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyper-parameters are essential and critical for the performance of communication algorithms. However, current hyper-parameters tuning methods for warm-start particles swarm optimization with cross and mutation (WS-PSO-CM) algortihm for radio map-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory and communication are primarily heuristic-based, exhibiting low levels of automation and unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we design an large language model (LLM) agent for automatic hyper-parameters-tuning, where an iterative framework and model context protocol (MCP) are applied. In particular, the LLM agent is first setup via a profile, which specifies the mission, background, and output format. Then, the LLM agent is driven by the prompt requirement, and iteratively invokes WS-PSO-CM algorithm for exploration. Finally, the LLM agent autonomously terminates the loop and returns a set of hyper-parameters. Our experiment results show that the minimal sum-rate achieved by hyper-parameters generated via our LLM agent is significantly higher than those by both human heuristics and random generation methods. This indicates that an LLM agent with PSO knowledge and WS-PSO-CM algorithm background is useful in finding high-performance hyper-parameters.</description>

      <title>In-Context Learning for Gradient-Free Receiver Adaptation: Principles, Applications, and Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has facilitated the creation of wireless receivers capable of functioning effectively in conditions that challenge traditional model-based designs. Leveraging programmable hardware architectures, deep learning-based receivers offer the potential to dynamically adapt to varying channel environments. However, current adaptation strategies, including joint training, hypernetwork-based methods, and meta-learning, either demonstrate limited flexibility or necessitate explicit optimization through gradient descent. This paper presents gradient-free adaptation techniques rooted in the emerging paradigm of in-context learning (ICL). We review architectural frameworks for ICL based on Transformer models and structured state-space models (SSMs), alongside theoretical insights into how sequence models effectively learn adaptation from contextual information. Further, we explore the application of ICL to cell-free massive MIMO networks, providing both theoretical analyses and empirical evidence. Our findings indicate that ICL represents a principled and efficient approach to real-time receiver adaptation using pilot signals and auxiliary contextual information-without requiring online retraining.</description>

      <title>New Bounds and Constructions for Variable Packet-Error Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of variable packet-error coding, which emerges in network communication scenarios where a source transmits information to a destination through multiple disjoint paths. The objective is to design codes with dynamic error-correcting capabilities that adapt to varying numbers of errors. Specifically, we first provide several bounds on the rate--distortion trade-off for general variable packet-error coding schemes. Then, we present two explicit constructions of variable packet-error coding schemes. The first construction uses higher-order MDS codes and provides a coding scheme that achieves a better rate--distortion trade-off compared to known results for general parameter regimes. The second construction is based on a variant of the repetition code and yields a coding scheme with an optimal rate--distortion trade-off, with respect to our bound, for certain parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Golden Partition Zone: Rethinking Neural Network Partitioning Under Inversion Threats in Collaborative Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In collaborative inference, intermediate features transmitted from edge devices can be exploited by adversaries to reconstruct original inputs via model inversion attacks (MIA). While existing defenses focus on shallow-layer protection, they often incur significant utility loss. A key open question is how to partition the edge-cloud model to maximize resistance to MIA while minimizing accuracy degradation. We first show that increasing model depth alone does not guarantee resistance. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that representational transitions in neural networks cause sharp changes in conditional entropy $H(x\mid z)$, with intra-class variance (denoted $R_c^2$) and feature dimensionality as critical factors. Experiments on three representative deep vision models demonstrate that splitting at the representational-transition or decision-level layers increases mean squared error by more than four times compared to shallow splits, indicating significantly stronger resistance to MIA. Positive label smoothing further enhances robustness by compressing $R_c^2$ and improving generalization. Finally, we validate the resilience of decision-level features under enhanced inversion models and observe that the type of auxiliary data influences both transition boundaries and reconstruction behavior.</description>

      <title>Towards Weight Distribution-Aware Polar Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar codes are constructed based on the reliability of sub-channels resulting from the polarization effect. However, this information-theoretic construction approach leads to a poor weight distribution. To address this issue, pre-transformed polar codes, such as CRC-polar codes and PAC codes, have been employed. In this paper, we focus on the structure of polar codes without applying any pre-transformations and explore methods, guided by the weight-contribution partial order, to design polar-like codes with enhanced weight distribution, notably without employing any search or optimization algorithms. Numerical results demonstrate improvement over a range of codes both with and without pre-transformation.</description>

      <title>EVA-S2PMLP: Secure and Scalable Two-Party MLP via Spatial Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Privacy-preserving neural network training in vertically partitioned scenarios is vital for secure collaborative modeling across institutions. This paper presents \textbf{EVA-S2PMLP}, an Efficient, Verifiable, and Accurate Secure Two-Party Multi-Layer Perceptron framework that introduces spatial-scale optimization for enhanced privacy and performance. To enable reliable computation under real-number domain, EVA-S2PMLP proposes a secure transformation pipeline that maps scalar inputs to vector and matrix spaces while preserving correctness. The framework includes a suite of atomic protocols for linear and non-linear secure computations, with modular support for secure activation, matrix-vector operations, and loss evaluation. Theoretical analysis confirms the reliability, security, and asymptotic complexity of each protocol. Extensive experiments show that EVA-S2PMLP achieves high inference accuracy and significantly reduced communication overhead, with up to $12.3\times$ improvement over baselines. Evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrates that the framework maintains model utility while ensuring strict data confidentiality, making it a practical solution for privacy-preserving neural network training in finance, healthcare, and cross-organizational AI applications.</description>

      <title>The maximum-average subtensor problem: equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the Maximum-Average Subtensor ($p$-MAS) problem, in which one wants to find a subtensor of size $k$ of a given random tensor of size $N$, both of order $p$, with maximum sum of entries. We are motivated by recent work on the matrix case of the problem in which several equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties have been characterized analytically in the asymptotic regime $1 \ll k \ll N$, and a puzzling phenomenon was observed involving the coexistence of a clustered equilibrium phase and an efficient algorithm which produces submatrices in this phase. Here we extend previous results on equilibrium and algorithmic properties for the matrix case to the tensor case. We show that the tensor case has a similar equilibrium phase diagram as the matrix case, and an overall similar phenomenology for the considered algorithms. Additionally, we consider out-of-equilibrium landscape properties using Overlap Gap Properties and Franz-Parisi analysis, and discuss the implications or lack-thereof for average-case algorithmic hardness.</description>

      <title>Spectral Contraction of Boundary-Weighted Filters on delta-Hyperbolic Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical graphs often exhibit tree-like branching patterns, a structural property that challenges the design of traditional graph filters. We introduce a boundary-weighted operator that rescales each edge according to how far its endpoints drift toward the graph's Gromov boundary. Using Busemann functions on delta-hyperbolic networks, we prove a closed-form upper bound on the operator's spectral norm: every signal loses a curvature-controlled fraction of its energy at each pass. The result delivers a parameter-free, lightweight filter whose stability follows directly from geometric first principles, offering a new analytic tool for graph signal processing on data with dense or hidden hierarchical structure.</description>

      <title>Quantum Error Correction Exploiting Degeneracy to Approach the Hashing Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is essential for realizing scalable quantum computation. Among various approaches, low-density parity-check codes over higher-order Galois fields have shown promising performance due to their structured sparsity and compatibility with iterative decoding algorithms whose computational complexity scales linearly with the number of physical qubits. In this work, we demonstrate that explicitly exploiting the degeneracy of quantum errors can significantly enhance the decoding performance. Simulation results over the depolarizing channel indicate that the proposed method, at a coding rate of 1/3, achieves a frame error rate as low as $10^{-4}$ at a physical error rate of 9.45% for a code with 104,000 logical qubits and 312,000 physical qubits, approaching the quantum hashing bound. These findings highlight the critical role of degeneracy in closing the gap to the fundamental limits of quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Multiple-Access Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.05328v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A state-dependent discrete memoryless multiple access channel is considered to model an integrated sensing and communication system, where two transmitters wish to convey messages to a receiver while simultaneously estimating the state parameter sequences through echo signals. In particular, the sensing state parameters are assumed to be correlated with the channel state. In this setup, improved inner and outer bounds for capacity-distortion region are derived. The inner bound is based on an achievable scheme that combines message cooperation and joint compression of past transmitted codewords and echo signals at each transmitter, resulting in unified cooperative communication and sensing. The outer bound is based on the ideas of dependence balance for communication rate, genie-aided state estimator and rate-limited constraints on sensing distortion. The proposed inner and outer bounds are proved to improve the state-of-the-art bounds. Finally, numerical examples are provided to demonstrate that our new inner and outer bounds strictly improve the existing results.</description>

Abstract: We study the Chernoff-Stein exponent of the following binary hypothesis testing problem: Associated with each hypothesis is a set of channels. A transmitter, without knowledge of the hypothesis, chooses the vector of inputs to the channel. Given the hypothesis, from the set associated with the hypothesis, an adversary chooses channels, one for each element of the input vector. Based on the channel outputs, a detector attempts to distinguish between the hypotheses. We study the Chernoff-Stein exponent for the cases where the transmitter (i) is deterministic, (ii) may privately randomize, and (iii) shares randomness with the detector that is unavailable to the adversary. It turns out that while a memoryless transmission strategy is optimal under shared randomness, it may be strictly suboptimal when the transmitter only has private randomness.</description>

      <title>Exact Error Exponents of Concatenated Codes for DNA Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a concatenated coding based class of DNA storage codes in which the selected molecules are constrained to be taken from an ``inner'' codebook associated with the sequencing channel. This codebook is used in a ``black-box'' manner, and is only assumed to operate at an achievable rate in the sense of attaining asymptotically vanishing maximal (inner) error probability. We first derive the exact error exponent in a widely-studied regime of constant rate and a linear number of sequencing reads, and show strict improvements over an existing achievable error exponent. Moreover, our achievability analysis is based on a coded-index strategy, implying that such strategies attain the highest error exponents within the broader class of codes that we consider. We then extend our results to other scaling regimes, including a super-linear number of reads, as well as several certain low-rate regimes. We find that the latter comes with notable intricacies, such as the suboptimality of codewords with all distinct molecules, and certain dependencies of the error exponents on the model for sequencing errors.</description>

      <title>Sequential Change Detection for Learning in Piecewise Stationary Bandit Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10974v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A finite-horizon variant of the quickest change detection problem is investigated, which is motivated by a change detection problem that arises in piecewise stationary bandits. The goal is to minimize the \emph{latency}, which is smallest threshold such that the probability that the detection delay exceeds the threshold is below a desired low level, while controlling the false alarm probability to a desired low level. When the pre- and post-change distributions are unknown, two tests are proposed as candidate solutions. These tests are shown to attain order optimality in terms of the horizon. Furthermore, the growth in their latencies with respect to the false alarm probability and late detection probability satisfies a property that is desirable in regret analysis for piecewise stationary bandits. Numerical results are provided to validate the theoretical performance results.</description>

      <title>On de Bruijn Array Codes Part II: Linear Codes</title>

Abstract: An M-sequence generated by a primitive polynomial has many interesting and desirable properties. A pseudo-random array is the two-dimensional generalization of an M-sequence. Similarly to primitive polynomials, there are irreducible and reducible polynomials whose all nonzero sequences have the same length. In this paper, a two-dimensional generalization for such sequences is given. This generalization is for a pseudo-random array code which is a set of $r_1 \times r_2$ arrays in which each $n_1 \times n_2$ nonzero matrix is contained exactly once as a window in one of the arrays. Moreover, these arrays have the shift-and-add property, i.e., the bitwise addition of two arrays (or a nontrivial shift of such arrays) is another array (or a shift of another array) from the code. All the known arrays can be formed by folding sequences generated from an irreducible polynomial or a reducible polynomial whose factors have the same degree and the same exponent. Two proof techniques are used to prove the parameters of the constructed arrays. The first one is based on another method, different from folding, for constructing some of these arrays. The second one is a generalization of a known proof technique. This generalization enables to present pseudo-random arrays with parameters not known before and also a variety of pseudo-random array codes which cannot be generated by the first method. The two techniques also suggest two different hierarchies between pseudo-random array codes. Finally, two methods to verify whether a folding of sequences, generated by these polynomials, yields a pseudo-random array or a pseudo-random array code, will be presented.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Clustering in Mixture of Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of clustering $T$ trajectories of length $H$, each generated by one of $K$ unknown ergodic Markov chains over a finite state space of size $S$. The goal is to accurately group trajectories according to their underlying generative model. We begin by deriving an instance-dependent, high-probability lower bound on the clustering error rate, governed by the weighted KL divergence between the transition kernels of the chains. We then present a novel two-stage clustering algorithm. In Stage~I, we apply spectral clustering using a new injective Euclidean embedding for ergodic Markov chains -- a contribution of independent interest that enables sharp concentration results. Stage~II refines the initial clusters via a single step of likelihood-based reassignment. Our method achieves a near-optimal clustering error with high probability, under the conditions $H = \tilde{\Omega}(\gamma_{\mathrm{ps}}^{-1} (S^2 \vee \pi_{\min}^{-1}))$ and $TH = \tilde{\Omega}(\gamma_{\mathrm{ps}}^{-1} S^2 )$, where $\pi_{\min}$ is the minimum stationary probability of a state across the $K$ chains and $\gamma_{\mathrm{ps}}$ is the minimum pseudo-spectral gap. These requirements provide significant improvements, if not at least comparable, to the state-of-the-art guarantee (Kausik et al., 2023), and moreover, our algorithm offers a key practical advantage: unlike existing approach, it requires no prior knowledge of model-specific quantities (e.g., separation between kernels or visitation probabilities). We conclude by discussing the inherent gap between our upper and lower bounds, providing insights into the unique structure of this clustering problem.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for Jamming Source Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph-based learning provides a powerful framework for modeling complex relational structures; however, its application within the domain of wireless security remains significantly underexplored. In this work, we introduce the first application of graph-based learning for jamming source localization, addressing the imminent threat of jamming attacks in wireless networks. Unlike geometric optimization techniques that struggle under environmental uncertainties and dense interference, we reformulate the localization as an inductive graph regression task. Our approach integrates structured node representations that encode local and global signal aggregation, ensuring spatial coherence and adaptive signal fusion. To enhance robustness, we incorporate an attention-based \ac{GNN} that adaptively refines neighborhood influence and introduces a confidence-guided estimation mechanism that dynamically balances learned predictions with domain-informed priors. We evaluate our approach under complex \ac{RF} environments with various sampling densities, network topologies, jammer characteristics, and signal propagation conditions, conducting comprehensive ablation studies on graph construction, feature selection, and pooling strategies. Results demonstrate that our novel graph-based learning framework significantly outperforms established localization baselines, particularly in challenging scenarios with sparse and obfuscated signal information. Our code is available at https://github.com/tiiuae/gnn-jamming-source-localization.</description>

      <title>Receiving RISs: Enabling Channel Estimation and Autonomous Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This chapter focuses on a hardware architecture for semi-passive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) and investigates its consideration for boosting the performance of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communication systems. The architecture incorporates a single or multiple radio-frequency chains to receive pilot signals via tunable absorption phase profiles realized by the metasurface front end, as well as a controller encompassing a baseband processing unit to carry out channel estimation, and consequently, the optimization of the RIS reflection coefficients. A novel channel estimation protocol, according to which the RIS receives non-orthogonal training pilot sequences from two multi-antenna terminals via tunable absorption phase profiles, and then, estimates the respective channels via its signal processing unit, is presented. The channel estimates are particularly used by the RIS controller to design the capacity-achieving reflection phase configuration of the metasurface front end. The proposed channel estimation algorithm, which is based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), profits from the RIS random spatial absorption sampling to capture the entire signal space, and exploits the beamspace sparsity and low-rank properties of extremely large MIMO channels, which is particularly relevant for communication systems at the FR3 band and above. Our extensive numerical investigations showcase the superiority of the proposed channel estimation technique over benchmark schemes for various system and RIS hardware configuration parameters, as well as the effectiveness of using channel estimates at the RIS side to dynamically optimize the possibly phase-quantized reflection coefficients of its unit elements.</description>
