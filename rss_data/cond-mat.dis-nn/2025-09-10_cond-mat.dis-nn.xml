      <title>Coherent Transport in Two-Dimensional Disordered Potentials under Spatially Uniform SU(2) Gauge Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study interference effects in the dynamics of a spin 1/2 particle propagating in two dimensions in a disordered potential and subject to a generalized spin--orbit coupling. With the particle initially in a spin-polarized plane wave state, in the short-time regime, before the spin and momentum distributions reach their steady states, we observe a transient backscattering peak offset from the exact backscattering direction, coexisting with a coherent backscattering dip. We present an intuitive explanation of this momentum offset using a non-Abelian gauge transformation. We also describe the full time evolution of the transient peak, from its buildup to its decay with a precise prediction of the dephasing time within a perturbative framework for multiple scattering. Our results can be applied to general spatially uniform SU(2) gauge fields, including the synthetic gauge field in ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Controlling the Glass Transition through Active Fluctuating Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluctuating pairwise interactions are understood to drive fluid-like states in dense biological systems. These states find a broad range of functionalities, such as directing growth during morphogenesis and forming aggregates with heightened mechanical response. However, a tractable model capturing the role of microscopic fluctuating interactions in these structural transitions is crucially lacking. Here, we study a $p$-spin model with fluctuating pairwise couplings (of strength $D_a$ and persistence time $t_a$) as a schematic model for interaction-mediated fluidization. We find that while stronger fluctuations suppress the glass transition, more persistent fluctuations have the opposite effect. We identify the presence of an emergent fluctuation-dissipation relation at long times. We numerically extract the critical temperature $T_c(D_a, t_a)$ from a scaling relation near the transition, illustrating how microscopic fluctuations control the glass transition.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transport Reservoir Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC), a neural network designed for temporal data, enables efficient computation with low-cost training and direct physical implementation. Recently, quantum RC has opened new possibilities for conventional RC and introduced novel ideas to tackle open problems in quantum physics and advance quantum technologies. Despite its promise, it faces challenges, including physical realization, output readout, and measurement-induced back-action. Here, we propose to implement quantum RC through quantum transport in mesoscopic electronic systems. Our approach possesses several advantages: compatibility with existing device fabrication techniques, ease of output measurement, and robustness against measurement back-action. Leveraging universal conductance fluctuations, we numerically demonstrate two benchmark tasks, spoken-digit recognition and time-series forecasting, to validate our proposal. This work establishes a novel pathway for implementing on-chip quantum RC via quantum transport and expands the mesoscopic physics applications.</description>

      <title>From lines to networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many real-world networks, ranging from subway systems to polymer structures and fungal mycelia, do not form by the incremental addition of individual nodes but instead grow through the successive extension and intersection of lines or filaments. Yet most existing models for spatial network formation focus on node-based growth, leaving a significant gap in our understanding of systems built from spatially extended components. Here we introduce a minimal model for spatial networks, rooted in the iterative growth and intersection of lines-a mechanism inspired by diverse systems including transportation networks, fungal hyphae, and vascular structures. Unlike classical approaches, our model constructs networks by sequentially adding lines across a domain populated with randomly distributed points. Each line grows greedily to maximize local coverage, while subject to angular continuity and the requirement to intersect existing structures. This emphasis on extended, interacting elements governed by local optimization and geometric constraints leads to the spontaneous emergence of a core-and-branches architecture. The resulting networks display a range of non-trivial scaling behaviors: the number of intersections grows subquadratically; Flory exponents and fractal dimensions emerge consistent with empirical observations; and spatial scaling exponents depend on the heterogeneity of the underlying point distribution, aligning with measurements from subway systems. Our model thus captures key organizational features observed across diverse real-world networks, establishing a universal paradigm that goes beyond node-based approaches and demonstrates how the growth of spatially extended elements can shape the large-scale architecture of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Simulating the two-dimensional $t-J$ model at finite doping with neural quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating large, strongly interacting fermionic systems remains a major challenge for existing numerical methods. In this work, we introduce Gutzwiller projected hidden fermion determinant states (G-HFDS) to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t$-$J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that the G-HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $10 \times 10$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping and different next-nearest neighbor hopping amplitudes through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions as well as the Fermi surface. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</description>

      <title>Envelope representation of Hamilton-Jacobi equations from spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, [arXiv:2311.08980] demonstrated that, if it exists, the limit free energy of possibly non-convex spin glass models must be determined by a characteristic of the associated infinite-dimensional non-convex Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In this work, we investigate a similar theme purely from the perspective of PDEs. Specifically, we study the unique viscosity solution of the aforementioned equation and derive an envelope-type representation formula for the solution, in the form proposed by Evans in [doi:10.1007/s00526-013-0635-3]. The value of the solution is expressed as an average of the values along characteristic lines, weighted by a non-explicit probability measure. The technical challenges arise not only from the infinite dimensionality but also from the fact that the equation is defined on a closed convex cone with an empty interior, rather than on the entire space. In the introduction, we provide a description of the motivation from spin glass theory and present the corresponding results for comparison with the PDE results.</description>

      <title>Seeing Beyond Dark-Field RGB Capabilities: Deep Spectral Extrapolation of Ultrasmall Plasmonic Nanogaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Localized surface plasmons can confine light within a deep-subwavelength volume comparable to the scale of atoms and molecules, enabling ultrasensitive responses to near-field variations. On the other hand, this extreme localization also inevitably amplifies the unwanted noise from the response of local morphological imperfections, leading to complex spectral variations and reduced consistency across the plasmonic nanostructures. Seeking uniform optical responses has therefore long been a sought-after goal in nanoplasmonics. However, conventional probing techniques by dark-field (DF) confocal microscopy, such as image analysis or spectral measurements, can be inaccurate and time-consuming, respectively. Here, we introduce SPARX, a deep-learning-powered paradigm that surpasses conventional imaging and spectroscopic capabilities. In particular, SPARX can batch-predict broadband DF spectra (e.g., 500-1000 nm) of numerous nanoparticles simultaneously from an information-limited RGB image (i.e., below 700 nm). It achieves this extrapolative inference beyond the camera's capture capabilities by learning the underlying physical relationships among multiple orders of optical resonances. The spectral predictions only take milliseconds, achieving a speedup of three to four orders of magnitude compared to traditional spectral acquisition, which may take from hours to days. As a proof-of-principle demonstration for screening identical resonances, the selection accuracy achieved by SPARX is comparable to that of conventional spectroscopy techniques. This breakthrough paves the way for consistent plasmonic applications and next-generation microscopies.</description>

      <title>Extended Yard Sale model of wealth distribution on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04032v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Excessive wealth concentration can undermine economic and social development. Random Asset Exchange (RAE) models provide valuable tools to investigate this phenomenon. Assuming that economic systems may operate optimally near the critical point of a continuous phase transition, the Extended Yard Sale (EYS) model introduced by Boghosian et al.~[Physica A 476, 15 (2017)] offers a compelling framework. This model captures the interplay between wealth redistribution and accumulation, exhibiting a continuous phase transition marked by a broad wealth distribution at criticality, separating a condensed phase -- where a microscopic fraction of agents holds a macroscopic share of total wealth -- from a distributed phase with a light-tailed wealth distribution. While the original EYS model assumes fully connected interactions, this work introduces and studies a networked variant where agents interact over Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random networks. The analysis combines Monte Carlo simulations with Quenched Mean Field and Mean Field approximations, exploring a variety of interaction and taxation schemes. A scaling analysis shows that, although the networked model also undergoes a continuous phase transition, it leads to local wealth condensation rather than the global condensation found in the fully connected case. These results deepen our understanding of wealth dynamics in structured populations and may help inform the development of more effective economic and social policies.</description>

      <title>Analytic theory of dropout regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dropout is a regularization technique widely used in training artificial neural networks to mitigate overfitting. It consists of dynamically deactivating subsets of the network during training to promote more robust representations. Despite its widespread adoption, dropout probabilities are often selected heuristically, and theoretical explanations of its success remain sparse. Here, we analytically study dropout in two-layer neural networks trained with online stochastic gradient descent. In the high-dimensional limit, we derive a set of ordinary differential equations that fully characterize the evolution of the network during training and capture the effects of dropout. We obtain a number of exact results describing the generalization error and the optimal dropout probability at short, intermediate, and long training times. Our analysis shows that dropout reduces detrimental correlations between hidden nodes, mitigates the impact of label noise, and that the optimal dropout probability increases with the level of noise in the data. Our results are validated by extensive numerical simulations.</description>
