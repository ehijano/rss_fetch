      <title>Anti-aligning Self-propelled Model of Two Species: Emergence of \textit{Self-organized Heterogeneous Aligned and Clustered Order}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-propelled particles with anti-aligning interactions generally do not form a polar order. However, in this Letter, we show that when multiple types of such particles coexist and interact through aligning interactions between different species, a global polar order can emerge through the formation of elongated clusters with alternating domains of each species. By developing a mean-field theory, we reveal the conditions for cluster formation and characterize the resulting patterns. Our findings highlight the critical role of inter-species interactions in the emergence of complex ordered states.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of peptide conformational dynamics in carbon nanotubes to directional mechanical forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02352v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In living organisms, proteins and peptides are often under the influence of mechanical forces, especially in confined spaces such as membrane channels, ribosome exit tunnel, or proteasome gate. Due to the directional nature of proteins as polymers with distinct ends, forces have the potential to influence protein conformational dynamics in a direction-dependent manner. In this study, we employed force-probe molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the impact of pulling a peptide through a confined environment versus pushing it in the same direction. Our model involves a carbon nanotube and one of three decapeptides with varying amino acid sequences. The simulations reveal that the difference between pulling the C-terminus and pushing the N-terminus is relatively minor when considering the conformational ensembles of the peptides. The loading rate of the force probe and the amino acid sequence of the peptide play a more important role. However, the application of force to the peptide significantly influences the relative motion of the peptides with respect to the nanotube. Pulling the peptide results in a smoother translocation through the nanotube compared to pushing, although the internal conformational dynamics of the peptide add complexity in either case. Our findings shed light on how short peptides navigate confined spaces within the cellular environment, emphasizing the importance of force-probe simulation studies in understanding these processes.</description>

      <title>Depletion interaction between cylindrical inclusions in polymer brushes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10607v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inclusions in mobile brushes experience apparent (depletion) attraction, which arises from a tendency to minimize the volume of depletion zones around the inclusions, thereby to maximize the entropy of the surrounding polymers. Here, we study the brush-induced depletion attraction between cylindrical inclusions using molecular dynamics simulations and the Asakura-Oosawa theory. Our considerations find that the correlation blobs defined in the brush environment serve as the fundamental units of the attraction. In tall brushes, however, the entropy of the overgrown polymer competes with the depletion attraction between the inclusions. As a result, the brush-induced depletion interaction displays non-monotonic variations with the brush height. Our study not only expands the repertoire of colloid-polymer mixtures to depletion interactions in brushes, but also suggests the brush-induced depletion interaction as a previously unappreciated mechanism for glycocalyx-induced protein cluster formation on cell surfaces.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of two bacterial flagella as a stochastic process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synchronization with noise is important for understanding biophysical processes at nano- and micro-meter scales, such as neuron firing and beating of cilia. To understand the energetics of these processes, stochastic thermodynamics approaches are useful. Due to large fluctuations in a small system, ensemble averages of thermodynamic quantities are not sufficient to characterize the energetics of an individual sample. In this paper, we use a model for synchronization of bacterial flagella as an example, and develop an approximation method for analyzing the phase and heat dissipation in trajectories for different noise realizations. We describe the temporal evolution of the phase difference and heat dissipation as stochastic processes, and verify the analytical results by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantification of Flagellar Gait Changes with Combined Shape Mode Analysis and Swimming Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many different microswimmers propel themselves using flagella that beat periodically. The shape of the flagellar beat and swimming speed have been observed to change with fluid rheology. We quantify changes in the flagellar waveforms of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in response to changes in fluid viscosity using (1) shape mode analysis and (2) a full swimmer simulation to analyze how shape changes affect the swimming speed and to explore the dimensionality of the shape space. By decomposing the gait into the time-independent mean shape and the time-varying stroke, we find that the flagellar mean shape substantially changes in response to viscosity, while the changes in the time-varying stroke are more subtle. Using the swimmer simulation, we quantify how the swimming speed is affected by the dimensionality of the flagellar shape reconstruction, and we show that the observed change in swimming speed with viscosity is explained by the variations in mean flagellar shape and beat frequency, while the changes in swimming speed from the different time-varying strokes are on the scale of variation between cells.</description>

      <title>Turning on the Light: Polymorphism-Induced Photoluminescence in Cysteine Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photoluminescence of non-aromatic supramolecular chemical assemblies has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to its potential for use in molecular sensing and imaging technologies. The underlying structural origins, the mechanisms of light emission in these systems, and the generality of this phenomenon remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that crystals of L-Cysteine (Cys) formed in heavy water ($\text{D}_2\text{O}$) exhibit distinct packing and hydrogen-bond networks, resulting in significantly enhanced photoluminescence compared to those prepared in $\text{H}_2\text{O}$. Using advanced excited-state simulations, we elucidate the nature of electronic transitions that activate vibrational modes of Cys in $\text{H}_2\text{O}$, particularly those involving thiol (S-H) and amine (C-N) groups, which lead to non-radiative decay. For the crystal formed in $\text{D}_2\text{O}$, these modes appear to be more constrained, and we also observe intersystem crossing from the singlet to the triplet state, indicating a potentially more complex light emission mechanism. Our findings provide new insights into this intriguing phenomenon and introduce innovative design principles for generating emergent fluorophores.</description>
