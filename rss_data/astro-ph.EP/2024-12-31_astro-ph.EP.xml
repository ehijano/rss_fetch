      <title>Timescales of Solar System Formation Based on Al-Ti Isotope Correlation by Supernova Ejecta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radioactive decay of short-lived 26Al to 26Mg has been used to estimate the timescales over which 26Al was produced in a nearby star and the protosolar disk evolved. The chronology commonly assumes that 26Al was uniformly distributed in the protosolar disk; however, this assumption is challenged by the discordance between the timescales defined by the Al-Mg and assumption-free Pb-Pb chronometers. We find that the 26Al heterogeneity is correlated with the nucleosynthetic stable Ti isotope variation, which can be ascribed to the non-uniform distribution of ejecta from a core-collapse supernova in the disk. We use the Al-Ti isotope correlation to calibrate variable 26Al abundances in Al-Mg dating of early solar system processes. The calibrated Al-Mg chronometer indicates a &gt;1 Myr gap between parent body accretion ages of carbonaceous and non-carbonaceous chondrites. We further use the Al-Ti isotope correlation to constrain the timing and location of the supernova explosion, indicating that the explosion occurred at 20-30 pc from the protosolar cloud, 0.94 +0.25/-0.21 Myr before the formation of the oldest solar system solids. Our results imply that the Sun was born in association with a ~25 solar mass star.</description>

      <title>Orbital maneuvers for a space probe around Titania</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For most space missions, it is interesting that the probe remains for a considerable time around the mission target. The longer the lifetime of a mission, the greater the chances of collecting information about the orbited body. In this work, we present orbital maneuvers that aim to show how to avoid a collision of a space probe with the surface of Titania. Through an expansion of the gravitational potential to the second order, the asymmetry of the gravitational field due to the coefficient $C_{22}$ of Titania, the zonal coefficient $J_2$, and the gravitational perturbation of Uranus are considered. Two models of coplanar bi-impulse maneuvers are presented. The first maneuver consists of transferring an initial elliptical orbit to a final circular orbit, and the second has the objective of transferring an initial elliptical orbit to a final orbit that is also elliptical. The lag in the inclination and semi-major axis of the orbits is investigated before performing the maneuvers. To point out the best scenarios for carrying out the maneuvers, a study is presented for different points of an orbit where transfers could be made. In addition, a maneuver strategy is presented to correct the variation of the periapsis argument. The results show that maneuvers performed a few days after integration are more economical than maneuvers performed later, a few days before the collision. The economy of the maneuvers is also demonstrated through an analysis of the ratio of the increase in speed to the lifetime.</description>

      <title>An estimate of resident time of the Oort Cloud new comets in planetary region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the result of our numerical orbit simulation which traces dynamical evolution of new comets coming from the Oort Cloud. We combine two dynamical models for this purpose. The first one is semi-analytic, and it models an evolving comet cloud under galactic tide and encounters with nearby stars. The second one numerically deals with planetary perturbation in the planetary region.Although our study does not include physical effects such as fading or disintegration of comets, we found that typical dynamical resident time of the comets in the planetary region is about $10^8$ years. We also found that the so-called planet barrier works when the initial orbital inclination of the comets is small. A numerical result concerning the temporary transition of the comets into other small body populations such as transneptunian objects or Centaurs is discussed.</description>

      <title>Investigating Temporal and Spatial Variation of Jupiter's Atmosphere with Radio Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spatial and temporal variability in Jupiter's atmosphere by comparing longitude-resolved brightness temperature maps from the Very Large Array (VLA) radio observatory and NASA's Juno spacecraft Microwave Radiometer (MWR) taken between 2013 and 2018. Spatial variations in brightness temperature, as observed at radio wavelengths, indicate dynamics in the atmosphere as they trace spatial fluctuations in radio-absorbing trace gases or physical temperature. We use four distinct frequency bands, probing the atmosphere from the water cloud region at the lowest frequency to the pressures above the ammonia cloud deck at the highest frequency. We visualize the brightness temperature anomalies and trace dynamics by analyzing the shapes of brightness temperature anomaly distributions as a function of frequency in Jupiter's North Equatorial Belt (NEB), Equatorial Zone (EZ), and South Equatorial Belt (SEB). The NEB has the greatest brightness temperature variability at all frequencies, indicating that more extreme processes are occurring there than in the SEB and EZ. In general, we find that the atmosphere at 5 and 22 GHz has the least variability of the frequencies considered, while observations at 10 and 15 GHz have the greatest variability. When comparing the size of the features corresponding to the anomalies, we find evidence for small-scale events primarily at the depths probed by the 10 and 15 GHz observations. In contrast, we find larger-scale structures deeper (5 GHz) and higher (22 GHz) in the atmosphere.</description>

      <title>The RISTRETTO simulator: Exoplanet reflected spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The upcoming Ristretto spectrograph is dedicated to the detection and analysis of exoplanetary atmospheres, with a primary focus on the temperate rocky world Proxima b. This scientific endeavor relies on the interplay of a high-contrast adaptive optics (AO) system and a high-resolution echelle spectrograph. In this work, I present a comprehensive simulation of Ristretto's output spectra, employing the Python package Pyechelle. Starting from realistic spectra of both exoplanets and their host stars, I generate synthetic 2D spectra to closely resemble those that will be produced by Ristretto itself. These synthetic spectra are subsequently treated as authentic data and therefore analyzed. These simulations facilitate not only the investigation of potential exoplanetary atmospheres but also an in-depth assessment of the inherent capabilities and limitations of the Ristretto spectrograph.</description>

      <title>Novel SiC UV Instrumentation Development with Potential Applications for the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we detail recent and current work that is being carried out to fabricate and advance novel SiC UV instrumentation that is aimed at enabling more sensitive measurements across numerous disciplines, with a short discussion of the promise such detectors may hold for the Habitable Worlds Observatory. We discuss SiC instrument development progress that is being carried out under multiple NASA grants, including several PICASSO and SBIR grants, as well as an ECI grant. Testing of pixel design, properties and layout as well as maturation of the integration scheme developed through these efforts provide key technology and engineering advancement for potential HWO detectors. Achieving desired noise characteristics, responsivity, and validating operation of SiC detectors using standard read out techniques offers a compelling platform for operation of denser and higher dimensionality SiC photodiode arrays of interest for use in potential HWO Coronagraph, Spectrograph, and High Resolution Imaging Instruments. We incorporate these SiC detector properties into a simulation of potential NUV exoplanet observations by HWO using SiC detectors and also discuss potential application to HWO.</description>

      <title>Using debris disk observations to infer substellar companions orbiting within or outside a parent planetesimal belt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.05315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aims. We analyze whether the effects of secular perturbations, originating from a substellar companion, on the dust dynamics in a debris disk can be investigated with spatially resolved observations.
  Methods. We numerically simulated the collisional evolution of narrow and eccentric cold planetesimal belts around a star of spectral type A3V that are secularly perturbed by a companion that orbits either closer to or farther from the star than the belt. Based on the resulting spatial dust distributions, we simulated spatially resolved maps of their surface brightness in the $K$, $N$, and $Q$ bands and at wavelengths of 70$\mu$m and 1300$\mu$m.
  Results. Assuming a nearby debris disk seen face-on, we find that the brightness distribution varies significantly with observing wavelength, for example between the $N$ and $Q$ band. This can be explained by the varying relative contribution of the emission of the smallest grains near the blowout limit. The orbits of both the small grains that form the halo and the large grains close to the parent belt precess due to the secular perturbations induced by a companion orbiting inward of the belt. The halo, being composed of older grains, trails the belt. The magnitude of the trailing decreases with increasing perturber mass and hence with increasing strength of the perturbation, a trend we recovered in synthetic maps of surface brightness by fitting ellipses to lines of constant brightness. Systems with an outer perturber do not show a uniform halo precession since the orbits of small grains are strongly altered. We identified features of the brightness distributions suitable for distinguishing between systems with a potentially detectable inner or outer perturber, especially with a combined observation with JWST/MIRI in the $Q$ band tracing small grain emission and with ALMA at mm wavelengths tracing the position of the parent planetesimal belt.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Time Transformations Between the Solar System Barycenter, Earth, and Moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16147v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistic corrections are essential for time transformations between geocentric, solar system barycentric, and luni-centric reference systems to account for differences in gravitational potential and relative motion. As the primary reference for Earth-based systems, Terrestrial Time (TT) provides the foundation for precise synchronization across spatial and temporal frameworks. To ensure consistency with TT, Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB) must exhibit no average rate difference from TT. Although the International Astronomical Union (IAU) has established resolutions for transformations between TT and TDB, extending these frameworks to define a lunar surface time scale (TL) is essential for advancing lunar exploration. This paper derives the (TL - TT) transformation, quantifying a secular drift of 56.0256 us/day and periodic terms, with the largest amplitude of ~0.470 us at the mean anomalistic period. Additionally, the TT-compatible spatial scale and Lorentz contraction of Moon-centered positional coordinates are computed, achieving sub-nanosecond timing precision. These transformations, implemented in JPL ephemeris generation software, provide a robust framework for high-fidelity relativistic models of lunar timekeeping, enabling further refinements and supporting navigation, communication, and scientific operations in cis-lunar space.</description>

      <title>Diverse dust populations in the near-Sun environment characterized by PSP/IS$\odot$IS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (IS$\odot$IS) energetic particle instrument suite on Parker Solar Probe is dedicated to measuring energetic ions and electrons in the near-Sun environment. It includes a half-sky-viewing time-of-flight mass spectrometer (EPI-Lo) and five high-energy silicon solid-state detector-telescopes (EPI-Hi). To August 2024, eight of EPI-Lo's eighty separate telescope foils have experienced direct dust puncture events, most of which occurred inside 40 solar radii (0.19 au). These impacts represent the closest ever direct dust detections to the Sun. While there is limited information about the size/mass of each impact due to the lack of a dedicated dust instrument, we can determine the impact direction for six punctures, allowing us to partially constrain the inner zodiacal abundance. Remarkably, one of six unambiguous dust impacters was likely on a retrograde orbit, suggesting long-period cometary material may survive within 20 solar radii (0.09 au). We discuss observations in the context of improving our understanding of the inner zodiacal dust environment, highlighting multiple dust populations responsible for these events, and refining hazard assessment for near-Sun spacecraft.</description>
