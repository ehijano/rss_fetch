      <title>Phenylalanine modification in plasma-driven biocatalysis revealed by solvent accessibility and reactive dynamics in combination with protein mass spectrometry</title>

Abstract: Biocatalysis is an emerging field that provides an environmentally friendly alternative to conventional catalysis, but still it faces some challenges. One of the major difficulties for biocatalysts that require reactive species like H2O2 as co-substrates lies in the concentration of these reactive species. On the one hand, they are used as reactants, but on the other hand, they inactivate the enzymes at high concentrations. When utilizing non-thermal plasma to deliver H2O2 for biocatalysis, it is essential to understand the potential interactions between plasma-generated species (PGS) and enzymes. This is particularly important because, alongside \ch{H2O2}, other reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals, atomic oxygen, superoxide, and nitric oxide are also produced. The investigation of the localized reactivity of the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of an enzyme, with certain species, is an important tool for predicting these interactions. In combination with reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations this enabled us to identify amino acid residues that are likely targets for modifications by the PGS. A subset of the theoretical predictions made in the present study were confirmed experimentally by mass spectrometry, underlining the utility of the SASA and MD based screening approach to direct time-consuming experiments and assist their interpretation.</description>

      <title>Modelling Statistics of Polypeptides in Emissions from Smokers Near Ocean Ridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have previously shown in model studies that rapid quenches of systems of monomers interacting to form polymer chains can fix nonequilibrium chemistries which could lead to the origin of life. We suggested that such quenching processes might have occurred at very high rates on early earth, giving an efficient mechanism for natural sorting through enormous numbers of nonequilibrium chemistries from which those most likely to lead to life could be naturally selected. Taking account of kinetic barriers, we found good agreement between laboratory quenching experiments on solutions of amino acids and the resulting model. We also made a preliminary comparison between reported data on polypeptides sampled from emissions from smokers near ocean ridges and our model. However that previous model assumed that the concentrations of all monomeric amino acids in the medium were the same whereas that is not the case in samples taken from ocean smokers. Here we take account of the heterogeneous concentrations of the amino acid monomers in the medium in the analysis of the smoker data and compare the results with the data on polypeptide concentrations found in the samples taken by a submersible in the Marianna Trough. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that smokers were the source of large and extremely diverse number of polypeptides in thermal disequilibrium which could incubate processes leading to life.</description>

      <title>How to use quantum computers for biomolecular free energies</title>

Abstract: Free energy calculations are at the heart of physics-based analyses of biochemical processes. They allow us to quantify molecular recognition mechanisms, which determine a wide range of biological phenomena from how cells send and receive signals to how pharmaceutical compounds can be used to treat diseases. Quantitative and predictive free energy calculations require computational models that accurately capture both the varied and intricate electronic interactions between molecules as well as the entropic contributions from motions of these molecules and their aqueous environment. However, accurate quantum-mechanical energies and forces can only be obtained for small atomistic models, not for large biomacromolecules. Here, we demonstrate how to consistently link accurate quantum-mechanical data obtained for substructures to the overall potential energy of biomolecular complexes by machine learning in an integrated algorithm. We do so using a two-fold quantum embedding strategy where the innermost quantum cores are treated at a very high level of accuracy. We demonstrate the viability of this approach for the molecular recognition of a ruthenium-based anticancer drug by its protein target, applying traditional quantum chemical methods. As such methods scale unfavorable with system size, we analyze requirements for quantum computers to provide highly accurate energies that impact the resulting free energies. Once the requirements are met, our computational pipeline FreeQuantum is able to make efficient use of the quantum computed energies, thereby enabling quantum computing enhanced modeling of biochemical processes. This approach combines the exponential speedups of quantum computers for simulating interacting electrons with modern classical simulation techniques that incorporate machine learning to model large molecules.</description>

      <title>Behavioral Traits as Dynamical Systems: Utilizing Entropy to Analyze Longitudinal Psychometric Data in Coupled Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traits such as neuroticism persist across species despite exhibiting characteristics typically regarded as maladaptive. This project presents an alternative model for understanding the stability of such traits by integrating findings from the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study on Aging (Pedersen, 2015) (SATSA) with a system of recursive, biologically inspired ordinary differential equations (ODEs). To utilize the ODEs analytically, Shannon entropy is extracted from longitudinal Likert-scale psychometric data, enabling the translation of high-dimensional behavioral responses into continuous-time dynamical systems. The model incorporates principles from evolutionary biology, including mutation-selection balance, genetic pleiotropy and metabolic constraints, and embeds environmental feedback as a recursive driver of phenotypic expression. The argument is presented that traits such as neuroticism exist not stochastically, but as emergent multistable attractors within a biologically-constrained system. This paper shows that entropy extracted from longitudinal psychometric data can be meaningfully modeled using recursive ordinary differential equations, revealing stable dynamical attractors and biologically and environmentally grounded constraints in traits often deemed maladaptive. This framework offers a scalable, mathematically grounded foundation for analyzing phenotypic expression, with the ultimate goal of biological extension for eventual multi-omic modeling of behavioral traits.</description>

      <title>Memory in neural activity: long-range order without criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16394v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ''criticality hypothesis'', based on observed scale-free correlations in neural activity, posits that the brain operates at a critical point of transition between two phases. However, the validity of this hypothesis is still debated. Here, employing a commonly used model of cortical dynamics, we find that a phase of long-range order (LRO) in neural activity may be induced by memory (time non-locality) without invoking criticality. The cortical dynamics model contains fast and slow time scales that govern the neural and resource (memory) dynamics, respectively. When the resource dynamics are sufficiently slow, we observe an LRO phase, which manifests in avalanche size and duration probability distributions that are scale-free and satisfy finite-size scaling. When the slow and fast time scales are no longer sufficiently distinct, LRO is destroyed. Since this LRO phase spans a wide range of parameters, it is robust against perturbations, unlike critical systems.</description>

      <title>Quantifying cellular autonomy in multi-cue environments</title>

Abstract: A cell routinely responds to one of many competing environmental cues. A fundamental question is whether the cell follows the cue prioritized by its internal signaling network or the cue that carries the most external information. We introduce a theoretical framework to answer this question. We derive information limits for four types of directional cues: external and self-generated chemical gradients, fluid flow, and contact inhibition of locomotion. When the cues compete as pairs, these limits predict which cue a cell should follow if its decision is based on environmental information alone. We compare these predicted decision boundaries with data from our and others' cell migration experiments, finding cases where the boundary is obeyed and cases where it is violated by orders of magnitude. Both outcomes are informative, and we find that they rationalize known properties, or predict putative properties, of cells' internal signaling networks. Our work introduces a physical framework to quantify the degree to which a cell acts like an autonomous agent, rather than a passive detector, favoring a cue even when it is less informative.</description>

      <title>Tracking the Morphological Evolution of Neuronal Dendrites by First-Passage Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A high degree of structural complexity arises in dynamic neuronal dendrites due to extensive branching patterns and diverse spine morphologies, which enable the nervous system to adjust function, construct complex input pathways and thereby enhance the computational power of the system. Owing to the determinant role of dendrite morphology in the functionality of the nervous system, recognition of pathological changes due to neurodegenerative disorders is of crucial importance. We show that the statistical analysis of a temporary signal generated by cargos that have diffusively passed through the complex dendritic structure yields vital information about dendrite morphology. As a feasible scenario, we propose engineering mRNA-carrying multilamellar liposomes to diffusively reach the soma and release mRNAs, which are translated into a specific protein upon encountering ribosomes. The concentration of this protein over a large population of neurons can be externally measured, as a detectable temporary signal. Using a stochastic coarse-grained approach for first-passage through dendrites, we connect the key morphological properties affected by neurodegenerative diseases -- including the density and size of spines, the extent of the tree, and the segmental increase of dendrite diameter towards soma -- to the characteristics of the evolving signal. Thus, we establish a direct link between the dendrite morphology and the statistical characteristics of the detectable signal. Our approach provides a fast noninvasive measurement technique to indirectly extract vital information about the morphological evolution of dendrites in the course of neurodegenerative disease progression.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Neural Networks Enable High Fidelity Shear Wave Viscoelastography across Multiple organs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tissue viscoelasticity has been recognized as a crucial biomechanical indicator for disease diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring. Conventional shear wave elastography techniques depend on dispersion analysis and face fundamental limitations in clinical scenarios. Particularly, limited wave propagation data with low signal-to-noise ratios, along with challenges in discriminating between dual dispersion sources stemming from viscoelasticity and finite tissue dimensions, pose great difficulties for extracting dispersion relation. In this study, we introduce SWVE-Net, a framework for shear wave viscoelasticity imaging based on a physics-informed neural network (PINN). SWVE-Net circumvents dispersion analysis by directly incorporating the viscoelasticity wave motion equation into the loss functions of the PINN. Finite element simulations reveal that SWVE-Net quantifies viscosity parameters within a wide range (0.15-1.5 Pa*s), even for samples just a few millimeters in size, where substantial wave reflections and dispersion occur. Ex vivo experiments demonstrate its applicability across various organs, including brain, liver, kidney, and spleen, each with distinct viscoelasticity. In in vivo human trials on breast and skeletal muscle tissues, SWVE-Net reliably assesses viscoelastic properties with standard deviation-to-mean ratios below 15%, highlighting robustness under real-world constraints. SWVE-Net overcomes the core limitations of conventional elastography and enables reliable viscoelastic characterization where traditional methods fall short. It holds promise for applications such as grading hepatic lipid accumulation, detecting myocardial infarction boundaries, and distinguishing malignant from benign tumors.</description>

      <title>The role of dendritic spines in water exchange measurements with diffusion MRI: Time-Dependent Single Diffusion Encoding MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-dependent diffusion MRI (dMRI) with single diffusion encoding (SDE) probes water dynamics in biological tissues, but signal interpretation depends on microstructure. While prior work focused on restricted/hindered diffusion and membrane permeation, diffusion-mediated exchange between dendritic shafts and spines in gray matter (GM) remains understudied. We hypothesize that impermeable spiny dendrites produce time-dependent SDE signals mimicking permeative exchange and investigate how spine density biases exchange time estimates.
  Using Monte Carlo simulations and narrow escape theory, we quantify spine-shaft exchange times (3-26 ms), matching cortical permeative exchange estimates. A modified two-compartment Karger model characterizes time-dependent SDE signals but yields biased exchange estimates, reflecting spine volume fraction rather than morphology. Unaccounted diffusion-mediated exchange introduces up to 80% bias in NEXI/SMEX model estimates. We propose an extended three-compartment Karger model incorporating both diffusion-mediated (spine-shaft) and permeative (intra-extracellular) exchange. However, this model cannot uniquely separate membrane permeability from spine volume effects.
  Our findings emphasize that dendritic spines should be considered in SDE-based exchange studies and caution against attributing exchange solely to permeability. Advanced methods are needed to disentangle these mechanisms in GM.</description>
