      <title>Stochastic motility energetics reveals cooperative bacterial swarming in optical tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacterial flagellar swarming enables dense microbial populations to migrate collectively across surfaces, often resulting in emergent, coordinated behaviors. However, probing the underlying energetics of swarming at the single cluster level remains a challenge. Here, we combine optical tweezers and multiparticle tracking within a stochastic thermodynamic framework to characterize the active motility of confined Proteus mirabilis clusters. Using the Photon Momentum Method to directly measure trapping forces, we show that swarming clusters generate persistent, dissipative flows indicative of non equilibrium stationary motility within confined solenoidal mesostructures. These flagellar rotational dynamics break detailed balance in mesoscopic force space and exceed the limits of passive friction, as evidenced by force velocity correlations and vortex like circulations. By coarse graining cluster trajectories into an active Brownian phase space, we quantify the work performed by bacterial swarms at cooperative coupling to thermal fluctuations, resulting in dissipative Ohmic like currents overcoming conservative trapping. Our findings establish a generalizable approach to quantify collective motility and energetic dissipation in active bacterial clusters, offering new insights into the physical principles governing microbial cooperativity.</description>

      <title>Active viscoelastic condensates provide controllable mechanical anchor points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many biological materials must couple mechanical strength with the ability to rapidly self-assemble at a specific location. In particular, biomolecular condensates readily self-assemble via phase separation, but may also need to resist external forces to fulfil their function. Spatial localisation of condensate formation can be controlled by active cores that preferentially drive the production of condensate material at a particular point, while resistance to external forces can be facilitated by viscoelastic material properties. To investigate the interplay of these two processes, we develop a continuum model of viscoelastic growth around an active core. We find that viscoelastic stresses restrict condensate growth, but also impart resistance to deformation. We investigate the effect of different incorporation schemes on growth dynamics, and test the influence of mechanical properties on condensate strength. Finally, we compare the predictions of our model to experimental data from centrosomes in C. elegans embryos, identifying a parameter regime in which rapid growth can be combined with appropriate mechanical strength, and studying how strain-dependent material incorporation may lead to isotropic growth of scaffold material. Our results provide general design principles for other materials that must reconcile rapid, localised self-assembly with mechanical strength, such as focal adhesions.</description>

      <title>Modeling flying formations as flow-mediated matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective locomotion of swimming and flying animals is fascinating in terms of individual-level fluid mechanics and group-level structure and dynamics. Here we bridge and relate these scales through a model of formation flight that views the collective as a material whose properties arise from the flow-mediated interactions among its members. We build on and revise an aerodynamic model describing how flapping flyers produce vortex wakes and how they are forced by others' wakes. While simplistic, the model faithfully reproduces a series of physical experiments carried out over the last decade on pairwise interactions of flapping foils. By studying longer in-line arrays, we show that the group behaves as a soft "crystal" with regularly spaced member "atoms" whose positioning is, however, susceptible to deformations and dynamical instabilities. Poking or wiggling a member excites longitudinal waves (flow-mediated phonons, or "flonons") that pass down the group while growing in amplitude, and indeed the internal excitation from flapping is sufficient to trigger instabilities. Linear analysis of the model explains the aerodynamic origin of the lattice spacing, the springiness of the "bonds" between flyers, and the tendency for disturbances to resonantly amplify. Other properties such as the timescales for instability growth and wave propagation seem to involve the full nonlinear behavior. These findings suggest intriguing analogies with physical materials that could be generally useful for understanding and analyzing animal groups. Several properties displayed by our system seem particularly relevant to biological collectives, namely group cohesion and organization, sensitive detection of and response to perturbations, and transmission of information through traveling waves.</description>

      <title>Controlling energy delivery with bistable nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Countless biological processes are fueled by energy-rich molecules like ATP and GTP that supply energy with extreme efficiency. However, designing similar energy-delivery schemes from the bottom up, essential for the development of powered nanostructures and other {\it de novo} machinery, presents a significant challenge: how can an energy-rich structure be stable in solution yet still deliver this energy at precisely the right time? In this paper, we present a purely physical mechanism that solves this challenge, facilitating energy transfer akin to ATP hydrolysis, yet occurring between synthetic nanostructures without any biochemical interactions. This targeted energy delivery is achieved by exploiting a differentiable state-based model to balance the energy profiles that govern the structural transitions in the two nanostructures, creating a combined relaxation pathway with minimal barriers that facilitates energy delivery. We verify the effectiveness and robustness of this mechanism through Molecular Dynamics simulations, demonstrating that a bath of the high-energy structures can systematically and repeatedly drive the target structure out of equilibrium, enabling it to perform tasks. As the mechanism operates only through explicit physical forces without any biochemistry or internal state variables, our results present generic and far-reaching design principles, setting the stage for the next generation of synthetic nanomachines.</description>

      <title>Coupling Anisotropic Curvature and Nematic Order: Mechanisms of Membrane Shape Remodeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study theoretically investigates how anisotropic curved membrane components (CMCs) control vesicle morphology through curvature sensing, nematic alignment, topological defects, and volume constraints. By comparing arc-shaped and saddle-shaped CMCs, we identify a rich spectrum of steady-state phases. For fully CMC-covered vesicles, arc-shaped components drive a pearling-to-cylinder transition as nematic interactions strengthen, while on partially CMC-covered vesicles, the saddle-shaped CMCs stabilize necks between the convex regions of bare membrane. We map the steady-state shapes of vesicles partially covered by arc-like and saddle-shaped CMCs, exposing how different vesicle shapes depend on the interplay between nematic interactions and volume constraints, revealing several novel phases. By investigating the in-plane nematic field, we find that topological defects consistently localize to high-curvature regions, revealing how intrinsic and deviatoric curvature effects cooperate in membrane remodeling. These findings establish a unified framework for understanding how proteins and lipid domains with anisotropic intrinsic curvature shape cellular structures -- from organelle morphogenesis to global cell shape.</description>

      <title>Repulsive particle interactions enable selective information processing at cellular interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Living systems relay information across membrane interfaces to coordinate compartment functions. We identify a physical mechanism for selective information transmission that arises from the sigmoidal response of surface-bound particle densities to spatial features of adjacent external structures. This mechanism implements a form of spatial thresholding, enabling the binary classification of external cues. Expansion microscopy measurements of nuclear pore complex distributions in S. arctica show signatures of such physical thresholding.</description>

      <title>Geo-Somatic Resonance Theory A Vibrational Framework for Sleep as Planetary Entrainment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sleep is commonly studied through neurochemical, evolutionary, and behavioral frameworks, typically emphasizing circadian rhythms and energy conservation. However, these approaches do not fully explain a deeper biophysical question: why does sleep universally involve physical stillness, a lying posture, and disconnection from conscious control? This paper introduces a new hypothesis that sleep is not merely a biological function, but a state of vibrational synchronization between the human body and natural frequencies generated by the Earth. In this state, the body reduces its autonomous activity and aligns with external environmental rhythms, allowing for energy restoration, internal recalibration, and systemic reorganization. This perspective reframes life as a continuous process of internally driven vibration influenced by external physical fields. The proposed model offers new avenues for understanding aging, health, death, and consciousness.</description>
