      <title>How human is the machine? Evidence from 66,000 Conversations with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When Artificial Intelligence (AI) is used to replace consumers (e.g., synthetic data), it is often assumed that AI emulates established consumers, and more generally human behaviors. Ten experiments with Large Language Models (LLMs) investigate if this is true in the domain of well-documented biases and heuristics. Across studies we observe four distinct types of deviations from human-like behavior. First, in some cases, LLMs reduce or correct biases observed in humans. Second, in other cases, LLMs amplify these same biases. Third, and perhaps most intriguingly, LLMs sometimes exhibit biases opposite to those found in humans. Fourth, LLMs' responses to the same (or similar) prompts tend to be inconsistent (a) within the same model after a time delay, (b) across models, and (c) among independent research studies. Such inconsistencies can be uncharacteristic of humans and suggest that, at least at one point, LLMs' responses differed from humans. Overall, unhuman-like responses are problematic when LLMs are used to mimic or predict consumer behavior. These findings complement research on synthetic consumer data by showing that sources of bias are not necessarily human-centric. They also contribute to the debate about the tasks for which consumers, and more generally humans, can be replaced by AI.</description>

      <title>A LoRa IoT Framework with Machine Learning for Remote Livestock Monitoring in Smart Agriculture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents AgroTrack, a LoRa-based IoT framework for remote livestock monitoring in smart agriculture. The system is designed for low-power, long-range communication and supports real-time tracking and basic health assessment of free-range livestock through GPS, motion, and temperature sensors integrated into wearable collars. Data is collected and transmitted via LoRa to gateways and forwarded to a cloud platform for visualization, alerts, and analytics. To enhance its practical deployment, AgroTrack incorporates advanced analytics, including machine learning models for predictive health alerts and behavioral anomaly detection. This integration transforms the framework from a basic monitoring tool into an intelligent decision-support system, enabling farmers to improve livestock management, operational efficiency, and sustainability in rural environments.</description>

      <title>IGUANA: Immersive Guidance, Navigation, and Control for Consumer UAV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the markets for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and mixed reality (MR) headsets continue to grow, recent research has increasingly explored their integration, which enables more intuitive, immersive, and situationally aware control systems. We present IGUANA, an MR-based immersive guidance, navigation, and control system for consumer UAVs. IGUANA introduces three key elements beyond conventional control interfaces: (1) a 3D terrain map interface with draggable waypoint markers and live camera preview for high-level control, (2) a novel spatial control metaphor that uses a virtual ball as a physical analogy for low-level control, and (3) a spatial overlay that helps track the UAV when it is not visible with the naked eye or visual line of sight is interrupted. We conducted a user study to evaluate our design, both quantitatively and qualitatively, and found that (1) the 3D map interface is intuitive and easy to use, relieving users from manual control and suggesting improved accuracy and consistency with lower perceived workload relative to conventional dual-stick controller, (2) the virtual ball interface is intuitive but limited by the lack of physical feedback, and (3) the spatial overlay is very useful in enhancing the users' situational awareness.</description>

      <title>The Slow Space Editor : Broadening Access to Restorative XR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Slow Space Editor is a 2D tool for creating 3D spaces. It was built as part of a research-through-design project that investigates how Virtual and Mixed Reality (XR) environments might be used for reflection and attention restoration. In this phase, we seek to radically simplify the creation of virtual environments, thereby broadening the potential group of users who could benefit from them. The research described in this paper has three aspects. First, we define the concept of "slow space," situating it alongside existing research in HCI and environmental psychology. Second, we report on a series of interviews with professional designers about how slow spaces are created in the physical world. Third, we share the design of the tool itself, focussing on the benefits of providing a simple method for users to control their environments. We conclude with our findings from a 19-person qualitative study of the tool.</description>

      <title>Human-in-the-Loop Optimization with Model-Informed Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-in-the-loop optimization identifies optimal interface designs by iteratively observing user performance. However, it often requires numerous iterations due to the lack of prior information. While recent approaches have accelerated this process by leveraging previous optimization data, collecting user data remains costly and often impractical. We present a conceptual framework, Human-in-the-Loop Optimization with Model-Informed Priors (HOMI), which augments human-in-the-loop optimization with a training phase where the optimizer learns adaptation strategies from diverse, synthetic user data generated with predictive models before deployment. To realize HOMI, we introduce Neural Acquisition Function+ (NAF+), a Bayesian optimization method featuring a neural acquisition function trained with reinforcement learning. NAF+ learns optimization strategies from large-scale synthetic data, improving efficiency in real-time optimization with users. We evaluate HOMI and NAF+ with mid-air keyboard optimization, a representative VR input task. Our work presents a new approach for more efficient interface adaptation by bridging in situ and in silico optimization processes.</description>

      <title>The Rise of the Knowledge Sculptor: A New Archetype for Knowledge Work in the Age of Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Generative Age, the nature of knowledge work is transforming. Traditional models that emphasise the organisation and retrieval of pre-existing information are increasingly inadequate in the face of generative AI (GenAI) systems capable of autonomous content creation. This paper introduces the Knowledge Sculptor (KS), a new professional archetype for Human-GenAI collaboration that transforms raw AI output into trustworthy, actionable knowledge. Grounded in a socio-technical perspective, the KS is conceptualised through a framework of competencies, including architecting a vision, iterative dialogue, information sculpting, and curiosity-driven synthesis. A practice-based vignette illustrates the KS role in action, and in a self-referential approach, the paper itself serves as an artefact of the sculpting process it describes.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Evaluation of Self-Supervised Learning for Label-Efficient Sleep Staging with Wearable EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable EEG devices have emerged as a promising alternative to polysomnography (PSG). As affordable and scalable solutions, their widespread adoption results in the collection of massive volumes of unlabeled data that cannot be analyzed by clinicians at scale. Meanwhile, the recent success of deep learning for sleep scoring has relied on large annotated datasets. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers an opportunity to bridge this gap, leveraging unlabeled signals to address label scarcity and reduce annotation effort. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of SSL for sleep staging using wearable EEG. We investigate a range of well-established SSL methods and evaluate them on two sleep databases acquired with the Ikon Sleep wearable EEG headband: BOAS, a high-quality benchmark containing PSG and wearable EEG recordings with consensus labels, and HOGAR, a large collection of home-based, self-recorded, and unlabeled recordings. Three evaluation scenarios are defined to study label efficiency, representation quality, and cross-dataset generalization. Results show that SSL consistently improves classification performance by up to 10% over supervised baselines, with gains particularly evident when labeled data is scarce. SSL achieves clinical-grade accuracy above 80% leveraging only 5% to 10% of labeled data, while the supervised approach requires twice the labels. Additionally, SSL representations prove robust to variations in population characteristics, recording environments, and signal quality. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SSL to enable label-efficient sleep staging with wearable EEG, reducing reliance on manual annotations and advancing the development of affordable sleep monitoring systems.</description>

      <title>Pre/Absence: Prompting Cultural Awareness and Understanding for Lost Architectural Heritage in Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lost architectural heritage presents interpretive challenges due to vanished structures and fragmented historical records. Using Hanyuan Hall of the Tang dynasty's Daming Palace as a case study, we conducted a formative investigation with archaeologists, heritage administrators, and visitors to identify key issues in current interpretation practices. We found that these practices often compress complex cultural layers into factual summaries and rely on linear narratives that overlook the continuing reinterpretations following a site's disappearance. In response, we designed Pre/Absence, a virtual reality experience grounded in the presence-absence dialectic to interweave tangible and vanished aspects of heritage within a spatiotemporal narrative. A mixed-method study with 28 participants compared Pre/Absence to a paper-based experience. Both improved users' factual understanding, but the VR experience more strongly enhanced cultural awareness, evoked emotional engagement with loss, and encouraged critical reflection on the evolving social and political meanings of heritage. The findings suggest that VR can move beyond static reconstruction to engage users as co-constructors of cultural meaning, providing a nuanced framework for critical heritage narrative design in human-computer interaction.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Locomotion Differences Between Virtual Reality Users With and Without Motor Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today's virtual reality (VR) systems and environments assume that users have typical abilities, which can make VR inaccessible to people with physical impairments. However, there is not yet an understanding of how inaccessible locomotion techniques are, and which interactions make them inaccessible. To this end, we conducted a study in which people with and without upper-body impairments navigated a virtual environment with six locomotion techniques to quantify performance differences among groups. We found that groups performed similarly with Sliding Looking on all performance measures, suggesting that this might be a good default locomotion technique for VR apps. To understand the nature of performance differences with the other techniques, we collected low-level interaction data from the controllers and headset and analyzed interaction differences with a set of movement-, button-, and target-related metrics. We found that movement-related metrics from headset data reveal differences among groups with all techniques, suggesting these are good metrics for identifying whether a user has an upper-body impairment. We also identify movement-, button, and target- related metrics that can explain performance differences between groups for particular locomotion techniques.</description>

      <title>Development of Mental Models in Human-AI Collaboration: A Conceptual Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has become integral to organizational decision-making and while research has explored many facets of this human-AI collaboration, the focus has mainly been on designing the AI agent(s) and the way the collaboration is set up - generally assuming a human decision-maker to be "fixed". However, it has largely been neglected that decision-makers' mental models evolve through their continuous interaction with AI systems. This paper addresses this gap by conceptualizing how the design of human-AI collaboration influences the development of three complementary and interdependent mental models necessary for this collaboration. We develop an integrated socio-technical framework that identifies the mechanisms driving the mental model evolution: data contextualization, reasoning transparency, and performance feedback. Our work advances human-AI collaboration literature through three key contributions: introducing three distinct mental models (domain, information processing, complementarity-awareness); recognizing the dynamic nature of mental models; and establishing mechanisms that guide the purposeful design of effective human-AI collaboration.</description>

      <title>Sentiment Matters: An Analysis of 200 Human-SAV Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) are likely to become an important part of the transportation system, making effective human-SAV interactions an important area of research. This paper introduces a dataset of 200 human-SAV interactions to further this area of study. We present an open-source human-SAV conversational dataset, comprising both textual data (e.g., 2,136 human-SAV exchanges) and empirical data (e.g., post-interaction survey results on a range of psychological factors). The dataset's utility is demonstrated through two benchmark case studies: First, using random forest modeling and chord diagrams, we identify key predictors of SAV acceptance and perceived service quality, highlighting the critical influence of response sentiment polarity (i.e., perceived positivity). Second, we benchmark the performance of an LLM-based sentiment analysis tool against the traditional lexicon-based TextBlob method. Results indicate that even simple zero-shot LLM prompts more closely align with user-reported sentiment, though limitations remain. This study provides novel insights for designing conversational SAV interfaces and establishes a foundation for further exploration into advanced sentiment modeling, adaptive user interactions, and multimodal conversational systems.</description>

      <title>Practicing a Second Language Without Fear: Mixed Reality Agents for Interactive Group Conversation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing speaking proficiency in a second language can be cognitively demanding and emotionally taxing, often triggering fear of making mistakes or being excluded from larger groups. While current learning tools show promise for speaking practice, most focus on dyadic, scripted scenarios, limiting opportunities for dynamic group interactions. To address this gap, we present ConversAR, a Mixed Reality system that leverages Generative AI and XR to support situated and personalized group conversations. It integrates embodied AI agents, scene recognition, and generative 3D props anchored to real-world surroundings. Based on a formative study with experts in language acquisition, we developed and tested this system with a user study with 21 second-language learners. Results indicate that the system enhanced learner engagement, increased willingness to communicate, and offered a safe space for speaking. We discuss the implications for integrating Generative AI and XR into the design of future language learning applications.</description>

      <title>Simulating Teams with LLM Agents: Interactive 2D Environments for Studying Human-AI Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enabling users to create their own simulations offers a powerful way to study team dynamics and performance. We introduce VirTLab, a system that allows researchers and practitioners to design interactive, customizable simulations of team dynamics with LLM-based agents situated in 2D spatial environments. Unlike prior frameworks that restrict scenarios to predefined or static tasks, our approach enables users to build scenarios, assign roles, and observe how agents coordinate, move, and adapt over time. By bridging team cognition behaviors with scalable agent-based modeling, our system provides a testbed for investigating how environments influence coordination, collaboration, and emergent team behaviors. We demonstrate its utility by aligning simulated outcomes with empirical evaluations and a user study, underscoring the importance of customizable environments for advancing research on multi-agent simulations. This work contributes to making simulations accessible to both technical and non-technical users, supporting the design, execution, and analysis of complex multi-agent experiments.</description>

      <title>LacAIDes: Generative AI-Supported Creative Interactive Circuits Crafting to Enliven Traditional Lacquerware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lacquerware, a representative craft of Chinese intangible cultural heritage, is renowned for its layered aesthetics and durability but faces declining engagement. While prior human-computer interaction research has explored embedding interactive circuits to transform lacquerware into responsive artifacts, most studies have focused on fabrication techniques rather than supporting makers in creatively designing such interactions at a low threshold. To address this gap, we present LacAIDes, a Generative AI powered creativity-support tool built on a multi-agent workflow aligned with the double diamond model of design thinking. LacAIDes enables exploration and creation of culturally grounded interactive circuits without requiring prior technical expertise. We evaluated LacAIDes in a longitudinal workshop with 34 participants using a mixed-method approach. Results show that LacAIDes demonstrated high usability, enhanced creative engagement in craft making, and encouraged critical reflection on the role of Generative AI in digital craft practices. This work contributes to human-computer interaction by introducing a novel creativity-support tool and providing empirical insights into revitalizing traditional craft making through Generative AI.</description>

      <title>Motion Exploration of Articulated Product Concepts in Interactive Sketching Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the early stages of engineering design, it is essential to know how a product behaves, especially how it moves. As designers must keep adjusting the motion until it meets the intended requirements, this process is often repetitive and time-consuming. Although the physics behind these motions is usually based on simple equations, manually working through them can be tedious and inefficient. To ease this burden, some tasks are now handled by computers. One common method involves converting hand-drawn sketches into models using CAD or CAE software. However, this approach can be time- and resource-intensive. Additionally, product sketches are usually best understood only by the designers who created them. Others may struggle to interpret them correctly, relying heavily on intuition and prior experience. Since sketches are static, they fail to show how a product moves, limiting their usefulness. This paper presents a new approach that addresses these issues by digitising the natural act of sketching. It allows designers to create, simulate, and test the motion of mechanical concepts in a more interactive way. An application was developed to evaluate this method, focusing on user satisfaction and mental workload during a design task. The results showed a 77% reduction in cognitive effort compared to traditional methods, with users reporting high satisfaction. Future work will focus on expanding this approach from 2D (planar) to full 3D (spatial) design environments, enabling more complex product concept development.</description>

      <title>What Makes a Visualization Complex?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the perceived visual complexity (VC) in data visualizations using objective image-based metrics. We collected VC scores through a large-scale crowdsourcing experiment involving 349 participants and 1,800 visualization images. We then examined how these scores align with 12 image-based metrics spanning information-theoretic, clutter, color, and our two object-based metrics. Our results show that both low-level image properties and the high-level elements affect perceived VC in visualization images; The number of corners and distinct colors are robust metrics across visualizations. Second, feature congestion, an information-theoretic metric capturing statistical patterns in color and texture, is the strongest predictor of perceived complexity in visualizations rich in the same stimuli; edge density effectively explains VC in node-link diagrams. Additionally, we observe a bell-curve effect for text annotations: increasing text-to-ink ratio (TiR) initially reduces complexity, reaching an optimal point, beyond which further text increases perceived complexity. Our quantification pipeline is also interpretable, enabling metric-based explanations, grounded in the VisComplexity2K dataset, bridging computational metrics with human perceptual responses. osf.io/5xe8a has the preregistration and osf.io/bdet6 has the VisComplexity2K dataset, source code, and all Apdx. and figures.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Based Approach to Enhanced Recognition of Emotions and Behavioral Patterns of Autistic Children</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder significantly influences the communication abilities, learning processes, behavior, and social interactions of individuals. Although early intervention and customized educational strategies are critical to improving outcomes, there is a pivotal gap in understanding and addressing nuanced behavioral patterns and emotional identification in autistic children prior to skill development. This extended research delves into the foundational step of recognizing and mapping these patterns as a prerequisite to improving learning and soft skills. Using a longitudinal approach to monitor emotions and behaviors, this study aims to establish a baseline understanding of the unique needs and challenges faced by autistic students, particularly in the Information Technology domain, where opportunities are markedly limited. Through a detailed analysis of behavioral trends over time, we propose a targeted framework for developing applications and technical aids designed to meet these identified needs. Our research underscores the importance of a sequential and evidence-based intervention approach that prioritizes a deep understanding of each child's behavioral and emotional landscape as the basis for effective skill development. By shifting the focus toward early identification of behavioral patterns, we aim to foster a more inclusive and supportive learning environment that can significantly improve the educational and developmental trajectory of children with ASD.</description>

      <title>Modeling Developer Burnout with GenAI Adoption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly reshaping software development workflows. While prior studies emphasize productivity gains, the adoption of GenAI also introduces new pressures that may harm developers' well-being. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the adoption of GenAI and developers' burnout. We utilized the Job Demands--Resources (JD--R) model as the analytic lens in our empirical study. We employed a concurrent embedded mixed-methods research design, integrating quantitative and qualitative evidence. We first surveyed 442 developers across diverse organizations, roles, and levels of experience. We then employed Partial Least Squares--Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) and regression to model the relationships among job demands, job resources, and burnout, complemented by a qualitative analysis of open-ended responses to contextualize the quantitative findings. Our results show that GenAI adoption heightens burnout by increasing job demands, while job resources and positive perceptions of GenAI mitigate these effects, reframing adoption as an opportunity.</description>

      <title>Investigating Thematic Patterns and User Preferences in LLM Interactions using BERTopic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study applies BERTopic, a transformer-based topic modeling technique, to the lmsys-chat-1m dataset, a multilingual conversational corpus built from head-to-head evaluations of large language models (LLMs). Each user prompt is paired with two anonymized LLM responses and a human preference label, used to assess user evaluation of competing model outputs. The main objective is uncovering thematic patterns in these conversations and examining their relation to user preferences, particularly if certain LLMs are consistently preferred within specific topics. A robust preprocessing pipeline was designed for multilingual variation, balancing dialogue turns, and cleaning noisy or redacted data. BERTopic extracted over 29 coherent topics including artificial intelligence, programming, ethics, and cloud infrastructure. We analysed relationships between topics and model preferences to identify trends in model-topic alignment. Visualization techniques included inter-topic distance maps, topic probability distributions, and model-versus-topic matrices. Our findings inform domain-specific fine-tuning and optimization strategies for improving real-world LLM performance and user satisfaction.</description>

      <title>Retentive Relevance: Capturing Long-Term User Value in Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommendation systems have traditionally relied on short-term engagement signals, such as clicks and likes, to personalize content. However, these signals are often noisy, sparse, and insufficient for capturing long-term user satisfaction and retention. We introduce Retentive Relevance, a novel content-level survey-based feedback measure that directly assesses users' intent to return to the platform for similar content. Unlike other survey measures that focus on immediate satisfaction, Retentive Relevance targets forward-looking behavioral intentions, capturing longer term user intentions and providing a stronger predictor of retention. We validate Retentive Relevance using psychometric methods, establishing its convergent, discriminant, and behavioral validity. Through large-scale offline modeling, we show that Retentive Relevance significantly outperforms both engagement signals and other survey measures in predicting next-day retention, especially for users with limited historical engagement. We develop a production-ready proxy model that integrates Retentive Relevance into the final stage of a multi-stage ranking system on a social media platform. Calibrated score adjustments based on this model yield substantial improvements in engagement, and retention, while reducing exposure to low-quality content, as demonstrated by large-scale A/B experiments. This work provides the first empirically validated framework linking content-level user perceptions to retention outcomes in production systems. We offer a scalable, user-centered solution that advances both platform growth and user experience. Our work has broad implications for responsible AI development.</description>

      <title>Towards Meaningful Transparency in Civic AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has become a part of the provision of governmental services, from making decisions about benefits to issuing fines for parking violations. However, AI systems rarely live up to the promise of neutral optimisation, creating biased or incorrect outputs and reducing the agency of both citizens and civic workers to shape the way decisions are made. Transparency is a principle that can both help subjects understand decisions made about them and shape the processes behind those decisions. However, transparency as practiced around AI systems tends to focus on the production of technical objects that represent algorithmic aspects of decision making. These are often difficult for publics to understand, do not connect to potential for action, and do not give insight into the wider socio-material context of decision making. In this paper, we build on existing approaches that take a human-centric view on AI transparency, combined with a socio-technical systems view, to develop the concept of meaningful transparency for civic AI systems: transparencies that allow publics to engage with AI systems that affect their lives, connecting understanding with potential for action.</description>

      <title>Enabling Personalized Long-term Interactions in LLM-based Agents through Persistent Memory and User Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as the central control unit of AI agents, yet current approaches remain limited in their ability to deliver personalized interactions. While Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM capabilities by improving context-awareness, it lacks mechanisms to combine contextual information with user-specific data. Although personalization has been studied in fields such as human-computer interaction or cognitive science, existing perspectives largely remain conceptual, with limited focus on technical implementation. To address these gaps, we build on a unified definition of personalization as a conceptual foundation to derive technical requirements for adaptive, user-centered LLM-based agents. Combined with established agentic AI patterns such as multi-agent collaboration or multi-source retrieval, we present a framework that integrates persistent memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles to enable personalized long-term interactions. We evaluate our approach on three public datasets using metrics such as retrieval accuracy, response correctness, or BertScore. We complement these results with a five-day pilot user study providing initial insights into user feedback on perceived personalization. The study provides early indications that guide future work and highlights the potential of integrating persistent memory and user profiles to improve the adaptivity and perceived personalization of LLM-based agents.</description>

      <title>Attribution-by-design: Ensuring Inference-Time Provenance in Generative Music Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of AI-generated music is diluting royalty pools and revealing structural flaws in existing remuneration frameworks, challenging the well-established artist compensation systems in the music industry. Existing compensation solutions, such as piecemeal licensing agreements, lack scalability and technical rigour, while current data attribution mechanisms provide only uncertain estimates and are rarely implemented in practice. This paper introduces a framework for a generative music infrastructure centred on direct attribution, transparent royalty distribution, and granular control for artists and rights' holders. We distinguish ontologically between the training set and the inference set, which allows us to propose two complementary forms of attribution: training-time attribution and inference-time attribution. We here favour inference-time attribution, as it enables direct, verifiable compensation whenever an artist's catalogue is used to condition a generated output. Besides, users benefit from the ability to condition generations on specific songs and receive transparent information about attribution and permitted usage. Our approach offers an ethical and practical solution to the pressing need for robust compensation mechanisms in the era of AI-generated music, ensuring that provenance and fairness are embedded at the core of generative systems.</description>

      <title>Everything is Plausible: Investigating the Impact of LLM Rationales on Human Notions of Plausibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the degree to which human plausibility judgments of multiple-choice commonsense benchmark answers are subject to influence by (im)plausibility arguments for or against an answer, in particular, using rationales generated by LLMs. We collect 3,000 plausibility judgments from humans and another 13,600 judgments from LLMs. Overall, we observe increases and decreases in mean human plausibility ratings in the presence of LLM-generated PRO and CON rationales, respectively, suggesting that, on the whole, human judges find these rationales convincing. Experiments with LLMs reveal similar patterns of influence. Our findings demonstrate a novel use of LLMs for studying aspects of human cognition, while also raising practical concerns that, even in domains where humans are ``experts'' (i.e., common sense), LLMs have the potential to exert considerable influence on people's beliefs.</description>

      <title>Beyond Sub-6 GHz: Leveraging mmWave Wi-Fi for Gait-Based Person Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Person identification plays a vital role in enabling intelligent, personalized, and secure human-computer interaction. Recent research has demonstrated the feasibility of leveraging Wi-Fi signals for passive person identification using a person's unique gait pattern. Although most existing work focuses on sub-6 GHz frequencies, the emergence of mmWave offers new opportunities through its finer spatial resolution, though its comparative advantages for person identification remain unexplored. This work presents the first comparative study between sub-6 GHz and mmWave Wi-Fi signals for person identification with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Wi-Fi, using a novel dataset of synchronized measurements from the two frequency bands in an indoor environment. To ensure a fair comparison, we apply identical training pipelines and model configurations across both frequency bands. Leveraging end-to-end deep learning, we show that even at low sampling rates (10 Hz), mmWave Wi-Fi signals can achieve high identification accuracy (91.2% on 20 individuals) when combined with effective background subtraction.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Depth-Aware Method For Embodied Reference Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embodied Reference Understanding requires identifying a target object in a visual scene based on both language instructions and pointing cues. While prior works have shown progress in open-vocabulary object detection, they often fail in ambiguous scenarios where multiple candidate objects exist in the scene. To address these challenges, we propose a novel ERU framework that jointly leverages LLM-based data augmentation, depth-map modality, and a depth-aware decision module. This design enables robust integration of linguistic and embodied cues, improving disambiguation in complex or cluttered environments. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving more accurate and reliable referent detection.</description>

      <title>To Ask or Not to Ask: Learning to Require Human Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing decision-support systems that complement human performance in classification tasks remains an open challenge. A popular approach, Learning to Defer (LtD), allows a Machine Learning (ML) model to pass difficult cases to a human expert. However, LtD treats humans and ML models as mutually exclusive decision-makers, restricting the expert contribution to mere predictions. To address this limitation, we propose Learning to Ask (LtA), a new framework that handles both when and how to incorporate expert input in an ML model. LtA is based on a two-part architecture: a standard ML model and an enriched model trained with additional expert human feedback, with a formally optimal strategy for selecting when to query the enriched model. We provide two practical implementations of LtA: a sequential approach, which trains the models in stages, and a joint approach, which optimises them simultaneously. For the latter, we design surrogate losses with realisable-consistency guarantees. Our experiments with synthetic and real expert data demonstrate that LtA provides a more flexible and powerful foundation for effective human-AI collaboration.</description>

      <title>Understanding Teen Overreliance on AI Companion Chatbots Through Self-Reported Reddit Narratives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15783v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI companion chatbots are increasingly popular with teens, while these interactions are entertaining, they also risk overuse that can potentially disrupt offline daily life. We examined how adolescents describe reliance on AI companions, mapping their experiences onto behavioral addiction frameworks and exploring pathways to disengagement, by analyzing 318 Reddit posts made by users who self-disclosed as 13-17 years old on the Character.AI subreddit. We found teens often begin using chatbots for support or creative play, but these activities can deepen into strong attachments marked by conflict, withdrawal, tolerance, relapse, and mood regulation. Reported consequences include sleep loss, academic decline, and strained real-world connections. Disengagement commonly arises when teens recognize harm, re-engage with offline life, or encounter restrictive platform changes. We highlight specific risks of character-based companion chatbots based on teens' perspectives and introduce a design framework (CARE) for guidance for safer systems and setting directions for future teen-centered research.</description>

      <title>Confident-Knowledge Diversity Drives Human-Human and Human-AI Free Discussion Synergy and Reveals Pure-AI Discussion Shortfalls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conversations transform individual knowledge into collective insight, enabling collaborators to solve problems more accurately than they could alone. Whether dialogues among large language models (LLMs) can replicate the synergistic gains observed in human discussion remains unclear. We systematically compared four interaction settings: LLM-LLM pairs, LLM trios, human trios, and human-LLM pairs, using validated medical multiple-choice questions. Agents answered individually, engaged in open-ended discussion, then re-answered, allowing us to quantify conversational gains. Interactions that included humans consistently yielded synergy (post-discussion accuracy increased for both stronger and weaker participants), whereas purely LLM groups did not improve and often declined. To explain and prospectively predict when unstructured dialogue helps, we introduce an agent-agnostic confident-knowledge framework that models each participant by performance (accuracy) and confidence. This framework quantifies confident-knowledge diversity, the degree to which one agent tends to be correct when another is uncertain, and yields a conservative upper bound on gains achievable via confidence-informed decisions, which we term Potential Conversation Synergy. Across humans, LLMs, and mixed teams, this metric prospectively predicts observed conversational improvements: when confident-knowledge diversity is low (as in LLM-only groups), discussion doesn't improve performance; when it is present (as in human or human-LLM groups), free-form dialogue reliably lifts accuracy. These findings propose a new concept and method for AI collaboration: quantifying confident-knowledge diversity to prospectively predict conversational gains and guide team selection and interaction design in both multi-agent and human-AI settings.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal GUI Architecture for Interfacing with LLM-Based Conversational Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) and real-time speech recognition now make it possible to issue any graphical user interface (GUI) action through natural language and receive the corresponding system response directly through the GUI. Most production applications were never designed with speech in mind. This article provides a concrete architecture that enables GUIs to interface with LLM-based speech-enabled assistants.
  The architecture makes an application's navigation graph and semantics available through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The ViewModel, part of the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern, exposes the application's capabilities to the assistant by supplying both tools applicable to a currently visible view and application-global tools extracted from the GUI tree router. This architecture facilitates full voice accessibility while ensuring reliable alignment between spoken input and the visual interface, accompanied by consistent feedback across modalities. It future-proofs apps for upcoming OS super assistants that employ computer use agents (CUAs) and natively consume MCP if an application provides it.
  To address concerns about privacy and data security, the practical effectiveness of locally deployable, open-weight LLMs for speech-enabled multimodal UIs is evaluated. Findings suggest that recent smaller open-weight models approach the performance of leading proprietary models in overall accuracy and require enterprise-grade hardware for fast responsiveness.
  A demo implementation of the proposed architecture can be found at https://github.com/hansvdam/langbar</description>

      <title>Emotionally Vulnerable Subtype of Internet Gaming Disorder: Measuring and Exploring the Pathology of Problematic Generative AI Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Concerns over the potential over-pathologization of generative AI (GenAI) use and the lack of conceptual clarity surrounding GenAI addiction call for empirical tools and theoretical refinement. This study developed and validated the PUGenAIS-9 (Problematic Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence Scale-9 items) and examined whether PUGenAIS reflects addiction-like patterns under the Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) framework. Using samples from China and the United States (N = 1,508), we conducted confirmatory factor analysis and identified a robust 31-item structure across nine IGD-based dimensions. We then derived the PUGenAIS-9 by selecting the highest-loading items from each dimension and validated its structure in an independent sample (N = 1,426). Measurement invariance tests confirmed its stability across nationality and gender. Person-centered (latent profile analysis) and variable-centered (network analysis) approaches revealed a 5-10% prevalence rate, a symptom network structure similar to IGD, and predictive factors related to psychological distress and functional impairment. These findings indicate that PUGenAI shares features of the emotionally vulnerable subtype of IGD rather than the competence-based type. These results support using PUGenAIS-9 to identify problematic GenAI use and show the need to rethink digital addiction with an ICD (infrastructures, content, and device) model. This keeps addiction research responsive to new media while avoiding over-pathologizing.</description>

      <title>Multi-Turn Human-LLM Interaction Through the Lens of a Two-Way Intelligibility Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20600v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our interest is in the design of software systems involving a human-expert interacting -- using natural language -- with a large language model (LLM) on data analysis tasks. For complex problems, it is possible that LLMs can harness human expertise and creativity to find solutions that were otherwise elusive. On one level, this interaction takes place through multiple turns of prompts from the human and responses from the LLM. Here we investigate a more structured approach based on an abstract protocol described in [3] for interaction between agents. The protocol is motivated by a notion of "two-way intelligibility" and is modelled by a pair of communicating finite-state machines. We provide an implementation of the protocol, and provide empirical evidence of using the implementation to mediate interactions between an LLM and a human-agent in two areas of scientific interest (radiology and drug design). We conduct controlled experiments with a human proxy (a database), and uncontrolled experiments with human subjects. The results provide evidence in support of the protocol's capability of capturing one- and two-way intelligibility in human-LLM interaction; and for the utility of two-way intelligibility in the design of human-machine systems. Our code is available at https://github.com/karannb/interact.</description>

      <title>DiMA: An LLM-Powered Ride-Hailing Assistant at DiDi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04768v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On-demand ride-hailing services like DiDi, Uber, and Lyft have transformed urban transportation, offering unmatched convenience and flexibility. In this paper, we introduce DiMA, an LLM-powered ride-hailing assistant deployed in DiDi Chuxing. Its goal is to provide seamless ride-hailing services and beyond through a natural and efficient conversational interface under dynamic and complex spatiotemporal urban contexts. To achieve this, we propose a spatiotemporal-aware order planning module that leverages external tools for precise spatiotemporal reasoning and progressive order planning. Additionally, we develop a cost-effective dialogue system that integrates multi-type dialog repliers with cost-aware LLM configurations to handle diverse conversation goals and trade-off response quality and latency. Furthermore, we introduce a continual fine-tuning scheme that utilizes real-world interactions and simulated dialogues to align the assistant's behavior with human preferred decision-making processes. Since its deployment in the DiDi application, DiMA has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving 93% accuracy in order planning and 92% in response generation during real-world interactions. Offline experiments further validate DiMA capabilities, showing improvements of up to 70.23% in order planning and 321.27% in response generation compared to three state-of-the-art agent frameworks, while reducing latency by $0.72\times$ to $5.47\times$. These results establish DiMA as an effective, efficient, and intelligent mobile assistant for ride-hailing services. Our project is released at https://github.com/usail-hkust/DiMA and we also release the MCP service (https://mcp.didichuxing.com/api) to foster the ride-hailing research community.</description>

      <title>Position Paper: Towards Open Complex Human-AI Agents Collaboration Systems for Problem Solving and Knowledge Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a technology-agnostic, collaboration-ready stance for Human-AI Agents Collaboration Systems (HAACS) that closes long-standing gaps in prior stages (automation; flexible autonomy; agentic multi-agent collectives). Reading empirical patterns through a seven-dimension collaboration spine and human-agent contrasts, we identify missing pieces: principled budgeting of initiative, instantaneous and auditable reconfiguration, a system-wide knowledge backbone with an epistemic promotion gate, capacity-aware human interfaces; and, as a prerequisite to all of the above, unified definitions of agent and formal collaborative dynamics. We respond with (i) a boundary-centric ontology of agenthood synthesized with cybernetics; (ii) a Petri net family (colored and interpreted) that models ownership, cross-boundary interaction, concurrency, guards, and rates with collaboration transitions; and (iii) a three-level orchestration (meta, agent, execution) that governs behavior families via guard flips. On the knowledge side, we ground collaborative learning in Conversation Theory and SECI with teach-back gates and an evolving backbone; on the problem-solving side, we coordinate routine MEA-style control with practice-guided open-ended discovery. The result is the Hierarchical Exploration-Exploitation Net (HE2-Net): a policy-controlled stance that splits provisional from validated assets, promotes only after tests and peer checks, and budgets concurrent probing while keeping reuse fast and safe. We show interoperability with emerging agent protocols without ad hoc glue and sketch bio-cybernetic extensions (autopoiesis, autogenesis, evolving boundaries, synergetics, etc). Altogether, the framework keeps humans central to setting aims, justifying knowledge, and steering theory-practice dynamics, while scaling agents as reliable collaborators within audited governance.</description>

      <title>ERR@HRI 2.0 Challenge: Multimodal Detection of Errors and Failures in Human-Robot Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into conversational robots has made human-robot conversations more dynamic. Yet, LLM-powered conversational robots remain prone to errors, e.g., misunderstanding user intent, prematurely interrupting users, or failing to respond altogether. Detecting and addressing these failures is critical for preventing conversational breakdowns, avoiding task disruptions, and sustaining user trust. To tackle this problem, the ERR@HRI 2.0 Challenge provides a multimodal dataset of LLM-powered conversational robot failures during human-robot conversations and encourages researchers to benchmark machine learning models designed to detect robot failures. The dataset includes 16 hours of dyadic human-robot interactions, incorporating facial, speech, and head movement features. Each interaction is annotated with the presence or absence of robot errors from the system perspective, and perceived user intention to correct for a mismatch between robot behavior and user expectation. Participants are invited to form teams and develop machine learning models that detect these failures using multimodal data. Submissions will be evaluated using various performance metrics, including detection accuracy and false positive rate. This challenge represents another key step toward improving failure detection in human-robot interaction through social signal analysis.</description>
