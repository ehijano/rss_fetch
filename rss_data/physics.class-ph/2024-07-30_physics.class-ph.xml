      <title>Phase transitions in rolling of irregular cylinders and spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When placed on an inclined plane, a perfect 2D disk or 3D sphere simply rolls down in a straight line under gravity. But how is the rolling affected if these shapes are irregular or random? Treating the terminal rolling speed as an order parameter, we show that phase transitions arise as a function of the dimension of the state space and inertia. We calculate the scaling exponents and the macroscopic lag time associated with the presence of first and second order transitions, and describe the regimes of co-existence of stable states and the accompanying hysteresis. Experiments with rolling cylinders corroborate our theoretical results on the scaling of the lag time. Experiments with spheres reveal closed orbits and their period-doubling in the overdamped and inertial limits respectively, providing visible manifestations of the hairy ball theorem and the doubly-connected nature of SO(3), the space of 3-dimensional rotations. Going beyond simple curiosity, our study might be relevant in a number of natural and artificial systems that involve the rolling of irregular objects, in systems ranging from nanoscale cellular transport to robotics.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Thermodynamics of a Linear Optical Cavity Driven On Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a complete framework of stochastic thermodynamics for a single-mode linear optical cavity driven on resonance. We first show that the steady-state intra-cavity field follows the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution. The effective temperature is given by the noise variance, and the equilibration rate is the dissipation rate. Next we derive expressions for internal energy, work, heat, and free energy of light in a cavity, and formulate the first and second laws of thermodynamics for this system. We then analyze fluctuations in work and heat, and show that they obey universal statistical relations known as fluctuation theorems. Finite time corrections to the fluctuation theorems are also discussed. Additionally, we show that work fluctuations obey the Crook's Fluctuation theorem which is a paradigm for understanding emergent phenomena and estimating free energy differences. The significance of our results is two-fold. On one hand, our work positions optical cavities as a unique platform for fundamental studies of stochastic thermodynamics. On the other hand, our work paves the way for improving the energy efficiency and information processing capabilities of laser-driven optical resonators using a thermodynamics based prescription.</description>

      <title>Geometric phase evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometric phase has historically been defined using closed cycles of polarization states, often derived using differential geometry on the Poincare sphere. Using the recently-developed wave model of geometric phase, we show that it is better to define geometric phase more generally, allowing every polarized wave to have a well-defined value at any point in its path. Using several example systems, we show how this approach provides more insight into the wave's behavior. Moreover, by tracking the continuous evolution of geometric phase as a wave propagates through an optical system, we encounter a natural explanation of why the conventional Poincare sphere solid angle method uses geodesic paths rather than physical paths of the polarization state.</description>

      <title>Pure moving optical media consisting of magnetochiral metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report numerical studies of microwave bianisotropies by magnetochiral (MCh) metasurfaces consisting of double Z-type gammadions with perpendicularly magnetized substrates. The metasurfaces' effective polarizability tensor, extracted from calculated reflection and transmission coefficients, has components of the non-reciprocal moving-type bianisotropy as well as the reciprocal chiral-type bianisotropy and non-reciprocal magneto-optical (MO) effect. Combination of the metasurfaces with contraposition MCh metasurfaces cancels both the chiral-type bianisotropy and MO effect, resulting in pure moving optical media. Achieved perfect transmission with phase difference of $\pi$ realizes an ideal gyrator for arbitrary spatial and polarization modes.</description>

      <title>Representation of continuum equations in physical components for arbitrary curved surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuum equations are ubiquitous in physical modelling of elastic, viscous, and viscoelastic systems. The equations of continuum mechanics take nontrivial forms on curved surfaces. Although the curved surface formulation of the continuum equations are derived in many excellent references available in the literature, they are not readily usable for solving physical problems due to the covariant, contravariant or mixed nature of the stress and strain tensors in the equations. We present the continuum equations in terms of physical components in a general differentiable manifold. This general formulation of the continuum equations can be used readily for modelling physical problems on arbitrary curved surfaces. We demonstrate this with the help of some examples.</description>

      <title>Study of Topological Phenomena Through Berry Phase in Classical Nonlinear Elastic Granules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geometric of Berry phase concept, traditionally rooted in quantum mechanics, has been found to be increasingly significant in classical mechanics, particularly for understanding the dynamics of linear and nonlinear systems. In this study, we demonstrate the controlled accumulation of the Berry phase in a classical system using a two-level time-dependent elastic bit, analogous to a quantum bit, within a nonlinear environment generated by a two-granular network. The nonlinearity of the granular beads is modulated through the frequency and amplitude of external harmonic excitation, along with static preloading. By employing the orthonormal basis of the nonlinear responses and mapping the displacement coefficients in Bloch states, we reveal how time influences the manipulation of the elastic bit and its states. Our analytical and experimental investigations uncover the Berry phase's role in exposing the various topological characteristics of the classical granular network. This research establishes a crucial link between classical and quantum realms via the Berry phase of an elastic bit, with significant implications for decoherence-free and robust data transfer and information processing.</description>

      <title>The geometry of induced currents in two dimensional media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework that allows us to clearly identify the geometric features underlying the phenomenon of superconductivity in two dimensional materials. In particular, we show that any such medium whose response to an externally applied electromagnetic field is a geodesically flowing induced current, must be a superconductor. In this manner, we conclude that the underlying geometry of this type of media is that of a Lorentzian contact manifold. Moreover, we show that the macroscopic hallmark of their superconducting state is a purely topological condition equivalent to the geodesic nature of the induced current: the non-vanishing of its helicity.</description>
