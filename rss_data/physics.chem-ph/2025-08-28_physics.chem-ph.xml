      <title>Two-dimensional electronic spectra from trajectory-based dynamics: pure-state Ehrenfest and spin-mapping approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) provides a detailed picture of electronically nonadiabatic dynamics that can be interpreted with the aid of simulations. Here, we develop and contrast trajectory-based nonadiabatic dynamics approaches for simulating 2DES spectra. First, we argue that an improved pure-state Ehrenfest approach can be constructed by decomposing the initial coherence into a sum of equatorial pure states that contain equal contributions from the states in the coherence. We then use this framework to show how one can obtain a more accurate, but computationally more expensive, approximation to the third-order 2DES response function by replacing Ehrenfest dynamics with spin mapping during the pump-probe delay time. We end by comparing and contrasting the accuracy of these methods in reproducing the exact linear, pump-probe, and 2DES spectra of two Frenkel exciton models: a coupled dimer system and the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Solvent Dynamics Drives the Formation of the Hydrated Electron in Photoexcited Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photophysics and photochemistry associated with irradiating UV light in liquid water is central to numerous physical, chemical and biological processes. One of the key events involved in this process is the generation of the hydrated electron. Despite long study from both experimental and theoretical fronts, a unified understanding of the underlying mechanisms associated with the generation of the solvated electron have remained elusive. Here, using excited-state molecular dynamics simulations of condensed phase photoexcited liquid water, we unravel the key sequence of chemical events leading to the creation of the hydrated electron on the excited state. The process begins through the excitation of electrons localized mostly on specific topological defects in water's hydrogen network which is subsequently followed by two main reaction pathways. The first, leads to the creation of a hydrogen atom culminating in non-radiative decay back to the ground-state within 100 femtoseconds. The second involves a proton coupled electron transfer, giving rise to the formation of the hydronium ion, hydroxyl radical and the hydrated excess electron on the excited-state. This process is facilitated by ultrafast coupled rotational and translational motions of water molecules leading to the formation of water mediated ion-radical pairs in the network. These species can survive on the picosecond timescale and ultimately modulate the emission of visible photons. All in all, our findings provide fresh perspectives into the interpretation of several independent time-dependent spectroscopies measured over the last decades, paving the way for new directions on both theoretical and experimental fronts.</description>

      <title>Rank-reduced equation-of-motion coupled cluster formalism with full inclusion of triple excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we describe the rank-reduced variant of the equation-of-motion coupled cluster theory with complete inclusion of single, double, and triple excitations. The advantage of the proposed formalism in comparison with the canonical theory stems from the application of Tucker decomposition format to the ground- and excited-states triply-excited amplitudes tensors. By exploiting the linear scaling of the dimension of the decomposed amplitudes with respect to the system size $N$, one can reduce the computational cost of the method to the level of $N^6$ and storage requirements to $N^4$. While in practice the proposed rank-reduced formalism introduces an error, we show that it is several times smaller than the inherent error of the parent theory with the proposed default settings for a wide range of problems. Higher level of accuracy can be achieved by increasing the value of a single parameter present in this formulation, recovering the canonical method in an appropriate limit. We illustrate the accuracy and performance of the proposed method by calculations for a group of molecules with excited states of different character -- from dominated by single excitations with respect to the reference determinant to states with moderate and large contribution of double and higher excitations. We report calculations of potential energy curves and related spectroscopic parameters for the first four singlet excited states of magnesium dimer, as well as the potential energy curve for the excited state of charge-transfer character in the NH$_3$-F$_2$ complex as a function of intermolecular separation.</description>

      <title>A Field-Theoretical Paradigm via Hierarchical Coarse-Graining: I. Generalized Mode Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20025v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiscale computer simulations facilitate the efficient exploration of large spatiotemporal scales in chemical and physical systems. However, molecular simulations predominantly rely on particle-based representations, which become computationally prohibitive when applied beyond the molecular scale. Field-theoretical simulations have emerged as an alternative to overcome these limitations. Despite their applicability in mesoscopic simulations, these approaches are typically derived from top-down principles, leaving a gap in the bottom-up derivation of field-theoretical models for targeted molecular systems. This work presents a systematic strategy for constructing statistical field models for molecular liquids from the atomistic level, marking a critical step toward bridging particle-based and field-theoretical modeling techniques. By introducing molecular coarse-grained models as an intermediate step, this hierarchical approach reduces the complexity of the atomistic-to-field-theoretical transformation while preserving important microscopic structural correlations. We systematically derive field-theoretical models in reciprocal space for both canonical and grand canonical ensembles using the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. By incorporating additional fields for both positive and negative Fourier modes, our generalized mode theory extends the applicability of bottom-up field-theoretical models beyond the conventional Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, which can be limited to positive Fourier modes. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient perturbative approach for approximating Fourier modes of molecular interactions, reducing computational cost and allowing for integrating complex molecular interactions into the field-theoretic description.</description>

      <title>Study of low-energy electron-induced dissociation of 1-Propanol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fragmentation of 1-propanol resulting from dissociative electron attachment has been explored across an energy range of 3.5 to 16 eV. Four distinct ion species are identified: $\text{H}^{-}$, $\text{O}^{-}$, $\text{OH}^{-}$, and $\text{C}_{3}\text{H}_{7}\text{O}^{-}$. The $\text{OH}^{-}$ ion exhibited a prominent peak near 8.7 eV, along with a small hump near 5.6 eV. Complementary channels led to the formation of the $\text{H}^{-}$ and $\text{C}_{3}\text{H}_{7}\text{O}^{-}$ ions. Both these two ions exhibit a sharp peak near 6 eV and broad overlapping resonances between 7 to 12 eV. The observed ion yields of distinct dissociation fragments in this study, when compared with those from previously studied alcohols, suggest site-specific fragmentation of alcohols during dissociative electron attachment. To gain a deeper understanding of the dissociation pathways, Density Functional Theory~(DFT) calculations were conducted, revealing the threshold energies for each channel. These threshold energies aligned well with the experimental uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Optimal control on open quantum systems and application to non-Condon photo-induced electron transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop an optimal control theory on open quantum system and its environment, and exemplify the method with the application to the non-Condon photo-induced electron transfer (PET) in condensed phase. This method utilizes the dissipaton theory, proposed by Yan in 2014 for open quantum systems, which provides an exact description of the dissipative system while also enables rigorous characterization and control of environmental hybridization modes, fully taking into account the non-perturbative and non-Markovian effects. Leveraging the advantage of the dissipaton phase-space algebra, we present in this communication the theoretical strategy for optimal control on both system and environment simultaneously. The control protocol is successfully demonstrated on PET for the environment-targeted-control facilitated transfer. This work sheds the light on manipulating open systems dynamics via polarized environment.</description>

      <title>Tunable quantum anomalous Hall effect in fullerene monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nearly four decades after its theoretical prediction, the search for material realizations of quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) remains a highly active field of research. Many materials have been predicted to exhibit quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) physics under feasible conditions but the experimental verification remains widely elusive. In this work, we propose an alternative approach towards QAH materials design by engineering customized molecular building blocks. We demonstrate this ansatz for a two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb lattice of C26 fullerenes, which exhibits a ferromagnetic ground state and thus breaks time-reversal symmetry. The molecular system is found to be highly tunable with respect to its magnetic degrees of freedom and applied strain, giving rise to a rich phase diagram with Chern numbers C= +/-2, +/-1, 0. Our proposal offers a versatile platform to realize tunable QAH physics under accessible conditions and provides an experimentally feasible approach for chemical synthesis of molecular networks with QAHE.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy in the condensed phase using equivariant transformer accelerated molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) provides rich information about how the electronic states of molecules, proteins, and solid-state materials interact with each other and their surrounding environment. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations offer an appealing route to uncover how nuclear motions mediate electronic energy relaxation and their manifestation in electronic spectroscopies, but are computationally expensive. Here we show that, by using an equivariant transformer-based machine learning architecture trained with only ~2500 ground state and ~100 excited state electronic structure calculations, one can construct accurate machine-learned potential energy surfaces for both the ground-state electronic surface and excited-state energy gap. We demonstrate the utility of this approach for simulating the dynamics of Nile blue in ethanol, where we experimentally validate and decompose the simulated 2DES to establish the nuclear motions of the chromophore and the solvent that couple to the excited state, connecting the spectroscopic signals to their molecular origin.</description>

      <title>Extension of the CC($P$;$Q$) Formalism to the Electron Attachment and Ionization Potential Equation-of-Motion Coupled-Cluster Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We combine the electron attachment (EA) and ionization potential (IP) equation-of-motion (EOM) coupled-cluster (CC) approaches with the CC($P$;$Q$) formalism. The resulting methodologies are used to describe the electronic states of several open-shell molecules, with the goal of approximating high-level EA/IP-EOMCC energetics corresponding to a full treatment of 3-particle-2-hole (3$p$-2$h$) and 3-hole-2-particle (3$h$-2$p$) excitations on top of CC with singles and doubles (CCSD). We show that the active-orbital-based EA/IP-EOMCC CC($P$;$Q$) approaches, abbreviated as EA/IP-CC(t;3), achieve sub-millihartree accuracies relative to the parent EA-EOMCCSD(3$p$-2$h$)/IP-EOMCCSD(3$h$-2$p$) data using reduced computational effort, while improving upon their completely renormalized EA/IP-CR-EOMCC(2,3) counterparts.</description>

      <title>Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Enhanced by Synergetic Interactions among Photon Phonon and Molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photocatalytic CO2 reduction is limited by inefficient CO2 activation and poor solar spectrum utilization. Here, we discovered and revealed the vibration coupling mechanism among photons, phonons, and molecules, which remarkably enhances photocatalytic catalysis of CO2 into fuels. We designed the nitrogen-doped Cu2O-based catalyst loaded onto the quartz optical substrate. The N-doping Cu2O converts linearly geometry of adsorbed CO2 molecules, which efficiently lowers the activation barrier and facilitates CO2 dissociation. Once the Cu-based catalyst is combined with a micro-pillar quartz film, the system induces vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between the asymmetric CO2 stretching mode and surface phonon polariton resonances. These resonances arise from the photothermal conversion of incident solar photons on the micro-pillars. The resonant coupling phenomena were further verified by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy using Synchrotron Radiation Source (SRS), which directly confirmed the interactions between molecular vibrations and photonic-phononic modes. The synergetic functions originated from this hybrid architecture achieve a CO yield of 167.7 umol h-1 g-1 under pure water conditions, which is the highest reported yield for Cu2O-based photocatalysts with 46% enhancement over non-VSC systems. This work uncovers a novel photo-thermal mechanism. It further provides a new strategy to control bond activation in photocatalytic CO2 conversion through light-vibration-matter coupling.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-induced magnetism in fullerene monolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using molecular orbital theory, we introduce magnetism in pure-carbon, charge-neutral fullerene monolayers which are otherwise non-magnetic. By controlling either molecular or lattice symmetry, we can realise highly-tuneable magnetic fullerene monolayers. We demonstrate a general design principle based on group theory analysis and explain the origin of magnetism using two representative systems with $S_4$ and $C_3$ molecular symmetries. Moreover, for building blocks that lack appropriate molecular symmetry, we can enforce crystalline symmetry to induce magnetism as well. Finally, we discuss the experimental feasibility of realising our proposed magnetic fullerene monolayers by examining a previously synthesised C$_{60}$ system. Our work opens a new direction in introducing magnetism in non-magnetic building blocks by enforcing either molecular or lattice symmetry.</description>
