      <title>Geometry of non-Gaussianity in transient non-attractor inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inflationary models predicting abundant primordial black holes (PBHs) and large amplitude of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) often rely on amplified fluctuations over limited scales, typically driven by phase transitions, particle production, or departures from slow-roll evolution. While the power spectrum of these models has been extensively studied, higher-order correlations are much less understood. Motivated by the complex physics involved and the fact that PBH and SIGW formation are both sensitive to non-linearities, we present a detailed study of the bispectrum as the leading non-linear effect in these scenarios. We refer to the scale- and shape-dependence of the bispectrum collectively as its geometry; and define a scale-dependent shape correlator to disentangle the two dependencies. Generally, we find that for the scales most affected by phase transitions and particle production (including the power spectrum peak), the bispectrum is strongest near the equilateral configuration, while non-attractor phases tend to produce correlations near the squeezed configuration. We further propose a simplified bispectrum estimator, resembling local-type non-Gaussianity but with scale-dependent amplitude, that captures the main features of the full bispectrum. As an implication of our results, we show that incorporating the bispectrum significantly broadens the range of scales with a substantial probability of large smoothed density contrasts compared to linear analysis. This suggests that non-linearities can alter not only PBH abundance and SIGW amplitude but also their mass and frequency spectra. In particular, and in contrast with the usual assumption, our results hint that the second-highest peak of the power spectrum may produce more PBHs than the highest peak.</description>

      <title>KiDS-Legacy: Constraints on Horndeski gravity from weak lensing combined with galaxy clustering and cosmic microwave background anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present constraints on modified gravity from a cosmic shear analysis of the final data release of the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-Legacy) in combination with DESI measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations, eBOSS observations of redshift space distortions, and cosmic microwave background anisotropies from Planck. We study the Horndeski class of modified gravity models in an effective field theory framework employing a parameterisation that satisfies stability conditions by construction and, for the first time, present a cosmological analysis in this inherently stable parameter basis. Cosmic shear constrains the Horndeski parameter space significantly, matching or surpassing the CMB contribution. Adopting the de-mixed kinetic term of the scalar field perturbation, $D_{\rm kin}$, and the deviation of the Planck mass from its fiducial value, $\Delta M_*^2\equiv M_*^2-1$, as model parameters, we constrain their present values to be $\Delta \hat{M}_*^2=0.32^{+0.07}_{-0.21}$ and $\hat{D}_{\rm kin} = 3.74^{+0.69}_{-1.92}$, which deviate from general relativity at $1.5\sigma$ and $1.9\sigma$, respectively. We derive constraints on the structure growth parameter $S_8=0.813^{+0.008}_{-0.011}$, which is compatible with the $\Lambda$CDM constraint at $0.54\sigma$. We obtain the deviation of the effective Newtonian coupling from the GR value as $\Delta \mu_{\infty,{\rm eff}}=0.066\pm0.023$, corresponding to a $2.9\sigma$ significance. Although modified gravity provides a slightly better fit to the data, a model comparison shows only a weak preference for modified gravity at the $1.4\sigma$ level. When adopting a dynamical dark energy model of the background cosmology, the inferred modified gravity parameter constraints are stable with respect to a $\Lambda$CDM background, while a mild preference at $1.57\sigma$ for dynamical dark energy remains.</description>

      <title>KiDS-Legacy: Constraining dark energy, neutrino mass, and curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We constrain minimally extended cosmological models with the cosmic shear analysis of the final data release from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-Legacy) in combination with external probes. Due to the consistency of the KiDS-Legacy analysis with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), we can combine these data sets reliably for the first time. Additionally, we use CMB lensing, galaxy redshift-space distortions, and baryon acoustic oscillations. We assess, in turn, the effects of spatial curvature, varying neutrino masses, and an evolving dark energy component on cosmological constraints from KiDS-Legacy alone and in combination with external probes. We find KiDS-Legacy to be consistent with the fiducial flat $\Lambda$CDM analysis with $c^2 \sum m_\nu\leq 1.5\,$eV, $w_0 = -1.0\pm 0.7$ and $w_a = -1.3^{+1.9}_{-2.0}$ while $\Omega_K = 0.08^{+0.16}_{-0.17}$ (1$\sigma$ bounds) with almost equal goodness-of-fit. $w_0w_a$CDM is not a significant improvement over $\Lambda$CDM when cosmic shear and CMB lensing are combined, yielding a Bayes factor $B = 0.07$. If all probes are combined, however, $B$ increases to 2.73, corresponding to a $2.6\sigma$ suspicousness tension. The constraint on $S_8 = \sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_\mathrm{m}/0.3}$ is robust to opening up the parameter space for cosmic shear. Adding all external datasets to KiDS-Legacy, we find with $S_8 = 0.816 \pm 0.006$ in $\Lambda$CDM and $S_8 = 0.837 \pm 0.008$ in $w_0 w_a$CDM for all probes combined.</description>

      <title>Insights for Early Dark Energy with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), as one of the earliest processes in the universe accessible to direct observation, offers a powerful and independent probe of the cosmic expansion history. With recent advances in both theory and observation, including efficient and flexible BBN codes, percent-level measurements of primordial deuterium and helium-4 abundances, refined measurements of nuclear reaction rates, and precise determinations of the baryon density from the cosmic microwave background, particularly keen insights can be gained from BBN. In this work, we leverage these developments to place model-independent constraints on deviations from the Standard Model expansion history during BBN. Using the latest abundance data, we apply principal component analysis to identify the most constrained and physically meaningful modes of expansion history variation. This approach allows us to impose the most general constraints on early dark energy during the epoch of BBN. We further examine whether general modifications to the expansion rate could alleviate the long-standing lithium problem. Our results demonstrate that BBN, sharpened by modern data and statistical techniques, remains an indispensable probe of dark energy and new physics in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Implication of Cross-correlation between Galaxy Clustering and 21-cm Line Intensity Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The apparent anisotropies of galaxy clustering and 21-cm mapping in redshift space offer a unique opportunity to simultaneously probe cosmic expansion and gravity on cosmological scales through the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect and redshift-space distortions (RSD). Although improved theoretical models exist for anisotropic clustering, their applicability is limited by the non-perturbative smearing effect caused by the randomness of relative velocities. Here, we consider an alternative approach using the statistical power of cross-correlation between galaxy clustering and 21-cm line intensity mapping. Based on Fisher matrix analysis, fully incorporating nonlinear RSD, we estimate the benefit of combining both observables. We find that, for spectroscopy surveys like DESI combined with 21-cm line-intensity mapping surveys, the constraint on the growth of structure is improved by a factor of two relative to the galaxy auto-correlation, while the constraint on the cosmic expansion is only slightly improved. Crucially, such an observation can strongly constrain the neutral hydrogen (HI) content Omega_HI to a sub-percent level. This level of precision unlocks the potential of this method to probe post-reionization astrophysics with enhanced precision. It would far surpass existing constraints from stacked 21-cm emission (resulting in ~ 50%-100% uncertainties) and break the degeneracy between Omega_HI and the HI bias b_HI inherent in linear-regime power spectrum analysis. This cross-correlation approach effectively compensates for the loss of constraining power when using galaxy clustering alone.</description>

      <title>Observational evidence of tidal torque in the primordial Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal torque theory (TTT) predicts that galaxy angular momenta are imprinted by the early tidal field acting on their proto-structures, which are preserved through cosmic evolution and provide the potentially most precise measurement of the early universe. We test this prediction using the gas component of central massive elliptical galaxies, whose angular momenta respond sensitively to external torques. By comparing the observed gas angular momentum vectors with those predicted from the primordial density field reconstructed by ELUCID for the nearby universe, we conclusively detect a strong direction correlation with a significance of about $7\sigma$. These results provide the first robust observational confirmation of TTT and open a new window for cosmological measurements of neutrino mass and other cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>The magnitude of the dark ages 21-cm signal in the context of existing early and late time constraints on $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dark ages 21-cm signal is a promising probe of the currently unobserved infant universe between the formation of the Cosmic Microwave Background around $z \approx 1100$ and the first galaxies around $z\approx 30$. A detection of the signal will help researchers understanding the nature of dark matter and dark energy, the expansion of the universe and any extensions to the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model that could explain the reported Cosmic Dawn 21-cm signal from EDGES and the Hubble tension. In this letter we take existing constraints on the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model from two early time probes, Planck and WMAP, and two late time probes, DES galaxy lensing and clustering and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and propagate these through to constraints on the magnitude of the dark ages 21-cm signal. We constrain the magnitude and central frequency of the signal while methodically accounting for uncertainties in the cosmological parameters. We find that within the context of our modelling assumptions and the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, the depth of the dark ages 21-cm signal is known to better than 1 mK and the central frequency to within 0.05 MHz.</description>

      <title>Dark sector interactions in the $w \rightarrow -1$ limit: velocity locking in pure momentum exchange models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of interacting dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) involving pure momentum exchange are a promising avenue for resolving cosmological tensions. However, the behaviour of these interactions in the theoretically challenging limit where the DE equation of state, $w$, approaches $-1$ is not fully understood. We demonstrate that a generic feature of these models is a $w$-dependent velocity-locking mechanism, which systematically shifts the onset of matter power spectrum suppression to smaller scales as $w \rightarrow -1$. The suppression magnitude depends on the difference in fluid velocities. In this limit, however, the interaction's drag dominates over the DE pressure support and causes the DE velocity to track that of the DM fluid at larger scales. This mechanism provides a physical explanation for the weaker constraints found in the literature when $w\approx-1$ in models where the interaction strength does not explicitly depend on $w$. We also demonstrate that the common approximation of neglecting DE perturbations ($\delta_{\mathrm{DE}}=\theta_{\mathrm{DE}}=0$) fails in this limit. By artificially increasing the velocity difference between the fluids, this simplification incorrectly removes the $w$-dependent velocity-locking mechanism and erases the shift in power spectrum suppression to smaller scales. This leads to an overestimation of the constraining power of cosmological data on the interaction strength.</description>

      <title>One-loop power spectrum corrections in interacting dark energy cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interacting Dark Energy (IDE) models offer a promising avenue to explore possible exchanges of energy and momentum between dark matter and dark energy, providing a dynamical extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Such interactions modify the growth of cosmic structures, imprinting distinctive signatures on the matter power spectrum that can be tested through large-scale structure (LSS) observations. In this work, we compute the one-loop corrections to the matter power spectrum in IDE models. We then reinterpret these results within the standard framework of the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS), which provides a consistent description of mildly non-linear scales and allows for reliable comparisons with observational data. We investigate two commonly studied forms of the coupling function, $Q$, namely $Q = \xi \mathcal{H} \rho_{\rm m}$ and $Q = \xi \mathcal{H} \rho_{\rm DE}$, and introduce a novel interaction term, $Q = \Gamma \, \rho_{\rm m} \, \rho_{\rm DE} \, \theta_{\rm m}$, characterized by the non-linear coupling constant $\Gamma$, which links the interaction strength to the velocity divergence of dark matter. This coupling function is proposed to isolate the effects solely of the IDE model on mildly non-linear scales. Using Full-Shape (FS) measurements of the galaxy power spectrum from BOSS DR12, we constrain the interaction rate $\Gamma$, the cosmological parameters, and the bias parameters. We find $\Gamma = 0.0039 \pm 0.0082$, which is highly consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model. This work opens the possibility of testing IDE models at mildly non-linear scales, potentially providing new insights for this class of models beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework.</description>

      <title>The Domain Adaptation problem in photometric redshift estimation: a solution applied to the HSC Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-band HSC-CLAUDS survey comprises several sky regions with varying observing conditions, only one of which, the COSMOS Ultra Deep Field (UDF), offers extensive redshift coverage. We aim to exploit a complete sample of labeled galaxies from the COSMOS UDF at i&lt;25 (z&lt;~5) to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) and infer more accurate photometric redshifts in the other regions than those currently available from SED-fitting methods. To address the severe domain mismatch problem we observed when applying the trained CNN to regions other than the COSMOS UDF, we developed an unsupervised adversarial domain adaptation network that we grafted onto the CNN. The method is validated by three tests: the predicted redshifts are compared to the spectroscopic redshifts that are available for limited samples of mostly bright galaxies; the predicted redshift distributions of the entire galaxy population of a given field in several intervals of magnitude are compared to those of the COSMOS UDF, assumed to be representative; the redshifts predicted for a sample of galaxies selected by narrow-band filter observations sensitive to [OII] emitters at z~1.47 are compared to those of confirmed [OII] emission line galaxies. The results show successful domain adaptation: the network is able to transfer its redshift classification capability learnt from the COSMOS UDF to other regions of HSC-CLAUDS. Accuracy varies depending on magnitude and redshift, following that of the labels we used, but far exceeds that of currently available photometric redshifts. The catalogs of CNN redshifts we inferred for the XMM, DEEP2 and ELAIS fields and for the remaining COSMOS region (~4 million sources in total at i&lt;25) are made public.</description>

      <title>Solving the Cosmological Vlasov-Poisson Equations with Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold dark matter (CDM) evolves as a collisionless fluid under the Vlasov-Poisson equations, but N-body simulations approximate this evolution by discretising the distribution function into particles, introducing discreteness effects at small scales. We present a physics-informed neural network approach that evolves CDM fields without any use of N-body data or methods, using a Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) to model the continuous displacement field for one-dimensional halo collapse. Physical constraints derived from the Vlasov-Poisson equations are embedded directly into the loss function, enabling accurate evolution beyond the first shell crossing. The trained model achieves sub-percent errors on the residuals even after seven shell crossings and matches N-body results while providing a resolution-free representation of the displacement field. In addition, displacement errors do not grow over time, a very interesting feature with respect to N-body methods. It can also reconstruct initial conditions through backward evolution when sufficient final-state information is available. Although current runtimes exceed those of N-body methods, this framework offers a new route to high-fidelity CDM evolution without particle discretisation, with prospects for extension to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>An Active Galaxy Cluster Merger at Cosmic Noon Revealed by JWST Weak Lensing and Multiwavelength Probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The galaxy cluster XLSSC 122 is a rare system at $z = 1.98$, hosting surprisingly evolved member galaxies when the Universe was only one-third of its present age. Leveraging deep JWST/NIRCam imaging, we perform a weak-lensing analysis and reconstruct the cluster's mass distribution, finding a mass peak that coincides with both the X-ray peak and the position of the brightest cluster galaxy. We obtain mass and concentration estimates of $M_{200\rm c}=1.6 \pm 0.3\times 10^{14}~M_{\odot}$ and $c_{200 \rm c}=6.3 \pm 0.3$, respectively, in agreement with recent strong-lensing estimates. The high concentration in particular motivates tests against empirical and simulation-derived mass--concentration relations. Placing our weak-lensing mass map in the context of Chandra X-ray data, MeerKAT radio imaging, ALMA+ACA/ACT Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) mapping, and a new JWST intracluster light measurement, we identify consistent NE--SW elongation across datasets and a pronounced offset along the same axis between the SZ and mass/X-ray peaks, pointing to significant merger activity. XLSSC 122 thus serves as a JWST pilot study for high-$z$ lensing, demonstrating the telescope's unique ability to map cluster mass distributions at $z\sim2$ and motivating a uniform sample of analogous systems with joint lensing, X-ray, SZ, and radio data to probe cluster assembly at Cosmic Noon.</description>

      <title>Milky Way Globular Clusters: Nurseries for Dynamically-Formed Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel self-consistent theoretical framework to characterize the formation, evolution, and merger sites of dynamically-formed black hole binaries, with a focus on explaining the most massive events observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. Our approach couples the galaxy formation model GAMESH with cluster population synthesis codes to trace the cosmic evolution of globular clusters simultaneously with mergers of massive black holes. Our reference model, which includes prescriptions for both cluster formation and disruption depending on properties of specific galaxies, accurately reproduces the observed age-mass distribution of the Milky Way globular clusters. We find that approximately 30% of the globular clusters observed in our galaxy's halo may have originated from satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. We confirm that hierarchical black hole mergers provide a significant contribution to the formation of black holes in and above the pair-instability mass gap. However, quantifying their contribution is challenging, as different population synthesis codes yield divergent results in terms of black hole mass function and merger rates. Furthermore, we characterize the host galaxies where massive black holes form in terms of their dark matter, stellar mass, and metallicity. Ultimately, we demonstrate that the merger and birth rate densities of binary black holes increase with redshift till z = 5. This cosmic evolution is a crucial signature with significant implications for future detectors like the LISA, the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, which will be capable to probe the high-redshift Universe.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the intergalactic magnetic field from Fermi-LAT observations of GRB 221009A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11128v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A cosmological origin of the magnetic fields in large scale structures of the Universe would require a non-negligible magnetic field in cosmic voids, which, however, remains undetected. Gamma-ray emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offers the opportunity to indirectly probe such an intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF), as gamma rays interact with cosmic radiation fields, producing electron-positron pairs, and initiate an electromagnetic cascade. The deflection of the pairs in the IGMF results in a time-delayed signal at GeV energies. Using observations with the Fermi Large Area Telescope of the GRB 221009A, we are able to derive the most stringent constraints to date from the non-observation of the cascade and rule out magnetic fields B &lt; 2.5 x 10^{-17} G at 95% confidence level for a coherence length larger than 1 Mpc. Our results are comparable to limits obtained from blazar observations but do not suffer from assumptions on the duty cycle of the gamma-ray source or whether inverse-Compton scattering losses dominate over the development of plasma instabilities.</description>

      <title>Intergalactic magnetic field lower limits up to the redshift $z\approx3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale intergalactic magnetic fields may contain a mixture of galactic and cosmogenic contributions, that can be probed via observations of $\gamma$-ray "echo" from sources at cosmological distances. While these contributions may be disentangled based on the difference in their redshift evolution, thus far indications of non-negligible magnetic field have been found only at low redshifts. This work aims at extending the intergalactic magnetic field constraints to redshifts $z\gtrsim 1$ using 17-year long all-sky observations of high-redshift active galactic nuclei with Fermi/LAT $\gamma$-ray telescope. Combing the Fermi/LAT measurements in the 0.1 GeV - 1 TeV energy range with the Monte Carlo simulations of the $\gamma$-ray "echo", it is shown that the zero field strength hypothesis at $z = [0.5; 3]$ is disfavoured at the $\approx 9\sigma$ significance level, yielding the lower limit of $B \gtrsim 1\times10^{-18}$ cG for the magnetic field correlation length above 1 Mpc. It is further shown that the same data put a lower limit on the volume-filling fraction of this field of $f\gtrsim 90\%$ in the redshift range considered. It is also demonstrated that the derived limits are not substantially affected by either source flux variability or the assumed $\gamma$-ray emission attenuation model. Implications of these limits for intergalactic magnetic field origin are discussed.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Foundations and Exact Solutions in $n$--Dimensional Fractional Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three theoretically plausible techniques to developing a fractional scalar field cosmological model are pointed in this paper; the time-dependent kernel weighted action being then selected. Upon this choice, we proceed to establish a fractional cosmological model in $n$ dimensions considering the FLRW metric and a generalized version of the S\'{a}ez-Ballester (SB) theory. Our study focuses on the following purposes. Firstly, to investigate the fundamental gravitational structural features of the model, we analyze the dynamical behavior of the field equations, the fulfillment of the Bianchi identities, the associated conservation laws, and the application of the second Noether theorem at the background and first-order perturbation levels. Moreover, the model's distinguishing characteristics and theoretical differences from the corresponding standard scenarios are also investigated.
  Secondly, we aim to obtain exact analytical solutions and analyze the time evolution of key cosmological quantities, considering the integration constants influence, and the number of spacetime dimensions, and the fractional parameter effects. Furthermore, the model's predictions are compared with those of the corresponding standard models and observational data.
  Lastly, we propose new ideas to further generalize our model, with a focus on constructing an effective potential and investigating the conditions under which bounce solutions may emerge.</description>

      <title>The multiphase interstellar medium as a common origin for magnetic misalignment and TB parity violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an original data analysis and a physical model that provide new insights into the origin of, and relationship between, two observables of the dusty, polarized Galaxy at intermediate and high latitudes: (i) the misalignment between HI filamentary structures and magnetic fields and (ii) the positive $TB$ correlation measured in Planck data suggesting parity violation in the interstellar medium (ISM). We confirm an observational link between the two effects and find that both are predominantly produced at large angular scales ($\geq 10^\circ$, multipoles $\ell \leq 20$) with a significantly stronger signal in the northern hemisphere.
  We propose a model in which filaments and magnetic fields appear misaligned in projection because they are sourced by cold and warm gas phases distributed in different proportions in the Solar neighborhood, from the wall of the Local Bubble to larger distances. These projection effects at large angular scales can produce coherent signatures that propagate to smaller scales in power spectra without invoking local, small-scale filament misalignment. Within this frame, HI filaments remain statistically aligned with the magnetic field in 3D, although with a projected scatter of tens of degrees that requires further investigation.
  The multiphase, geometrical model presented in this work is supported by Planck polarization data at 30 GHz, where synchrotron radiation dominates, and at 217 and 353 GHz, where dust emission dominates. Our analysis also incorporates starlight polarization measurements. The model introduced here suggests a new interpretation of two unexplained observables and emphasizes the role of the large-scale magnetized ISM in shaping polarized Galactic emission, which has important implications for both Galactic astrophysics and cosmological foreground characterization.</description>

      <title>GLIMPSE-D: An Exotic Balmer-Jump Object at z=6.20? Revisiting Photometric Selection and the Cosmic Abundance of Pop III Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11790v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present deep JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectroscopy of GLIMPSE-16043, a promising $z\sim6$ Pop III candidate originally identified through NIRCam photometry as having weak [OIII]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$ emission. Our follow-up reveals clear [OIII] emission, ruling out a genuine zero-metallicity nature. However, the combination of the measured line fluxes and photometry indicates that its spectral energy distribution requires an extraordinarily strong Balmer jump ($-1.66 \pm 0.47$ mag) and H$\alpha$ equivalent width ($3750\pm1800$ \AA), features that cannot be reproduced by current stellar+nebular or pure nebular photoionization models. The only models approaching the observations to almost within $1\sigma$ involve a hot ($T_{\rm eff}\!\simeq\!10^{4.7}$ K) single blackbody embedded in a low-$T_{\rm e}$ nebular environment, suggestive of scenarios such as a tidal-disruption event or a microquasar with strong disk winds. This cautions that photometric Pop~III selections are vulnerable to contamination when the rest-frame optical continuum is undetected. Motivated by this, we refine the photometric Pop III selection criteria to exclude the locus of extreme Balmer-jump objects. The revised criteria also recover the recently reported spectroscopic candidate AMORE6, demonstrating that the updated selection preserves sensitivity to genuine Pop III-like sources while removing key contaminants. Applying the refined criteria across legacy survey fields and five newly released CANUCS lensing cluster fields, we revisit the Pop III UV luminosity function and estimate the Pop III cosmic star-formation rate density to be $\approx[10^{-6}$--$10^{-4}]$~$M_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$~cMpc$^{-3}$ at $z\simeq6$--7, falling in the range of current theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Galactic Halo Reconstruction from Rotation Curves in Self-Interacting Fuzzy Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fuzzy Dark Matter with an explicitly non-zero quartic self-interaction (gFDM) is shown to be a viable model for simultaneously fitting 17 dark-matter-dominated galaxies from the SPARC database, constraining both the boson mass, $m$, and the self-coupling constant, $g$, to values within the range $\log_{10}\left(\frac{m}{\mathrm{eV}/c^2}\right) = \log_{10}(1.98)-22^{+0.8}_{-0.6}$ and $\log_{10}\left(\frac{g}{\mathrm{Jm}^3/kg}\right) = \log_{10}(1.45)-28^{+0.4}_{-1.2}$; this is based on the combination of an appropriately constructed static super-Gaussian profile for the inner galactic core (`soliton') region, and a Navarro-Frenk-White profile for the surrounding halo region. Identification of these parameters enables the explicit {\em dynamical} reconstruction of potential host halos for such galaxies, for which we outline a procedure with a proof-of-principle demonstration for two galaxies (UGCA444, UGC07866) shown to yield viable rotation curves over a dynamical period of $O(1) \, Gyr$.</description>

      <title>Optimal intrinsic alignment estimators in the presence of redshift-space distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present estimators for quantifying intrinsic alignments in large spectroscopic surveys that efficiently capture line-of-sight (LOS) information while being relatively insensitive to redshift-space distortions (RSD). We demonstrate that changing the LOS integration range, Pimax, as a function of transverse separation outperforms the conventional choice of a single Pimax value. This is further improved by replacing the flat Pimax cut with a LOS weighting based on shape projection and RSD. Although these estimators incorporate additional LOS information, they are projected correlations that exhibit signal-to-noise ratios comparable to 3D correlation functions, such as the IA quadrupole. Using simulations from Abacus Summit, we evaluate these estimators and provide recommended Pimax values and weights for projected separations of 1 - 100 Mpc/h. These will improve measurements of intrinsic alignments in large cosmological surveys and the constraints they provide for both weak lensing and direct cosmological applications.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of the redshifted 21 cm signal from the Dark Ages to parameters of primordial magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19436v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the impact of the decaying magnetic turbulence of primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) and ambipolar diffusion on the ionisation and thermal history of the Dark Ages Universe ($30\le z\le300$), and its imprint on the spectral profile of the global signal in the redshifted 21 cm hydrogen line. The heating function caused by decaying magnetic turbulence monotonically decreases after cosmological recombination; its amplitude strongly depends on the strength of the PMFs' $B_0$ and weakly depends on the spectral index of the initial power spectrum of the PMFs' $n_{\rm B}$. The heating function caused by ambipolar diffusion, in contrast, noticeably depends on the spectral index in the range $-3\lesssim n_{\rm B}\lesssim4$ but is subdominant in the Dark Ages epoch for PMF models with $B_0\lesssim0.5$ nG. We computed the ionisation and thermal history of intergalactic gas from the cosmological recombination up to the end of the Dark Ages epoch for a range of PMF parameters, $0.05\lesssim B_0\lesssim0.5$ nG, $-2.9\lesssim n_{\rm B}\lesssim4$, and show the essentially distinguished thermal evolution from one in the Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. We also show that the profile of the redshifted 21 cm hydrogen line is very sensitive to the PMF parameters from this range and can be used for their constraints in conjunction with other observational data.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy dark matter halos with repulsive self-interactions: coherent soliton and halo vortex network with moderate self-coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00293v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the impact of moderate repulsive self-interactions on fuzzy dark matter halos generated by merging smaller Gaussian density concentrations. We study the size of the core and the granules, the spatial dependence of the field's coherence, the turbulent vortex tangle and the oscillation frequency of the central soliton, covering the range from quantum-pressure-dominated to self-interaction-dominated stabilisation of the solitonic core. For the probed self-coupling strengths $g$ and with a fixed initial configuration, mergers with increasing $g$ result in cores with increased size and a reduced central density, oscillating with decreased frequency, in accordance with expectations from the study of isolated Self-interacting Fuzzy Dark Matter (SFDM) solitons. By contrast, the characteristic granule size and typical inter-vortex distances in the surrounding halo are only mildly affected, growing much less relative to the core. The total length of the vortex network, although less robust, shows no signs of decay over our simulation timescales. The generated halos therefore develop central self-interaction-dominated cores, but with the outer halos still supported by quantum-pressure and classical kinetic energy in equipartition as in the non-interacting case. Furthermore, measures of coherence of the field clearly separate the condensed core, identified via the Penrose-Onsager (largest eigenvalue) mode of the entire classical field, from the surrounding quasi-coherent halo. Unlike the $g=0$ case, we observe a relative increase of incoherent fluctuations coexisting with the coherent mode at the centre of the halo with increasing $g$, a phenomenon also observed in laboratory condensates at non-zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Photometric redshift calibration with self-organising maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02779v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Euclid survey aims to trace the evolution of cosmic structures up to redshift $z$ $\sim$ 3 and beyond. Its success depends critically on obtaining highly accurate mean redshifts for ensembles of galaxies $n(z)$ in all tomographic bins, essential for deriving robust cosmological constraints. However, photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s) suffer from systematic biases arising from various sources of uncertainty. To address these challenges, we utilised self-organising maps (SOMs) with mock samples resembling the Euclid Wide Survey (EWS), to validate Euclid's uncertainty requirement of $|\Delta\langle z \rangle| = \langle z_{\text{est}} \rangle - \langle z \rangle \leq 0.002 (1+z)$ per tomographic bin, assuming DR3-level data. We observe that defining the redshift tomography using the mean spectroscopic redshift (spec-$z$) per SOM cell, results in none of the ten tomographic redshift bins satisfying the requirement. In contrast, the redshift tomography on the photo-$z$s of the EWS-like sample yields superior results, with eight out of ten bins [$0 &lt; z\leq 2.5$] meeting the Euclid requirement. To enhance the realism of our study, we morph our calibration sample to mimic the C3R2 survey in incremental steps. In this context, a maximum of six out of ten bins meet the requirement, strongly advocating the adoption of a redshift tomography defined by the photo-$z$s of individual galaxies rather than the commonly used mean spec-$z$ of SOM cells. To examine the impact on the expected biases for $\Omega_{\text{m}}$, $\sigma_{8}$, and $\Delta w_{0}$ measured by Euclid, we perform a Fisher forecast for cosmic shear only, based on our redshift uncertainties. Here, we find that even under an evaluation of the uncertainty where the impact of the redshift bias is substantial, most absolute biases remain below 0.1$\sigma$ in the idealised scenario and below 0.3$\sigma$ in the more realistic case.</description>

      <title>Forecasting the Constraint on the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ Modified Gravity in the CSST $3\times2$pt Photometric Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We forecast the constraint on the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ model from the photometric survey operated by the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST). The simulated $3\times2$pt data of galaxy clustering, weak lensing, and galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements within 100 deg$^{2}$ are used in the analysis. The mock observational maps are constructed from a light cone, redshift sampling and noise. The angular power spectra are measured with pseudo-$C_\ell$ estimators and compared to theory in the same basis using validated weighting functions and an analytic covariance matrix that includes Gaussian, connected non-Gaussian, and super-sample terms. We model the theoretical spectra using two methods. The first one uses MGCAMB to compute the linear modified-gravity clustering power spectra, and the second one adopts the FREmu emulator with a baseline of nonlinear $\Lambda$CDM prescription. Parameter inference is performed with Cobaya, and the cosmological and modified-gravity parameters are sampled within the emulator training domain, which is jointly fitted with the systematic parameters. We find that the predictions from the two methods are in good agreement at the overlapping large scales, and the emulator method can correctly provide additional high-$\ell$ information. The $1\sigma$ upper bounds of $\log_{10}|f_{R0}|$ are found to be $&lt;-5.42$ for cosmic shear only case and $&lt;-5.29$ for the 100 deg$^2$ CSST $3\times2$pt probe. The full CSST photometric survey with 17,500 deg$^2$ survey area is expected to further improve the constraint precision by about one order of magnitude. Our results demonstrate that the CSST $3\times2$pt survey can deliver strict tests on $f(R)$ gravity.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Cluster Detection and Dynamical Analysis in the VIPERS High-Redshift Spectroscopic Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a dynamical analysis of galaxy clusters identified in the VIPERS spectroscopic survey within the redshift range 0.5 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.2. Cluster candidates were first detected as overdense regions in redshift space through the Finger-of-God (FoG) effect, and cluster membership was assigned using the GalWeight technique within the FoG-GalWeight methodology developed by our team. For each cluster, we derived the virial radius (R200), velocity dispersion (sigma200), and virial mass (M200) using the virial mass estimator. We identified ten VIPERS clusters spanning a mass range of 0.59 x 10^14 &lt;= M200/(h^-1 Msun) &lt;= 4.32 x 10^14 and velocity dispersions of 360 &lt;= sigma200 &lt;= 900 km s^-1. We cross-matched the VIPERS clusters with published catalogs and found at least one matching system for each cluster, offering external validation for our detections. We investigated the velocity dispersion-mass relation for these systems and obtained log(sigma200) = (2.73 +/- 0.06) + (0.36 +/- 0.18) log(M200), with an intrinsic scatter of sigma_int = 0.04 +/- 0.07. The derived relation is consistent with theoretical predictions from N-body and hydrodynamical simulations, confirming the reliability of the FoG-GalWeight methodology and the robustness of the virial mass estimator. Our findings demonstrate that the velocity dispersion can serve as a reliable and direct proxy for cluster mass, even at high redshift, without requiring additional dynamical mass modeling.</description>

      <title>The Luminosity Function and Clustering of H$\alpha$ Emitting Galaxies at $z\approx4-6$ from a Complete NIRCam Grism Redshift Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the luminosity function (LF) and clustering properties of 888 H$\alpha$ emitters (HAEs) at $3.75 &lt; z &lt; 6$ in the GOODS-N field. The sample, built from JWST CONGRESS and FRESCO NIRCam grism surveys using a novel redshift assignment algorithm, spans $\sim$62 arcmin$^2$ and reaches $L_{\rm H\alpha} \sim 10^{41.2} {\rm erg s^{-1}}$. We identify two prominent filamentary protoclusters at $z \approx 4.41$ and $z \approx 5.19$, hosting 98 and 144 HAEs, respectively. The observed H$\alpha$ LFs show similar shallow faint-end slopes for both protocluster and field galaxies at $z=3.75-5$, and for the protocluster at $z=5-6$ ($\alpha\approx 1.2$ to $-1.3$). In contrast, the field LF at $z=5-6$ is much steeper ($\alpha=-1.87_{-0.23}^{+0.30}$), suggesting that protocluster galaxies at $z &gt; 5$ are more evolved, resembling those at $z=3.75-5$. The observed star formation rate density from H$\alpha$, integrated down to 0.45 ${\rm M_\odot yr^{-1}}$, is $0.050^{+0.002}_{-0.003}$ and $0.046^{+0.006}_{-0.004} M_\odot {\rm yr}^{-1} {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$ at $z=3.75-5$ and $z=5-6$, with protoclusters contributing $\sim$25% and 55%, respectively. This implies that a large fraction of star formation at $z &gt; 4$ occurs in protoclusters. We conduct the first star-formation-rate-limited 3D clustering analysis at $z &gt; 4$. We find the filamentary protocluster geometry flattens the power-law shape of the HAE auto-correlation functions, with slopes much shallower than typically assumed. The auto-correlation function of field HAEs have correlation lengths of $r_0 = 4.61^{+1.00}_{-0.68} h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$ at $z \approx 4-5$ and $r_0 = 6.23^{+1.68}_{-1.13} h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$ at $z=5-6$. Comparing the observed correlation functions with the UniverseMachine simulation, we infer the dark matter (sub-)halo masses of HAEs to be $\log (M_h/M_\odot)=11.0-11.2$ at $z\approx 4-6$, with a scatter of 0.4 dex.</description>

      <title>The Large-scale Environments of Low-luminosity AGNs at $3.9 &lt; z &lt; 6$ and Implications for Their Host Dark Matter Halos from a Complete NIRCam Grism Redshift Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the large-scale environments and clustering properties of 28 low-luminosity AGNs at $z=3.9-6$ in the GOODS-N field. Our sample, identified from the JWST NIRCam Imaging and WFSS data in CONGRESS and FRESCO surveys with either broad H$\alpha$ emission lines or V-shape continua, are compared to 782 H$\alpha$ emitters (HAEs) selected from the same data. These AGNs are located in diverse large-scale environments and do not preferentially reside in denser environments compared to HAEs. Their overdensity field, $\delta$, averaged over (15 $h^{-1}$cMpc)$^3$, ranges from $-0.56$ to 10.56, and shows no clear correlation with broad-line luminosity, black hole (BH) masses, or the AGN fraction. It suggests that $&gt; 10$ cMpc structures do not significantly influence BH growth. We measure the two-point cross-correlation function of AGNs with HAEs, finding a comparable amplitude to that of the HAE auto-correlation. This indicates similar bias parameters and host dark matter halo masses for AGNs and HAEs. The correlation length of field AGNs is 4.26 $h^{-1}$cMpc, and 7.66 $h^{-1}$cMpc at $3.9 &lt; z &lt; 5$ and $5 &lt; z &lt; 6$, respectively. We infer a median host dark matter halo mass of $\log (M_h/M_\odot)\approx 11.0-11.2$ and host stellar masses of $\log (M_\star/M_\odot) \approx 8.4-8.6$ by comparing with the UniverseMachine simulation. Our clustering analysis suggests that low-luminosity AGNs at high redshift reside in normal star-forming galaxies with overmassive BHs. They represent an intrinsically distinct population from luminous quasars and could be a common phase in galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>The Discovery of Little Red Dots in the Local Universe: Signatures of Cool Gas Envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: JWST observations have revealed a population of high-redshift "little red dots" (LRDs) that challenge conventional AGN models. We report the discovery of three local LRDs at $z = 0.1$-$0.2$, initially selected from the SDSS database, with follow-up optical/near-IR spectroscopy and photometry. They exhibit properties fully consistent with those of high-redshift LRDs, including broad hydrogen and helium emission lines, compact morphologies, V-shaped UV-optical SED, declining near-IR continua, and no significant variability. Two sources were targeted but not detected in X-rays with statistical significance. All three sources show blue-shifted He I absorption, while two exhibit H$\alpha$ and Na D absorption lines. We detect full Balmer and Paschen line series in all three objects, along with abundant narrow [Fe II] emission in two. The emission line analyses suggest narrow lines originate from AGN-powered, metal-poor regions with minimal dust; broad lines come from inner regions with exceptionally high density or atypical dust properties; and [Fe II] emission arises from dense gas between broad and narrow-line regions. One of our objects, J1025+1402 (nicknamed $The~Egg$), shows extremely high equivalent width Na D, K I, and Ca II triplet absorption lines, along with other potential low-ionization absorption features, suggesting the presence of a cool ($\sim$5000 K), metal-enriched gas envelope. The optical/near-IR continua of these LRDs are also consistent with theoretical models featuring an atmosphere around black holes. The WISE-detected IR emission is consistent with weak dust emission of $T \sim 10^2-10^3$ K. We propose a conceptual model consisting of a largely thermalized cool-gas envelope surrounding the central black hole and an extended emission line region with high-density outflowing gas to explain the observed properties of these local LRDs.</description>

      <title>$F$-term Multi-Field Inflation in Supergravity without Stabiliser Superfields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realising $F$-term slow-roll inflation in supergravity is non-trivial due to the well-known $\eta$-problem. The common strategy to solve the problem is to impose a shift symmetry on the K\"ahler potential, but this often leads to a negative potential in the large-field regime. To avoid negative potentials, an additional superfield called the stabiliser is usually added with a desired interaction. An alternative mechanism in supergravity, avoiding the use of a stabiliser superfield, was earlier proposed by two of us in the setup with a single chiral superfield having inflaton and goldstino amongst its field components. In this work, we extend that alternative mechanism to multi-superfield models of inflation, thereby providing a generic framework for embedding a wide class of single- and multi-field inflation models into supergravity. We illustrate our approach by several concrete examples of multi-field inflation and clarify the conditions required to avoid tachyonic instabilities during multi-field evolution. Our proposal significantly broadens the theoretical landscape of $F$-term inflation models in supergravity.</description>

      <title>Lensing Stability and Scattering Phenomena in Anisotropic Black Hole Spacetimes in Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the physical and observational features of static, spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes surrounded by anisotropic fluid and embedded in a plasma environment. Motivated by recent advances in black hole imaging and precision measurements in strong gravity, we explore light propagation, wave dynamics, and observational signatures in such geometries. We begin by analyzing the background spacetime and matter content, examining the horizon structure and verifying the energy conditions associated with the anisotropic fluid. We then study photon trajectories in both vacuum and plasma environments, deriving the equations of motion and computing deflection angles and image magnifications under weak gravitational lensing. Both uniform and power-law plasma profiles are considered to model realistic astrophysical settings. In the wave optics regime, we first analyze the linear stability of the spacetime under axial (odd-parity) perturbations using Chandrasekhar's method, and then investigate scalar field scattering by solving the wave equation in the curved background with plasma. Using Born and WKB approximations, we compute the differential scattering cross-sections and examine how anisotropy and plasma affect interference features. Finally, we perform parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to constrain the black hole mass and anisotropic fluid parameters, utilizing EHT and GRAVITY data for Sgr A* and EHT-only data for M87*. These results present a unified theoretical framework that links anisotropic matter effects with lensing and scattering observables providing a firm basis for future comparisons with high-resolution astrophysical data sets in diverse contexts.</description>

      <title>The $\mu$-deformed Einstein field equations with $\mu$-dependent effective cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the $\mu$-deformed Einstein field equations from the generalized thermodynamic functions of the $\mu$-deformed analog of Bose gas model, applying the (adapted) Verlinde's approach. The basic role of deformation parameter is shown: it provides the possibility to vary the value of the cosmological constant. Due to this, we suggest an interesting treatment of the cosmological constant (CC) problem within the framework of $\mu$-deformation. Namely, viewing the derived $\mu$-deformed CC as an effective one and varying the parameter $\mu$ appropriately, we gain the possibility to drastically reduce the CC, so as to get for it the realistic value. The relation to dark matter is of importance.</description>

      <title>Interpretable machine learning of halo gas density profiles: a sensitivity analysis of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar and AGN-driven feedback processes affect the distribution of gas on a wide range of scales, from within galaxies well into the intergalactic medium. Yet, it remains unclear how feedback, through its connection to key galaxy properties, shapes the radial gas density profile in the host halo. We tackle this question using suites of the EAGLE, IllustrisTNG, and Simba cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, which span a variety of feedback models. We develop a random forest algorithm that predicts the radial gas density profile within haloes from the total halo mass and five global properties of the central galaxy: gas and stellar mass; star formation rate; mass and accretion rate of the central black hole (BH). The algorithm reproduces the simulated gas density profiles with an average accuracy of $\sim$80-90% over the halo mass range $10^{9.5} \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot} &lt; M_{\rm 200c} &lt; 10^{15} \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and redshift interval $0&lt;z&lt;4$. For the first time, we apply Sobol statistical sensitivity analysis to full cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, quantifying how each feature affects the gas density as a function of distance from the halo centre. Across all simulations and redshifts, the total halo mass and the gas mass of the central galaxy are the most strongly tied to the halo gas distribution, while stellar and BH properties are generally less informative. The exact relative importance of the different features depends on the feedback scenario and redshift. Our framework can be readily embedded in semi-analytic models of galaxy formation to incorporate halo gas density profiles consistent with different hydrodynamical simulations. Our work also provides a proof of concept for constraining feedback models with future observations of galaxy properties and of the surrounding gas distribution.</description>
