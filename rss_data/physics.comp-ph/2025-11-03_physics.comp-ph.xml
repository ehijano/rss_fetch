      <title>MRX: A differentiable 3D MHD equilibrium solver without nested flux surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces a new 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium solver, based on the concept of admissible variations of B, p that allows for magnetic relaxation of a magnetic field in a perturbed/non-minimum energy state to a lower energy state. We describe the mathematical theory behind this method, including ensuring certain bounds on the magnetic energy, and the differential geometry behind transforming to and from a logical domain and physical domain. Our code is designed to address a number of traditional challenges to 3D MHD equilibrium solvers, e.g. exactly enforcing physical constraints such as divergence-free magnetic field, exhibiting high levels of numerical convergence, dealing with complex geometries, and modeling stochastic field lines or chaotic behavior. By using differentiable Python, our numerical method comes with the additional benefits of computational efficiency on modern computing architectures, high code accessibility, and differentiability at each step. The proposed magnetic relaxation solver is robustly benchmarked and tested with standard examples, including solving 2D toroidal equilibria at high-beta, and a rotating ellipse stellarator. Future work will address the integration of this code for 3D equilibrium optimization for modeling magnetic islands and chaos in stellarator fusion devices.</description>

      <title>Attenuation Compensation in Lossy Media via the Wave Operator Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wave operator model provides a framework for modeling wave propagation by encoding material parameter distributions into matrix-form operators. This paper extends this framework from lossless to lossy media. We present a derivation of the wave operator solution for the electric field in dissipative environments, which can be decomposed into a closed-form propagation term and a non-closed-form dissipation term. Based on an analysis of the dominant exponential decay within the propagation term, an attenuation compensation strategy is proposed to restore the attenuated data to an approximate lossless state. The performance of this compensation strategy is analyzed and validated through numerical experiments, establishing the theoretical foundation for reduced order model (ROM)-based techniques in lossy media.</description>

      <title>Boron Nitride Nanotubes as Efficient Surface Absorbers for Air Pollutant Gas Molecules: Insights from Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates into the adsorption sensing capabilities of single-walled (5,5) boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) towards environmental pollutant gas molecules, including CH2, SO2, NH3, H2Se, CO2 and CS2. Employing a linear combination of atomic orbital density functional theory (DFT) and spin-polarized generalized gradient approximation (GGA), the investigation reveals the nanotube's robust adsorption behavior without compromising its structural integrity. Thermodynamic and chemical parameters, such as adsorption energy, HOMO-LUMO gap, vertical ionization energy, and vertical electron affinity, highlight the (5,5) BNNTs' potential as efficient absorbents for pollutant molecules. Infrared spectroscopy confirms the formation of distinct BNNT-gas complexes. These findings underscore the promising application of BN nanotubes as absorbents for common gaseous pollutants, essential for developing sensors to enhance indoor air quality.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Neural Network Backflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately describing the ground state of strongly correlated systems is essential for understanding their emergent properties. Neural Network Backflow (NNBF) is a powerful variational ansatz that enhances mean-field wave functions by introducing configuration-dependent modifications to single-particle orbitals. Although NNBF is theoretically universal in the limit of large networks, we find that practical gains saturate with increasing network size. Instead, significant improvements can be achieved by using a multi-determinant ansatz. We explore efficient ways to generate these multi-determinant expansions without increasing the number of variational parameters. In particular, we study single-step Lanczos and symmetry projection techniques, benchmarking their performance against diffusion Monte Carlo and NNBF applied to alternative mean fields. Benchmarking on a doped periodic square Hubbard model near optimal doping, we find that a Lanczos step, diffusion Monte Carlo, and projection onto a symmetry sector all give similar improvements achieving state-of-the-art energies at minimal cost. By further optimizing the projected symmetrized states directly, we gain significantly in energy. Using this technique we report the lowest variational energies for this Hamiltonian on $4\times 16$ and $4 \times 8$ lattices as well as accurate variance extrapolated energies. We also show the evolution of spin, charge, and pair correlation functions as the quality of the variational ansatz improves.</description>

      <title>Boundary Layer Transition as Succession of Temporal and Spatial Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that both temporal and spatial symmetry breaking in canonical K-type transition arise as organized hydrodynamic structures rather than stochastic fluctuations. Before the skin-friction maximum, the flow is fully described by a periodic, spanwise symmetric, harmonic response to the Tollmien-Schlichting wave, forming a spatially compact coherent structure that produces hairpin packets. This fundamental harmonic response may visually resemble turbulence, but remains fully periodic and delimits the exact extent of the deterministic regime. A distinct regime change occurs after this point; a hierarchy of new (quasi-)periodic and aperiodic space-time structures emerges, followed shortly by anti-symmetric structures that develop similarly despite no anti-symmetric inputs, marking the onset of aperiodicity and spanwise asymmetry. We identify these structures as symmetry-decomposed spectral and space-time proper orthogonal modes that resolve the full progression from deterministic to broadband dynamics. The key insight is that laminar-turbulent transition can be viewed as a sequence of symmetry breaking events, each driven by energetically dominant, space-time coherent modes that gradually turn an initially harmonic flow into broadband turbulence.</description>

      <title>Dense Circumstellar Medium around Pulsating Massive Stars Powering Interacting Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of red supergiant (RSG) progenitors of core-collapse (CC) supernovae (SNe) with initial masses between $12-20~M_\odot$ focusing on the effects of enhanced mass loss due to pulsation-driven instabilities in their envelopes and subsequent dynamical ejections during advanced stages of nuclear burning. Using time-dependent mass loss from detailed MESA stellar evolution models, including a parameterized prescription for pulsation-driven superwinds and time-averaged mass loss rates attributed to resulting shock-induced ejections, we construct the circumstellar medium (CSM) before the SN explosion. We calculate resulting CSM density profiles and column densities considering the acceleration of the stellar wind. Our models produce episodes of enhanced mass loss $10^{-4}-10^{-2}~M_\odot~\rm{yr}^{-1}$ in the last centuries-decades before explosion forming dense CSM ($&gt;10^{-15}~\rm{gcm}^{-3}$ at distances $&lt;10^{15}$ cm) -- consistent with those inferred from multi-wavelength observations of Type II SNe such as SN~2023ixf and SN~2020ywx.</description>

      <title>Phase behaviour and defect structure of soft rods on a sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using particle-resolved molecular-dynamics simulations, we compute the phase diagram for soft repulsive spherocylinders confined on the surface of a sphere. While crystal (K), smectic (Sm), and isotropic (I) phases exhibit a stability region for any aspect ratio of the spherocylinders, a nematic phase emerges only beyond a critical aspect ratio lying between 6.0 and 7.0. As required by the topology of the confining sphere, the ordered phases exhibit a total orientational defect charge of +2. In detail, the crystal and smectic phases exhibit two +1 defects at the poles, whereas the nematic phase features four +1/2 defects which are connected along a great circle. For aspect ratios above the critical value, lowering the packing fraction drives a sequence of transitions: the crystal melts into a smectic phase, which then transforms into a nematic through the splitting of the +1 defects into pairs of +1/2 defects that progressively move apart, thereby increasing their angular separation. Eventually, at very low densities, orientational fluctuations stabilize an isotropic phase. Our simulations data can be experimentally verified in Pickering emulsions and are relevant to understand the morphogenesis in epithelial tissues.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Mechanical Stimuli in Functionally Graded Bone Scaffolds Through Porosity Gradients: A Finite Element Analysis Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving an optimal biomechanical environment within bone scaffolds is critical for promoting tissue regeneration, particularly in load-bearing anatomical sites where rigid fixation can induce stress shielding and compromise healing. Functionally graded (FG) scaffolds, which incorporate controlled variations in porosity or material properties, have attracted significant attention as a strategy to mitigate stress shielding by promoting more favourable load transfer. In this study, the effects of porosity gradient magnitude (i.e., max-to-min ratio of porosity), gradient resolution, scaffold material properties, and fixation plate rigidity on the distribution of mechanical stimuli within FG scaffolds were systematically investigated. Finite element analyses (FEA) were conducted on a femoral segmental defect model stabilised with a bone plate, and multiple porosity gradient strategies were compared against a corresponding uniform scaffold composed of body-centred cubic (BCC) unit cells. Scaffolds composed of titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V), bioactive glass (45S5 Bio-glass), and polylactic acid (PLA) were evaluated to capture a range of material stiffnesses. Introducing porosity gradients consistently enhanced the mean octahedral shear strain within the scaffold, particularly in regions adjacent to the fixation plate affected by stress shielding. The magnitude of mechanical stimulus improvement increased with both greater porosity gradient magnitudes and higher gradient resolution. These improvements were more pronounced in stiffer materials, such as Ti-6Al-4V, emphasising the critical interplay between scaffold material properties and architectural design. These findings highlight the importance of tailoring both porosity profiles and material selection to optimise scaffold mechanics for bone regeneration.</description>

      <title>Influence of the Control Temperature of Park's Two-temperature Model on the Mars Pathfinder Reactive Hypersonic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of reactive hypersonic flow under thermodynamic and chemical non-equilibrium conditions are presented for the Mars Pathfinder capsule. An 8-species chemical model is employed to simulate Mars' atmosphere. Park's two-temperature model is used to account for the thermal non-equilibrium phenomena. The present work analyzes the impact of different values of the weight factors used in Park's model, aiming to broaden the understanding of the weight factors influence. The code used to simulate the flows solves the Navier-Stokes equations modified to account for reacting gas mixtures. The findings are depicted in terms of the Mach number and temperature modes along the stagnation streamline in a region close to the shock wave. The present analysis also includes results regarding the stagnation point convective heat flux. The results indicate that varying the weight factors yields negligible differences in the shock wave position and stagnation point convective heat flux. The changes in the weight factors cause variations in the maximum temperature mode values in the non-equilibrium region. The results presented are in good agreement with experimental data present in the literature. The present work indicates that Park's two-temperature model weight factors can substantially affect the temperature mode distributions in the flow non-equilibrium region.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Study of Transition Metal Doped in 2D Polyaramid for Novel Material Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a first--principles density functional theory (DFT) study of transition metal (TM = Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) functionalized two--dimensional polyaramid (2DPA) to explore their structural, electronic, and magnetic properties. Mechanical parameters, such as bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and Pugh ratio, together with phonon dispersion, confirm the mechanical and dynamic stability of all doped systems. Electronic structure analysis shows strong binding of Co, Cr, Fe, Ni, and Ti with formation energies between --1.15 eV and --2.96 eV, while Mn binds more weakly (--0.67 eV). TM doping introduces new electronic states that reduce the band gap, with Fe-doped 2DPA exhibiting the lowest value of 0.26 eV. The systems display predominantly ferromagnetic ordering, with magnetic moments of 1.14 {\mu}B (Co), 3.57 {\mu}B (Cr), 2.26 {\mu}B (Fe), 4.19 {\mu}B (Mn), and 1.62 {\mu}B (Ti). These results demonstrate that TM--doped 2DPA possesses tunable magnetic and electronic characteristics, highlighting its potential for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>A stochastic branching particle method for solving non-conservative reaction-diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a stochastic branching particle-based method for solving nonlinear non-conservative advection-diffusion-reaction equations. The method splits the evolution into an advection-diffusion step, based on a linearized Kolmogorov forward equation and approximated by stochastic particle transport, and a reaction step implemented through a branching birth-death process that provides a consistent temporal discretization of the underlying reaction dynamics. This construction yields a mesh-free, nonnegativity-preserving scheme that naturally accommodates non-conservative systems and remains robust in the presence of singularities or blow-up. We validate the method on two representative two-dimensional systems: the Allen-Cahn equation and the Keller-Segel chemotaxis model. In both cases, the present method accurately captures nonlinear behaviors such as phase separation and aggregation, and achieves reliable performance without the need for adaptive mesh refinement.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of diffusivity and plastic deformation in ultrasound-assisted cold spray of tungsten: a molecular dynamics study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tungsten ($W$) is widely valued for its exceptional thermal stability, mechanical strength, and corrosion resistance, making it an ideal candidate for high-performance military and aerospace applications. However, its high melting point and inherent brittleness pose significant challenges for processing $W$ using additive manufacturing (AM). Cold spray (CS), a solid-state AM process that relies on high-velocity particle impact and plastic deformation, offers a promising alternative. In this study, we employ atomistic simulations to investigate the feasibility of CS for tungsten. We show that ultrasound perturbation can significantly enhance the self-diffusivity and plastic deformation of $W$ compared to the negligible diffusion and plastic deformation observed in non-ultrasound-assisted CS of $W$. For different impact velocities, particle sizes, and ultrasound parameters, we demonstrate that ultrasound-assisted viscoplasticity enhances self-diffusivity by inhibiting grain boundaries and incorporating softening in $W$. Moreover, we found that this enhanced diffusion in ultrasound-assisted $W$ can be exploited to promote interdiffusion at the particle-substrate interface, enabling in situ alloy formation. Through the formation of an equimolar $V$-$W$ alloy on a $W$ substrate using ultrasound-assisted CS simulations, we observed distinct mechanical properties and a reduced dislocation density in the deposited coating compared to a pure tungsten substrate. These results highlight the potential of ultrasound-assisted CS as a viable approach for manufacturing uniform coatings and engineered alloys, addressing key limitations in the AM of refractory metals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The one-dimensional Fr\"ohlich model describing the motion of a single electron interacting with optical phonons is a paradigmatic model of quantum many-body physics. We predict the existence of an arbitrarily large number of bound excited states in the strong coupling limit and calculate their excitation energies. Numerical simulations of a discretized model demonstrate the complete amelioration of the projector Monte Carlo sign problem by walker annihilation in an infinite Hilbert space. They reveal the threshold for the occurrence of the first bound excited states at a value of $\alpha \approx 1.73$ for the dimensionless coupling constant. This puts the threshold into the regime of intermediate interaction strength. We find a significant spectral weight and increased phonon number of the bound excited state at threshold.</description>

      <title>Conditional mutual information: A generalization of causal inference in quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of causality is fundamental to numerous scientific explanations; however, its extension to the quantum regime has yet to be rigorously explored. This letter introduces the development of a quantum causal index, a novel extension of the classical causal inference framework, tailored to learn the causal relationships inherent in quantum systems. Our study focuses on the asymmetric quantum conditional mutual information (QCMI), incorporating the von Neumann entropy, as a directional metric of causal influence in quantum many-body systems. We analyze spin chains using the QCMI, implementing a projective measurement on one site as the intervention and monitoring its effect on a distant site conditioned on intermediate spins. Additionally, we study the effective causal propagation velocity, which is the speed at which QCMI becomes significant at distant sites. These findings indicate the presence of finite-speed propagation of causal influence, along with the emergence of coherent oscillations.</description>

      <title>A Variance-Based Convergence Criterion in Neural Variational Monte Carlo for Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optimization of neural wave functions in variational Monte Carlo crucially relies on a robust convergence criterion. While the energy variance is theoretically a definitive measure, its practical application as a primary convergence criterion has been underexplored. In this work, we develop a lightweight, general-purpose solver that utilizes the energy variance as a convergence criterion. We apply it to several systems-including the harmonic oscillator, hydrogen atom, and charmonium hadron-for validating the variance as a reliable diagnostic, and using a empirical threshold $10^{-3}$ as the energy variance convergence values for performing rapid parameter scans to enable preliminary physical verification. To clarify the scope of our approach, we derive an inequality that delineates the limitations of variance-based optimization in nodal systems. Despite these limitations, the energy variance proves to be a highly valuable tool, guiding our solver to efficient and reliable results across a range of quantum problems.</description>

      <title>Common Task Framework For a Critical Evaluation of Scientific Machine Learning Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is transforming modeling and control in the physical, engineering, and biological sciences. However, rapid development has outpaced the creation of standardized, objective benchmarks - leading to weak baselines, reporting bias, and inconsistent evaluations across methods. This undermines reproducibility, misguides resource allocation, and obscures scientific progress. To address this, we propose a Common Task Framework (CTF) for scientific machine learning. The CTF features a curated set of datasets and task-specific metrics spanning forecasting, state reconstruction, and generalization under realistic constraints, including noise and limited data. Inspired by the success of CTFs in fields like natural language processing and computer vision, our framework provides a structured, rigorous foundation for head-to-head evaluation of diverse algorithms. As a first step, we benchmark methods on two canonical nonlinear systems: Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and Lorenz. These results illustrate the utility of the CTF in revealing method strengths, limitations, and suitability for specific classes of problems and diverse objectives. Next, we are launching a competition around a global real world sea surface temperature dataset with a true holdout dataset to foster community engagement. Our long-term vision is to replace ad hoc comparisons with standardized evaluations on hidden test sets that raise the bar for rigor and reproducibility in scientific ML.</description>
