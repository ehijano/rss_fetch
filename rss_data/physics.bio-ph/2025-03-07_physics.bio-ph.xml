      <title>Optimal Cell Shape for Accurate Chemical Gradient Sensing in Eukaryote Chemotaxis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate gradient sensing is crucial for efficient chemotaxis in noisy environments, but the relationship between cell shape deformations and sensing accuracy is not well understood. Using a theoretical framework based on maximum likelihood estimation, we show that the receptor dispersion, quantified by cell shape convex hull, fundamentally limits gradient sensing accuracy. Cells with a concave shape and isotropic error space achieve optimal performance in gradient detection. This concave shape, resulting from active protrusions or contractions, can significantly improve gradient sensing accuracy at the cost of increased energy expenditure. By balancing sensing accuracy and deformation cost, we predict that a concave, three-branched shape as optimal for cells in shallow gradients. To achieve efficient chemotaxis, our theory suggests that a cell should adopt a repeating "run-and-expansion" cycle. Our theoretical predictions align well with experimental observations, implying that the fast amoeboid cell motion is optimized near the physical limit for chemotaxis. This study highlights the crucial role of active cell shape deformation in facilitating accurate chemotaxis.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical quantum embedding by machine learning for large molecular assemblies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum-in-quantum embedding strategy coupled to machine learning potentials to improve on the accuracy of quantum-classical hybrid models for the description of large molecules. In such hybrid models, relevant structural regions (such as those around reaction centers or pockets for binding of host molecules) can be described by a quantum model that is then embedded into a classical molecular-mechanics environment. However, this quantum region may become so large that only approximate electronic structure models are applicable. To then restore accuracy in the quantum description, we here introduce the concept of quantum cores within the quantum region that are amenable to accurate electronic structure models due to their limited size. Huzinaga-type projection-based embedding, for example, can deliver accurate electronic energies obtained with advanced electronic structure methods. The resulting total electronic energies are then fed into a transfer learning approach that efficiently exploits the higher-accuracy data to improve on a machine learning potential obtained for the original quantum-classical hybrid approach. We explore the potential of this approach in the context of a well-studied protein-ligand complex for which we calculate the free energy of binding using alchemical free energy and non-equilibrium switching simulations.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Enhanced Calculation of Quantum-Classical Binding Free Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binding free energies are a key element in understanding and predicting the strength of protein--drug interactions. While classical free energy simulations yield good results for many purely organic ligands, drugs including transition metal atoms often require quantum chemical methods for an accurate description. We propose a general and automated workflow that samples the potential energy surface with hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations and trains a machine learning (ML) potential on the QM energies and forces to enable efficient alchemical free energy simulations. To represent systems including many different chemical elements efficiently and to account for the different description of QM and MM atoms, we propose an extension of element-embracing atom-centered symmetry functions for QM/MM data as an ML descriptor. The ML potential approach takes electrostatic embedding and long-range electrostatics into account. We demonstrate the applicability of the workflow on the well-studied protein--ligand complex of myeloid cell leukemia 1 and the inhibitor 19G and on the anti-cancer drug NKP1339 acting on the glucose-regulated protein 78.</description>

      <title>Euler buckling on curved surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Euler buckling epitomises mechanical instabilities: An inextensible straight elastic line buckles under compression when the compressive force reaches a critical value $F_\ast&gt;0$. Here, we extend this classical, planar instability to the buckling under compression of an inextensible relaxed elastic line on a curved surface. By weakly nonlinear analysis of an asymptotically short elastic line, we reveal that the buckling bifurcation changes fundamentally: The critical force for the lowest buckling mode is $F_\ast=0$ and higher buckling modes disconnect from the undeformed branch to connect in pairs. Solving the buckling problem numerically, we additionally find a new post-buckling instability: A long elastic line on a curved surface snaps through under sufficient compression. Our results thus set the foundations for understanding the buckling instabilities on curved surfaces that pervade the emergence of shape in biology.</description>

      <title>Capacitive response of biological membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a minimal model to analyze the capacitive response of a biological membrane subjected to a step voltage via blocking electrodes. Through a perturbative analysis of the underlying electrolyte transport equations, we show that the leading-order relaxation of the transmembrane potential is governed by a capacitive timescale, ${\tau_{\rm C} =\dfrac{\lambda_{\rm D}L}{D}\left(\dfrac{2+\Gamma\delta^{\rm M}/L}{4+\Gamma\delta^{\rm M}/\lambda_{\rm D}}\right)}$, where $\lambda_{\rm D}$ is the Debye screening length, $L$ is the electrolyte width, $\Gamma$ is the ratio of the dielectric permittivity of the electrolyte to the membrane, $\delta^{\rm M}$ is the membrane thickness, and $D$ is the ionic diffusivity. This timescale is considerably shorter than the traditional RC timescale ${\lambda_{\rm D} L / D}$ for a bare electrolyte due to the membrane's low dielectric permittivity and finite thickness. Beyond the linear regime, however, salt diffusion in the bulk electrolyte drives a secondary, nonlinear relaxation process of the transmembrane potential over a longer timescale ${\tau_{\rm L} =L^2/4\pi^2 D}$. A simple equivalent-circuit model accurately captures the linear behavior, and the perturbation expansion remains applicable across the entire range of observed physiological transmembrane potentials. Together, these findings underscore the importance of the faster capacitive timescale and nonlinear effects on the bulk diffusion timescale in determining transmembrane potential dynamics for a range of biological systems.</description>

      <title>Rhythmic sharing: A bio-inspired paradigm for zero-shot adaptive learning in neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08644v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The brain rapidly adapts to new contexts and learns from limited data, a coveted characteristic that artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms struggle to mimic. Inspired by the mechanical oscillatory rhythms of neural cells, we developed a learning paradigm utilizing link strength oscillations, where learning is associated with the coordination of these oscillations. Link oscillations can rapidly change coordination, allowing the network to sense and adapt to subtle contextual changes without supervision. The network becomes a generalist AI architecture, capable of predicting dynamics of multiple contexts including unseen ones. These results make our paradigm a powerful starting point for novel models of cognition. Because our paradigm is agnostic to specifics of the neural network, our study opens doors for introducing rapid adaptive learning into leading AI models.</description>
