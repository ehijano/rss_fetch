      <title>Exact Flux Vacua, Symmetries, and the Structure of the Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying flux vacua in string theory with stabilized complex structure moduli presents a significant challenge, necessitating the minimization of a scalar potential complicated by infinitely many exponential corrections. In order to obtain exact results we connect three central topics: transcendentality or algebraicity of coupling functions, emergent symmetries, and the distribution of vacua. Beginning with explicit examples, we determine the first exact landscape of flux vacua with a vanishing superpotential within F-theory compactifications on a genuine Calabi-Yau fourfold. We find that along certain symmetry loci in moduli space the generically transcendental vacuum conditions become algebraic and can be described using the periods of a K3 surface. On such loci the vacua become dense when we do not bound the flux tadpole, while imposing the tadpole bound yields a small finite landscape of distinct vacua. Away from these symmetry loci, the transcendentality of the fourfold periods ensures that there are only a finite number of vacua with a vanishing superpotential, even when the tadpole constraint is removed. These observations exemplify the general patterns emerging in the bulk of moduli space that we expose in this work. They are deeply tied to the arithmetic structure underlying flux vacua and generalize the finiteness claims about rational CFTs and rank-two attractors. From a mathematical perspective, our study is linked with the recent landmark results by Baldi, Klingler, and Ullmo about the Hodge locus that arose from connecting tame geometry and Hodge theory.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we construct a supersymmetric model, obtained by deforming $\mathcal N=2$ AdS$_3$ supergravity through a chiral vector component of the torsion. Moreover, we study the existence of BPS states of such theory, by inspecting the presence of Killing spinors on a specific bosonic solution.</description>

      <title>Ground States of Class S Theory on ADE Singularities and dual Chern-Simons theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In radial quantization, the ground states of a gauge theory on ADE singularities $R^4/\Gamma$ are characterized by flat connections that are maps from $\Gamma$ to the gauge group. We study Class S theory of type $A_1$ on a Riemann surface of genus $g&gt;1$, without punctures. The fundamental building block of Class S theory is the trifundamental Trinion theory - a low energy limit of two M5 branes compactified on the three-punctured Riemann sphere. We show through the superconformal index, that the supersymmetric Casimir energy of the trifundamental theory imposes a constraint on the set of allowed flat connections, which agrees with the prediction of a duality relating the ground state Hilbert space of Class S on ADE singularities to the Hilbert space of a certain dual Chern-Simons theory whose gauge group is given by the McKay correspondence. The conjecture is shown to hold for $\Gamma=Z_k$, agreeing with the previous results of Benini et al. and Alday et al. Non-abelian generalizations of this duality are analyzed by considering the example of the dicyclic group Dic${}_2$, corresponding to gauge group SO$(8)$.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Group Gauge Theories and Simple Gauge/String Dualities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional topological gauge theories with gauge group equal to the symmetric group $S_n$ and their string theory duals. The simplest such theory is the topological quantum field theory of principal $S_n$ fiber bundles. Its correlators are equal to Hurwitz numbers. The operator products in the gauge theory for each finite value of $n$ are coded in a partial permutation algebra. We propose a generalization of the partial permutation algebra to any symmetric orbifold topological quantum field theory and show that the latter theory factorizes into marked partial permutation combinatorics and seed Frobenius algebra properties. Moreover, we exploit the established correspondence between Hurwitz theory and the stationary sector of Gromov-Witten theory on the sphere to prove an exact gauge/string duality. The relevant field theory is a grand canonical version of Hurwitz theory and its two-point functions are obtained by summing over all values of the instanton degree of the maps covering the sphere. We stress that one must look for a multiplicative basis on the boundary to match the bulk operator algebra of single string insertions. The relevant boundary observables are completed cycles.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a $(\mathbb {RP}^1 \times \mathbb{RP}^1)$-gauged $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quotient of $\mathbb R^{2,2}$ embeds an AdS$_3/\mathbb Z_2/ (\mathbb{RP}^1 \times \mathbb{RP}^1)$ spacetime that is globally hyperbolic, unlike regular AdS$_3$. This embedded spacetime possesses a single cover of AdS$_3$'s isometries without producing closed timelike curves and a non-timelike boundary. After including its gauge symmetries, its AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence becomes equivalent to an embedded $\frac{\text{AdS}_3}{\mathbb Z_2}$ / $\frac{\mathbb R^{2,2}}{\mathbb Z_2}$ embedding correspondence.</description>

      <title>Leading Giant graviton expansion of Schur correlators in large representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider 4d $\mathcal N=4$ $U(N)$ SYM and the leading giant graviton correction to the Schur defect 2-point functions of $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS Wilson lines in rank-$k$ symmetric and antisymmetric representations. We study in particular the large $k$ limit for the symmetric case and the regime $1\ll k \ll N$ in the antisymmetric one. We present exact results for the correction in agreement with matrix model evaluation at finite $N,k$. The Wilson lines in symmetric/antisymmetric representations admit a description in terms of D3$_{k}$ and D5$_{k}$ brane probes representing a collection of $k$ fundamental strings. In this picture, giant graviton corrections come from fluctuations of brane probes in presence of a wrapped D3 brane giant graviton. In particular, for the antisymmetric case, our leading correction matches the half-index of the 3d $\mathcal N=4$ Maxwell theory living on the 3d disk which is a part of the giant graviton divided out by the D5$_{k}$ probe, as recently proposed in arXiv:2404.08302. For the symmetric case at large $k$, we derive an explicit exact residue formula for the leading correction.</description>

      <title>On Global Symmetries and Fayet-Iliopoulos Terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the genuine Fayet-Iliopoulos terms of 4D N=1 supergravity. Such terms are commonly believed to preserve a global symmetry, and therefore they are in conflict with the principles of quantum gravity. However, we find that generically there do exist supersymmetric terms that break explicitly the specific global symmetry, while preserving gauge invariance. We illustrate this, by providing a series of examples, including superpotentials and superspace higher order terms, along with a general prescription for their construction.</description>

      <title>On the field independent additive constant in Wilson actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the field independent additive constant in Wilson actions carefully within the exact renormalization group formalism. The additive constant does not affect the correlation functions of fields normalized by the partition function, and for that reason it is often ignored. But it is an essential part of the partition function, and in the limit where the UV cutoff goes to zero, the constant gives a renormalized vacuum energy density. We discuss two concrete examples: the Gaussian theory and the linear sigma model in the large $N$ limit.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric $\mathbb{Z}_4$ orbifolds of type IIB string theory revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct freely acting asymmetric $\mathbb{Z}_4$ orbifolds of type IIB string theory on $T^5$ preserving 24,16 or 8 supercharges in five dimensions. We show that these models are well-defined if the SO(8) lattice is chosen, while the SU(2)$^4$ lattice, which was previously considered in the literature, does not lead to a modular invariant partition function. Also, we clarify some issues related to the coefficients in the $q\bar{q}$-expansion of the partition function in the twisted sectors of asymmetric orbifolds.</description>

      <title>Revisiting holographic model for thermal and dense QCD with a critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To quantitatively provide reliable predictions for the hot and dense QCD matter, a holographic model should be adjusted to describe first-principles lattice results available at vanishing baryon chemical potential. The equation of state from two well-known lattice groups, the HotQCD collaboration and the Wuppertal-Budapest (WB) collaboration, shows visible differences at high temperatures. We revisit the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton (EMD) holographic model for hot QCD with 2+1 flavors and physical quark masses by fitting lattice QCD data from the WB collaboration. Using the parameterization for the scalar potential and gauge coupling proposed in our work [Phys.Rev.D 106 (2022) 12, L121902], the equation of state, the higher order baryon number susceptibilities, and the chiral condensates are in quantitative agreement with state-of-the-art lattice results. We find that the critical endpoint (CEP) obtained from fitting the WB collaboration data is nearly identical to the one from the HotQCD collaboration, suggesting the robustness of the location of the CEP. Moreover, our holographic prediction for the CEP location is in accord with more recent Bayesian analysis on a large number of holographic EMD models and an effective potential approach of QCD from gap equations.</description>

      <title>Climbing over the potential barrier during inflation via null energy condition violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The violation of the null energy condition (NEC) may play a crucial role in enabling a scalar field to climb over high potential barriers, potentially significant in the very early universe. We propose a single-field model where the universe sequentially undergoes a first stage of slow-roll inflation, NEC violation, and a second stage of slow-roll inflation. Through the NEC violation, the scalar field climbs over high potential barriers, leaving unique characteristics on the primordial gravitational wave power spectrum, including a blue-tilted nature in the middle-frequency range and diminishing oscillation amplitudes at higher frequencies. Additionally, the power spectrum exhibits nearly scale-invariant behavior on both large and small scales.</description>

      <title>Cosmology from String T-duality and zero-point length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by String T-duality and taking into account the zero-point length correction, $l_0$, to the gravitational potential, we construct modified Friedmann equations by applying the first law of thermodynamics on the apparent horizon of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) Universe. The cosmological viability of this extended scenario is investigated by studying influences on the evolution of the early Universe and performing the cosmographic analysis. Furthermore, we explore the inflationary paradigm under the slow-roll condition. By testing the model against observational data, the zero-point length is constrained around the Planck scale, in compliance with the original assumption from String T-duality. We also study the growth of density perturbations in the linear regime. It is shown that the zero-point length stands out as an alternative characterization for the broken-power-law spectrum, which provides a better fitting for the experimental measurements comparing to the simple power-law potential. Finally, we focus on implications for the primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) spectrum. Should the zero-point length be running over energy scales, as is the case for all parameters and coupling constants in quantum gravity under renormalization group considerations, deviations from General Relativity (GR) might be potentially tested through upcoming PGW observatories.</description>

      <title>Virasoro constraints for K3 surfaces and monodromy operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Virasoro constraints for moduli spaces of stable torsion free sheaves on a surface with only $(p,p)$-cohomology were recently proved by Bojko-Moreira-Lim. The rank 1 case, which is not restricted to surfaces with only $(p,p)$-cohomology, was established by Moreira. We formulate conjectural Virasoro constraints in any positive rank without requiring only $(p,p)$-cohomology. We prove our conjecture for K3 surfaces using Markman monodromy operators, which allow us to reduce to the rank 1 case. We also prove new Virasoro constraints in rank 0. Finally, for K3 surfaces, we introduce new Virasoro operators in negative degree which, together with the previous Virasoro operators, give a representation of Virasoro algebra with central charge $24$.</description>

      <title>Black Hole shadows of $\alpha'$-corrected black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the qualitative features induces by corrections to GR coming from String Theory, on the shadows of rotating black holes. We deal with the slowly rotating black hole solutions up to order $\mathcal{O}(a^3)$, to first order in $\alpha'$, including also the dilaton. We provide a detailed characterization of the geometry, as well as the ISCO and photon ring, and then we proceed to obtain the black hole images within the relativistic thin-disk model. We characterize the images by computing the diameter, displacement and asymmetry. A comparison with the Kerr case, indicates that all these quantities grow due to the $\alpha'$ correction, and that the departure from GR for different observable is enhanced depending on the angle of view, namely for the diameter the maximum departure is obtained when the system is face-on, while for the displacement and asymmetry the departure from GR is maximized for edge-on point of view.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic attractor is a concept that describes universal equilibration behavior in which systems lose microscopic details before hydrodynamics becomes applicable. We propose a setup to observe hydrodynamic attractors in ultracold atomic gases, taking advantage of the fact that driving the two-body $s$-wave scattering length causes phenomena equivalent to isotropic fluid expansions. We specifically consider two-component fermions with contact interactions in three dimensions and discuss their dynamics under a power-law drive of the scattering length in a uniform system, employing a hydrodynamic relaxation model. We analytically solve their dynamics and find the hydrodynamic attractor solution. Our results establish the cold atom systems as a new platform for exploring hydrodynamic attractors.</description>

      <title>Coupled $\operatorname{G}_2$-instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the coupled instanton equations for a metric, a spinor, a three-form, and a connection on a bundle, over a spin manifold. Special solutions in dimensions $6$ and $7$ arise, respectively, from the Hull--Strominger and heterotic $\operatorname{G}_2$ systems. The equations are motivated by recent developments in theoretical physics and can be recast using generalized geometry; we investigate how coupled instantons relate to generalized Ricci-flat metrics and also to Killing spinors on a Courant algebroid. In this respect, we present two open questions regarding how these different geometric conditions are intertwined. A positive answer is expected from recent developments in the physics literature in work by De la Ossa, Larfors and Svanes, and in the mathematics literature, for the case of Calabi--Yau manifolds, in recent work by the second author jointly with Gonzalez Molina. We give a complete solution to the first of these two problems, for $\operatorname{G}_2$-structures with torsion coupled to $\operatorname{G}_2$-instantons, in the seven-dimensional case, and also establish some partial results for the second problem. The last part of the present work carefully studies the approximate solutions to the heterotic $\operatorname{G}_2$-system constructed by the third and fourth authors on contact Calabi--Yau $7$-manifolds, for which we prove the existence of approximate coupled $\operatorname{G}_2$-instantons and generalized Ricci-flat metrics.</description>

      <title>Hadronic Spectrum in the Chiral Large $N_c$ Extension of Quantum Chromodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Quantum Chromodynamics in the chiral large $N_c$ limit which contains a left-handed Weyl fermion in the fundamental representation, a left-handed Weyl fermion in the two index antisymmetric representation and $(N_c-3)$ left-handed Weyl fermions in the antifundamental representation of the $SU(N_c)$ gauge group. We construct gauge singlet composite operators and study their masses and correlation functions at large $N_c$.
  It is shown that all hadron masses scale as $\sim N_c^0 n_q$ where $n_q$ is the number of constituent quarks in the hadron. In addition by simple gluon exchange considerations it is seen that scattering amplitudes between hadrons have the same $N_c$ scaling as the mass of the lightest hadron involved. This is the case provided the hadrons in the scattering amplitude share a sufficiently large number of constituent quarks.
  The chiral large $N_c$ extension also allows for other non-trivial processes. For instance we consider two different baryonium states that are unique to this extension and that decay via emissions of two- and three-quark hadrons. Also other non-trivial scattering processes are considered. Finally, we study composites made of a mix of left- and right-handed fields. We categorize multiple groups of hadrons within the full spectrum according to their flavor structure. Within these groups all $n$-point functions scale the same.</description>

      <title>Embedded Domain Walls and Electroweak Baryogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embedded walls are domain wall solutions which are unstable in the vacuum but stabilized in a plasma of the early Universe. We show how embedded walls in which the electroweak symmetry is restored can lead to an efficient scenario of electroweak baryogenesis. We construct an extension of the Standard Model of particle physics in which embedded walls exist and are stabilized in an electromagnetic plasma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the model put forth by Ref. \cite{Oppenheim:2024rcp}, in which it is claimed that "post-quantum classical gravity" (PQCG), a stochastic theory of gravity, leads to modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) behavior on galactic scales that reproduces galactic rotation curves. We show that this analysis has two basic problems: (i) the equations of PQCG do not lead to a new large scale force of the form claimed in the paper, and (ii) the form claimed is not of the MONDian form anyhow and so does not correspond to observed galactic dynamics. We also mention other potential problems that might arise from stochastic gravitational behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00767v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the quiver Yangians associated to general affine Dynkin diagrams. Although the quivers are generically not toric, the algebras have some similar structures. The odd reflections of the affine Dynkin diagrams should correspond to Seiberg duality of the quivers, and we investigate the relations of the dual quiver Yangians. We also mention the construction of the twisted quiver Yangians. It is conjectured that the truncations of the (twisted) quiver Yangians can give rise to certain $\mathcal{W}$-algebras. Incidentally, we give the screening currents of the $\mathcal{W}$-algebras in terms of the free field realization in the case of generalized conifolds. Moreover, we discuss the toroidal and elliptic algebras for any general quivers.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Wu-Yang approach to magnetic charge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wu-Yang fiber bundle approach to magnetic charge has an overlooked feature -- a disk-like sheet current density and associated magnetic field in the overlap region between the Northern hemisphere and Southern hemisphere, where the different vector potentials connect. This disk magnetic field plays a role similar to the Dirac string in the Dirac approach to magnetic charge - it brings an inward magnetic flux of $4 \pi g$ which then gives rise to an outward flux of $4 \pi g$ from the Coulomb magnetic field. As with the Dirac string approach we show that placing an electric charge near this disk magnetic field gives rise to a non-zero electromagnetic field momentum. Thus the Wu-Yang approach is seen to be a Coulomb magnetic field plus a disk magnetic field, in a manner similar to the Dirac approach which has a Coulomb magnetic field plus a string magnetic field. We discuss some of the possible consequences of this. We conclude by showing that the non-singular, but non-single valued Banderet monopole potential also has a disk-like singularity and non-zero electromagnetic field momentum in the presence of an electric charge.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory for Extreme Mass Ratios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an effective field theory describing a pair of gravitationally interacting point particles in an expansion in their mass ratio, also known as the self-force (SF) expansion. The 0SF dynamics are trivially obtained to all orders in Newton's constant by the geodesic motion of the light body in a Schwarzschild background encoding the gravitational field of the heavy body. The corrections at 1SF and higher are generated by perturbations about this configuration -- that is, the geodesic deviation of the light body and the fluctuation graviton -- but crucially supplemented by an operator describing the recoil of the heavy body as it interacts with the smaller companion. Using this formalism we compute new results at third post-Minkowskian order for the conservative dynamics of a system of gravitationally interacting massive particles coupled to a set of additional scalar and vector fields.</description>

      <title>From Amplitudes to Analytic Wavefunctions</title>

Abstract: The field-theoretic wavefunction has received renewed attention with the goal of better understanding observables at the boundary of de Sitter spacetime and studying the interior of Minkowski or general FLRW spacetime. Understanding the analytic structure of the wavefunction potentially allows us to establish bounds on physical observables. In this paper we develop an amplitude representation for the flat space wavefunction, which allow us to write the flat space wavefunction as an amplitude-like Feynman integral integrated over an energy-fixing kernel. With this representation it is possible to separate the wavefunction into an amplitude part and a subleading part which is less divergent as the total energy goes to zero. In turn the singularities of the wavefunction can be classified into two sets: amplitude-type singularities, which can be mapped to singularities found in amplitudes (including anomalous thresholds), and wavefunction-type singularities, which are unique to the wavefunction. As an example we study several tree level and one loop diagrams for scalars, and explore their singularities in detail.</description>

      <title>The kinematics of multiple Compton scattering of two-photon systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12972v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Stokes-Mueller method to calculate the cross sections associated with multiple Compton scattering of an arbitrary two-photon system. This method is used to calculate the cross section in the scenario in which one of the maximally entangled annihilation photons undergoes intermediate Compton scattering followed by the detection of both photons using a pair of Compton polarimeters. The method accounts for potential quantum-decoherence effects caused by Compton scattering. Despite being grounded in quantum field theory, the method does not require an in-depth understanding of its typically intricate prerequisites. As a result, this method is anticipated to be accessible to a broader community of physicists and is readily applicable in Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Worldline path integral for the massive graviton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the counterterms necessary for the renormalization of the one-loop effective action of massive gravity from a worldline perspective. This is achieved by employing the recently proposed massive $\mathcal{N}=4$ spinning particle model to describe the propagation of the massive graviton on those backgrounds that solve the Einstein equations without cosmological constant, namely on Ricci-flat manifolds, in four dimensions. The model is extended to be consistent in $D$ spacetime dimensions by relaxing the gauging of the full SO(4) R-symmetry group to a parabolic subgroup, together with the inclusion of a suitable Chern-Simons term. Then, constructing the worldline path integral on the one-dimensional torus allows for the correct calculation of the one-loop divergencies in arbitrary $D$ dimensions. Our primary contribution is the determination of the Seleey-DeWitt coefficients up to the fourth coefficient $a_3(D)$, which to our knowledge has never been reported in the literature. Its calculation is generally laborious on the quantum field theory side, as a general formula for these coefficients is not available for operators that are non-minimal in the heat kernel sense. This work illustrates the computational efficiency of worldline methods in this regard. Heat kernel coefficients characterize linearized massive gravity in a gauge-independent manner due to the on-shell condition of the background on which the graviton propagates. They could serve as a benchmark for verifying alternative approaches to massive gravity, and, for this reason, their precise expression should be known explicitly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [1] we pointed out that in the Dark Dimension scenario [2] theoretical issues arise when the prediction for the vacuum energy $\rho$, that is obtained from swampland conjectures in string theory, is confronted with the corresponding result for $\rho$ in the field theory limit. One of the problems arises from the field theory side and is due to previous results for $\rho$ that, according to our analysis, turn out to be incorrect, although widely spread. Our work was challenged in [3]. Here we show why in our opinion the claims in [3] are inconsistent, actually based on arguments deprived of physical meaning, providing further support to our findings. We conclude by discussing ideas on the physical mechanism that could trigger the suppression of large UV contributions to $\rho$.</description>

      <title>Soft Leptogenesis with Primordial Black Holes and Natural Solution to Gravitino Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of the production of sneutrinos through Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes (PBH), we have studied soft leptogenesis in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with heavy right handed neutrinos. Depending upon different conditions on the Hawking evaporation temperature of the PBH and the initial Hawking temperature of the PBH with the sneutrinos's mass which has lepton number violating decay modes, we have discussed how the gravitino problem could be easily avoided in leptogenesis in SUSYGUT theories. For this, one is required to consider that the PBH energy density dominates the energy budget of the universe over the inflaton field. We have shown three possible cases for which the successful generation of baryonic asymmetry is possible. In one case, for the generation of baryonic asymmetry, Shakharov's out-of-equilibrium condition is required whereas in the other two cases, it is found to be not required. The first case is somewhat similar to conventional soft leptogenesis, where for avoiding gravitino problem, $B$ parameter is required to be lower than the weak scale. However in those later two cases, gravitino problem can be easily avoided and the soft breaking $B$ parameter could be naturally at the weak scale for PBH mass greater than about $3 \times 10^{26}$ GeV. From experimental constraint of non-observation of $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$, the allowed region of typical mass scale of some supersymmetric particles and the $|A|$ parameter is also discussed.</description>

Abstract: It was recently shown that taking into account the granular structure of graphene lattice, the Dirac-like dynamics of its quasiparticles resists beyond the lowest energy approximation. This can be described in terms of new phase-space variables, $(\vec{X},\vec{P})$, that enjoy generalized Heisenberg algebras. In this letter, we add to that picture the important case of noncommuting $\vec{X}$, for which $[X^i,X^j] = \mathrm{i} \, \theta^{i j}$ and we find that $\theta^{i j} = \ell^2 \, \epsilon^{i j}$, with $\ell$ the lattice spacing. We close by giving both the general recipe and a possible specific kinematic setup for the practical implementation of this approach to test noncommutative theories in tabletop analog experiments on graphene.</description>

      <title>Anharmonic Effects on the Squeezing of Axion Perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is assumed in standard cosmology that the Universe underwent a period of inflation in its earliest phase, providing the seeds for structure formation through vacuum fluctuations of the inflaton scalar field. These fluctuations get stretched by the quasi-exponential expansion of the Universe and become squeezed. The aim of this paper is to deepen the understanding of the squeezing process, considering the effect of self-interactions. Axion-like particles can provide a useful setup to study this effect. Specifically we focus on the consequences that a non-trivial evolution of the background axion field has on the squeezing of the perturbations. We follow the evolution of the axion's fluctuation modes from the horizon exit during inflation to the radiation-dominated epoch. We compute Bogoliubov coefficients and squeezing parameters, which are linked to the axion particle number and isocurvature perturbation. We find that the quantum mechanical particle production and the squeezing of the perturbations are enhanced, if one accounts for anharmonic effects, i.e., the effect of higher order terms in the potential. This effect becomes particularly strong towards the hilltop of the potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of matter fields on an ensemble of random geometries is a difficult problem still in need of new methods and ideas. We will follow a point of view inspired by probability theory techniques that relies on an expansion of the two point function as a sum over random walks. An analogous expansion for Fermions on non-Euclidean geometries is still lacking. Casiday et al. [\textit{Laplace and Dirac operators on graphs}, Linear and Multilinear Algebra (2022) 1] proposed a classical "Dirac walk" diffusing on vertices and edges of an oriented graph with a square root of the graph Laplacian. In contrast to the simple random walk, each step of the walk is given a sign depending on the orientation of the edge it goes through. In a toy model, we propose here to study the Green functions, spectrum and the spectral dimension of such "Dirac walks" on the Bethe lattice, a $d$-regular tree. The recursive structure of the graph makes the problem exactly solvable. Notably, we find that the spectrum develops a gap and that the spectral dimension of the Dirac walk matches that of the simple random walk ($d_s=1$ for $d=2$ and $d_s=3$ for $d\geq 3$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a comprehensive study of asymptotically flat spacetime in even dimensions $d\geq 4$. We analyze the most general boundary condition and asymptotic symmetry compatible with Penrose's definition of asymptotic null infinity $\mathscr{I}$ through conformal compactification. Following Penrose's prescription and using a minimal version of the Bondi-Sachs gauge, we show that $\mathscr{I}$ is naturally equipped with a Carrollian stress tensor whose radial derivative defines the asymptotic Weyl tensor. This analysis describes asymptotic infinity as a stretched horizon in the conformally compactified spacetime. We establish that charge aspects conservation can be written as Carrollian Bianchi identities for the asymptotic Weyl tensor. We then provide a covariant renormalization for the asymptotic symplectic potential, which results in a finite symplectic flux and asymptotic charges. The renormalization scheme works even in the presence of logarithmic anomalies.</description>

      <title>Running Coupling and Running Quark Mass Effects on the Elastic Form Factors of Nucleons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the elastic electric and magnetic form factors of the proton, neutron and the charged roper resonance ($G_E^p$, $G_M^p$, $G_E^n$, $G_M^n$, $G_E^R$ and $G_M^R$) systematically in a constituent quark model. Three ingredients are crucial in this study: i) the mixing between the pure S-wave and other components which produces a nonzero neutron electric form factor. ii) a running coupling constant that soften the form factors. iii) the running quark mass function, $M_q(p^2)$, which is responsible for the decreasing of the $\mu_p G_E^p(Q^2)/G_M^p(Q^2)$ as $Q^2$ increases. The produced elastic form factors of the proton and neutron match the corresponding observed values fairly well. Our study shows that $\mu_p G_E^p(Q^2)/G_M^p(Q^2) \approx M_q(Q^2/9)/M_q(0)$ upto $Q^2 \approx 4 \text{ GeV}^2$. We give predictions on the elastic form factors of the roper resonance, the electric charge and the magnetic momentum radius ratios of the roper resonance to the proton are $r^R_{E}/r^p_{E} \approx r^R_{M}/r^p_{M} \approx 1.5$.</description>

Abstract: A generalized Kerr-Schild ansatz for bigravity, already considered in the literature, which leads to linear interactions between the metrics is used to study the bigravity equations in the context of the double copy. By contracting the resulting spin-2 field bigravity equations of motion using Killing vector fields, as is usually carried out in general relativity, we arrive to the single and zeroth copy equations for the mentioned ansatz. For the case of stationary solutions, we obtain two Maxwell and two conformally coupled scalar field equations for the single and zeroth copies respectively, and the linear interactions are absent. In the time-dependent case we obtain equations for the fields which are coupled. By decoupling these equations and at the zeroth copy level, we recover a massless and a massive field whose mass is proportional to the Fierz-Pauli mass and depends on the coefficients of the interaction potential between the metrics. This has been also previously documented in the literature and is now reinterpreted within the context of the double copy proposal.</description>

Abstract: We evaluate the maximal Bell violation for a generic qubit-qudit system, obtaining easily computable expressions in arbitrary qudit dimension. This work generalizes the well-known Horodeckis's result for a qubit-qubit system. We also give simple lower and upper bounds on that violation and study the possibility of improving the amount of Bell-violation by embedding the qudit Hilbert space in one of larger dimension. The results are illustrated with a family of density matrices in the context of a qubit-qutrit system.</description>

      <title>Classical double copy in the black hole mini-superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a novel formulation of classical double copy in the mini-superspace of static, spherically symmetric black holes where the map between the solutions of general relativity and Maxwell's theory can be realized in Boyer-Lindsquit coordinates. By employing the reduced action principle, we show that the double copy structure can be generalized to Lovelock gravities and quasi-topological gravities. However, the gravitational solutions are mapped to the purely electric solutions of Maxwell's theory with a difference: instead of a direct match between the Kerr-Schild scalar in the gravity side and the scalar potential in the gauge theory side, the scalar potential becomes a polynomial in the Kerr-Schild scalar, giving rise to a generalization of the Kerr-Schild double copy. We calculate the Regge-Teitelboim surface charges and prove that the mass of the black hole solution is identified with the electric charge corresponding to the Coulomb part of the gauge theory solution in the same way it does in the case of general relativity.</description>
