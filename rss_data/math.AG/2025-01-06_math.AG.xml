      <title>Quantum Error Correction with Goppa Codes from Maximal Curves: Design, Simulation, and Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper characterizes Goppa codes of certain maximal curves over finite fields defined by equations of the form $y^n = x^m + x$. We investigate Algebraic Geometric and quantum stabilizer codes associated with these maximal curves and propose modifications to improve their parameters. The theoretical analysis is complemented by extensive simulation results, which validate the performance of these codes under various error rates. We provide concrete examples of the constructed codes, comparing them with known results to highlight their strengths and trade-offs. The simulation data, presented through detailed graphs and tables, offers insights into the practical behavior of these codes in noisy environments. Our findings demonstrate that while the constructed codes may not always achieve optimal minimum distances, they offer systematic construction methods and interesting parameter trade-offs that could be valuable in specific applications or for further theoretical study.</description>

      <title>$K_2$-regularity and normality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We take a fresh look at the relationship between $K$-regularity and regularity of schemes, proving two results in this direction. First, we show that $K_2$-regular affine algebras over fields of characteristic zero are normal. Second, we improve on Vorst's $K$-regularity bound in the case of local complete intersections; this is related to recent work on higher du Bois singularities.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Scheme of a Pair of Skew Lines on a Cubic Hypersurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an irreducible component $H(X)$ of the Hilbert scheme $Hilb^{2t+2}(X)$ of a smooth cubic hypersurface $X$ containing two disjoint lines. For cubic threefolds, $H(X)$ is always smooth, as shown in arXiv:2010.11622. We provide a second proof and generalize this result to higher dimensions. Specifically, for cubic hypersurfaces of dimension at least four, we show $H(X)$ is normal, and it is smooth if and only if $X$ lacks certain "higher triple lines." Using Hilbert-Chow morphism, we describe the birational geometry of $H(X)$. As an application, when $X$ is a general cubic fourfold, a natural double cover of $H(X)$ yields a smooth model extending a rational map considered by Voisin.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on plane curves related to freeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a free curve $C$ of degree $d$ with exponents $(d_1,d_2)$ there is a simple formula relating $d,d_1, d_2$ and the total Tjurina number of $C$. Our first result discusses how this result changes when the curve $C$ is no longer free. For a free line arrangement with exponents $(d_1,d_2)$, the Poincar\'e polynomial coincides with the Betti polynomial $B(t)$ and with the product $P(t)=(1+d_1t)(1+d_2t)$. Our second result shows that for any curve $C$, the difference $P(t)-B(t)$ is a polynomial $a t +bt^2$, with $a$ and $b$ non-negative integers. Moreover $a =0$ or $b=0$ if and only if $C$ is a free line arrangement. We also give a combinatorial restriction which a potential minimal counter-example to Terao's Conjecture must satisfy. Moreover, we make more precise a result by H. Schenck concerning the relation between the exponents and the maximal multiplicity of points in any line arrangement.</description>

      <title>Hypersurfaces passing through the Galois orbit of a point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asgarli, Ghioca, and Reichstein recently proved that if $K$ is a field with $|K|&gt;2$, then for any positive integers $d$ and $n$, and separable field extension $L/K$ with degree $m=\binom{n+d}{d}$, there exists a point $P\in \mathbb{P}^n(L)$ which does not lie on any degree $d$ hypersurface defined over $K$. They asked whether the result holds when $|K| = 2$. We answer their question in the affirmative by combining various ideas from arithmetic geometry. More generally, we show that for each positive integer $r$ and separable field extension $L/K$ with degree $r$, there exists a point $P \in \mathbb{P}^n(L)$ such that the vector space of degree $d$ forms over $K$ that vanish at $P$ has the expected dimension. We also discuss applications to linear systems of hypersurfaces with special properties.</description>

      <title>Computing A1-Euler numbers with Macaulay2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.01775v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use Macaulay2 for several enriched counts in GW(k). First, we compute the count of lines on a general cubic surface using Macaulay2 over Fp in GW(Fp) for p a prime number and over the rational numbers Q in GW(Q). This gives a new proof for the fact that the count of lines on a cubic surface is 3+12h in GW(k) where h denotes the hyperbolic form. Then, we compute the count of lines in P3 meeting 4 general lines, the count of lines on a quadratic surface meeting one general line and the count of singular elements in a pencil of degree d-surfaces. Finally, we provide code to compute the EKL-form and compute several A1-Milnor numbers.</description>

      <title>Goppa code and quantum stabilizer codes from plane curves given by separated polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine algebraic geometric (AG) codes associated with curves generated by separated polynomials, and we create AG codes and quantum stabilizer codes from these curves by varying their parameters. Our research involves a thorough examination of the curves' algebraic features as well as the creation of Goppa codes over them. Extending these findings, we create quantum stabilizer codes, revealing that quantum codes built from Hermitian self-orthogonal AG codes have acceptable parameters, improving the reliability and performance of communication networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conjecture that every unramified Brauer class $\alpha\in \text{Br}(X)$ on a projective hyperk\"ahler manifold $X$ satisfies $\text{ind}(\alpha)\mid\text{per}(\alpha)^{\dim(X)/2}$. We provide evidence for this conjecture by proving it for two large classes of projective hyperk\"ahler manifolds: For projective hyperk\"ahler manifolds admitting a Lagrangian fibration and for Hilbert schemes of K3 surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we will characterize the structure of the negative part of the Zariski decomposition of $K_{\cF}+D$ for a foliated surface $(X,\cF)$ associated with a $\bQ$-divisor $D$ whenever $K_{\cF}+D$ is pseudoeffective. As applications, we will study the effective behavior of the multiple linear system $|m(K_{\cF}+D)|$ for any sufficiently divisible integer $m&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>The Proper Basis for Polynomial Ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.03482v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a new type of ideal basis called the proper basis that improves both Gr\"obner basis and Buchberger's algorithm. Let $x_1$ be the least variable of a monomial ordering in a polynomial ring $K[x_1,\dotsc,x_n]$ over a field $K$. The Gr\"obner basis of a zero-dimensional polynomial ideal contains a univariate polynomial in $x_1$. The proper basis is defined and computed in the variables $\tilde{\bm{x}}:=(x_2,\dotsc,x_n)$ with $x_1$ serving as a parameter in the algebra $K[x_1][\tilde{\bm{x}}]$. Its algorithm is more efficient than not only Buchberger's algorithm whose elimination of $\tilde{\bm{x}}$ unnecessarily involves the least variable $x_1$ but also M\"oller's algorithm due to its polynomial division mechanism. This is corroborated by a series of benchmark testings herein. The proper basis is in a modular form and neater than Gr\"obner basis and hence reduces its coefficient swell problem. It is expected that all the state of the art algorithms improving Buchberger's algorithm over the last decades can be further improved if we apply them to the proper basis.</description>

      <title>Can Transformers Do Enumerative Geometry?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can Transformers model and learn enumerative geometry? What is a robust procedure for using Transformers in abductive knowledge discovery within a mathematician-machine collaboration? In this work, we introduce a Transformer-based approach to computational enumerative geometry, specifically targeting the computation of $\psi$-class intersection numbers on the moduli space of curves. By reformulating the problem as a continuous optimization task, we compute intersection numbers across a wide value range from $10^{-45}$ to $10^{45}$. To capture the recursive nature inherent in these intersection numbers, we propose the Dynamic Range Activator (DRA), a new activation function that enhances the Transformer's ability to model recursive patterns and handle severe heteroscedasticity. Given precision requirements for computing the intersections, we quantify the uncertainty of the predictions using Conformal Prediction with a dynamic sliding window adaptive to the partitions of equivalent number of marked points. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no prior work on modeling recursive functions with such a high-variance and factorial growth. Beyond simply computing intersection numbers, we explore the enumerative "world-model" of Transformers. Our interpretability analysis reveals that the network is implicitly modeling the Virasoro constraints in a purely data-driven manner. Moreover, through abductive hypothesis testing, probing, and causal inference, we uncover evidence of an emergent internal representation of the the large-genus asymptotic of $\psi$-class intersection numbers. These findings suggest that the network internalizes the parameters of the asymptotic closed-form and the polynomiality phenomenon of $\psi$-class intersection numbers in a non-linear manner.</description>
