      <title>Domain Growth in Long-range Ising Models with Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances have highlighted the rich low-temperature kinetics of the long-range Ising model (LRIM). This study investigates domain growth in an LRIM with quenched disorder, following a deep low-temperature quench. Specifically, we consider an Ising model with interactions that decay as $J(r) \sim r^{-(D+\sigma)}$, where $D$ is the spatial dimension and $\sigma &gt; 0$ is the power-law exponent. The quenched disorder is introduced via random pinning fields at each lattice site. For nearest-neighbor models, we expect that domain growth during activated dynamics is logarithmic in nature: $R(t) \sim (\ln t)^{\alpha}$, with growth exponent $\alpha &gt;0$. Here, we examine how long-range interactions influence domain growth with disorder in dimensions $D = 1$ and $D = 2$. In $D = 1$, logarithmic growth is found to persist for various $\sigma &gt; 0$. However, in $D = 2$, the dynamics is more complex due to the non-trivial interplay between extended interactions, disorder, and thermal fluctuations.</description>

      <title>System-Bath Approach to Rotational Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotational equilibrated systems are widespread, but relatively little attention has been devoted to studying them from the first principles of statistical mechanics. Here we bridge this gap, as we look at a Brownian particle coupled with a rotational thermal bath modeled via Caldeira-Leggett oscillators. We show that the Langevin equation that describes the dynamics of the Brownian particle contains (due to rotation) long-range correlated noise. In contrast to the usual situation of non-rotational equilibration, the rotational Gibbs distribution is recovered only for a weak coupling with the bath. However, the presence of a uniform magnetic field disrupts equilibrium, even under weak coupling conditions. In this context, we clarify the applicability of the Bohr-van Leeuwen theorem to classical systems in rotational equilibrium, as well as the concept of work done by a changing magnetic field. Additionally, we show that the Brownian particle under a rotationally symmetric potential reaches a stationary state that behaves as an effective equilibrium, characterized by a free energy. As a result, no work can be extracted via cyclic processes that respect the rotation symmetry. However, if the external potential exhibits asymmetry, then work extraction via slow cyclic processes is possible. This is illustrated by a general scenario, involving a slow rotation of a non-rotation-symmetric potential.</description>

      <title>Local entropy production rate of run-and-tumble particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the local entropy production rate and the local entropy flow in active systems composed of non-interacting run-and-tumble particles in a thermal bath. After providing generic time-dependend expressions, we focus on the stationary regime. Remarkably, in this regime the two entropies are equal and depend only on the distribution function and its spatial derivatives. We discuss in details two case studies, relevant to real situations. First, we analyze the case of space dependent speed,describing photokinetic bacteria, cosidering two different shapes of the speed, piecewise constant and sinusoidal. Finally, we investigate the case of external force fields, focusing on harmonic and linear potentials, which allow analytical treatment. In all investigated cases, we compare exact and approximated analytical results with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic bounds and symmetries in first-passage problems of fluctuating currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a method for deriving thermodynamic bounds for first-passage problems of currents with two boundaries. Using this method, we extend some results on first-passage times of fluctuating currents. Notably, we derive a thermodynamic bound on the rate of dissipation of a Markov process in terms of the splitting probabilities and the first-passage time statistics of a fluctuating current, which is a refinement of a previously derived inequality. We also show that the concept of effective affinity, originally developed for continuous-time Markov chains, naturally extends to discrete-time Markov chains. Furthermore, we analyse symmetries in first-passage problems of fluctuating currents with two boundaries. We show that optimal currents -- those for which the effective affinity fully accounts for the dissipation -- satisfy a symmetry property: the current's average speed to reach the positive threshold equals the current's speed to reach the negative threshold. The developed approach uses a coarse-graining procedure for the average entropy production at random times and utilises martingale methods to perform time-reversal of first-passage quantities.</description>

      <title>Kappa distributions in the language of superstatistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kappa distribution of velocities appears routinely in the study of collisionless plasmas present in Earth's magnetosphere, the solar wind among other contexts where particles are unable to reach thermal equilibrium. Originally justified through the use of Tsallis' non-extensive statistics, nowadays there are alternative frameworks that provide insight into these distributions, such as superstatistics. In this work we review the derivation of the multi-particle and single-particle kappa distributions for collisionless plasmas within the framework of superstatistics, as an alternative to the use of non-extensive statistics. We also show the utility of the superstatistical framework in the computation of expectation values under kappa distributions. Some consequences of the superstatistical formalism regarding correlations, temperature and entropy of kappa-distributed plasmas are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Domain-wall melting and entanglement in free-fermion chains with a band structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the melting of a domain wall in free-fermion chains, where the periodic variation of the hopping amplitudes gives rise to a band structure. It is shown that the entanglement grows logarithmically in time, and the prefactor is proportional to the number of filled bands in the initial state. For a dimerized chain the particle density and current are found to have the same expressions as in the homogeneous case, up to a rescaling of the velocity. The universal contribution to the entropy profile is then doubled, while the non-universal part can be extracted numerically from block-Toeplitz matrices.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniform interfaces in non-equilibrium phase coexistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that long-wavelength interfacial fluctuations are strongly suppressed in non-equilibrium phase coexistence between bulk hyperuniform systems. Using simulations of three distinct microscopic models, we demonstrate that hyperuniform interfaces are much smoother than equilibrium ones, with a universal reduction of height fluctuations at large scale. We derive a non-equilibrium interface equation from the field theory of the bulk order parameter, and predict a reduction in height fluctuations, $S_h(\boldsymbol k)\equiv \langle |h(\boldsymbol k)|^2\rangle\sim |\boldsymbol k|^{-1}$, in stark contrast to equilibrium capillary wave theory where $S_h(\boldsymbol k)\sim |\boldsymbol k|^{-2}$. Our results establish a new universality class for non-equilibrium interfaces, highlighting the fundamental role of suppressed bulk fluctuations in shaping interfacial dynamics far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Origins of Conformable Dynamics: From Disorder to Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformable derivatives have attracted increasing interest for bridging classical and fractional calculus while retaining analytical tractability. However, their physical foundations remain underexplored. In this work, we provide a systematic derivation of conformable relaxation dynamics from microscopic principles. Starting from a spatially-resolved Ginzburg-Landau framework with quenched disorder and temperature-dependent kinetic coefficients, we demonstrate how spatial heterogeneity and energy barrier distributions give rise to emergent power-law memory kernels. In the adiabatic limit, these kernels reduce to a conformable temporal structure of the form T^{1-\mu}\,d\psi/dT. The deformation parameter \mu is shown to be connected to experimentally measurable properties such as transport coefficients, disorder statistics, and relaxation time spectra. This formulation also reveals a natural link with nonextensive thermodynamics and Tsallis entropy. By unifying memory effects, anomalous relaxation, and spatial correlations under a coherent physical mechanism, our framework transforms conformable derivatives from heuristic tools into physically grounded operators suitable for modeling complex critical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of quantum oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a compact analytical approximation for the quantum partition function of systems composed of quantum oscillators. The proposed formula is general and applicable to an arbitrary number of oscillators described by a rather general class of potential energy functions (not necessarily polynomials). Starting from the exact path integral expression of the partition function, we introduce a time-dependent Gaussian approximation for the potential contribution and, then, invoke a principle of minimal sensitivity to minimize the error. This leads to a system of coupled nonlinear equations whose solution yields the optimal parameters of the gaussian approximation. The resulting approximate partition function accurately reproduces thermodynamic quantities such as the free energy, average energy, and specific heat -- even at zero temperature -- with typical errors of only a few percent. We illustrate the performance of our approximate formula with numerical results for systems of up to ten coupled anharmonic oscillators. These results are compared to "exact" numerical results obtained via Hamiltonian diagonalization for small systems and Path Integral Monte Carlo simulations for larger ones.</description>

      <title>Prethermal inverse Mpemba effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse Mpemba effect is a counterintuitive phenomenon in which a system, initially in thermal equilibrium and prepared at different temperatures below that of the final equilibrium state, relaxes to the final state more rapidly when starting from a lower initial temperature. We extend this concept to the relaxation toward a prethermal state in isolated quantum systems. By examining a simple model that exhibits prethermalization, we demonstrate that this effect indeed manifests under periodic driving. We further discuss the realization of this phenomenon in a variety of systems within a unified theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric properties of one-dimensional Markov generators with the links to Markov-dualities and to shape-invariance-exact-solvability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For diffusion process involving the force $F(x)$ and the diffusion coefficient $D(x)$, the continuity equation $\partial_t P_t(x)=- \partial_xJ_t(x)$ gives the dynamics of the probability $P_t( x)$ in terms of the current $J_t( x)=F(x)P_t(x)-D(x)\partial_x P_t(x)={\cal J}P_t( x)$ obtained from $P_t( x) $ via the application of the first-order differential current-operator ${\cal J}$. So the dynamics of the probability $P_t( x)$ is governed by the factorized Fokker-Planck generator ${\cal F}=-\partial_x{\cal J}$, while the dynamics of the current $J_t( x)$ is governed by its supersymmetric partner ${\hat {\cal F} }= - {\cal J}\partial_x$, so that their right and left eigenvectors are directly related using the two intertwining relations ${\cal J}{\cal F}=-{\cal J}\partial_x{\cal J}={\hat {\cal F}}{\cal J}$ and ${\cal F}\partial_x=-\partial_x{\cal J}\partial_x=\partial_x{\hat {\cal F} }$. We also describe the link with the factorization of the adjoint $ {\cal F}^{\dagger}=\frac{d}{dm(x)}\frac{d}{ds(x)} $ in terms of the scale function $s(x)$ and speed measure $m(x)$. We then analyze how the supersymmetric partner ${\hat {\cal F} } = - {\cal J} \partial_x$ can be re-interpreted in two ways: (1) as the adjoint ${\mathring {\cal F}}^{\dagger} ={\mathring {\cal J} }^{\dagger} \partial_x$ of the Fokker-Planck generator ${\mathring {\cal F}}=- \partial_x{\mathring {\cal J} }$ associated to the dual force ${\mathring F}(x)=-F(x)-D'(x)$, that unifies various known Markov dualities; (2) as the non-conserved Fokker-Planck generator ${\tilde {\cal F}}_{nc} = -\partial_x{\tilde {\cal J}}-{\tilde K }(x)$ involving the force ${\tilde F}(x)=F(x) +D'(x)$ and the killing rate ${\tilde K }(x)=-F'(x)-D''(x)$, with application to shape-invariance-solvability. Finally, we describe how all these ideas can be also applied to Markov jump processes with nearest-neighbors transition rates $w(x \pm 1,x)$.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium-preserving Laplacian renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion over networks has recently been used to define spatiotemporal scales and extend Kadanoff block spins of Euclidean space to supernodes of networks in the Laplacian renormalization group (LRG). Yet, its ad hoc coarse-graining procedure remains underdeveloped and unvalidated, limiting its broader applicability. Here we rigorously formulate an LRG preserving the equilibrium state, offering a principled coarse-graining procedure. We construct the renormalized Laplacian matrix preserving dominant spectral properties using a proper, quasi-complete basis transformation and the renormalized adjacency matrix preserving mean connectivity from equilibrium-state flows among supernodes. Applying recursively this equilibrium-preserving LRG to various hypergraphs, we find that in hypertrees with low spectral dimensions vertex degree and hyperedge cardinality distributions flow toward Poissonian forms, while in hypergraphs lacking a finite spectral dimension they broaden toward power-law forms when starting from Poissonian ones, revealing how informational, structural, and dynamical scale-invariances are interrelated.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent moment dynamics for networks of spiking neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel approach to moment closure problem is used to derive low dimensional laws for the dynamics of the moments of the membrane potential distribution in a population of spiking neurons. Using spectral expansion of the density equation we derive the recursive and nonlinear relation between the moments, such as the mean potential, and the population firing rates. The self-consistent dynamics found relies on the dominant eigenvalues of the evolution operator, tightly related to the moments of the single-neuron inter-spike interval distribution. Contrary to previous attempts our system can be applied both in noise- and drift-dominated regime, and both for weakly and strongly coupled population. We demonstrate the applicability of the theory for the case of a network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons deriving closed analytical expressions. Truncating the mode decomposition to the first few more relevant moments, results to effectively describe the population dynamics both out-of-equilibrium and in response to strongly-varying inputs.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-likelihood produces associative memories able to generalize, even for asymmetric couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy-based probabilistic models learned by maximizing the likelihood of the data are limited by the intractability of the partition function. A widely used workaround is to maximize the pseudo-likelihood, which replaces the global normalization with tractable local normalizations. Here we show that, in the zero-temperature limit, a network trained to maximize pseudo-likelihood naturally implements an associative memory: if the training set is small, patterns become fixed-point attractors whose basins of attraction exceed those of any classical Hopfield rule. We explain quantitatively this effect on uncorrelated random patterns. Moreover, we show that, for different structured datasets coming from computer science (random feature model, MNIST), physics (spin glasses) and biology (proteins), as the number of training examples increases the learned network goes beyond memorization, developing meaningful attractors with non-trivial correlations with test examples, thus showing the ability to generalize. Our results therefore reveal pseudo-likelihood works both as an efficient inference tool and as a principled mechanism for memory and generalization.</description>

      <title>Mass Transfer Through Vapor-Liquid Interfaces From Hydrodynamic Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We assess the capabilities of hydrodynamic density functional theory (DFT) to predict mass transfer across vapor-liquid interfaces by studying the response of an initially equilibrated pure component vapor-liquid system to the localized insertion of a second component. Hydrodynamic DFT captures the effect of interfaces on the dynamics by modeling the chemical potential gradients of an inhomogeneous system based on classical DFT. Hydrodynamic DFT effectively connects molecular models with continuum fluid dynamics. Away from interfaces the framework simplifies to the isothermal Navier-Stokes equations. We employ Maxwell-Stefan diffusion with a generalized driving force to model diffusive molecular transport in inhomogeneous systems. For the considered Lennard--Jones truncated and shifted (LJTS) fluid, we utilize a non-local Helmholtz energy functional based on the perturbed truncated and shifted (PeTS) equation of state. The model provides noise-free partial densities and fluxes for the mass transfer near the interface, as well as profiles of these quantities across the interface. A comparison with non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations shows that hydrodynamic DFT accurately predicts mass transfer across the interface, including microscopic phenomena such as the temporary enrichment and repulsion of the light boiling component at the interface. Combining generalized entropy scaling with generalized Maxwell-Stefan diffusion allows for an accurate description of diffusive molecular transport in the system. This approach can accurately predict phase behavior, equilibrium interfaces, and mass transfer across interfaces based on molecular interactions for mixtures of strongly dissimilar components. Our results suggest that hydrodynamic DFT can accurately predict the dynamics of mixtures at vapor-liquid interfaces.</description>

      <title>Quasiconservation Laws and Suppressed Transport in Weakly Interacting Localized Models</title>

Abstract: The stability of localization in the presence of interactions remains an open problem, with finite-size effects posing significant challenges to numerical studies. In this work, we investigate the perturbative stability of noninteracting localization under weak interactions, which allows us to analyze much larger system sizes. Focusing on disordered Anderson and quasiperiodic Aubry-Andr\'e models in one dimension, and using the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) at first order in perturbation theory, we compute first-order corrections to noninteracting local integrals of motion (LIOMs). We find that for at least an $O(1)$ fraction of the LIOMs, the corrections are well-controlled and converge at large system sizes, while others suffer from resonances. Additionally, we introduce and study the charge-transport capacity of this weakly interacting model. To first order, we find that the charge transport capacity remains bounded in the presence of interactions. Taken together, these results demonstrate that localization is perturbatively stable to weak interactions at first order, implying that, at the very least, localization persists for parametrically long times in the inverse interaction strength. We expect this perturbative stability to extend to all orders at sufficiently strong disorder, where the localization length is short, representing the true localized phase. Conversely, our findings suggest that the previously proposed interaction-induced avalanche instability, namely in the weakly localized regime of the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e models, is a more subtle phenomenon arising only at higher orders in perturbation theory or through nonperturbative effects.</description>

      <title>Spin-Glass Phases and Multichaos in the Ashkin-Teller Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global phase diagram of the Ashkin-Teller spin glass is calculated in d = 3 spatial dimensions by renormalization-group theory. Depending on the value of the positive or negative four-spin interaction, qualitatively different topologies are found for the spin-glass phase diagram in the usual variables of temperature and fraction of antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor interactions. Two different spin-glass phases occur. Both spin-glass phases are chaotic. One spin-glass exhibits phase reentrance that is reverse from the reentrances seen in previous spin-glass phase diagrams. Seven different phases: Ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic, entropic ferromagnetic and entropic antiferromagnetic, spin-glass and entropic spin-glass, and disordered phases occur. The entropic ferromagnetic phase unusually but understandably occurs at temperatures above one spin-glass phase. A random disorder line is identified and no phase transition occurs on this lie. Our calculation is exact on the d = 3 hierarchical lattice and Migdal-Kadanoff approximate on the cubic lattice.</description>

      <title>Latent Thermodynamic Flows: Unified Representation Learning and Generative Modeling of Temperature-Dependent Behaviors from Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate characterization of the equilibrium distributions of complex molecular systems and their dependence on environmental factors such as temperature is essential for understanding thermodynamic properties and transition mechanisms. Projecting these distributions onto meaningful low-dimensional representations enables interpretability and downstream analysis. Recent advances in generative AI, particularly flow models such as Normalizing Flows (NFs), have shown promise in modeling such distributions, but their scope is limited without tailored representation learning. In this work, we introduce Latent Thermodynamic Flows (LaTF), an end-to-end framework that tightly integrates representation learning and generative modeling. LaTF unifies the State Predictive Information Bottleneck (SPIB) with NFs to simultaneously learn low-dimensional latent representations, referred to as Collective Variables (CVs), classify metastable states, and generate equilibrium distributions across temperatures beyond the training data. The two components of representation learning and generative modeling are optimized jointly, ensuring that the learned latent features capture the system's slow, important degrees of freedom while the generative model accurately reproduces the system's equilibrium behavior. We demonstrate LaTF's effectiveness across diverse systems, including a model potential, the Chignolin protein, and cluster of Lennard Jones particles, with thorough evaluations and benchmarking using multiple metrics and extensive simulations. Finally, we apply LaTF to a RNA tetraloop system, where despite using simulation data from only two temperatures, LaTF reconstructs the temperature-dependent structural ensemble and melting behavior, consistent with experimental and prior extensive computational results.</description>

      <title>Brownian motion near a soft surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brownian motion near soft surfaces is a situation widely encountered in nanoscale and biological physics. However, a complete theoretical description is lacking to date. Here, we theoretically investigate the dynamics of a two-dimensional colloid in an arbitrary external potential and near a soft surface. The latter is minimally modelled by a Winkler's foundation, and we restrict the study to the colloidal motion in the direction perpendicular to the surface. We start from deterministic hydrodynamic considerations, by invoking the already-established leading-order soft-lubrication forces acting on the particle. Importantly, a negative softness-induced and position-dependent added mass is identified. We then incorporate thermal fluctuations in the description. In particular, an effective Hamiltonian formulation is introduced and a temperature-dependent generalized potential is constructed in order to ensure equilibrium properties for the colloidal position. From these considerations and the Fokker-Planck equation, we then derive the relevant Langevin equation, which self-consistently allows to recover the deterministic equation of motion at zero temperature. Interestingly, besides an expected multiplicative-noise feature, the noise correlator appears to be modified by the surface softness. Moreover, a softness-induced temperature-dependent spurious drift term has to be incorporated within the Ito prescription. Finally, using numerical simulations with various initial conditions and parameter values, we statistically analyze the trajectories of the particle when placed within a harmonic trap and in presence of the soft surface. This allows us to: i) quantify further the influence of surface softness, through the added mass, which enhances the velocity fluctuations; and ii) show that intermediate-time diffusion is unaffected by softness, within the assumptions of the model.</description>

      <title>An alternative approach to the phonon theory of liquids: An analytical study of Frenkel frequency and heat capacity as a function of pressure and temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the Maxwell relationship and experimental viscosity data, the phonon theory of liquids can provide a temperature-dependent description of liquid heat capacity that is consistent with experimental data. However, since liquid heat capacity also varies with pressure, we present an alternative approach that can be used to calculate the Frenkel frequency in terms of temperature and pressure by applying the concept of chemical potential under the assumption of a diffusive equilibrium. Using this derived Frenkel frequency, we formulate an analytical expression for the liquid heat capacity in terms of both temperature and pressure, without the need for viscosity data, which is consistent with predictions from the phonon theory of liquids. Our model is tested by comparing the calculated heat liquid capacity with experimental data for four noble liquids at various pressures and temperatures, and good agreement is found. Finally, based on our findings, we propose analytical expressions for the Frenkel line and viscosity as a function of pressure and temperature, and discuss the key details and implications of our approach.</description>

Abstract: We give some results relating asymptotic characterisations of maximum entropy probability measures to characterisations of Bayes optimal classifiers. Our main theorems show that maximum entropy is a universally Bayes optimal decision rule given constraints on one's knowledge about some observed data in terms of an expected loss. We will extend this result to the case of uncertainty in the observations of expected losses by generalising Sanov's theorem to distributions of constraint values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study measurement-induced phase transitions in quantum circuits consisting of kicked Ising models with postselected weak measurements, whose dynamics can be mapped onto a classical dynamical system. For a periodic (Floquet) non-unitary evolution, such circuits are exactly tractable and admit volume-to-area law transitions. We show that breaking time-translation symmetry down to a quasiperiodic (Fibonacci) time evolution leads to the emergence of a critical phase with tunable effective central charge and with a fractal origin. Furthermore, for some classes of random non-unitary circuits, we demonstrate the robustness of the volume-to-area law phase transition for arbitrary random realizations, thanks to the emergent compactness of the classical map encoding the circuit's dynamics.</description>

      <title>Topological defects govern plasticity and shear band formation in two-dimensional amorphous solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the fundamental mechanisms behind plastic instabilities and shear band formation in amorphous media under applied deformation remains a long-standing challenge. Leveraging on the mathematical concept of topology, we revisit this problem using two-dimensional experimental amorphous granular packings subjected to pure shear. We demonstrate that topological defects (TDs) in the displacement vector field act as carriers of plasticity, enabling the prediction of both the onset of plastic flow and the global mechanical response of the system. At the microscopic level, we show that these TDs are responsible for the dynamical breakdown of local orientational order, thereby linking topological excitations to short-range structural changes. Finally, we establish that the spatial localization and cooperative alignment of TDs underlie the formation of macroscopic shear bands, which drive plastic flow under large shear loads. This process is mediated by the quasi-periodic annihilation of large defect clusters and their geometric transformation from an approximately isotropic to a strongly anisotropic shape. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding plastic deformation and shear band formation in two-dimensional amorphous systems by connecting topology, short-range order, and mechanical response.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding mechanisms of rare but important events in complex molecular systems, such as protein folding or ligand (un)binding, requires accurately mapping transition paths from an initial to a final state. The committor is the ideal reaction coordinate for this purpose, but calculating it for high-dimensional, nonlinear systems has long been considered intractable. Here, we introduce an iterative path sampling strategy for computing the committor function for systems with high free energy barriers. We start with an initial guess to define isocommittor interfaces for transition interface sampling. The resulting path ensemble is then reweighted and used to train a neural network, yielding a more accurate committor model. This process is repeated until convergence, effectively solving the long-standing circular problem in enhanced sampling where a good reaction coordinate is needed to generate efficient sampling, and vice-versa. The final, converged committor model can be interrogated to extract mechanistic insights. We demonstrate the power of our method on a benchmark 2D potential and a more complex host-guest (un)binding process in explicit solvent.</description>

      <title>Model selection for stochastic dynamics: a parsimonious and principled approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis focuses on the discovery of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) from noisy and discrete time series. A major challenge is selecting the simplest possible correct model from vast libraries of candidate models, where standard information criteria (AIC, BIC) are often limited.
  We introduce PASTIS (Parsimonious Stochastic Inference), a new information criterion derived from extreme value theory. Its penalty term, $n_\mathcal{B} \ln(n_0/p)$, explicitly incorporates the size of the initial library of candidate parameters ($n_0$), the number of parameters in the considered model ($n_\mathcal{B}$), and a significance threshold ($p$). This significance threshold represents the probability of selecting a model containing more parameters than necessary when comparing many models.
  Benchmarks on various systems (Lorenz, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, Lotka-Volterra for SDEs; Gray-Scott for SPDEs) demonstrate that PASTIS outperforms AIC, BIC, cross-validation (CV), and SINDy (a competing method) in terms of exact model identification and predictive capability.
  Furthermore, real-world data can be subject to large sampling intervals ($\Delta t$) or measurement noise ($\sigma$), which can impair model learning and selection capabilities. To address this, we have developed robust variants of PASTIS, PASTIS-$\Delta t$ and PASTIS-$\sigma$, thus extending the applicability of the approach to imperfect experimental data.
  PASTIS thus provides a statistically grounded, validated, and practical methodological framework for discovering simple models for processes with stochastic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Coexistent multifractal mesoscopic fluctuations in Integer Quantum Hall Transition and in Orbital Hall Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the integer quantum Hall transition in a disordered nanowire with orbital momentum-space texture connected to four terminals is accompanied by an orbital Hall transition. We applied a multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis and found that both conductance fluctuations in the integer quantum Hall transition (IQHT) and orbital-conductance fluctuations in the orbital Hall transition (OHT) display multifractal behavior. We argue that this multifractality is primarily related to disorder, which gives rise to the strong fluctuations that are fingerprints of IQHT and OHT, but is also a consequence of the fact that the nanowire has finite size, which causes a weakening of the multifractality in a certain range of values of disorder strength followed by a new regime of increasing multifractality with increasing disorder strength. Furthermore, our findings indicate that OHT can bring novel insights to future IQHT analysis.</description>

      <title>Universal shape-dependence of quantum entanglement in disordered magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disordered quantum magnets are not only experimentally relevant, but offer efficient computational methodologies to calculate the low energy states as well as various measures of quantum correlations. Here, we present a systematic analysis of quantum entanglement in the paradigmatic random transverse-field Ising model in two dimensions, using an efficient implementation of the asymptotically exact strong disorder renormalization group method. The phase diagram is known to be governed by three distinct infinitely disordered fixed points (IDFPs) that we study here. For square subsystems, it has been recently established that quantum entanglement has a universal logarithmic correction due to the corners of the subsystem at all three IDFPs. This corner contribution has been proposed as an "entanglement susceptibility", a useful tool to locate the phase transition and to measure the correlation length critical exponent. Towards a deeper understanding, we quantify how the corner contribution depends on the shape of the subsystem. While the corner contribution remains universal, the shape-dependence is qualitatively different in each universality class, also confirmed by line segment subsystems, a special case of skeletal entanglement. Therefore, unlike in conformally invariant systems, in general different subsystem shapes are versatile probes to unveil new universal information on the phase transitions in disordered quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The XY spin chain is a paradigmatic example of a model solved by free fermions, in which the energy eigenspectrum is built from combinations of quasi-energies. In this article we show that by extending the XY model's anisotropy parameter $\lambda$ to complex values, it is possible for two of the quasi-energies to become degenerate. In the non-Hermitian XY model these quasi-energy degeneracies give rise to exceptional points (EPs) where two of the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors coalesce. The distinct $\lambda$ values at which EPs appear form concentric rings in the complex plane which are shown in the infinite system size limit to converge to the unit circle coinciding with the boundary between distinct topological phases. The non-Hermitian model is also seen to possess a line of broken $PT$ symmetry along the pure imaginary $\lambda$-axis. For finite systems, there are four EP values on this broken $PT$-symmetric line if the system size is a multiple of 4.</description>

      <title>Numerical search for states with constant enstrophy flux over finite time intervals in two-dimensional turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An ensemble model of turbulence based on states with constant flux in wavenumber space was proposed in [K. Yoshida, Phys. Rev. E, 106, 045106 (2022)]. The justification of this ensemble model relies on the conjecture that almost all states with constant flux correspond to turbulence states. To verify this conjecture, a numerical search for states with constant enstrophy flux in wavenumber space over finite time intervals in two-dimension turbulence is conducted using a Monte Carlo method. Properties of the obtained states, such as energy spectrum and spectra related to fourth-order moments, are examined and compared with those of turbulence states obtained from direct numerical simulations. The dependence of the obtained states on the time interval and the initial conditions used in the numerical search is also discussed.</description>

      <title>What is emergence, after all?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The term emergence is increasingly used across scientific disciplines to describe phenomena that arise from interactions among a system's components but cannot be readily inferred by examining those components in isolation. While often invoked to explain higher-level behaviors, such as flocking, synchronization, or collective intelligence, the term is frequently used without precision, sometimes giving rise to ambiguity or even mystique. In this perspective paper, we clarify the scientific meaning of emergence as a measurable, physically grounded phenomenon. Through concrete examples, such as temperature, magnetism, and herd immunity in social networks, we review how collective behavior can arise from local interactions that are constrained by global boundaries. By disentangling emergence from vague overuse, we emphasize its role as a rigorous tool for understanding complex systems. Our goal is to show that emergence, when properly framed, offers not mysticism but insight.</description>

      <title>Work and entropy of mixing in isolated quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mixing of two different gases is one of the most common natural phenomena, with applications ranging from CO$_2$ capture to water purification. Traditionally, mixing is analyzed in the context of local thermal equilibrium, where systems exchange energy with a heat bath. Here, we study mixing in an isolated system with potentially non-equilibrium initial states, characterized solely by macroscopic observables. We identify the entropy of mixing as a special case of observational entropy within an observer-dependent framework, where both entropy and extractable work depend on the resolution of measurement. This approach naturally resolves the Gibbs mixing paradox in quantum systems: while an observer experiences a discontinuous increase in entropy upon learning of the existence of two particle types, this knowledge does not provide an advantage in work extraction if the types of particles remain operationally indistinguishable in their measurements. Finally, we derive a Landauer-like bound on the difference in energy extracted by two observers, where an "observational temperature" emerges, determined by the accessible information. These results provide a foundation for rigorously determining the energy required to unmix in non-equilibrium settings and extend beyond quantum systems, offering insights into the thermodynamics of isolated classical gases.</description>

      <title>Intuitive dissection of the Gaussian information bottleneck method with an application to optimal prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient signal representation is essential for the functioning of living and artificial systems operating under resource constraints. A widely recognized framework for deriving such representations is the information bottleneck method, which yields the optimal strategy for encoding a random variable, such as the signal, in a way that preserves maximal information about a functionally relevant variable, subject to an explicit constraint on the amount of information encoded. While in its general formulation the method is numerical, it admits an analytical solution in an important special case where the variables involved are jointly Gaussian. In this setting, the solution predicts discrete transitions in the dimensionality of the optimal representation as the encoding capacity is increased. Although these signature transitions, along with other features of the optimal strategy, can be derived from a constrained optimization problem, a clear and intuitive understanding of their emergence is still lacking. In our work, we advance our understanding of the Gaussian information bottleneck method through multiple mutually enriching perspectives, including geometric and information-theoretic ones. These perspectives offer novel intuition about the set of optimal encoding directions, the nature of the critical points where the optimal number of encoding components changes, and about the way the optimal strategy navigates between these critical points. We then apply our treatment of the method to a previously studied signal prediction problem, obtaining new insights on how different features of the signal are encoded across multiple components to enable optimal prediction of future signals. Altogether, our work deepens the foundational understanding of the information bottleneck method in the Gaussian setting, motivating the exploration of analogous perspectives in broader, non-Gaussian contexts.</description>

      <title>Circuit complexity and functionality: a thermodynamic perspective</title>

Abstract: Circuit complexity, defined as the minimum circuit size required for implementing a particular Boolean computation, is a foundational concept in computer science. Determining circuit complexity is believed to be a hard computational problem [1,2,3]. Recently, in the context of black holes, circuit complexity has been promoted to a physical property, wherein the growth of complexity is reflected in the time evolution of the Einstein-Rosen bridge (``wormhole'') connecting the two sides of an AdS ``eternal'' black hole [4]. Here we are motivated by an independent set of considerations and explore links between complexity and thermodynamics for functionally-equivalent circuits, making the physics-inspired approach relevant to real computational problems, for which functionality is the key element of interest. In particular, our thermodynamic framework provides a new perspective on the obfuscation of programs of arbitrary length -- an important problem in cryptography -- as thermalization through recursive mixing of neighboring sections of a circuit, which can be viewed as the mixing of two containers with ``gases of gates''. This recursive process equilibrates the average complexity and leads to the saturation of the circuit entropy, while preserving functionality of the overall circuit. The thermodynamic arguments hinge on ergodicity in the space of circuits which we conjecture is limited to disconnected ergodic sectors due to fragmentation. The notion of fragmentation has important implications for the problem of circuit obfuscation as it implies that there are circuits of same size and functionality that cannot be connected via a polynomial number of local moves. Furthermore, we argue that fragmentation is unavoidable unless the complexity classes NP and coNP coincide.</description>

Abstract: As a fundamental thermodynamic principle, speed limits reveal the lower bound of entropy production (EP) required for a system to transition from a given initial state to a final state. While various speed limits have been developed for continuous-time Markov processes, their application to discrete-time Markov chains remains unexplored. In this study, we investigate the speed limits in discrete-time Markov chains, focusing on two types of EP commonly used to measure the irreversibility of a discrete-time process: time-reversed EP and time-backward EP. We find that time-reversed EP satisfies the speed limit for the continuous-time Markov processes, whereas time-backward EP does not. Additionally, for time-reversed EP, we derive practical speed limits applicable to systems driven by cyclic protocols or with unidirectional transitions, where conventional speed limits become meaningless or invalid. We show that these relations also hold for continuous-time Markov processes by taking the time-continuum limit of our results. Finally, we validate our findings through several examples.</description>

      <title>The Basins of Attraction of Soft Sphere Packings Are Not Fractal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The energy landscape plays a central role in understanding the dynamics of low-temperature and athermal systems, which are characterized by a plethora of minima and the intricate geometry of their basins of attraction. Due to their complexity, these landscapes resist analytical treatment and must instead be studied numerically. We focus on jammed soft spheres, a paradigmatic model of glasses and granulars, to expose the limitations of standard numerical methods in resolving the true structure of energy landscapes. We show that CVODE is the ODE solver with the best time-for-error trade-off, outperforming commonly used steepest-descent solvers by several orders of magnitude. Using this numerical approach, we provide unequivocal evidence that optimizers widely used in computational studies of soft sphere packings destroy all semblance of the true landscape geometry, even in moderately low dimensions. Employing a range of geometric indicators, both low- and high-dimensional, we show that earlier claims on the fractality of basins of attraction originated from the use of inadequate mapping strategies. In reality, the basins of attraction of soft sphere packings are smooth structures with well-defined length scales.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Quantum States and Universal Correlations in a Disorder-Order Interface Propagating over a 1D Ground State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10645v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider translationally invariant quantum spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chains with local interactions and a discrete symmetry that is spontaneously broken at zero temperature. We envision experimenters switching off the couplings between two parts of the system and preparing them in independent equilibrium states. One side of the chain is prepared in a disordered phase, and the other in a symmetry-breaking ground state. When the couplings are switched back on, time evolution ensues. We argue that in integrable systems the front separating the ordered region recedes at the maximal velocity of quasiparticle excitations over the ground state. We infer that, generically, the order parameters should vary on a subdiffusive scale of order $t^{1/3}$, where $t$ is time, and their fluctuations should exhibit the same scaling. This interfacial region exhibits full range correlations, indicating that it cannot be decomposed into nearly uncorrelated subsystems. Using the transverse-field Ising chain as a case study, we demonstrate that all order parameters follow the same universal scaling functions. Through an analysis of the skew information, we uncover that the breakdown of cluster decomposition has a quantum contribution: each subsystem within the interfacial region, with extent comparable to the region, exists in a macroscopic quantum state.</description>

      <title>The transition from homeostasis to stochasticity induced catastrophe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What are the signatures of the onset of catastrophe? Here we present the rich system physics characterizing the transition from homeostasis to stochasticity driven breakdown in an experimentally motivated minimal model. Recent high-precision experiments on individual bacterial cells, growing and dividing repeatedly in a variety of environments, have revealed a previously unknown intergenerational scaling law which not only uniquely determines the stochastic map governing homeostasis, but also, as we show here, offers quantitative insights into the transition from the "conspiracy principle" regime (homeostasis) to the "catastrophe principle" regime and then to system breakdown. In fact, upon closer examination, the stochastic map turns out to be a one-dimensional Kesten process; these transitions occur as a single parameter, the strength of the multiplicative noise term, is continuously tuned. Emergence of asymptotically scale invariant distributions with quantifiable power law tails, outlier driven extremal behavior and reverse monotonicity of the conditional exceedance distribution characterize this transition to catastrophe. In turn, prevention of rapid increase in the extremal event-driven rate of failure, in the interest of system preservation, causes the catastrophe regime to be strategically unfavorable.</description>

Abstract: Smart active matter has the ability to control its motion guided by individual policies to achieve collective goals. We introduce a theoretical framework to study a decentralized learning process in which agents can locally exchange policies to adapt their behavior and maximize a predefined reward function. We use our formalism to derive explicit hydrodynamic equations for the policy dynamics. We apply the theory to two different microscopic models where policies correspond either to fixed parameters similar to evolutionary dynamics, or to state-dependent controllers known from the field of robotics. We find good agreement between theoretical predictions and agent-based simulations. By deriving fundamental control parameters and uncertainty relations, our work lays the foundations for a statistical physics analysis of decentralized learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report new results on classical nonrelativistic dipole conserving particles - fractons. These have been previously shown to exhibit "Machian" dynamics where the motion of one particle requires the presence of others in its proximity, such that dynamics produces ergodicity breaking steady states characterized by clusters. In this work, we show that although the global state breaks ergodicity, a limited version of ergodic behavior is retained within the clusters which may or may not be chaotic, depending on the nature of the microscopic Hamiltonian. In certain cases, we show that the dynamics can be mapped to that of a billiards particle in various stadiums. We also show that the many-fracton trajectories characteristically exhibit a central time or "Janus point" and thus a generic nonequilibrium bidirectional arrow of time.</description>

      <title>A Microcanonical Inflection Point Analysis via Parametric Curves and its Relation to the Zeros of the Partition Function</title>

Abstract: In statistical physics, phase transitions are arguably among the most extensively studied phenomena. In the computational approach to this field, the development of algorithms capable of estimating entropy across the entire energy spectrum in a single execution has highlighted the efficacy of microcanonical inflection point analysis, while Fisher's zeros technique has re-emerged as a powerful methodology for investigating these phenomena.
  This paper presents an alternative protocol for analyzing phase transitions using a parametrization of the entropy function in the microcanonical ensemble. We also provide a clear demonstration of the relation of the linear pattern of the Fisher's zeros on the complex inverse temperature map (a circle in the complex $x=e^{-\beta \varepsilon}$ map) with the order of the transition, showing that the latent heat is inversely related to the distance between the zeros. We study various model systems, including the Lennard-Jones cluster, the Ising, the XY, and the Zeeman models. By examining the behavior of thermodynamic quantities such as entropy and its derivatives in the microcanonical ensemble, we identify key features-such as loops and discontinuities in parametric curves-which signal phase transitions' presence and nature. This approach can facilitate the classification of phase transitions across various physical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All digital devices have components that implement Boolean functions, mapping that component's input to its output. However, any fixed Boolean function can be implemented by an infinite number of circuits, all of which vary in their resource costs. This has given rise to the field of circuit complexity theory, which studies the minimal resource cost to implement a given Boolean function with any circuit. Traditionally, circuit complexity theory has focused on the resource costs of a circuit's size (its number of gates) and depth (the longest path length from the circuit's input to its output). In this paper, we extend circuit complexity theory by investigating the minimal thermodynamic cost of a circuit's operation. We do this by using the mismatch cost (MMC) of a given circuit that is run multiple times in a row to calculate a lower bound on the entropy production (EP) incurred in each such run. Specifically, we discuss conditions under which MMC of a circuit is proportional to the size of a circuit, and conditions for them to diverge. We also use our results to compare the thermodynamic costs of different circuit families implementing the same family of Boolean functions. In addition we analyze how heterogeneity in the underlying physical processes implementing the gates in a circuit influences the minimal thermodynamic cost of the overall circuit. These and other results of ours lay the foundation for extending circuit complexity theory to include mismatch cost as a resource cost.</description>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement, crucial for understanding quantum many-body systems and quantum gravity, is commonly assessed through various measures such as von Neumann entropy, mutual information, and entanglement contour, each with its inherent advantages and limitations. In this work, we introduce the hyperfine structure of entanglement, which decomposes entanglement contours known as the fine structure into particle-number cumulants. This measure exhibits a set of universal properties with its significance in quantum information science. We apply it across diverse contexts: in Fermi gases, establishing connections to mutual information and interacting conformal field theory; in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence, unveiling finer subregion-subregion duality; and in Chern insulators, distinguishing between different quantum phases, especially topological gapped state and trivial gapped state. Our findings suggest experimental accessibility, offering fresh insights into quantum entanglement across physical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stabilizer codes lie at the heart of modern quantum-error-correcting codes (QECC). Of particular importance is a class called Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes, which includes many important examples such as toric codes, color codes, and fractons. Recent studies have revealed that the decoding transition for these QECCs could be intrinsically captured by calculating information-theoretic quantities from the mixed state. Here we perform a simple analytic calculation of the coherent information for general CSS codes under local incoherent Pauli errors via diagonalization of the density matrices and mapping to classical statistical mechanical (SM) models. Our result establishes a rigorous connection between the decoding transition of the quantum code and the phase transition in the random classical SM model. It is also directly confirmed for CSS codes that exact error correction is possible if and only if the maximum-likelihood (ML) decoder always succeeds in the thermodynamic limit. Thus, the fundamental threshold is saturated by the optimal decoder.</description>

      <title>Analytical Solution of the Nonlinear Relativistic Boltzmann Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an exact analytical solution to the nonlinear relativistic Boltzmann equation for a homogeneous, anisotropically scattering massless gas. Utilizing a BKW-like trial solution, we cast the Boltzmann equation into a set of nonlinear coupled equations for scalar moments, based on which the analytical solution is derived. One remarkable feature of our analytical solution lies in the nontrivial scattering angle dependence. We also show that this analytical solution admits a stable fixed point corresponding to the equilibrium solution as long as the parameters are physically feasible. Furthermore, a clear correspondence between our solution and the BKW solution pertaining to nonrelativistic Maxwell molecules is established, thereby clarifying the non-existence of a BKW-type solution in the relativistic domain for massive particles.</description>

      <title>Thermal Quench Dynamics of Visons in Gapless Kitaev Spin Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relaxation dynamics of the Kitaev honeycomb model under a thermal quench is dominated by the quasi-stochastic diffusion and pair annihilation of visions, which are gapped flux excitations of an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field of the Kitaev spin liquid. Both the diffusion energy barrier as well as the effective interactions between visons are mediated by the Majorana fermions which are fractionalized quasiparticles of the spin liquid. Through extensive kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the interplay between the thermal diffusion and nonlocal multi-vision interactions leads to a variety of temperature-dependent dynamical behaviors ranging from diffusion-limited and terminal-velocity-limited annihilation to dynamical arresting and freezing. Notably, we show that the freezing phenomenon is intimately related to the formation of metastable $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ vison crystals and a hidden coarsening of super-clusters associated with a broken $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnets from higher $SU(N)$ representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general formalism for deriving the thermodynamics of ferromagnets consisting of "atoms" carrying an arbitrary irreducible representation of $SU(N)$ and coupled through long-range two-body quadratic interactions. Using this formalism, we derive the thermodynamics and phase structure of ferromagnets with atoms in the doubly symmetric or doubly antisymmetric irreducible representations. The symmetric representation leads to a paramagnetic and a ferromagnetic phase with transitions similar to the ones for the fundamental representation studied before. The antisymmetric representation presents qualitatively new features, leading to a paramagnetic and two distinct ferromagnetic phases that can coexist over a range of temperatures, two of them becoming metastable. Our results are relevant to magnetic systems of atoms with reduced symmetry in their interactions compared to the fundamental case.</description>

      <title>Correlations and Krylov spread for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian: Ising chain with a complex-valued transverse magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Krylov complexity measures the spread of an evolved state in a natural basis, induced by the generator of the dynamics and the initial state. Here, we study the spread in Hilbert space of the state of an Ising chain subject to a complex-valued transverse magnetic field, initialized in a trivial product state with all spins pointing down. We demonstrate that Krylov spread reveals structural features of many-body systems that remain hidden in correlation functions that are traditionally employed to determine the phase diagram. When the imaginary part of the spectrum of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is gapped, the system state asymptotically approaches the non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum for this Hamiltonian. We find that the spread of this evolution unravels three different dynamical phases based on how the spread reaches its infinite-time value. Furthermore, we establish a connection between the Krylov spread and the static correlation function for the z-components of spins in the underlying non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum, providing a full analytical characterization of correlations across the phase diagram. Specifically, for a gapped imaginary spectrum in a finite magnetic field, we find that the correlation function exhibits an oscillatory behavior that decays exponentially in space. Conversely, for a gapless imaginary spectrum, the correlation function displays an oscillatory behavior with an amplitude that decays algebraically in space; the underlying power law depends on the manifestation of two exceptional points within this phase.</description>

      <title>Spin-$s$ $Q$-systems: Twist and Open Boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In integrable spin chains, the spectral problem can be solved by the method of Bethe ansatz, which transforms the problem of diagonalization of the Hamiltonian into the problem of solving a set of algebraic equations named Bethe equations. In this work, we systematically investigate the spin-$s$ XXX chain with twisted and open boundary conditions using the rational $Q$-system, which is a powerful tool to solve Bethe equations. We establish basic frameworks of the rational $Q$-system and confirm its completeness numerically in both cases. For twisted boundaries, we investigate the polynomiality conditions of the rational $Q$-system and derive physical conditions for singular solutions of Bethe equations. For open boundaries, we uncover novel phenomena such as hidden symmetries and magnetic strings under specific boundary parameters. Hidden symmetries lead to the appearance of extra degeneracies in the Hilbert space, while the magnetic string is a novel type of exact string configuration, whose length depends on the boundary magnetic fields. These findings, supported by both analytical and numerical evidences, offer new insights into the interplay between symmetries and boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Inertia-induced power-law scaling in martensites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Martensites subjected to quasistatic deformation are known to exhibit power law distributed acoustic emission in a broad range of scales, however, the origin of the observed scaling behavior and the mechanism of self-organization towards apparent criticality remains obscure. Here we argue that the power law structure of intermittent fluctuations can be at least partially interpreted as an effect of inertia. We build on the insight that inertial dynamics, evidenced by acoustic emission, can become an important factor if the underlying mechanical system is only marginally stable. We first illustrate the possibility of inertia-induced \textit{heavy-tailed} avalanche size distributions using a prototypical example of a discrete chain with bi-stable springs. We then explore the effects of inertia in fully realistic two- and three-dimensional continuum models of elastic phase transitions. In particular, we demonstrate that a three-dimensional model can produce not only qualitative but also quantitative agreement with experiment.</description>

      <title>Finding the right path: statistical mechanics of connected solutions in constraint satisfaction problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and study a statistical mechanics ensemble that characterizes connected solutions in constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Built around a well-known local entropy bias, it allows us to better identify hardness transitions in problems where the energy landscape is dominated by isolated solutions. We apply this new device to the symmetric binary perceptron model (SBP), and study how its manifold of connected solutions behaves. We choose this particular problem because, while its typical solutions are isolated, it can be solved using local algorithms for a certain range of constraint density $\alpha$ and threshold $\kappa$. With this new ensemble, we unveil the presence of a cluster composed of delocalized connected solutions. In particular, we demonstrate its stability until a critical threshold $\kappa^{\rm no-mem}_{\rm loc.\, stab.}$ (dependent on $\alpha$). This transition appears as paths of solutions shatter, a phenomenon that more conventional statistical mechanics approaches fail to grasp. Finally, we compared our predictions to simulations. For this, we used a modified Monte-Carlo algorithm, designed specifically to target these delocalized solutions. We obtained, as predicted, that the algorithm finds solutions until $\kappa\approx\kappa^{\rm no-mem}_{\rm loc.\, stab.}$.</description>

      <title>{\guillemotleft}Anticommuting{\guillemotright} $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a class of lattice $S=\frac{1}{2}$ quantum Hamiltonians with bond-dependent Ising couplings and a mutually {\guillemotleft}anticommuting{\guillemotright} algebra of extensively many local $\mathbb{Z}_2$ conserved charges that was explicated in [arXiv:2407.06236]. This mutual algebra is reminiscent of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Pauli matrix algebra but encoded in the structure of \emph{local conserved charges}. These models have finite residual entropy density in the ground state with a simple but non-trivial degeneracy counting and concomitant quantum spin liquidity as proved in [arXiv:2407.06236]. The spin liquidity relies on a geometrically site-interlinked character of the local conserved $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges that is rather natural in presence of an {\guillemotleft}anticommuting{\guillemotright} structure, as opposed to for example the bond-interlinked character of the local conserved $\mathbb{Z}_2$ hexagonal plaquette charges of the Kitaev honeycomb spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ model which leads to a mutually commuting local algebra.
  In this work, we make several exact statements on the many-body order that can be present within the class of {\guillemotleft}anticommuting{\guillemotright} quantum spin liquids. We elucidate the differences between the many-body order in these models and that found in some gapped quantum spin liquids with mutually commuting local algebras, e.g. the Kitaev toric code or Levin-Wen models. We also point out a mutually commuting algebra with local support that are naturally expressed as multi-linear Majorana forms in the Kitaev representation of these quantum spin liquids. They capture non-trivial quantum resonances throughout the lattice in these {\guillemotleft}anticommuting{\guillemotright} $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Chord Intertwiner, Multiple Shocks and Switchback in Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the bulk Hilbert space interpretation of chords in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model and introduce a notion of intertwiner that constructs bulk states from states with fixed boundary conditions. This leads to an isometric map that factorizes the one-particle bulk Hilbert space into a tensor product of two boundary Hilbert spaces without particle insertion. The map enables a systematic derivation of a family of correlation functions with arbitrary finite amount of matter insertions, relevant for capturing the switchback effect-a feature of holographic complexity. We further develop a path integral framework that describes multiple shockwave configurations in the semiclassical limit. For the two-body scattering processes in semi-classical regime, we show it exhibits sub-maximal chaos at finite temperature, consistent with the scramblon dynamics associated with the "fake disk" geometry. The effective "fake temperature" governing this behavior emerges from the semiclassical limit of the quantum $6 j$-symbol associated with the out-of-time-order correlator. We further analyze multi-shockwave configurations and derive precise conditions under which the switchback effect is realized, both in terms of the total chord number and the Krylov complexity of precursor operators. Our results clarify the structure of correlation functions with multiple operator insertions, their bulk interpretation in terms of shockwave geometries in the semiclassical regime, and provide a microscopic derivation of the switchback effect in the DSSYK model.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Sectors in Chord Space and Relational Holography in the DSSYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can there be multiple bulk theories for the same boundary theory? We answer this affirmatively in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model using the tools of constrained systems. We find different symmetry sectors generated by specific constraints within the chord Hilbert space of the DSSYK with matter. Each sector corresponds to a different bulk description. These include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (as a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy chord) used in de Sitter holography. We derive the partition functions and thermal correlation functions in the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems from the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.</description>

      <title>Neural models of multiscale systems: conceptual limitations, stochastic parametrizations, and a climate application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work explores key conceptual limitations in data-driven modeling of multiscale dynamical systems, focusing on neural emulators and stochastic climate modeling. A skillful climate model should capture both stationary statistics and responses to external perturbations. While current autoregressive neural models often reproduce the former, they typically struggle with the latter. We begin by analyzing a low-dimensional dynamical system to expose, by analogy, fundamental limitations that persist in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we construct neural stochastic models under two scenarios: one where the full state vector is observed, and another with only partial observations (i.e. a subset of variables). In the first case, the models accurately capture both equilibrium statistics and forced responses in ensemble mean and variance. In the more realistic case of partial observations, two key challenges emerge: (i) identifying the \textit{proper} variables to model, and (ii) parameterizing the influence of unobserved degrees of freedom. These issues are not specific to neural networks but reflect fundamental limitations of data-driven modeling and the need to target the slow dynamics of the system. We argue that physically grounded strategies -- such as coarse-graining and stochastic parameterizations -- are critical, both conceptually and practically, for the skillful emulation of complex systems like the coupled climate system. Building on these insights, we turn to a more realistic application: a stochastic reduced neural model of the sea surface temperature field and the net radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere, assessing its stationary statistics, response to temperature forcing, and interpretability.</description>

      <title>A unifying approach to self-organizing systems interacting via conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a unified framework for embedding and analyzing dynamical systems using generalized projection operators rooted in local conservation laws. By representing physical, biological, and engineered systems as graphs with incidence and cycle matrices, we derive dual projection operators that decompose network fluxes and potentials. This formalism aligns with principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and captures a broad class of systems governed by flux-forcing relationships and local constraints. We extend this approach to collective dynamics through the PRojective Embedding of Dynamical Systems (PrEDS), which lifts low-dimensional dynamics into a high-dimensional space, enabling both replication and recovery of the original dynamics. When systems fall within the PrEDS class, their collective behavior can be effectively approximated through projection onto a mean-field space. We demonstrate the versatility of PrEDS across diverse domains, including resistive and memristive circuits, adaptive flow networks (e.g., slime molds), elastic string networks, and particle swarms. Notably, we establish a direct correspondence between PrEDS and swarm dynamics, revealing new insights into optimization and self-organization. Our results offer a general theoretical foundation for analyzing complex networked systems and for designing systems that self-organize through local interactions.</description>
