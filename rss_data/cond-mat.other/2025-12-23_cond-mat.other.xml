      <title>Berry phase polarization and orbital magnetization responses of insulators: Formulas for generalized polarizabilities and their application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Condensed matter physics is often concerned with determining the response of a solid to an external stimulus. This paper revisits and extends the microscopic formalism for calculating response coefficients -- here referred to as (generalized) polarizabilities -- in crystalline electronic insulators. The main focus is on the Berry phase polarization and orbital magnetization, for which we obtain general formulas describing the linear response to an arbitrary (but static and uniform) perturbation. The response of an arbitrary lattice-periodic observable (e.g. spin, layer pseudospin) to electric and magnetic fields is also examined, and serves as a basis for mircoscopically establishing Maxwell relations between conjugate generalized polarizabilities. We furthermore introduce and examine the notion of Berry curvature or Hall vector polarizability, i.e., the response of the Berry curvature to a general perturbation, and show how it relates to Berry phase polarization and orbital magnetization responses. For all polarizabilities considered, we obtain simplified formulas applicable to two- and four-band models, expressed directly in terms of the Hamiltonian and the perturbation. Three specific applications of these formulas are discussed: (i) a computation of the magnetoelectric polarizabilities of model antiferromagnets in one and two dimensions; (ii) a general proof of (quasi)topological signatures in the polarizabilities of Dirac fermions in two dimensions; (iii) a calculation of the strain-induced Berry curvature polarizability in an altermagnet.</description>

      <title>Trapping and Tunneling of Hydrogen, Deuterium and Oxygen in Niobium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate isolated O-H and O-D pairs trapped in BCC Nb using a machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) trained to density-functional theory (DFT). The MLIP enables large-supercell analysis and identification of trapping sites within BCC Nb, as well as efficient mapping of three-dimensional (3D) potential-energy surfaces. In addition to the pair of tetrahedral``face'' sites previously identified based on DFT, we identify a lower-energy pair of ``edge'' trapping sites and confirm the stability of H and D at these trapping sites with DFT. We solve the Schr\"odinger equation for H and D in the 3D potential that surrounds the trapping sites. Solutions based on the static-lattice limit yield tunnel splittings in the range $J/h \in\{3-100\}$ GHz for both trapping sites.</description>

      <title>Signature of inverse orbital Hall effect in silicon studied using time-resolved terahertz polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the anomalous Hall conductivity induced in silicon by circularly polarized light at room temperature using near-infrared (NIR) pump-terahertz (THz) probe spectroscopy. The time-resolved detection scheme eliminates the large nonlinear current generated by the field-induced circular photogalvanic effect, allowing exclusive observation of a long-lived anomalous Hall conductivity of photocarriers that depends on the helicity of NIR light. The magnitude of this conductivity is comparable to that of GaAs despite silicon's much weaker spin-orbit coupling, and its robustness against NIR photon energy rules out a spin-polarization-based origin, which occurs only in the vicinity of the bandgap. These results suggest the emergence of the inverse orbital Hall effect, paving the way for silicon-based orbitronics.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Hall effect in hysteretic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement of the Hall effect is a ubiquitous probe for materials discovery, characterization, and metrology. Inherent to the Hall measurement geometry, the measured signal is often contaminated by unwanted contributions, so the data must be processed to isolate the Hall response. The standard approach invokes Onsager-Casimir reciprocity and antisymmetrizes the raw signal about zero applied magnetic field. In hysteretic materials this becomes nontrivial, since Onsager-Casimir relations apply only to microscopically reversible states. Incorrect antisymmetrization can lead to artifacts that mimic anomalous or topological Hall signatures. The situation is especially subtle when hysteresis loops are not centered at zero applied field, as in exchange-biased systems. A practical reference for generically extracting the Hall response in hysteretic materials is lacking. Here, using Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ as a bulk single-crystal model that can be prepared with or without exchange-biased hysteresis, we demonstrate two procedures that can be used to extract the Hall effect: (1) reverse-magnetic-field reciprocity and (2) antisymmetrization with respect to applied field. We then measure the Hall effect on CeCoGe$_3$, a noncentrosymmetric antiferromagnet which can be prepared to have asymmetric magnetization and magnetoresistance, and demonstrate how improper processing can generate artificial anomalous Hall signals. These methods are generic and can be applied to any conductor.</description>

      <title>Higher lattice gauge theory from representations of 2-groups and 3+1D topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a higher lattice gauge theory based on the representation of 2-groups described by a category of crossed modules on a lattice model described by path 2-groupoids. Using these lattice gauge representations, an exactly solvable Hamiltonian for topological phases in 3+1 dimensions is constructed. We show that the ground states of this model are topological observables.</description>

      <title>A First Look at Hydrogen Generation in an Ultramafic Rock with Micro-CT and SEM-BEX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Natural hydrogen generated by water-rock interaction in ultramafic rocks is increasingly recognised as a potentially important primary energy resource, but the pore-scale processes that control the initiation and early transport of a free gas phase remain poorly constrained. Here we present an in situ X-ray micro-tomography experiment in which an ultramafic granular pack of dunnite from West Papua, Indonesia, saturated with KI-doped brine, is heated to 100C with a pore pressure of 4bar under 10bar confining pressure inside a micro-CT scanner. Time-resolved 4D imaging captures the transition from a fully liquid-saturated pore space to the appearance and growth of a distinct gas phase after an 8h induction period. Bubbles first nucleate near the top of the sample before becoming distributed throughout the imaged volume as a connected ganglia. The nucleating gas phase is most plausibly dominated by molecular hydrogen generated by low-temperature fluid-rock reaction, as indicated by independent hydrogen-presence detectors, although we cannot yet fully exclude minor contributions from other gases. SEM-BEX imaging reveals textural alteration and local changes in elemental signals between reacted and unreacted material. Taken together, these observations provide spatially and temporally resolved evidence for gas generation during low-temperature alteration of ultramafic grains and demonstrate that pore-scale imaging can directly link water-rock reaction kinetics, gas generation and multiphase flow behaviour in natural hydrogen systems.</description>
