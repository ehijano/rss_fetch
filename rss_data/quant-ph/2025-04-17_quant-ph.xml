      <title>Entangled Subspaces through Algebraic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an algebraic geometry-inspired approach for constructing entangled subspaces within the Hilbert space of a multipartite quantum system. Specifically, our method employs a modified Veronese embedding, restricted to the conic, to define subspaces within the symmetric part of the Hilbert space. By utilizing this technique, we construct the minimal-dimensional, non-orthogonal yet Unextendible Product Basis (nUPB), enabling the decomposition of the multipartite Hilbert space into a two-dimensional subspace, complemented by a Genuinely Entangled Subspace (GES) and a maximal-dimensional Completely Entangled Subspace (CES). In multiqudit systems, we determine the maximum achievable dimension of a symmetric GES and demonstrate its realization through this construction. Furthermore, we systematically investigate the transition from the conventional Veronese embedding to the modified one by imposing various constraints on the affine coordinates, which, in turn, increases the CES dimension while reducing that of the GES.</description>

      <title>Generating three transparency windows, Fano-resononce and slow/fast light in magnomechanical system through an auxiliary microwave cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a theoretical scheme to investigate the magnomechanically induced transparency (MMIT) phenomenon, Fano resonances, and slow/fast light effects in a hybrid cavity magnomechanical system. The magnomechanical system consists of two cavities: the principal cavity contains two ferromagnetic yttrium iron garnet (YIG) spheres, and the auxiliary cavity contains an atomic assembly. These two cavities are connected via photon tunneling, with the principal cavity being driven by two electromagnetic fields. The photon-magnon and phonon-magnon couplings are responsible for the magnon-induced transparency (MIT) and MMIT observed in the probe output spectrum. Furthermore, we examine the impacts of tunneling coupling, atom-photon coupling, and the magnetic field on the absorption, dispersion, and transmission spectra. We provide an explanation of the mechanism behind the Fano resonance phenomenon. Additionally, we address the phenomenon of slow and light propagation. Moreover, we demonstrate that group delay of the probe field can be improved by increasing photon tunneling strength. We also show that the slow light profile is decreased by adjusting the atom-photon coupling strength. This model is experimentally feasible. We hope these findings have the potential to be applied to the processing of quantum information and communication.</description>

      <title>Post-Variational Ground State Estimation via QPE-Based Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum phase estimation (QPE) plays a pivotal role in many quantum algorithms, offering provable speedups in applications such as Shor's factoring algorithm. While fault-tolerant quantum algorithms for combinatorial and Hamiltonian optimization often integrate QPE with variational protocols-like the quantum approximate optimization Ansatz or variational quantum eigensolver-these approaches typically rely on heuristic techniques requiring parameter optimization. In this work, we present the QPE-based quantum imaginary time evolution (QPE-QITE) algorithm, designed for post-variational ground state estimation on fault-tolerant quantum computers. Unlike variational methods, QPE-QITE employs additional ancillae to project the quantum register into low-energy eigenstates, eliminating the need for parameter optimization. We demonstrate the capabilities of QPE-QITE by applying it to the low-autocorrelation binary sequences (LABS) problem, which is a higher order optimization problem that has been studied in the context of quantum scaling advantage. Scaling estimates for magic state requirements are provided to assess the feasibility of addressing these problems on near-term fault-tolerant devices, establishing a benchmark for quantum advantage. Moreover, we discuss potential implementations of QPE-QITE on existing quantum hardware as a precursor to fault tolerance.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Authentication Protocols for Advanced Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Authentication is a fundamental building block of secure quantum networks, essential for quantum cryptographic protocols and often debated as a key limitation of quantum key distribution (QKD) in security standards. Most quantum-safe authentication schemes rely on small pre-shared keys or post-quantum computational assumptions. In this work, we introduce a new authentication approach that combines hardware assumptions, particularly Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs), along with fundamental quantum properties of non-local states, such as local indistinguishability, to achieve provable security in entanglement-based protocols. We propose two protocols for different scenarios in entanglement-enabled quantum networks. The first protocol, referred to as the offline protocol, requires pre-distributed entangled states but no quantum communication during the authentication phase. It enables a server to authenticate clients at any time with only minimal classical communication. The second, an online protocol, requires quantum communication but only necessitates entangled state generation on the prover side. For this, we introduce a novel hardware module, the Hybrid Entangled PUF (HEPUF). Both protocols use weakly secure, off-the-shelf classical PUFs as their hardware module, yet we prove that quantum properties such as local indistinguishability enable exponential security for authentication, even in a single round. We provide full security analysis for both protocols and establish them as the first entanglement-based extension of hardware-based quantum authentication. These protocols are suitable for implementation across various platforms, particularly photonics-based ones, and offer a practical and flexible solution to the long-standing challenge of authentication in quantum communication networks.</description>

      <title>Work Statistics and Quantum Trajectories: No-Click Limit and non-Hermitian Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generalized framework for quantum work statistics in continuously monitored quantum systems that extends the conventional two-point measurement scheme to include the effects of multiple generalized measurements and post-selection of no-click trajectories. By deriving a modified generating function for work, our approach naturally incorporates non-Hermitian dynamics arising from quantum jump processes and reveals deviations from the standard Jarzynski equality due to measurement-induced asymmetries. We illustrate our theoretical framework by analyzing a one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model under local spin monitoring. In this model, increased measurement strength projects the system onto the no-click state, leading to a suppression of energy fluctuations and measurement-induced energy saturation, reminiscent of the quantum Zeno effect.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Error Correction for Entanglement Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum network applications impose a variety of requirements on entanglement resources in terms of rate, fidelity, latency, and more. The repeaters in the quantum network must combine good methods for entanglement generation, effective entanglement distillation, and smart routing protocols to satisfy these application requirements. In this work, we focus on quantum error correction-based entanglement distillation in a linear chain of quantum repeaters. While conventional approaches reuse the same distillation scheme over multiple hop lengths after entanglement swaps, we propose a novel adaptive error correction scheme that boosts end-to-end metrics. Specifically, depending on the network operation point, we adapt the code used in distillation over successive rounds to monotonically increase the rate while also improving fidelity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy using three codes: [[9,1,3]], [[9,2,3]], [[9,3,3]]. We compare the performance of four different protocols that combine the codes in different ways, where we define a new performance metric, efficiency, that incorporates both overall rate and fidelity. While we highlight our innovation under minimal assumptions on noise, the method can be easily generalized to realistic network settings. By combining our approach with good entanglement generation methods and smart routing protocols, we can achieve application requirements in a systematic, resource-efficient, way.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulations of nuclear resonances with variational methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The many-body nature of nuclear physics problems poses significant computational challenges. These challenges become even more pronounced when studying the resonance states of nuclear systems, which are governed by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Quantum computing, particularly for quantum many-body systems, offers a promising alternative, especially within the constraints of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This work aims to simulate nuclear resonances using quantum algorithms by developing a variational framework compatible with non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and implementing it fully on a quantum simulator. We employ the complex scaling technique to extract resonance positions classically and adapt it for quantum simulations using a two-step algorithm. First, we transform the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian into a Hermitian form by using the energy variance as a cost function within a variational framework. Second, we perform theta-trajectory calculations to determine optimal resonance positions in the complex energy plane. To address resource constraints on NISQ devices, we utilize Gray Code (GC) encoding to reduce qubit requirements. We first validate our approach using a schematic potential model that mimics a nuclear potential, successfully reproducing known resonance energies with high fidelity. We then extend the method to a more realistic alpha-alpha nuclear potential and compute the resonance energies with a basis size of 16, using only four qubits. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that the complete theta-trajectory method can be implemented on a quantum computer without relying on any classical input beyond the Hamiltonian. The results establish a scalable and efficient quantum framework for simulating resonance phenomena in nuclear systems. This work represents a significant step toward quantum simulations of open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Advancing quantum simulations of nuclear shell model with noise-resilient protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some of the computational limitations in solving the nuclear many-body problem could be overcome by utilizing quantum computers. The nuclear shell-model calculations providing deeper insights into the properties of atomic nuclei, is one such case with high demand for resources as the size of the Hilbert space grows exponentially with the number of particles involved. Quantum algorithms are being developed to overcome these challenges and advance such calculations. To develop quantum circuits for the nuclear shell-model, leveraging the capabilities of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. We aim to minimize resource requirements (specifically in terms of qubits and gates) and strive to reduce the impact of noise by employing relevant mitigation techniques. We achieve noise resilience by designing an optimized ansatz for the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) based on Givens rotations and incorporating qubit-ADAPT-VQE in combination with variational quantum deflation (VQD) to compute ground and excited states incorporating the zero-noise extrapolation mitigation technique. Furthermore, the qubit requirements are significantly reduced by mapping the basis states to qubits using Gray code encoding and generalizing transformations of fermionic operators to efficiently represent manybody states. By employing the noise-resilient protocols, we achieve the ground and excited state energy levels of 38Ar and 6Li with better accuracy. These energy levels are presented for noiseless simulations, noisy conditions, and after applying noise mitigation techniques. Results are compared for Jordan Wigner and Gray code encoding using VQE, qubit-ADAPT-VQE, and VQD. Our work highlights the potential of noise-resilient protocols to leverage the full potential of NISQ devices in scaling the nuclear shell model calculations.</description>

      <title>Hardware Co-Designed Optimal Control for Programmable Atomic Quantum Processors via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing scalable, fault-tolerant atomic quantum processors requires precise control over large arrays of optical beams. This remains a major challenge due to inherent imperfections in classical control hardware, such as inter-channel crosstalk and beam leakage. In this work, we introduce a hardware co-designed intelligent quantum control framework to address these limitations. We construct a mathematical model of the photonic control hardware, integrate it into the quantum optimal control (QOC) framework, and apply reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to discover optimal control strategies. We demonstrate that the proposed framework enables robust, high-fidelity parallel single-qubit gate operations under realistic control conditions, where each atom is individually addressed by an optical beam. Specifically, we implement and benchmark three optimization strategies: a classical hybrid Self-Adaptive Differential Evolution-Adam (SADE-Adam) optimizer, a conventional RL approach based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and a novel end-to-end differentiable RL method. Using SADE-Adam as a baseline, we find that while PPO performance degrades as system complexity increases, the end-to-end differentiable RL consistently achieves gate fidelities above 99.9$\%$, exhibits faster convergence, and maintains robustness under varied channel crosstalk strength and randomized dynamic control imperfections.</description>

      <title>Detectors for local discrimination of sets of generalized Bell states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in quantum information processing is the discrimination among a set of orthogonal quantum states of a composite system under local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Corresponding to the LOCC indistinguishable sets of four ququad-ququad orthogonal maximally entangled states (MESs) constructed by Yu et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 020506 (2012)], the maximum commutative sets (MCSs) were introduced as detectors for the local distinguishability of the set of generalized Bell states (GBSs), for which the detectors are sufficient to determine the LOCC distinguishability. In this work, we show how to determine all the detectors for a given GBS set. We construct also several 4-GBS sets without detectors, most of which are one-way LOCC indistinguishable and only one is one-way LOCC distinguishable, indicating that the detectors are not necessary for LOCC distinguishability. Furthermore, we show that for 4-GBS sets in quantum system $\mathbb{C}^{6}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{6}$, the detectors are almost necessary for one-way LOCC distinguishability, except for one set in the sense of local unitary equivalence. The problem of one-way LOCC discrimination of 4-GBS sets in $\mathbb{C}^{6}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{6}$ is completely resolved.</description>

      <title>Probing the Abyss of the Quantum Vacuum: A Quest for Fluctuation-Free Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modification of electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations by boundary conditions is a fundamental prediction of quantum electrodynamics (QED). However, direct experimental verification in the optical regime is hindered by the need for sub-wavelength spatial resolution. Here, we present a novel approach to indirectly probe the spatial distribution of vacuum fluctuations by leveraging radio-frequency (RF) measurements of thermal noise. At RF frequencies, thermal noise, which occupies the same electromagnetic modes as vacuum fluctuations and is similarly shaped by boundary conditions, dominates the single-photon energy. By precisely characterizing the spatial distribution of thermal noise near a conducting boundary, we infer the corresponding modification of vacuum modes and, consequently, the vacuum fluctuations themselves. Our experimental setup, employing coaxial cables and RF splitters to mimic optical mirrors and beam splitters, enables controlled manipulation of boundary conditions and precise thermal noise measurements. We observe a reduction in thermal noise near the conducting boundary, providing indirect evidence for the theoretically predicted suppression of vacuum fluctuations. This work establishes a new experimental framework for investigating QED effects in constrained environments, with potential implications for quantum-limited precision measurements, such as gravitational wave detection and intensity-stabilized light sources. This RF approach circumvents the limitations of optical techniques and opens new avenues for exploring fundamental quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Gaussian states in quantum field theory: Exact representations of relative phase in superpositions of Gaussian states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian quantum mechanics is a powerful tool regularly used in quantum optics to model linear and quadratic Hamiltonians efficiently. Recent interest in qubit-CV hybrid models has revealed a simple, yet important gap in our knowledge, namely, how to fully manipulate superpositions of Gaussian states. In this paper, we show how to faithfully represent a quadratic Gaussian state in the Fock basis. Specifically, we evaluate the phase necessary to equate the unitary representation of a zero-mean Gaussian state with its Fock representation. This allows for the coherent manipulation of superpositions of Gaussian states, especially the evaluation of expectation values from these superposed states. We then use this method to model a simple quantum field theory communication protocol using quadratic detectors in a regime that has previously been impossible to solve. The result presented in this paper is expected to become increasingly relevant with hybrid-CV systems, especially in the strong-coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Network-Integrated Decoding System for Real-Time Quantum Error Correction with Lattice Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing real-time decoders for surface codes are limited to isolated logical qubits and do not support logical operations involving multiple logical qubits. We present DECONET, a first-of-its-kind decoding system that scales to thousands of logical qubits and supports logical operations implemented through lattice surgery. DECONET organizes compute resources in a network-integrated hybrid tree-grid structure, which results in minimal latency increase and no throughput degradation as the system grows. Specifically, DECONET can be scaled to any arbitrary number of $l$ logical qubits by increasing the compute resources by $O(l \times log(l))$, which provides the required $O(l)$ growth in I/O resources while incurring only an $O(log(l))$ increase in latency-a modest growth that is sufficient for thousands of logical qubits. Moreover, we analytically show that the scaling approach preserves throughput, keeping DECONET backlog-free for any number of logical qubits. We report an exploratory prototype of DECONET, called DECONET/HELIOS, built with five VMK-180 FPGAs, that successfully decodes 100 logical qubits of distance five. For 100 logical qubits, under a phenomenological noise rate of 0.1%, the DECONET/HELIOS has an average latency of 2.40 {\mu}s and an inverse throughput of 0.84 {\mu}s per measurement round.</description>

Abstract: Within an inherently classical perspective, there is always an unavoidable energy cost associated with the information deletion and this common lore is at the heart of the Landauer's conjecture that does not impose, per se, any relevant limit on the information acquisition. Although such a mindset should generally apply to systems of any size, its quantum mechanical implications are particularly intriguing and, for this reason, we examine here a minimal physical structure where the system and the environment are described, respectively, by a pair of quantum oscillators coupled by an appropriate Hermitian interaction able to amplify the entropy of the initial state. Since at the onset of the dynamical evolution the system is originally in a pure state, its entropy variation is always positive semidefinite and the Landauer's conjecture should not impose any constraint. Nonetheless, provided the quantum amplification is effective, it turns out that the entropy variation of the system always undershoots the heat transferred to the environment. When the initial thermal state of the environment is characterized by a chemical potential, the entropy growth is bounded both by the particles and by the heat flowing to the environment. The limits deduced in the quantum thermodynamical framework are also scrutinized from a field theory standpoint where species of different spins are copiously produced (especially in a cosmological context) thanks to the rapid variation of the space-time curvature.</description>

      <title>A study on B-cell epitope prediction based on QSVM and VQC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates quantum computing's role in B-cell epitope prediction using Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) and Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC). It highlights the potential of quantum machine learning in bioinformatics, addressing computational efficiency limitations of traditional methods as data complexity grows. QSVM uses quantum kernel functions for data mapping, while VQC employs parameterized quantum circuits for classification. Results show QSVM and VQC achieving 70% and 73% accuracy, respectively, with QSVM excelling in balancing classes. Despite challenges like computational demands and hardware limitations, quantum methods show promise, suggesting future improvements with ongoing advancements.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Casimir pressure for two graphene-coated plates: Quantum field theoretical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the nonequilibrium Casimir pressure in the system of two parallel graphene-coated plates one of which is either warmer or cooler than the environment. The electromagnetic response of graphene coating characterized by the nonzero energy gap and chemical potential is described in the framework of the Dirac model by means of the polarization tensor. It is shown that the magnitude of the nonequilibrium Casimir pressure on a warmer plate than the environment is larger and on a cooler plate is smaller than the magnitude of the standard Casimir pressure in the state of thermal equilibrium. According to our results, the spatially local theory underestimates the role of the effects of nonequilibrium. This underestimation increases for asmaller chemical potential of the graphene coating and at lower temperatures of the cooled plate. Possible applications of the obtained results are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a set of open-source packages that form a highly extensible framework for quantum optimization. One design goal of the system is the inclusion of a command line based configuration system for setting up experiments. The possible options are derived using well-known Python packages and presented to the user intuitively, allowing the configuration of repeatable variational quantum optimization experiments. We give an example of using the system through the Airline Crew Pairing problem, a highly relevant industrial problem, and the MaxCut problem, for which instances of manageable size are readily available.</description>

      <title>Exact noise and dissipation operators for quantum stochastic thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of open quantum systems plays a fundamental role in several scientific and technological disciplines, from quantum computing and information science to molecular electronics and quantum thermodynamics. Despite its widespread relevance, a rigorous formulation of quantum dissipation in conjunction with thermal noise remains a topic of active research. In this work, we establish a formal correspondence between classical stochastic thermodynamics, in particular the Fokker-Planck and Klein-Kramers equations, and the quantum master equation. Building on prior studies of multiplicative noise in classical stochastic differential equations, we demonstrate that thermal noise at the quantum level manifests as a multidimensional geometric stochastic process. By applying canonical quantization, we introduce a novel Hermitian dissipation operator that serves as a quantum analogue of classical viscous friction. This operator not only preserves the mathematical rigor of open quantum system dynamics but also allows for a well-defined expression of heat exchange between a system and its environment, enabling the formulation of an alternative quantum equipartition theorem. Our framework ensures a precise energy balance that aligns with the first law of thermodynamics and an entropy balance consistent with the second law. The theoretical formalism is applied to two prototypical quantum systems, the harmonic oscillator and a particle in an infinite potential well, for whom it provides new insights into nonequilibrium thermodynamics at the quantum scale. Our results advance the understanding of dissipation in quantum systems and establish a foundation for future studies on stochastic thermodynamics in the quantum domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the robustness of genuine multipartite entanglement and inseparability of multipartite pure states under superposition with product pure states. We introduce the concept of the maximal and the minimal Schmidt ranks for multipartite states. From the minimal Schmidt rank of the first order we present criterion of verifying unconditional robustness of genuine multipartite entanglement of multipartite pure states under superposition with product pure states. By the maximal Schmidt rank of the first order we verify the unconditional robustness of multipartite inseparability under superposition with product pure states. The number of product states superposed to a given entangled state which result in a separable state is investigated in detail. Furthermore, the minimal Schmidt ranks of the second order are also introduced to identify the unconditional robustness of an entangled state for tripartite inseparability.</description>

      <title>Characterizing physical and logical errors in a transversal CNOT via cycle error reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of prototype quantum information processors has progressed to a stage where small instances of logical qubit systems perform better than the best of their physical constituents. Advancing towards fault-tolerant quantum computing will require an understanding of the underlying error mechanisms in logical primitives as they relate to the performance of quantum error correction. In this work we demonstrate the novel capability to characterize the physical error properties relevant to fault-tolerant operations via cycle error reconstruction. We illustrate this diagnostic capability for a transversal CNOT, a prototypical component of quantum logical operations, in a 16-qubit register of a trapped-ion quantum computer. Our error characterization technique offers three key capabilities: (i) identifying context-dependent physical layer errors, enabling their mitigation; (ii) contextualizing component gates in the environment of logical operators, validating the performance differences in terms of characterized component-level physics, and (iii) providing a scalable method for predicting quantum error correction performance using pertinent error terms, differentiating correctable versus uncorrectable physical layer errors. The methods with which our results are obtained have scalable resource requirements that can be extended with moderate overhead to capture overall logical performance in increasingly large and complex systems.</description>

      <title>Causality, localisation, and universality of monitored quantum walks with long-range hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum resetting protocols can speed up the time in which a quantum walker reaches a target site on a lattice. In these setups, a detector monitors the target site and the walker motion is restarted if the detector has not clicked after a fixed time interval. The optimal resetting rate can be extracted from the time evolution of the probability $S(t)$ that the detector has not clicked up to time $t$. We analyse $S(t)$ for a quantum walk in a one-dimensional lattice when the coupling between sites decays algebraically as $d^{-\alpha}$ with the distance $d$, for $\alpha\in(0,\infty)$. At long-times, $S(t)$ decays with a universal power-law exponent that is independent of $\alpha$. At short times, $S(t)$ exhibits a plethora of phase transitions as a function of $\alpha$. These lead to the identification of two main regimes for the optimal resetting rate. For $\alpha&gt;1$, the resetting rate $r$ is bounded from below by the velocity with which information propagates causally across the lattice. For $\alpha&lt;1$, instead, the long-range hopping tends to localise the walker: The optimal resetting rate depends on the size of the lattice and diverges as $\alpha\to 0$. We derive simple models reproducing the numerical results, shedding light on the interplay of long-range coherent dynamics, symmetries, and local quantum measurement processes in determining equilibrium. Our predictions can be verified in existing experimental setups.</description>

      <title>Refining the Understanding of Operator Size Dynamics in Open Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information scrambling refers to the phenomenon in which local quantum information in a many-body system becomes dispersed throughout the entire system under unitary evolution. It has been extensively studied in closed quantum systems, where it is quantified by operator size growth, revealing deep connections between condensed matter physics, high-energy physics, and quantum information. However, when extending the study of operator size dynamics to open quantum systems, two different definitions of operator size distributions emerge. These definitions are based on different treatments of the bath. In this work, we aim to establish a unified picture for operator size dynamics in open quantum systems, using the solvable Brownian SYK models at generic system size. In particular, we provide the conditions under which the signature of scrambling transition, discovered using one particular definition, appears in operator size dynamics under the other definition. Additionally, we extend previous studies by exploring finite-size effects that are not captured by the scramblon theory. Our results provide a refined understanding of operator size dynamics in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Accelerating MCMC with Quantum Walks: Design, Implementation, and Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are algorithms for sampling probability distributions, often applied to the Boltzmann distribution in physical and chemical models, such as protein folding and the Ising model. These methods enable the study of such systems by sampling their most probable states. However, sampling multidimensional and multimodal distributions with MCMC demands significant computational resources, leading to the development of techniques aimed at improving sampling efficiency. In this context, quantum computing, with its potential to accelerate classical methods, emerges as a promising solution to the sampling problem. In this work, we present the design and implementation of a novel MCMC algorithm (QMCMC) based on the Discrete Quantum Walk (DQW) algorithm. We test several Gaussian distributions, including mixtures and demonstrate that it effectively captures the structure of the target distribution by leveraging quantum superposition. In addition, we introduce a circuit extension that significantly improves convergence speed, which in turn enhances the scalability of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Locality-aware Pauli-based computation for local magic state preparation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic state distillation, a process for preparing magic states needed to implement non-Clifford gates fault-tolerantly, plays a crucial role in fault-tolerant quantum computation. Historically, it has been a major bottleneck, leading to the pursuit of computation schemes optimized for slow magic state preparation. Recent advances in magic state distillation have significantly reduced the overhead, enabling the simultaneous preparation of many magic states. However, the magic state transfer cost prevents the conventional layout from efficiently utilizing them, highlighting the need for an alternative scheme optimized for highly parallel quantum algorithms. In this study, we propose locality-aware Pauli-based computation, a novel compilation scheme that distills magic states in the computation area, aiming to reduce execution time by minimizing magic state transfer costs and improving locality. Numerical experiments on random circuit sampling and 2D Ising Hamiltonian simulation demonstrate that our scheme significantly reduces execution time, while incurring little or no additional spatial overhead, compared to sequential Pauli-based computation, a conventional computation scheme, and scales favorably with increasing qubit count.</description>

      <title>Logical multi-qubit entanglement with dual-rail superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum error correction (QEC) across hardware platforms have demonstrated operation near and beyond the fault-tolerance threshold, yet achieving exponential suppression of logical errors through code scaling remains a critical challenge. Erasure qubits, which enable hardware-level detection of dominant error types, offer a promising path toward resource-efficient QEC by exploiting error bias. Single erasure qubits with dual-rail encoding in superconducting cavities and transmons have demonstrated high coherence and low single-qubit gate errors with mid-circuit erasure detection, but the generation of multi-qubit entanglement--a fundamental requirement for quantum computation and error correction--has remained an outstanding milestone. Here, we demonstrate a superconducting processor integrating four dual-rail erasure qubits that achieves the logical multi-qubit entanglement with error-biased protection. Each dual-rail qubit, encoded in pairs of tunable transmons, preserves millisecond-scale coherence times and single-qubit gate errors at the level of $10^{-5}$. By engineering tunable couplings between logical qubits, we generate high-fidelity entangled states resilient to physical qubit noise, including logical Bell states (98.8% fidelity) and a three-logical-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state (93.5% fidelity). A universal gate set is realized through a calibrated logical controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate with 96.2% process fidelity, enabled by coupler-activated $XX$ interactions in the protected logical subspace. This work advances dual-rail architectures beyond single-qubit demonstrations, providing a blueprint for concatenated quantum error correction with erasure qubits.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the quantum interference between single photons and local oscillator with photon correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum interference between a coherent state and a single photon is an important tool in continuous variable optical quantum technologies to characterize and engineer non-Gaussian quantum states. Semiconductor quantum dots, which have recently emerged as a key platform for efficient single-photon generation, could become interesting assets in this context. An essential parameter for interfering single photons and classical fields is the mean wavepacket overlap between both fields. Here, we report on two homodyne photon-correlation techniques enabling the precise measurement of the overlap between a single photon generated by a quantum dot-cavity device and pulsed laser light. The different statistics of interfering fields lead to specific signatures of the quantum interference on the photon correlations at the output of the interfering beam splitter. We compare the behavior of maximized overlap, measuring either the Hong-Ou-Mandel visibility between both outputs or the photon bunching at a single output. Through careful tailoring of the laser light in various degrees of freedom, we maximize the overlap to $76\,\%$, with limitations primarily due to mismatched spectral and temporal profiles and low-frequency charge noise in the single-photon source.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing with arbitrary frequency resolution via correlation measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving high-frequency spectral resolution with quantum sensors, while crucial in fields ranging from physical to biological sciences, is challenging due to their finite coherence time. Here, we introduce a novel protocol that achieves this goal by measuring phase correlations of AC magnetic fields using ensembles of NV centers. Our method extends the sensing dynamic range to frequencies higher than the system's Rabi frequency while achieving arbitrary frequency resolution, limited only by the target field coherence time. Moreover, our approach operates more robustly with respect to the magnetic field's amplitude. Thanks to this robustness, our protocol allows the application of more $\pi$-pulses in pulse sequences such as CPMG, enabling the decoupling of a broader range of frequency noise. The higher harmonics generated in this process continue to act as a part of the signal, ultimately improving the frequency resolution. This method paves the way for achieving arbitrary frequency resolution with improved performances, making it highly versatile for quantum sensing applications across diverse scientific fields.</description>

      <title>Correlations as a resource in molecular switches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoisomerization, a photochemical process underlying many biological mechanisms, has been modeled recently within the quantum resource theory of thermodynamics. This approach has emerged as a promising tool for studying fundamental limitations to nanoscale processes independently of the microscopic details governing their dynamics. On the other hand, correlations between physical systems have been shown to play a crucial role in quantum thermodynamics by lowering the work cost of certain operations. Here, we explore quantitatively how correlations between multiple photoswitches can enhance the efficiency of photoisomerization beyond that attainable for single molecules. Furthermore, our analysis provides insights into the interplay between quantum and classical correlations in these transformations.</description>

      <title>Phonon-Coupled Hole-Spin Qubits in High-Purity Germanium: Design and Modeling of a Scalable Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a design and modeling of a scalable quantum processor architecture utilizing hole-spin qubits defined in gate-controlled germanium (Ge) quantum dots, where coherent spin-phonon coupling is predicted to facilitate qubit manipulation and long-range interactions. The architecture exploits the strong, electrically tunable spin-orbit interactions intrinsic to hole states in Ge, integrated with high-quality phononic crystal cavities (PnCCs) to enable fully electrical qubit control and phonon-mediated coupling. Employing a streamlined simulation framework built upon multiband \(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}\) modeling and finite-element methods, we quantify key performance metrics, including electrically tunable \( g \)-factors ranging from \(1.3\) to \(2.0\), spin-phonon coupling strengths up to \(6.3\,\mathrm{MHz}\), phononic cavity quality factors exceeding \(10^4\), and phonon-mediated spin relaxation times (\(T_1\)) reaching milliseconds. The proposed architecture concurrently achieves extended spin coherence and rapid gate operations through strategic electric field modulation and engineered phononic bandgap environments. Furthermore, isotopically enriched high-purity Ge crystals grown in-house at the University of South Dakota, significantly enhance device coherence by minimizing disorder and hyperfine interactions. This integrated approach, merging advanced materials engineering, precise spin-orbit coupling, and phononic cavity design, establishes a promising CMOS-compatible pathway toward scalable, high-fidelity quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Hardness of observing strong-to-weak symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) is the cornerstone of our understanding of quantum phases of matter. Recent works have generalized this concept to the domain of mixed states in open quantum systems, where symmetries can be realized in two distinct ways dubbed strong and weak. Novel intrinsically mixed phases of quantum matter can then be defined by the spontaneous breaking of strong symmetry down to weak symmetry. However, proposed order parameters for strong-to-weak SSB (based on mixed-state fidelities or purities) seem to require exponentially many copies of the state, raising the question: is it possible to efficiently detect strong-to-weak SSB in general? Here we answer this question negatively in the paradigmatic cases of $Z_2$ and $U(1)$ symmetries. We construct ensembles of pseudorandom mixed states that do not break the strong symmetry, yet are computationally indistinguishable from states that do. This rules out the existence of efficient state-agnostic protocols to detect strong-to-weak SSB.</description>

      <title>Exceptional deficiency of non-Hermitian systems: high-dimensional coalescence and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are non-Hermitian singularities associated with the coalescence of individual eigenvectors accompanied by the degeneracy of their complex energies. Here, we report the discovery of a generalization to the concept of EP called exceptional deficiency (ED), which features the complete coalescence of two eigenspaces with identical but arbitrarily large dimensions and the coincidence of entire spectral continua. The characteristics of the ED are studied using one-way coupled Hermitian and non-Hermitian lattices. The ED can induce an anomalous absence and presence of non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) that transcends the topological bulk-edge correspondence of NHSE, resulting in unexpected synergistic skin-propagative dynamics. The conditions of the ED are also explored for unprecedented control of localization and propagation in non-Hermitian systems. These effects are experimentally observed using active mechanical lattices. The discovery of ED opens multiple new frontiers in non-Hermitian physics and can potentially resolve long-standing challenges in related applications.</description>

      <title>R\'enyi security framework against coherent attacks applied to decoy-state QKD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a flexible and robust framework for finite-size security proofs of quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols under coherent attacks, applicable to both fixed- and variable-length protocols. Our approach achieves high finite-size key rates across a broad class of protocols while imposing minimal requirements. In particular, it eliminates the need for restrictive conditions such as limited repetition rates or the implementation of virtual tomography procedures. To achieve this goal, we introduce new numerical techniques for the evaluation of sandwiched conditional R\'enyi entropies. In doing so, we also find an alternative formulation of the "QKD cone" studied in previous work. We illustrate the versatility of our framework by applying it to several practically relevant protocols, including decoy-state protocols. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to accommodate realistic device imperfections, such as independent intensity and phase imperfections. Overall, our framework provides both greater scope of applicability and better key rates than existing techniques, especially for small block sizes, hence offering a scalable path toward secure quantum communication under realistic conditions</description>

      <title>A complete theory of the Clifford commutant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Clifford group plays a central role in quantum information science. It is the building block for many error-correcting schemes and matches the first three moments of the Haar measure over the unitary group -a property that is essential for a broad range of quantum algorithms, with applications in pseudorandomness, learning theory, benchmarking, and entanglement distillation. At the heart of understanding many properties of the Clifford group lies the Clifford commutant: the set of operators that commute with $k$-fold tensor powers of Clifford unitaries. Previous understanding of this commutant has been limited to relatively small values of $k$, constrained by the number of qubits $n$. In this work, we develop a complete theory of the Clifford commutant. Our first result provides an explicit orthogonal basis for the commutant and computes its dimension for arbitrary $n$ and $k$. We also introduce an alternative and easy-to-manipulate basis formed by isotropic sums of Pauli operators. We show that this basis is generated by products of permutations -which generate the unitary group commutant- and at most three other operators. Additionally, we develop a graphical calculus allowing a diagrammatic manipulation of elements of this basis. These results enable a wealth of applications: among others, we characterize all measurable magic measures and identify optimal strategies for stabilizer property testing, whose success probability also offers an operational interpretation to stabilizer entropies. Finally, we show that these results also generalize to multi-qudit systems with prime local dimension.</description>

      <title>Long-time soliton dynamics via a coarse-grained space-time method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the long-time dynamics of the Sine-Gordon (SG) model under a class of perturbations whose quantum field theoretic analog - via bosonization - corresponds to the massive Schwinger model describing 1+1D relativistic QED of Dirac fermions. Classical SG solutions offer critical insight into non-perturbative effects in this quantum theory, but capturing their long-time behavior poses significant numerical challenges. To address this, we extend a coarse-graining method to spacetime using a dual-mesh construction based on the Minkowski-metric. We first validate the approach against the well-studied variant of the SG model describing magnetic fluxon dynamics in Josephson transmission lines (JTLs), where analytical and numerical benchmarks exist. We then apply the method to the Schwinger-inspired SG model and uncover long-lived bound states - "Schwinger atoms" - in which a soliton is trapped by a fixed central charge. In certain regimes, the system exhibits limit cycles that give rise to positronium-like states of oppositely charged solitons, while in others such formation is suppressed. Accessing such long-time solutions requires a rigorous implementation of outgoing boundary conditions on a finite computational domain that provide radiative dissipation to allow relaxation toward states that exist only in an infinite domain. Here we provide such a construction. Our results also suggest the possibility of analog quantum simulation of relativistic quantum field theories with JTLs. These results demonstrate the utility of spatio-temporal coarse-graining methodology for probing non-perturbative structure formation in non-linear field theories.</description>

      <title>Liouvillean Spectral Transition in Noisy Quantum Many-Body Scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the behavior of quantum many-body systems under decoherence is essential for developing robust quantum technologies. Here, we examine the fate of weak ergodicity breaking in systems hosting quantum many-body scars when subject to local pure dephasing -- an experimentally relevant form of environmental noise. Focusing on a large class of models with an approximate su(2)-structured scar subspace, we show that scarred eigenmodes of the Liouvillean exhibit a transition reminiscent of spontaneous $\mathbb{PT}$-symmetry breaking as the dephasing strength increases. Unlike previously studied non-Hermitian mechanisms, this transition arises from a distinct quantum jump effect. Remarkably, in platforms such as the XY spin ladder and PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, the critical dephasing rate shows only weak dependence on system size, revealing an unexpected robustness of scarred dynamics in noisy quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Probing Quantum Anomalous Hall States in Twisted Bilayer WSe2 via Attractive Polaron Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices in semiconductors are predicted to exhibit a rich variety of interaction-induced topological states. However, experimental demonstrations of such topological states, apart from MoTe2 superlattices, have remained scarce. Here, we report the first optical detection of quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states in twisted WSe2 homobilayer (tWSe2). Specifically, we employ polarization-resolved attractive polaron spectroscopy on a dual-gated, 2 degree tWSe2 and observe direct signatures of spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking at hole filling {\nu} = 1. Together with a Chern number (C) measurement via Streda formula analysis, we identify this magnetized state as a topological state, characterized by C = 1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these topological and magnetic properties are tunable via a finite displacement field, between a QAH ferromagnetic state and an antiferromagnetic state. Our findings position tWSe2 as a highly versatile, stable, and optically addressable platform for investigating topological order and strong correlations in two-dimensional landscapes.</description>

      <title>Optically Switchable Fluorescence Enhancement at Critical Interparticle Distances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanostructures provide local field enhancement to be used as efficiency-boosting tools in fluorescence-based applications. For photostable quantum dots (QDs) to have enhanced emission, their size and exact location in the proximity of plasmonic nanostructure become key parameters while constructing light emitting devices. However, plasmonic nanostructures mostly suffer from non-radiative energy transfer at close proximity, which hinders the ultimate performance of fluorophores. In this work, we provided critical interparticle distances through finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations, where the radiative decay rate is equalized to the non-radiative counterpart for light emitting QD-based technologies. To show the promises of the QD placement at a critical distance, we demonstrate an optical switch for the fluorescence efficiency of a CdSe/ZnS core-shell QD (CSQD) by optically exciting the silver nanoparticle (AgNP) placed at a critical distance. While the provided single particle spectroscopy allows for the observation of heterogeneity in CSQD-AgNP coupling that is often masked in ensemble measurements, our benchmark study serves as a base reference for the development of QD-based light emitting technologies by resolving the optically switchable active tuning of radiative decay rates.</description>

      <title>Dynamical electronic correlation and chiral magnetism in van der Waals magnet Fe4GeTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the quasi-2D van der Waals magnetic systems, Fe4GeTe2 imprints a profound impact due to its near-room temperature ferromagnetic behaviour and the complex magnetothermal phase diagram exhibiting multiple phase transformations, as observed from magnetization and magnetotransport measurements. A complete analysis of these phase transformations in the light of electronic correlation and its impact on the underlying magnetic interactions remain unattended in the existing literature. Using first-principles methodologies, incorporating the dynamical nature of electron correlation, we have analysed the interplay of the direction of magnetization in the easy-plane and easy-axis manner with the underlying crystal symmetry, which reveals the opening of a pseudogap feature beyond the spin-reorientation transition (SRT) temperature. The impact of dynamical correlation on the calculated magnetic circular dichroism and x-ray absorption spectrum of the L-edge of the Fe atoms compared well with the existing experimental observations. The calculated intersite Heisenberg exchange interactions display a complicated nature, depending upon the pairwise interactions among the two inequivalent Fe sites, indicating a RKKY-like behaviour of the magnetic interactions. We noted the existence of significant anisotropic and antisymmetric exchanges interactions, resulting into a chirality in the magnetic behaviour of the system. Subsequent investigation of the dynamical aspects of magnetism in Fe4GeTe2 and the respective magnetothermal phase diagram reveal that the dynamical nature of spins and the decoupling of the magnetic properties for both sites of Fe is crucial to explain all the experimentally observed phase transformations.</description>

Abstract: This paper is a sequel to the work of Bhattacharjya et al.\ (J. Phys. A-Math. 57.33: 335303, https://doi.org/10.1088/1751-8121/ad6653) on quantum state transfer on blow-up graphs, where instead of the adjacency matrix, we take the Laplacian matrix as the time-independent Hamiltonian associated with a blow-up graph. We characterize strong cospectrality, periodicity, perfect state transfer (LPST) and pretty good state transfer (LPGST) on blow-up graphs. We present several constructions of blow-up graphs with LPST and produce new infinite families of regular graphs where each vertex is involved in LPST. We also determine LPST and LPGST in blow-ups of classes of trees. Finally, if $n\equiv 0$ (mod 4), then the blow-up of $n$ copies of a graph $G$ has no LPST, but we show that under certain conditions, the addition of an appropriate matching this blow-up graph results in LPST.</description>

      <title>Identifying high performance spectrally-stable quantum defects in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point defects in semiconductors are becoming central to quantum technologies. They can be used as spin qubits interfacing with photons, which are fundamental for building quantum networks. Currently, the most prominent quantum defect in diamond is the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center. However, it suffers from spectral diffusion that negatively impacts optical coherence and is due to the coupling of the emission energy with uncontrolled electric fields. The group IV vacancy complexes on the other hand have shown to be significantly more spectrally-stable as they are centrosymmetric and thus immune to the linear Stark shift. They however suffer from several issues ranging from low operation temperature to low optical efficiency due to dark states and difficulty in stabilizing the right defect charge state. Here we search for alternative to the group IV vacancy complex in diamond by systematically evaluating all possible vacancy complex using high-throughput first-principles computational screening. We identify the defects that combine centrosymmetry, emission in the visible range, as well as favorable and achievable electronic structure promoting higher operation temperature and defect levels well within the band gap. We find Zn$V^{-2}$ to be especially appealing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOVs) with spiral phase in the space-time domain, which carry intrinsic transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM), introduce a new degree of freedom to light beams and exhibit unique properties. While integer and fractional spatial vortices have been extensively studied and widely applied, and research on integer STOVs have grown prosperously, fractional STOVs (FSTOVs), classified as STOVs with fractional spiral phases are rarely explored due to the challenges in characterizing rapidly varying spatiotemporal phases. Furthermore, approaches for the rapid recognition of FSTOVs are lacking. Herein, we experimentally and theoretically demonstrate the generation of FSTOVs in the far field. The generation, evolution, and diffraction rules of FSTOVs are revealed. Furthermore, a self-referential method for the rapid recognition of FSTOVs based on the energy ratio between the two end lobes of their diffraction patterns is proposed. This work will promote the development of the theory of light with transverse OAM, and open new opportunities for the applications of STOV, such as STOV-based optical communication and quantum information.</description>

Abstract: Quantum electrodynamics predicts identity of incident and emitted photons in stimulated emission. This fundamental law is important to test experimentally. In this work stimulated emission in GaAs semiconductor amplifier was investigated and positive frequency shift of the amplified beam was detected. In relative units this frequency shift was found equal $\Delta\nu/\nu = (+1.7 \pm 0.2)\cdot10^{-18}$. This indicates violation of the photon energy conservation in stimulated emission.</description>

      <title>Profile control of fibre-based micro-mirrors using adaptive laser shooting with $\textit{in situ}$ imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fibre Fabry-Perot cavities (FFPCs) are used in various studies in cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) and quantum technologies due to the cavity's small mode volume and compact integration with optical fibres. We develop a novel $\text{CO}_2$ laser machining method that produces well-controlled surface profiles on the end facets of cleaved optical fibres. Using multiple shots in distinct spatial distribution patterns, our method employs a shooting algorithm that adaptively changes laser ablation parameters during the shooting to suppress deviations from the desired profile. This is made possible by $\textit{in situ}$ imaging of the machined profile, its inspection and the usage of the information in the subsequent steps. Underlying this algorithm is a newly found laser ablation parameter, the pause between shots, which controls the accumulation of heat in between successive laser shots and as a result determines the area of impact made by an individual ablation sequence. We fabricate fibre-based micro-mirrors with radii of curvature ranging from 250 $\mu$m to 700 $\mu$m with an effective mirror diameter of 60 $\mu$m in either Gaussian or spherical profiles. Due to the self-correcting nature of our adaptive algorithm, we achieve a near 100\% success rate in the production of desired profiles with low ellipticity. After furnishing the laser machined fibre end facets with high reflectivity coating, FFPCs are formed to demonstrate a high finesse up to 150,000 at an optical wavelength of 854 nm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We illustrate the emergence of classical analogue of coherent state and its generalisation in a purely classical field theoretical setting. Our algebraic approach makes use of the Poisson bracket and symmetries of the underlying field theory, in a complete parallel to the quantum construction. The classical phase space picture is found to play a key role in this construction.</description>

      <title>Non-orientable Exceptional Points in Twisted Boundary Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-orientable manifolds, such as the M\"obius strip and the Klein bottle, defy conventional geometric intuition through their twisted boundary conditions. As a result, topological defects on non-orientable manifolds give rise to novel physical phenomena. We study the adiabatic transport of exceptional points (EPs) along non-orientable closed loops and uncover distinct topological responses arising from the lack of global orientation. Notably, we demonstrate that the cyclic permutation of eigenstates across an EP depends sensitively on the loop orientation, yielding inequivalent braid representations for clockwise and counterclockwise encirclement; this is a feature unique to non-orientable geometries. Orientation-dependent geometric quantities, such as the winding number, cannot be consistently defined due to the absence of a global orientation. However, when a boundary is introduced, such quantities become well defined within the local interior, even though the global manifold remains non-orientable. We further demonstrate the adiabatic evolution of EPs and the emergence of orientation-sensitive observables in a Klein Brillouin zone, described by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian that preserves momentum-space glide symmetry. Finally, we numerically implement these ideas in a microdisk cavity with embedded scatterers using synthetic momenta.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Quantum Master and Fokker-Planck Equation for Gravitational Systems and Gravitational Decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum master equation describing the stochastic dynamics of a quantum massive system interacting with a quantum gravitational field is useful for the investigation of quantum gravitational and quantum informational issues such as the quantum nature of gravity, gravity-induced entanglement and gravitational decoherence. Studies of the decoherence of quantum systems by an electromagnetic field shows that a lower temperature environment is more conducive to successful quantum information processing experiments. Likewise, the quantum nature of (perturbative) gravity is far better revealed at lower temperatures than high, minimizing the corruptive effects of thermal noise. In this work, generalizing earlier results of the Markovian ABH master equation [1,2] which is valid only for high temperatures, we derive a non-Markovian quantum master equation for the reduced density matrix, and the associated Fokker-Planck equation for the Wigner distribution function, for the stochastic dynamics of two masses following quantum trajectories, interacting with a graviton field, including the effects of graviton noise, valid for all temperatures. We follow the influence functional approach exemplified in the derivation of the non-Markovian Hu-Paz-Zhang master equation [62,64] for quantum Brownian motion. We find that in the low temperature limit, the off-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix decrease in time logarithmically for the zero temperature part and quadratically in time for the temperature-dependent part, which is distinctly different from the Markovian case. We end with a summary of our findings and a discussion on how this problem studied here is related to the quantum stochastic equation derived in [77] for gravitational self force studies, and to quantum optomechanics where experimental observation of gravitational decoherence and entanglement may be implemented.</description>

      <title>Unified Multipole Bott Indices for Non-Hermitian Skin Effect in Different Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit a distinctive phenomenon known as the non-Hermitian skin effect, where an extensive number of eigenstates become localized at the boundaries of a lattice with open boundaries. While the spectral winding number under periodic boundary conditions is a well-established topological indicator for predicting the skin effect in one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems, a suitable topological invariant to diagnose higher-order skin effects remains elusive. In this Letter, we propose a unified non-Hermitian multipole characterization framework that generalizes the concept of spectral winding to higher-order skin effects. Specifically, we develop a set of non-Hermitian multipole Bott indices capable of diagnosing skin effects of different orders. Our approach provides a comprehensive understanding of both first- and higher-order skin effects in non-Hermitian systems, offering new perspectives for exploring topological phenomena in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>No equivalence between hydrodynamic and dispersive mass of the charged polaron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of a charged impurity exerting a weak, slowly decaying force on its surroundings, treating the latter as an ideal compressible fluid. In the semiclassical approximation, the ion is described by the Newton equation coupled to the Euler equation for the medium. After linearization, we obtain a simple closed formula for the effective mass of the impurity, depending on the interaction potential, the mean medium density, and sound velocity. Thus, once the interaction and the equation of state of the fluid is known, an estimate of the hydrodynamic effective mass can be quickly provided. Going beyond the classical case, we show that replacing the Newton with Schr\"{o}dinger equation can drastically change the behavior of the impurity. In particular, the scaling of the Fermi polaron effective mass with the medium density is opposite in quantum and classical scenario. Our results are relevant for experimental systems featuring low energy impurities in Fermi or Bose systems, such as ions immersed in neutral atomic gases.</description>

      <title>Max-Cut graph-driven quantum circuit design for planar spin glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding the ground state of spin glasses is a challenging problem with broad implications. Many hard optimization problems, including NP-complete problems, can be mapped, for instance, to the Ising spin glass model. We present a graph-based approach that allows for accurate state initialization of a frustrated triangular spin-lattice with up to 20 sites that stays away from barren plateaus. To optimize circuit efficiency and trainability, we employ a clustering strategy that organizes qubits into distinct groups based on the maximum cut technique, which divides the lattice into two subsets maximally disconnected. We provide evidence that this Max-Cut-based lattice division offers a robust framework for optimizing circuit design and effectively modeling frustrated systems at polynomial cost. All simulations are performed within the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) formalism, the current paradigm for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ), but can be extended beyond. Our results underscore the potential of hybrid quantum-classical methods in addressing complex optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Exotic Quantum States in Spin-1 Bose-Einstein Condensate with Spin-Orbit Coupling in Concentric Annular Traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the exotic quantum states emerging in the ground state (GS) of a strongly-correlated spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate confined in two-dimensional concentric annular traps with a spin-orbit coupling (SOC). In the antiferromagnetic case, the GS density manifests various patterns of distributions, including facial-makeup states, petal states, topological fissure states, multiple-half-ring states and property-distinguished vertical and horizonal stripe states. We notice a peculiar phenomenon of density-phase separation in the sense that the variations of density and phase tend to be independent. In ferromagnetic case, the GS exhibits a semi-circular or half-disk status of density embedded with vortices and anti-vortices. The spin distribution can self-arrange into an array of half-skyrmions and we also find a half-antiskyrmion fence separating vortex-antivortex pairs. Our study indicates that one can manipulate the emergence of exotic quantum states via the interplay of the SOC, interaction and potential geometry and the abundant state variations might also provide potential resources for quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Electric field tunable spin-orbit gap in a bilayer graphene/WSe$_{2}$ quantum dot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the investigation of proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in a heterostructure of bilayer graphene (BLG) and tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$). A BLG quantum dot (QD) in the few-particle regime acts as a sensitive probe for induced SOC. Finite bias and magnetotransport spectroscopy measurements reveal a significantly enhanced SOC that decreases with the applied displacement field, distinguishing it from pristine BLG. We attribute this tunability to an increased layer localization of the QD states on the BLG layer distant to the WSe$_2$. Furthermore, our measurements demonstrate a reduced valley $g$-factor at larger displacement fields, consistent with a weaker lateral confinement of the QD. Our findings show evidence of the influence of WSe$_2$ across BLG layers, driven by reduced real-space confinement and increased layer localization at higher displacement fields. This study demonstrates the electrostatic tunability of spin-orbit gap in BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures, which is especially relevant for the field of spintronics and future spin qubit control in BLG QDs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08706v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the geodesics on the manifold of mixed quantum states for the Bures metric. It is shown that these geodesics correspond to physical non-Markovian evolutions of the system coupled to an ancilla. Furthermore, we argue that geodesics lead to optimal precision in single-parameter estimation in quantum metrology. More precisely, if the unknown parameter $x$ is a phase shift proportional to the time parametrizing the geodesic, the estimation error obtained by processing the data of measurements on the system is equal to the smallest error that can be achieved from joint detections on the system and ancilla, meaning that there is no information loss on this parameter in the ancilla. This error can saturate the Heisenberg bound. Reciprocally, assuming that the system-ancilla output and input states are related by a unitary $e^{-i x H}$ with $H$ a $x$-independent Hamiltonian, we show that if the error obtained from measurements on the system is equal to the minimal error obtained from joint measurements on the system and ancilla then the system evolution is given by a geodesic. In such a case, the measurement on the system bringing most information on $x$ is $x$-independent and can be determined in terms of the intersections of the geodesic with the boundary of quantum states. These results show that geodesic evolutions are of interest for high-precision detections in systems coupled to an ancilla in the absence of measurements on the ancilla.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the quantum data processing inequality and its refinements that are physically meaningful in the context of approximate recoverability. An important conjecture regarding this due to Seshadreesan et. al. in J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 48 (2015) is disproved. We prove some inequalities capturing universal approximate recoverability with the Petz recovery map for the sandwiched quasi and R\'enyi relative entropies for the parameter $t=2$. We also obtain convexity theorems on some parametrized versions of the relative entropy and fidelity, which can be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: Mathematical analysis of the spectral properties of the time evolution operator in quantum walks is crucial for understanding key dynamical behaviors such as localization and gaining insights into the long-term dynamics of quantum walks. Previous studies have shown that eigenvalue analysis using the transfer matrix method is particularly effective for space-inhomogeneous three-state quantum walks with specific classes of coin matrices, including Grover matrices. In this article, we extend these results by developing a more sophisticated transfer matrix framework applicable to three-state quantum walks with general coin matrices, enabling the analysis of a broader class of time evolution operators. Additionally, we perform numerical analyses to derive exact eigenvalues for models that were previously considered intractable, demonstrating the practical usefulness and applicability of our proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These are the lecture notes of the master's course "Quantum Computing", taught at Chalmers University of Technology every fall since 2020, with participation of students from RWTH Aachen and Delft University of Technology. The aim of this course is to provide a theoretical overview of quantum computing, excluding specific hardware implementations. Topics covered in these notes include quantum algorithms (such as Grover's algorithm, the quantum Fourier transform, phase estimation, and Shor's algorithm), variational quantum algorithms that utilise an interplay between classical and quantum computers [such as the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and the quantum approximate optimisation algorithm (QAOA), among others], quantum error correction, various versions of quantum computing (such as measurement-based quantum computation, adiabatic quantum computation, and the continuous-variable approach to quantum information), the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning, and quantum complexity theory. Lectures on these topics are compiled into 12 chapters, most of which contain a few suggested exercises at the end, and interspersed with four tutorials, which provide practical exercises as well as further details. At Chalmers, the course is taught in seven weeks, with three two-hour lectures or tutorials per week. It is recommended that the students taking the course have some previous experience with quantum physics, but not strictly necessary.</description>

Abstract: The Cram\'er-Rao bound serves as a crucial lower limit for the mean squared error of an estimator in frequentist parameter estimation. Paradoxically, it requires highly accurate prior knowledge of the estimated parameter for constructing the optimal unbiased estimator. In contrast, Bhattacharyya bounds offer a more robust estimation framework with respect to prior accuracy by introducing additional constraints on the estimator. In this work, we examine divergences that arise in the computation of these bounds and establish the conditions under which they remain valid. Notably, we show that when the number of constraints exceeds the number of measurement outcomes, an estimator with finite variance typically does not exist. Furthermore, we systematically investigate the properties of these bounds using paradigmatic examples, comparing them to the Cram\'er-Rao and Bayesian approaches.</description>

Abstract: Waveguides offer a means to controllably couple atomic ensembles to the electromagnetic field therein. Here, we demonstrate x-ray propagation in planar thin-film waveguides coupled to M\"ossbauer nuclei under collective resonant excitation by short pulses of synchrotron radiation. We record x-ray photons that have been emitted into resonant modes of the waveguide. Depending on the geometry and mode of excitation, two fundamentally different signatures of the collective emission are observed, for which we present a unifying theoretical model. Our results form a new platform for waveguide quantum electrodynamics in the hard x-ray regime with the potential to provide a coherent narrowband source of x-rays on the nanometer scale.</description>

      <title>Quantum Generative Learning for High-Resolution Medical Image Generation</title>

Abstract: Integration of quantum computing in generative machine learning models has the potential to offer benefits such as training speed-up and superior feature extraction. However, the existing quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) fail to generate high-quality images due to their patch-based, pixel-wise learning approaches. These methods capture only local details, ignoring the global structure and semantic information of images. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing a quantum image generative learning (QIGL) approach for high-quality medical image generation. Our proposed quantum generator leverages variational quantum circuit approach addressing scalability issues by extracting principal components from the images instead of dividing them into patches. Additionally, we integrate the Wasserstein distance within the QIGL framework to generate a diverse set of medical samples. Through a systematic set of simulations on X-ray images from knee osteoarthritis and medical MNIST datasets, our model demonstrates superior performance, achieving the lowest Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) scores compared to its classical counterpart and advanced QGAN models reported in the literature.</description>

Abstract: We propose an interferometric scheme where each photon returns one bit of the binary expansion of an unknown phase. It sets up a method for estimating the phase value at arbitrary uncertainty. This strategy is global, since it requires no prior information, and it achieves the Heisenberg bound independently of the output statistics. We provide simulations and a characterization of this architecture.</description>

      <title>Quantum random power method for ground state computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantum-classical hybrid random power method that approximates a ground state of a Hamiltonian. The quantum part of our method computes a fixed number of elements of a Hamiltonian-matrix polynomial via quantum polynomial filtering techniques with either Hamiltonian simulation or block encoding. The use of the techniques provides a computational advantage that may not be achieved classically in terms of the degree of the polynomial. The classical part of our method is a randomized iterative algorithm that takes as input the matrix elements computed from the quantum part and outputs an approximation of ground state of the Hamiltonian. We prove that with probability one, our method converges to an approximation of a ground state of the Hamiltonian, requiring a constant scaling of the per-iteration classical complexity. The required quantum circuit depth is independent of the initial overlap and has no or a square-root dependence on the spectral gap. The iteration complexity scales linearly as the dimension of the Hilbert space when the quantum polynomial filtering corresponds to a sparse matrix. We numerically validate this sparsity condition for well-known model Hamiltonians. We also present a lower bound of the fidelity, which depends on the magnitude of noise occurring from quantum computation regardless of its charateristics, if it is smaller than a critical value. Several numerical experiments demonstrate that our method provides a good approximation of ground state in the presence of systematic and/or sampling noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional absorption spectroscopy relies on coherent laser sources, and in turn suffers from the inherent limitation of shot noise, especially in estimating weak absorption. Here we propose a measurement strategy with correlated photons to determine the weak absorption by distinguishing the output with and without photons, dubbed as the on-off measurement. We demonstrate that absorption spectroscopy that incorporates quantum correlations is capable of estimating weak absorption down to a single-photon level, even in noisy environments, achieving a precision comparable to that obtained through 1000 photons in conventional absorption spectroscopy. Our strategy provides a new method to probe fragile systems with weak absorption, avoiding the occurrence of light-induced damage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16356v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for the study of multiparty entanglement by analyzing the behavior of collective variables. Throughout the manuscript, we explore a specific type of multiparty entanglement which can be detected through the fluctuation of a collective observable. We thoroughly analyze its properties and how it can be extended to mixed states while placing it within the context of the existing literature. The novelty of our approach also lies in the fact that we present a graphical point of view. This is done by introducing a spectral space on which the various properties of our entanglement quantifier have a direct pictorial interpretation. Notably, this approach proves particularly effective for assessing $k$-entanglement, as we show its ability to extend previously established inequalities. To enhance understanding, we also demonstrate how this framework applies to specific scenarios, encompassing both finite-dimensional cases and infinite-dimensional systems, the latter being exemplified by the time-frequency modal degree of freedom of co-propagating single photons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07676v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermodynamics is based on a coarse-grained approach, from which its fundamental variables emerge, effectively erasing the complicate details of the microscopic dynamics within a macroscopic system. The strength of Thermodynamics lies in the universality provided by this paradigm. In contrast, quantum mechanics focuses on describing the dynamics of microscopic systems, aiming to make predictions about experiments we perform, a goal shared by all fundamental physical theories, which are often framed as gauge theories in modern physics. Recently, a gauge theory for quantum thermodynamics was introduced, defining gauge invariant work and heat, and exploring their connections to quantum phenomena. In this work, we extend that theory in two significant ways. First, we incorporate energy spectrum degeneracies, which were previously overlooked. Additionally, we define gauge-invariant entropy, exploring its properties and connections to other physical and informational quantities. This results in a complete framework for quantum thermodynamics grounded in the principle of gauge invariance. To demonstrate some implications of this theory, we apply it to well-known critical systems.</description>

      <title>Compressing Hamiltonians with ab initio downfolding for simulating strongly-correlated materials on quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12237v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate first-principles description of strongly-correlated materials is an important and challenging problem in condensed matter physics. Ab initio downfolding has emerged as a way of deriving compressed many-body Hamiltonians that maintain the essential physics of strongly-correlated materials. The solution of these material-specific models is still exponentially difficult to generate on classical computers, but quantum algorithms allow for a significant speed-up in obtaining the ground states of these compressed Hamiltonians. Here we demonstrate that utilizing quantum algorithms for obtaining the properties of downfolded Hamiltonians can indeed yield high-fidelity solutions. By combining ab initio downfolding and variational quantum eigensolvers, we correctly predict the antiferromagnetic state of one-dimensional cuprate $\text{Ca}_2\text{CuO}_3$, the excitonic ground state of monolayer $\text{WTe}_2$, and the charge-ordered state of correlated metal $\text{SrVO}_3$. Numerical simulations utilizing a classical tensor network implementation of variational quantum eigensolvers allow us to simulate large models with up to $54$ qubits and encompassing up to four bands in the correlated subspace, which is indicative of the complexity that our framework can address. Through these methods we demonstrate the potential of classical pre-optimization and downfolding techniques for enabling efficient materials simulation using quantum algorithms.</description>

We describe how flow-based approaches can be combined with the replica trick using a custom neural-network architecture around a lattice defect connecting two replicas. Numerical tests for the $\phi^4$ scalar field theory in two and three dimensions demonstrate that our technique outperforms state-of-the-art Monte Carlo calculations, and exhibit a promising scaling with the defect size.</description>

      <title>Toward end-to-end quantum simulation for protein dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling and simulating the protein folding process overall remains a grand challenge in computational biology. We systematically investigate end-to-end quantum algorithms for simulating various protein dynamics with effects, such as mechanical forces or stochastic noises. A major focus is the read-in of system settings for simulation, for which we discuss (i) efficient quantum algorithms to prepare initial states--whether for ensemble or single-state simulations, in particular, the first efficient procedure for preparing Gaussian pseudo-random amplitude states, and (ii) the first efficient loading of the connectivity matrices of the protein structure. For the read-out stage, our algorithms estimate a range of classical observables, including energy, low-frequency vibrational modes, density of states, displacement correlations, and optimal control parameters. Between these stages, we simulate the dynamic evolution of the protein system, by using normal mode models--such as Gaussian network models (GNM) and all-atom normal mode models. In addition, we conduct classical numerical experiments focused on accurately estimating the density of states and applying optimal control to facilitate conformational changes. These experiments serve to validate our claims regarding potential quantum speedups. Overall, our study demonstrates that quantum simulation of protein dynamics represents a robust, end-to-end application for both early-stage and fully fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Linear-optical protocols for mitigating and suppressing noise in bosonic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum-information processing and computation with bosonic qubits are corruptible by noise channels. Using interferometers and photon-subtraction gadgets (PSGs) accompanied by linear amplification and attenuation, we establish linear-optical methods to mitigate and suppress bosonic noise channels. We first show that by employing amplifying and attenuating PSGs respectively at the input and output of either a thermal or random-displacement channel, probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) can be carried out to mitigate errors in expectation-value estimation. We also derive optimal physical estimators that are properly constrained to improve the sampling accuracy of PEC. Next, we prove that a purely-dephasing channel is coherently suppressible using a multimode Mach--Zehnder interferometer and conditional vacuum measurements (VMZ). In the limit of infinitely-many ancillas, with nonvanishing success rates, VMZ using either Hadamard or two-design interferometers turns any dephasing channel into a phase-space-rotated linear-attenuation channel that can subsequently be inverted with (rotated) linear amplification without Kerr nonlinearity. Moreover, for weak central-Gaussian dephasing, the suppression fidelity increases monotonically with the number of ancillas and most optimally with Hadamard interferometers. We demonstrate the performance of these linear-optical mitigation and suppression schemes on common noise channels (and their compositions) and popular bosonic codes. While the theoretical formalism pertains to idling noise channels, we also provide numerical evidence supporting mitigation and suppression capabilities with respect to noise from universal gate operations.</description>

Abstract: Ergodicity has been one of the fundamental concepts underpinning our understanding of thermalization in isolated systems since the first developments in classical statistical mechanics. Recently, a similar notion has been introduced for quantum systems, termed complete Hilbert space ergodicity (CHSE), in which the evolving quantum state explores all of the available Hilbert space. This contrasts with the eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis (ETH), in which thermalisation is formulated via the properties of matrix elements of local operators in the energy eigenbasis. In this work we explore how ETH-violation mechanisms, including quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation can affect complete Hilbert space ergodicity. We find that the presence of these mechanisms leads to CHSE in decoupled subspaces, a phenomenon we call Hilbert Subspace Ergodicity, and which represents a protocol for constructing t-designs in subspaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kernel methods map data into high-dimensional spaces, enabling linear algorithms to learn nonlinear functions without explicitly storing the feature vectors. Quantum kernel methods promise efficient learning by encoding feature maps into exponentially large Hilbert spaces inherent in quantum systems. In this work, we implement quantum kernels on a 10-qubit star-topology register in a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) platform. We experimentally encode classical data in the evolution of multiple quantum coherence orders using data-dependent unitary transformations and then demonstrate one-dimensional regression and two-dimensional classification tasks. By extending the register to a double-layered star configuration, we propose an extended quantum kernel to handle non-parametrized operator inputs. Specifically, we set up a kernel for the classification of entangling and non-entangling operations and then validate this kernel first numerically by computing it on a double-layered star register and then experimentally by computing it on a three-qubit NMR register. Our results show that this kernel exhibits an ability to generalize well over unseen data. These results confirm that quantum kernels possess strong capabilities in classical as well as quantum machine learning tasks.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a family of high-rate amplitude-damping (AD) Shor Codes, designed to effectively correct AD errors while maintaining immunity to collective coherent (CC) errors. The proposed $[[(w+1)(w+K), K]]$ AD codes can approximately correct up to $w$ AD errors, with flexible parameters $(w, K)$, and we provide a rigorous proof that these codes satisfy the approximate quantum error correction conditions. These codes leverage structured stabilizer measurements, enabling efficient detection of AD errors using only local operations and ancillary qubits. We further construct a family of CC-AD Shor codes by concatenating these AD codes with the dual-rail code.</description>

Abstract: We present fast parallel rearrangement of single atoms in optical tweezers into arbitrary geometries by updating holograms displayed by an ultra fast spatial light modulator. Using linear interpolation of the tweezer position and the optical phase between the start and end arrays, we can calculate and display holograms every few ms, limited by technology. To show the versatility of our method, we sort the same atomic sample into multiple geometries with success probabilities of 0.997(2) per rearrangement cycle. This makes the method a useful tool for rearranging large atom arrays for quantum computation and quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithm for the gradient of a logarithm-determinant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The logarithm-determinant is a common quantity in many areas of physics and computer science. Derivatives of the logarithm-determinant compute physically relevant quantities in statistical physics models, quantum field theories, as well as the inverses of matrices. A multi-variable version of the quantum gradient algorithm is developed here to evaluate the derivative of the logarithm-determinant. From this, the inverse of a sparse-rank input operator may be determined efficiently. Measuring an expectation value of the quantum state--instead of all $N^2$ elements of the input operator--can be accomplished in $O(k\sigma)$ time in the idealized case for $k$ relevant eigenvectors of the input matrix. A factor $\sigma=\frac1{\varepsilon^3}$ or $-\frac1{\varepsilon^2}\log_2\varepsilon$ depends on the version of the quantum Fourier transform used for a precision $\varepsilon$. Practical implementation of the required operator will likely need $\log_2N$ overhead, giving an overall complexity of $O(k\sigma\log_2 N)$. The method applies widely and converges super-linearly in $k$ when the condition number is high. The best classical method we are aware of scales as $N$.
  Given the same resource assumptions as other algorithms, such that an equal superposition of eigenvectors is available efficiently, the algorithm is evaluated in the practical case as $O(\sigma\log_2 N)$. The output is given in $O(1)$ queries of oracle, which is given explicitly here and only relies on time-evolution operators that can be implemented with arbitrarily small error. The algorithm is envisioned for fully error-corrected quantum computers but may be implementable on near-term machines. We discuss how this algorithm can be used for kernel-based quantum machine-learning.</description>

      <title>Impossibility of Quantum Private Queries</title>

Abstract: Symmetric private information retrieval is a cryptographic task allowing a user to query a database and obtain exactly one entry without revealing to the owner of the database which element was accessed. The task is a variant of general two-party protocols called one-sided secure function evaluation and is closely related to oblivious transfer. Under the name quantum private queries, quantum protocols have been proposed to solve this problem in a cheat-sensitive way: In such protocols, it is not impossible for dishonest participants to cheat, but they risk detection [V. Giovannetti, S. Lloyd, and L. Maccone, Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 230502 (2008)]. We give an explicit attack against any cheat-sensitive symmetric private information retrieval protocol, showing that any protocol that is secure for the user cannot have non-trivial security guarantees for the owner of the database.</description>

      <title>Quantum enhanced beam tracking surpassing the Heisenberg uncertainty limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining a beam's full trajectory requires tracking both its position and momentum (angular) information. However, the product of position and momentum uncertainty in a simultaneous measurement of the two parameters is bound by the Heisenberg uncertainty limit (HUL). In this work, we present a proof-of-principle demonstration of a quantum-enhanced beam tracking technique, leveraging the inherent position and momentum entanglement between photons produced via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). We show that quantum entanglement can be exploited to achieve a beam tracking accuracy beyond the HUL in a simultaneous measurement. Moreover, with existing detection technologies, it is already possible to achieve near real-time beam tracking capabilities at the single-photon level. The technique also exhibits high resilience to background influences, with negligible reduction in tracking accuracy even when subjected to a disruptive beam that is significantly brighter than SPDC.</description>

      <title>Tripartite Haar random state has no bipartite entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that no EPR-like bipartite entanglement can be distilled from a tripartite Haar random state $|\Psi\rangle_{ABC}$ by local unitaries or local operations when each subsystem $A$, $B$, or $C$ has fewer than half of the total qubits. Specifically, we derive an upper bound on the probability of sampling a state with EPR-like entanglement at a given EPR fidelity tolerance, showing a doubly-exponential suppression in the number of qubits. Our proof relies on a simple volume argument supplemented by an $\epsilon$-net argument and concentration of measure. Viewing $|\Psi\rangle_{ABC}$ as a bipartite quantum error-correcting code $C\to AB$, this implies that neither output subsystem $A$ nor $B$ supports any non-trivial logical operator. We also discuss a physical interpretation in the AdS/CFT correspondence, indicating that a connected entanglement wedge does not necessarily imply bipartite entanglement, contrary to a previous belief.</description>

      <title>Simulating Noncausality with Quantum Control of Causal Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Logical consistency with free local operations is compatible with non-trivial classical communications, where all parties can be both in each other's past and future - a phenomenon known as noncausality. Noncausal processes, such as the ''Lugano (AF/BW) process'', violate causal inequalities, yet their physical realizability remains an open question. In contrast, the quantum switch - a physically realizable process with indefinite causal order - can only generate causal correlations. Building on a recently established equivalence [Kunjwal and Baumeler, PRL 131, 120201 (2023)] between the SHIFT measurement, which exhibits nonlocality without entanglement, and the Lugano process, we demonstrate that the SHIFT measurement can be implemented using a quantum switch of classical communications in a scenario with quantum inputs. This shows that the structure of the Lugano process can be simulated by a quantum switch and that successful SHIFT discrimination witnesses causal nonseparability rather than noncausality, refuting prior claims. Finally, we identify a broad class of ''superposition of classical communications'' derived from classical processes without global past capable of realizing similar causally indefinite measurements. We examine these results in relation to the ongoing debate on implementations of indefinite causal orders.</description>

      <title>Direct Gradient Computation for Barren Plateaus in Parameterized Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The barren plateau phenomenon, where the gradients of parametrized quantum circuits become vanishingly small, poses a significant challenge in quantum machine learning. While previous studies attempted to explain the barren plateau phenomenon using the Weingarten formula, the reliance on the Weingarten formula leads to inaccurate conclusions. In this study, we consider a unitary operator \(U\) consisting of rotation gates and perform an exact calculation of the expectation required for the gradient computation. Our approach allows us to obtain the gradient expectation and variance directly. Our analysis reveals that gradient expectations are not zero, as opposed to the results derived using the Weingarten formula, but depend on the number of qubits in the system. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the number of effective parameters, circuit depth, and gradient variance are interconnected in deep parameterized quantum circuits. Numerical simulations further confirm the validity of our theoretical results. Our approach provides a more accurate framework for analyzing quantum circuit optimization.</description>

      <title>On the similarity of bandwidth-tuned quantum kernels and classical kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum kernels (QK) are widely used in quantum machine learning applications; yet, their potential to surpass classical machine learning methods on classical datasets remains uncertain. This limitation can be attributed to the exponential concentration phenomenon, which can impair both trainability and generalization. A common strategy to alleviate this is bandwidth tuning, which involves rescaling data points in the quantum model to improve generalization. In this work, we numerically demonstrate that optimal bandwidth tuning results in QKs that closely resemble radial basis function (RBF) kernels, leading to a lack of quantum advantage over classical methods. Moreover, we reveal that the size of optimal bandwidth tuning parameters further simplifies QKs, causing them to behave like polynomial kernels, corresponding to a low-order Taylor approximation of a RBF kernel. We thoroughly investigate this for fidelity quantum kernels and projected quantum kernels using various data encoding circuits across several classification datasets. We provide numerical evidence and derive a simple analytical model that elucidates how bandwidth tuning influences key quantities in classification tasks. Overall, our findings shed light on the mechanisms that render QK methods classically simulatable.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency, Low-Loss Floquet-mode Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advancing fault-tolerant quantum computing and fundamental science necessitates quantum-limited amplifiers with near-ideal quantum efficiency and multiplexing capability. However, existing solutions typically achieve one at the expense of the other. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the first Floquet-mode traveling-wave parametric amplifier (Floquet TWPA), which achieves nearly quantum-limited noise performance, minimal dissipation, and broadband operation, breaking the presumption that broadband amplifiers introduce higher noise. We achieve a system measurement efficiency of $65.1\pm5.8\%$ when measuring a superconducting qubit, which to our knowledge is the highest-reported in a superconducting qubit readout experiment utilizing phase-preserving amplifiers. Our device exhibits $&gt;20$-dB amplification over a $3$-GHz instantaneous bandwidth, $&lt;\!0.5\,$-dB average in-band insertion loss, and the highest reported intrinsic quantum efficiency for a TWPA of $92.1\pm7.6\%$, relative to an ideal phase-preserving amplifier. Fabricated in a superconducting qubit process, these general-purpose Floquet TWPAs are suitable for fast, high-fidelity multiplexed readout in large-scale quantum systems and future monolithic integration with quantum processors.</description>

Abstract: The $k$-partite entanglement, which focus on at most how many particles in the global system are entangled but separable from other particles, is complementary to the $k$-entanglement that reflects how many splitted subsystems are entangled under partitions of the systems in characterizing multipartite entanglement. Very recently, the theory of the complete $k$-entanglement measure has been established in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 012405 (2024)]. Here we investigate whether we can define the complete measure of the $k$-partite entanglement. Consequently, with the same spirit as that of the complete $k$-entanglement measure, we present the axiomatic conditions that a complete $k$-partite entanglement measure should require. Furthermore, we present two classes of $k$-partite entanglement measures and discuss the completeness of them as illustrations.</description>

      <title>First Measurement of Entanglement Dynamics in the SYK Model using Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, fundamental to quantum chaos, many-body physics, and holographic duality, exhibits both maximal chaos and exact solvability, yet its entanglement entropy has never been measured experimentally. Here, we present the first measurement of entanglement entropy growth under the SYK Hamiltonian using IBM's superconducting quantum computer as a programmable quantum platform. We implement an optimized swap-based many-body interference protocol tailored for limited qubit connectivity to measure entanglement entropy. Additionally, we enhance the randomized measurement protocol for entropy measurement by expanding the unitary ensemble, which increases the circuit volume and pushes the capability of the near-term devices. However, we tackle this challenge by employing a quantum multi-programming strategy that parallelizes circuit execution. This work paves the way for exploring chaotic quantum dynamics and establishes scalable methods for investigating complex entanglement growth on current quantum platforms.</description>

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) is a novel multi-layer neuromorphic network. Many groups worldwide have studied this network, including image processing, time series analysis, solving physical problems, and practical applications such as medical use. Therefore, we propose an Adaptive Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (VQKAN) that takes advantage of KAN for Variational Quantum Algorithms in an adaptive manner. The Adaptive VQKAN is VQKAN that uses adaptive ansatz as the ansatz and repeat VQKAN growing the ansatz just like Adaptive Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). The scheme inspired by Adaptive VQE is promised to ascend the accuracy of VQKAN to practical value. As a result, Adaptive VQKAN has been revealed to calculate the fitting problem more accurately and faster than Quantum Neural Networks by far less number of parametric gates.</description>

      <title>Double-bracket algorithm for quantum signal processing without post-selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP), a framework for implementing matrix-valued polynomials, is a fundamental primitive in various quantum algorithms. Despite its versatility, a potentially underappreciated challenge is that all systematic protocols for implementing QSP rely on post-selection. This can impose prohibitive costs for tasks when amplitude amplification cannot sufficiently improve the success probability. For example, in the context of ground-state preparation, this occurs when using a too poor initial state. In this work, we introduce a new formula for implementing QSP transformations of Hermitian matrices, which requires neither auxiliary qubits nor post-selection. Rather, using approximation to the exact unitary synthesis, we leverage the theory of the double-bracket quantum algorithms to provide a new quantum algorithm for QSP, termed Double-Bracket QSP (DB-QSP). The algorithm requires the energy and energetic variance of the state to be measured at each step and has a recursive structure, which leads to circuit depths that can grow super exponentially with the degree of the polynomial. With these strengths and caveats in mind, DB-QSP should be viewed as complementing the established QSP toolkit. In particular, DB-QSP can deterministically implement low-degree polynomials to "warm start" QSP methods involving post-selection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extreme sensitivity of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians exhibiting the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) has been extensively studied in recent years with well-established theoretical explanations. However, this sensitivity is often overlooked in numerical simulations, leading to unreliable results. In this work, we reexamine Hatano-Nelson and symplectic Hatano-Nelson models studied in previous work [Kawabata \textit{et al}., Phys. Rev. X 13, 021007 (2023)], and compare their results with our high-precision calculations. We systematically investigate inaccuracies in physical results arising from numerical instability during diagonalization and non-Hermitian Hamiltonian evolution. We find that these instabilities arise from a large condition number that scales exponentially with system size due to the NHSE, signaling strong non-normality. Strikingly, a reliable spectrum alone is shown to be insufficient for accurate non-Hermitian evolution, while the reliability of wave functions plays a more critical role. Our findings underscore the necessity of evaluating the condition number to ensure the validity of numerical studies on systems with NHSE, implying that some prior numerical findings in this area may require careful reexamination.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the interaction between two monoidal structures: a multiplicative one, for the encoding of pairing, and an additive one, for the encoding of choice. We propose a colored PROP to model computation in this framework, where the choice is parameterized by an algebraic side effect: the model can support regular tests, probabilistic and non-deterministic branching, as well as quantum branching, i.e. superposition.
  The graphical language comes equipped with a denotational semantics based on linear applications, and an equational theory. We prove the language to be universal, and the equational theory to be complete with respect to this semantics.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we present several improvements of the non-relativistic Friedrichs-Lee model with multiple discrete and continuous states and still retain its solvability. Our findings establish a solid theoretical basis for the exploration of resonance phenomena in scenarios involving multiple interfering states across various channels. The scattering amplitudes associated with the continuum states naturally adhere to coupled-channel unitarity, rendering this framework particularly valuable for investigating hadronic resonant states appearing in multiple coupled channels. Moreover, this generalized framework exhibits a wide-range applicability, enabling investigations into resonance phenomena across diverse physical domains, including hadron physics, nuclear physics, optics, and cold atom physics, among others.</description>

Abstract: Most approaches towards a quantum theory of gravitation indicate the existence of a minimal length scale of the order of the Planck length. Quantum mechanical models incorporating such an intrinsic length scale call for a deformation of Heisenberg's algebra resulting in a generalized uncertainty principle and constitute what is called gravitational quantum mechanics. Utilizing the position representation of this deformed algebra, we study various models of gravitational quantum mechanics. The free time evolution of a Gaussian wave packet is investigated as well as the spectral properties of a particle bound by an external attractive potential. Here the cases of a box with infinite walls and an attractive potential well of finite depth are considered.</description>

Abstract: Theoretical considerations are made for the nuclear excitation from the ground state to the 8 eV $^{229m}$Th isomer via near-resonant electron transitions in Sb-like ($q=39+$) thorium ions. The energy of the first excited atomic state ($J=7/2$) in the $^{229}$Th$^{39+}$ ion is estimated to be 8.308$\pm$0.069 eV, which is very close to the new reference value for the $^{229m}$Th nuclear isomer energy, 8.356 eV [Zhang et al., Nature 633, 63 (2024)]. Therefore, the $^{229}$Th$^{39+}$ ion provides a unique opportunity to study the nuclear excitation by electron transition process under well-defined atomic conditions in the regime of extremely low nuclear excitation energy. Our results indicate that the upper theoretical limit for the $^{229m}$Th isomer excitation rate reaches an enormous value of $1.27\times10^{16}$ s$^{-1}$ at resonance ($\Delta=0$ meV), but drops many orders of magnitude for the value of electronic transition energy within its uncertainty interval. Additionally, it was shown that using an electron beam ion trap, the production of the $^{229}$Th isomer can reach rates ranging from a few to approximately $7\times10^{19}$ $^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Puncturing Quantum Stabilizer Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical coding theory contains several techniques to obtain new codes from other codes, including puncturing and shortening. For quantum codes, a form of puncturing is known, but its description is based on the code space rather than its generators. In this work, we generalize the puncturing procedure to allow more freedom in the choice of which coded states are kept and which are removed. We describe this puncturing by focusing on the stabilizer matrix containing the generators of the code. In this way, we are able to explicitly describe the stabilizer matrix of the punctured code given the stabilizer matrix of the original stabilizer code. The additional freedom in the procedure also opens up new ways to construct new codes from old, and we present several ways to utilize this for the search of codes with good or even optimal parameters. In particular, we use the construction to obtain codes whose parameters exceed the best previously known. Lastly, we generalize the proof of the Griesmer bound from the classical setting to stabilizer codes since the proof relies heavily on the puncturing technique.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the classic Joule-expansion experiments, now with a quantum-degenerate atomic Bose gas. In contrast to the classical-gas experiments, where no temperature change was measured, here we observe and quantitatively explain both cooling and heating effects, which arise, respectively, due to quantum statistics and inter-particle interactions.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Vacuum-Induced Chiral Spin Liquids in Kagome Lattices: Tuning and Probing Topological Quantum Phases via Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological phases in frustrated quantum magnetic systems have captivated researchers for decades, with the chiral spin liquid (CSL) standing out as one of the most compelling examples. Featured by long-range entanglement, topological order, and exotic fractional excitations, the CSL has inspired extensive exploration for practical realizations. In this work, we demonstrate that CSLs can emerge in a kagome lattice driven by vacuum quantum fluctuations within a single-mode chiral cavity. The chiral cavity imprints quantum fluctuations with time-reversal symmetry breaking, fostering chiral interactions among electrons and stabilizing a robust CSL phase without external laser excitation. Moreover, we identify experimentally accessible observables -- such as average photon number and transport properties -- that reveal connections between photon dynamics and the emergent chiral order. Our findings establish a novel pathway for creating, controlling, and probing topological and symmetry-breaking quantum phases in strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>The thread embodiment of holographic quantum entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically develop a quantum thread picture that characterizes the entanglement structure of holographic duality. Behind this construction lies a simple philosophy: holographic quantum entanglement can be visualized by thread-like objects. Inspired by tensor network models and the earlier concept of bit threads, we propose rules governing the trajectories of quantum threads in the holographic bulk. These rules not only carry meaningful interpretations at the level of quantum information theory but also determine that the quantum threads travel along geodesics in the holographic bulk. This makes kinematic space a tailor-made language for describing quantum thread configurations. We hope that the quantum thread method can provide necessary constraints or useful guidance for constructing genuine holographic tensor networks beyond toy models.</description>

      <title>Level-anticrossing in B(E2) anomaly (I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a new mechanism for explaining the B(E2) anomaly was given by F. Pan \emph{et al.} (PRC, 110, 054324, 2024), which is realized in the parameter region from the SU(3) symmetry limit to the O(6) symmetry limit, and seems to be not related to the SU(3) symmetry. However, through SU(3) analysis, a new technique proposed recently, we found that it is not so. The new mechanism is related to level-anticrossing phenomenon, which is related to level-crossing phenomenon in the SU(3) symmetry limit. By incorporating previous ideas, we have a more general explanatory framework for the B(E2) anomaly, which is important for understanding some higher-order interactions in the interacting boson model. Through analysis, it is shown that level-anticrossing in this mechanism mainly results from the third-order interaction $[\hat{L}\times \hat{Q}_{\chi} \times \hat{L}]^{(0)}$. Finally, the B(E2) anomaly in $^{170}$Os is also discussed within this general framework.</description>

      <title>Impact of the Sagnac Effect on Thermodynamic and Magnetocaloric Properties of a Rotating Two-Dimensional Electron Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the impact of the Sagnac effect on the thermodynamic properties of a non-interacting two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a rotating sample under the influence of a uniform magnetic field. We derive an analytical expression for the energy spectrum using an effective Hamiltonian that incorporates inertial forces, and then apply canonical ensemble statistical mechanics to evaluate thermodynamic quantities. The results show that rotation modifies the energy levels, the application of a magnetic field leads to the formation of Landau levels further altered by rotation and gravitational mass, and thermodynamic quantities (internal energy, specific heat, free energy, entropy, magnetization, and magnetocaloric effect) exhibit a strong dependence on these parameters. In particular, the difference between effective mass $m^*$ and gravitational mass $m_G$ influences magnetization and the magnetocaloric effect, with negative rotations potentially inducing a cooling effect when these masses are distinct. We conclude that rotational effects and effective mass properties are crucial for understanding the thermodynamics of electronic systems under magnetic fields, with implications for thermal modulation in semiconductor materials.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Numerical Renormalization Group: Solution of the non-Hermitian Kondo model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonians describe open quantum systems, nonequilibrium dynamics, and dissipative processes. Although a rich range of single-particle NH physics has been uncovered, many-body phenomena in strongly correlated NH systems have been far less well studied. The Kondo effect, an important paradigm for strong correlation physics, has recently been considered in the NH setting. Here we develop a NH generalization of the numerical renormalization group (NRG) and use it to solve the NH Kondo model. Our non-perturbative solution applies beyond weak coupling, and we uncover a nontrivial phase diagram. The method is showcased by application to the NH pseudogap Kondo model, which we show supports a completely novel phase with a genuine NH stable fixed point and complex eigenspectrum. Our NH-NRG code, which can be used in regimes and for models inaccessible to, e.g., perturbative scaling and Bethe ansatz, is provided open source.</description>
