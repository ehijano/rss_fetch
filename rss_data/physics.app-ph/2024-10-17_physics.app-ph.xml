      <title>Acoustic shape-morphing micromachines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shape transformation is crucial for the survival, adaptation, predation, defense, and reproduction of organisms in complex environments. It also serves as a key mechanism for the development of various applications, including soft robotics, biomedical systems, and flexible electronic devices. However, among the various deformation actuation modes, the design of deformable structures, the material response characteristics, and the miniaturization of devices remain challenges. As materials and structures are scaled down to the microscale, their performance becomes strongly correlated with size, leading to significant changes in, or even the failure of, many physical mechanisms that are effective at the macroscale. Additionally, electrostatic forces, surface tension, and viscous forces dominate at the microscale, making it difficult for structures to deform or causing them to fracture easily during deformation. Moreover, despite the prominence of acoustic actuation among various deformation drive modes, it has received limited attention. Here, we introduce an acoustical shape-morphing micromachine (ASM) that provides shape variability through a pair of microbubbles and the micro-hinges connecting them. When excited by external acoustic field, interaction forces are generated between these microbubbles, providing the necessary force and torque for the deformation of the entire micromachine within milliseconds. We established programmable design principles for ASM, enabling the forward and inverse design of acoustic deformation, precise programming, and information storage. Furthermore, we adjusted the amplitude of acoustic excitation to demonstrate the controllable switching of the micromachine among various modes. By showcasing the micro bird, we illustrated the editing of multiple modes, achieving a high degree of controllability, stability, and multifunctionality.</description>

      <title>Broadband millimeter-wave frequency mixer based on thin-film lithium niobate photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency mixers are fundamental components in modern wireless communication and radar systems, responsible for up- and down-conversion of target radio-frequency (RF) signals. Recently, photonic-assisted RF mixers have shown unique advantages over traditional electronic counterparts, including broad operational bandwidth, flat frequency response, and immunity to electromagnetic interference. However, current integrated photonic mixers face significant challenges in achieving efficient conversion at high frequencies, especially in millimeter-wave bands, due to the limitations of existing electro-optic (EO) modulators. Additionally, high-frequency local oscillators in the millimeter-wave range are often difficult to obtain and expensive, leading to unsatisfactory cost and restricted operational bandwidth in practice. In this paper, we harness the exceptional EO property and scalability of thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic platform to implement a high-performance harmonic reconfigurable millimeter-wave mixer. The TFLN photonic circuit integrates a broadband EO modulator that allows for extensive frequency coverage, and an EO frequency comb source that significantly reduces the required carrier frequency of the local oscillator. We experimentally demonstrate fully reconfigurable frequency down-conversion across a broad operational bandwidth ranging from 20 GHz to 67 GHz, with a large intermediate frequency of 20 GHz, as well as up-conversion to frequencies of up to 110 GHz. Our integrated photonic mixing system shows dramatically improved bandwidth performance, along with competitive indicators of frequency conversion efficiency and spurious suppression ratio, positioning it as a promising solution for future millimeter-wave transceivers in next-generation communication and sensing systems.</description>

      <title>Bulk-Boundary Correspondence in 2D Photonics: Analysis and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The centerpiece of topological photonics is the bulk-boundary correspondence principle (BBCP), which relates discrete invariants of the Bloch bands to the possible presence of topologically protected interface modes between two periodic heterostructures. In addition to the fundamental significance of BBCP, interface modes are of interest in a variety of applications. In Maxwell's electrodynamics, the BBCP has been rigorously proved for 1D and "1.5D" problems (in the latter, fields and wave vectors generally have two components, while the mathematical equations can still be reduced to 1D). The 2D Maxwell case, however, is qualitatively different, because the boundary conditions involve nontrivial Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps rather than scalar impedances as in 1D. The theoretical analysis and numerical examples presented in the paper are fully consistent with the BBCP. Moreover, the BBCP is closely connected with the positivity of electromagnetic energy density, as was also shown to be the case in 1D and 1.5D.</description>

      <title>Phase retrieval via media diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies phase retrieval for wave fields, aiming to recover the phase of an incoming wave from multi-plane intensity measurements behind different types of linear and nonlinear media. We show that unique phase retrieval can be achieved by utilizing intensity data produced by multiple media. This uniqueness does not require prescribed boundary conditions for the phase in the incidence plane, in contrast to existing phase retrieval methods based on the transport of intensity equation. Moreover, the uniqueness proofs lead to explicit phase reconstruction algorithms. Numerical simulations are presented to validate the theory.</description>

      <title>A Versatile Side Entry Laser System for Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the design and implementation of a side entry laser system designed for an ultra-high vacuum scanning transmission electron microscope. This system uses a versatile probe design enclosed in a vacuum envelope such that parts can be easily aligned, modified, or exchanged without disturbing the vacuum. The system uses a mirror mounted on the sample holder such that the sample can be illuminated without being tilted. Notably the mirror can be removed and replaced with an ablation target and a higher power laser used to ablate material directly onto the sample. We argue that new capabilities hold the potential to transform the electron microscope from an analysis tool towards a more flexible synthesis system, where atomic scale fabrication and atom-by-atom experiments can be performed.</description>

      <title>High detectivity terahertz radiation sensing using frequency-noise-optimized nanomechanical resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We achieve high detectivity terahertz sensing using a silicon nitride nanomechanical resonator functionalized with a metasurface absorber. High performances are achieved by striking a fine balance between the frequency stability of the resonator, and its responsivity to absorbed radiation. Using this approach, we demonstrate a detectivity $D^*=3.4\times10^9~\mathrm{cm\cdot\sqrt{Hz}/W}$ and a noise equivalent power $\mathrm{NEP}=36~\mathrm{pW/\sqrt{Hz}}$ that outperform the best room-temperature on-chip THz detectors (i.e., pyroelectrics). Our optical absorber consists of a 1-mm diameter metasurface, which currently enables a 0.5-3 THz detection range but can easily be scaled to other frequencies in the THz and infrared ranges. In addition to demonstrating high-performance terahertz sensing, our work unveils an important fundamental trade-off between high frequency stability and high responsivity in thermal-based nanomechanical radiation sensors.</description>

      <title>Complex-valued scatter compensation in nonlinear microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear, i.e., multi-photon microscopy is a powerful technique for imaging deep into biological tissues. Its penetration depth can be increased further using adaptive optics. In this work, we present a fast, feedback-based adaptive-optics algorithm, termed C-DASH, for multi-photon imaging through multiply-scattering media. C-DASH utilises complex-valued light shaping (i.e., joint shaping of amplitude and phase), which offers several advantages over phase-only techniques: it converges faster, it delivers higher image quality enhancement, it shows a robust performance largely insensitive to the axial position of the correction plane, and it has a higher ability to cope with, on the one hand, scattering media that vary over time and, on the other hand, scattering media that are partially absorbing. Furthermore, our method is practically self-aligning. We also present a simple way to implement C-DASH using a single reflection off a phase-only spatial light modulator. We provide a thorough characterisation of our method, presenting results of numerical simulations as well as two-photon excited fluorescence imaging experiments.</description>
