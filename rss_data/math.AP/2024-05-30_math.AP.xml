      <title>The spreading of global solutions of chemotaxis systems with logistic source and consumption on $\mathbb{R}^{N}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the spreading properties of globally defined bounded positive solutions of a chemotaxis system featuring a logistic source and consumption: \[ \left\{ \begin{aligned} &amp;\partial_tu=\Delta u - \chi\nabla\cdot(u\nabla v)+ u(a-bu),\quad &amp;(t,x)\in [0,\infty)\times\mathbb{R}^N, \\ &amp;{\tau \partial_tv}=\Delta v-uv,\quad &amp; (t,x)\in [0,\infty)\times\mathbb{R}^N, \end{aligned} \right. \] where $u(t,x)$ represents the population density of a biological species, and $v(t,x)$ denotes the density of a chemical substance. Key findings of this study include: (i) the species spreads at least at the speed $c^*=2\sqrt a$ (equalling the speed when $v\equiv 0$), suggesting that the chemical substance does not hinder the spreading; (ii) the chemical substance does not induce infinitely fast spreading of $u$; (iii) the spreading speed remains unaffected under conditions that $v(0,\cdot)$ decays spatially or $0&lt;-\chi\ll 1$ and $\tau=1$. Additionally, our numerical simulations reveal a noteworthy phase transition in $\chi$: for $v(0, \cdot)$ uniformly distributed across space, the spreading speed accelerates only when $\chi$ surpasses a critical positive value.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation for a Class of Indefinite Elliptic Systems by Comparison Theory for the Spectral Flow via an Index Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider families of strongly indefinite systems of elliptic PDE and investigate bifurcation from a trivial branch of solutions by using the spectral flow. The novelty in our approach is a refined version of a comparison principle that was originally proved by Pejsachowicz in a joint work with the third author, and which is based on an index theorem for a certain class of Fredholm operators that is of independent interest. Finally, we use our findings for a bifurcation problem on shrinking domains that originates from works of Morse and Smale.</description>

      <title>The hot spots conjecture for some non-convex polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an elementary new proof of the hot spots conjecture for L-shaped domains. This result, in addition to a new eigenvalue inequality, allows us to locate the hot spots in Swiss cross translation surfaces. We then prove, in several cases, that first mixed Dirichlet-Neumann eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on L-shaped domains also have no interior critical points. As a combination of these results, we prove the hot spots conjecture for five classes of domains tiled by L-shaped domains, including a class of non-simply connected domains. An interesting feature of the proofs is that we make positive use of the lack of regularity of eigenfunctions on non-convex polygons.</description>

      <title>Existence, Uniqueness and Asymptotic Dynamics of Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equations With Quasi-Periodic Initial Data: I. The Standard NLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first part of a two-paper series studying nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with quasi-periodic initial data. In this paper, we consider the standard nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. Under the assumption that the Fourier coefficients of the initial data obey a power-law upper bound, we establish local existence of a solution that retains quasi-periodicity in space with a slightly weaker Fourier decay. Moreover, the solution is shown to be unique within this class of quasi-periodic functions. In addition, for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with small nonlinearity, within the time scale, as the small parameter of nonlinearity tends to zero, we prove that the nonlinear solution converges asymptotically to the linear solution with respect to both the sup-norm $\|\cdot\|_{L_x^\infty(\mathbb R)}$ and the Sobolev-norm $\|\cdot\|_{H^s_x(\mathbb R)}$.
  The proof proceeds via a consideration of an associated infinite system of coupled ordinary differential equations for the Fourier coefficients and a combinatorial analysis of the resulting tree expansion of the coefficients. For this purpose, we introduce a Feynman diagram for the Picard iteration and $\ast^{[\cdot]}$ to denote the complex conjugate label.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the initial value problem associated to the low dispersion fractionary Benjamin-Bona-Mahony equation, fBBM. Our aim is to establish local persistence results in weighted Sobolev spaces and to obtain unique continuation results that imply that those results above are sharp. Hence, arbitrary polynomial type decay is not preserved by the fBBM flow.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the solutions to the non-homogeneous double obstacle problems with Orlicz growth involving measure data. After establishing the existence of the solutions to this problem in the Orlicz-Sobolev space, we derive a pointwise gradient estimate for these solutions by Riesz potential, which leads to the result on the $C^1$ regularity criterion.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the defocusing nonlinear wave equation $-\partial_t^2u+\Delta u=|u|^{p-1}u$ in $\mathbb R\times \mathbb R^d$. Building on our companion work ({\it \small Self-similar imploding solutions of the relativistic Euler equations}), we prove that for $d=4, p\geq 29$ and $d\geq 5, p\geq 17$, there exists a smooth complex-valued solution that blows up in finite time.</description>

      <title>On the weak Harnack inequalities for nonlocal double phase problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to studying the weak Harnack inequalities for nonlocal double phase functionals by using expansion of positivity, whose prototype is $$ \iint_{\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}^n} \left(\frac{|u(x)-u(y)|^p}{|x-y|^{n+sp}}+a(x,y)\frac{|u(x)-u(y)|^q}{|x-y|^{n+tq}}\right) \,dxdy $$ with $a\ge0$ and $0&lt;s\le t&lt;1&lt;p\le q$. The core of our approach is to establish several measure theoretical estimates based on the nonlocal Caccioppoli-type inequality, where the challenges consist in controlling subtle interaction between the pointwise behaviour of modulating coefficient and the growth exponents. Meanwhile, a quantitative boundedness result on the minimizer of such functionals is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Periodic localized traveling waves in the two-dimensional suspension bridge equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the dynamics generated by the suspension bridge equation, traveling waves are an essential feature. The existing literature focuses primarily on the idealized one-dimensional case, while traveling structures in two spatial dimensions have only been studied via numerical simulations. We use computer-assisted proof methods based on a Newton-Kantorovich type argument to find and prove periodic localized traveling waves in two dimensions. The main obstacle is the exponential nonlinearity in combination with the resulting large amplitude of the localized waves. Our analysis hinges on establishing computable bounds to control the aliasing error in the computed Fourier coefficients. This leads to existence proofs of different traveling wave solutions, accompanied by small, explicit, rigorous bounds on the deficiency of numerical approximations. This approach is directly extendable to other wave equation models and elliptic partial differential equations with analytic nonlinearities, in two as well as in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Capacitary inradius and Poincar\'e-Sobolev inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a two-sided estimate on the sharp $L^p$ Poincar\'e constant of a general open set, in terms of a capacitary variant of its inradius. This extends a result by Maz'ya and Shubin, originally devised for the case $p=2$, in the subconformal regime. We cover the whole range of $p$, by allowing in particular the extremal cases $p=1$ (Cheeger's constant) and $p=N$ (conformal case), as well. We also discuss the more general case of the sharp Poincar\'e-Sobolev embedding constants and get an analogous result. Finally, we present a brief discussion on the superconformal case, as well as some examples and counter-examples.</description>

      <title>A variational analysis of nematic axisymmetric films: the covariant derivative case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nematic surfaces are thin fluid structures, ideally two-dimensional, endowed with an in-plane nematic order. In 2012, two variational models have been introduced by Giomi [10] and by Napoli and Vergori [27,26]. Both penalize the area of the surface and the gradient of the director: in [10] the covariant derivative of the director is considered, while [26] deals with the surface gradient. In this paper, a complete variational analysis of the model proposed by Giomi is performed for revolution surfaces spanning two coaxial rings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proves the local-in-time strong well-posedness of a parabolic-hyperbolic regularized version of Hibler's sea ice model. The latter model is the most frequently used sea ice model in climate science. Lagrangian coordinates are employed to handle the hyperbolic terms in the balance laws. The resulting problem is regarded as a quasilinear non-autonomous evolution equation. Maximal $\mathrm{L}^p$-regularity of the underlying linearized problem is obtained on an anisotropic ground space in order to deal with the lack of regularization in the balance laws.</description>

      <title>Pinning and dipole asymptotics of locally deformed striped phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of spatial inhomogeneity on perfectly periodic, self-organized striped patterns in spatially extended systems. We demonstrate that inhomogeneities select a specific translate of the striped patterns and induce algebraically decaying, dipole-type farfield deformations. Phase shifts and leading order terms are determined by effective moments of the spatial inhomogeneity. Farfield decay is proportional to the derivatives of the Green's function of an effective Laplacian. Technically, we use mode filters and conjugacies to an effective Laplacian to establish Fredholm properties of the linearization in Kondratiev spaces. Spatial localization in a contraction argument is gained through the use of an explicit deformation ansatz and a subtle cancellation in Bloch wave space.</description>

      <title>Renormalized stochastic pressure equation with log-correlated Gaussian coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17195v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study periodic solutions to the following divergence-form stochastic partial differential equation with Wick-renormalized gradient on the $d$-dimensional flat torus $\mathbb{T}^d$,
  \[
  -\nabla\cdot\left(e^{\diamond (- \beta X) }\diamond\nabla U\right)=\nabla \cdot (e^{\diamond (- \beta X)} \diamond \mathbf{F}),
  \] where $X$ is the log-correlated Gaussian field, $\mathbf{F}$ is a random vector and $\diamond$ denotes the Wick product. The problem is a variant of the stochastic pressure equation, in which $U$ is modeling the pressure of a creeping water-flow in crustal rock that occurs in enhanced geothermal heating. In the original model, the Wick exponential term $e^{\diamond(-\beta X)}$ is modeling the random permeability of the rock. The porosity field is given by a log-correlated Gaussian random field $\beta X$, where $\beta&lt;\sqrt{d}$. We use elliptic regularity theory in order to define a notion of a solution to this (a priori very ill-posed) problem, via modifying the $S$-transform from Gaussian white noise analysis, and then establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions. Moreover, we show that the solution to the problem can be expressed in terms of the Gaussian multiplicative chaos measure.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, via first establishing a weighted variant of the profound and far-reaching inequality obtained by A. Cohen, W. Dahmen, I. Daubechies, and R. DeVore in 2003, the authors give two new characterizations of Muckenhoupt weights. As an application, the authors further establish a representation formula of gradients with sharp parameters in ball Banach function spaces, which extends the famous formula obtained by H. Brezis, A. Seeger, J. Van Schaftingen, and P.-L. Yung in 2021 from classical Sobolev spaces to various different Sobolev-type spaces and gives an affirmative answer to the question in page 29 of [Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations 62 (2023), Paper No. 234]. The most novelty of this article exists in subtly revealing the mutual equivalences among the Muckenhoupt weight, the weighted variant of the inequality of Cohen et al., and the weighted upper estimate of the formula of Brezis et al.</description>

Abstract: We show how the Fourier transform for distributional sections of vector bundles over symmetric spaces of non-compact type $G/K$ can be used for questions of solvability of systems of invariant differential equations in analogy to H\"ormander's proof of the Ehrenpreis-Malgrange theorem. We get complete solvability for the hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^2$ and partial results for products $\mathbb{H}^2 \times \cdots \times \mathbb{H}^2$ and the hyperbolic 3-space $\mathbb{H}^3$.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic spirals in 2d perfect fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study logarithmic spiraling solutions to the 2d incompressible Euler equations which solve a nonlinear transport system on $\mathbb{S}$. We show that this system is locally well-posed in $L^p, p\geq 1$ as well as for atomic measures, that is logarithmic spiral vortex sheets. In particular, we realize the dynamics of logarithmic vortex sheets as the well-defined limit of logarithmic solutions which could be smooth in the angle. Furthermore, our formulation not only allows for a simple proof of existence and bifurcation for non-symmetric multi branched logarithmic spiral vortex sheets but also provides a framework for studying asymptotic stability of self-similar dynamics.
  We give a complete characterization of the long time behavior of logarithmic spirals. We prove global well-posedness for bounded logarithmic spirals as well as data that admit at most logarithmic singularities. This is due to the observation that the local circulation of the vorticity around the origin is a strictly monotone quantity of time. We are then able to show a dichotomy in the long time behavior, solutions either blow up (either in finite or infinite time) or completely homogenize. In particular, bounded logarithmic spirals should converge to constant steady states. For logarithmic spiral sheets, the dichotomy is shown to be even more drastic where only finite time blow up or complete homogenization of the fluid can and does occur.</description>

      <title>Higher H\"older regularity for the fractional $p$-Laplace equation in the subquadratic case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fractional $p$-Laplace equation $$ (-\Delta_p)^s u = 0 $$ for $0&lt;s&lt;1$ and in the subquadratic case $1&lt;p&lt;2$. We provide H\"older estimates with an explicit H\"older exponent. The inhomogeneous equation is also treated and there the exponent obtained is almost sharp. Our results complement the previous results for the superquadratic case when $p\geq 2$. The arguments are based on a careful Moser-type iteration and a perturbation argument.</description>

      <title>The geometry of maximal development and shock formation for the Euler equations in multiple space dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08564v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a fundamental piece of the boundary of the maximal globally hyperbolic development (MGHD) of Cauchy data for the multi-dimensional compressible Euler equations, which is necessary for the local shock development problem. For an open set of compressive and generic $H^7$ initial data, we construct unique $H^7$ solutions to the Euler equations in the maximal spacetime region below a given time-slice, beyond the time of the first singularity; at any point in this spacetime, the solution can be smoothly and uniquely computed by tracing both the fast and slow acoustic characteristic surfaces backward-in-time, until reaching the Cauchy data prescribed along the initial time-slice. The future temporal boundary of this spacetime region is a singular hypersurface, containing the union of three sets: first, a co-dimension-$2$ surface of ``first singularities'' called the pre-shock; second, a downstream hypersurface called the singular set emanating from the pre-shock, on which the Euler solution experiences a continuum of gradient catastrophes; third, an upstream hypersurface consisting of a Cauchy horizon emanating from the pre-shock, which the Euler solution cannot reach. We develop a new geometric framework for the description of the acoustic characteristic surfaces which is based on the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) framework, and combine this with a new type of differentiated Riemann variables which are linear combinations of gradients of velocity, sound speed, and the curvature of the fast acoustic characteristic surfaces. With these new variables, we establish uniform $H^7$ Sobolev bounds for solutions to the Euler equations without derivative loss and with optimal regularity.</description>

      <title>On the visco-plastic approximation of a rate-independent coupled elastoplastic damage model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study a rate-independent system for the propagation of damage and plasticity. To construct solutions we resort to approximation in terms of viscous evolutions, where viscosity affects both damage and plasticity with the same rate. The main difficulty arises from the fact that the available estimates do not provide sufficient regularity on the limiting evolutions to guarantee that forces and velocities are in a duality pairing, hence we cannot use a chain rule for the driving energy. Nonetheless, via careful techniques we can characterize the limiting rate-independent evolution by means of an energy-dissipation balance, which encodes the onset of viscous effects in the behavior of the system at jumps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01514v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hot spots conjecture of J. Rauch states that the second Neumann eigenfunction of the Laplace operator on a bounded Lipschitz domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$ attains its extrema only on the boundary of the domain. We present an analogous problem for domains with mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions. We then solve this problem for Euclidean triangles and a class of planar domains bounded by the graphs of certain piecewise smooth functions.</description>

      <title>Instability of periodic waves for the Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers equation with monostable source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, it is proved that the KdV-Burgers equation with a monostable source term of Fisher-KPP type has small-amplitude periodic traveling wave solutions with finite fundamental period. These solutions emerge from a subcritical local Hopf bifurcation around a critical value of the wave speed. Moreover, it is shown that these periodic waves are spectrally unstable as solutions to the PDE, that is, the Floquet (continuous) spectrum of the linearization around each periodic wave intersects the unstable half plane of complex values with positive real part. To that end, classical perturbation theory for linear operators is applied in order to prove that the spectrum of the linearized operator around the wave can be approximated by that of a constant coefficient operator around the zero solution, which intersects the unstable complex half plane.</description>

      <title>A simple but effective bushfire model: analysis and real-time simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a simple mathematical model for bushfires accounting for temperature diffusion in the presence of a combustion term which is activated above a given ignition state. The model also takes into consideration the effect of the environmental wind and of the pyrogenic flow. The simplicity of the model is highlighted from the fact that it is described by a single scalar equation, containing only four terms, making it very handy for rapid and effective numerical simulations which run in real-time. In spite of its simplicity, the model is in agreement with data collected from bushfire experiments in the lab, as well as with spreading of bushfires that have been observed in the real world. Moreover, the equation describing the temperature evolution can be easily linked to a geometric evolution problem describing the level sets of the ignition state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the global well-posedness of the stochastic Abelian-Higgs equations in two dimensions. The proof is based on a new covariant approach, which consists of two parts: First, we introduce covariant stochastic objects. The covariant stochastic objects and their multi-linear interactions are controlled using covariant heat kernel estimates. Second, we control nonlinear remainders using a covariant monotonicity formula, which is inspired by earlier work of Hamilton.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vortices produce locally concentrated field configurations and are solutions to the nonlinear partial differential equations systems of complicated structures. In this paper, we establish the existence and uniqueness for solutions of the gauged non-Abelian vortices in a coupled 4D-2D quantum field theory by researching the nonlinear elliptic equations systems with exponential terms in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ using the calculus of variations. In addition, we obtain the asymptotic behavior of the solutions at infinity and the quantized integrals in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$.</description>

      <title>Normalized ground states for the mass supercritical Schr\"{o}dinger-Bopp-Podolsky system: existence, limit behavior, strong instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns the normalized ground states for the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation in the Bopp-Podolsky electrodynamics. This equation has a nonlocal nonlinearity and a mass supercritical power nonlinearity, both of which have deep impact on the geometry of the corresponding functional, and thus on the existence, limit behavior and stability of the normalized ground states. In the present study, the existence of critical points is obtained by a mountain-pass argument developed on the $L^2$-spheres. To be specific, we show that normalized ground states exist, provided that spherical radius of the $L^2$-spheres is sufficiently small. Then, by discussing the relation between the normalized ground states of the Schr\"{o}dinger-Bopp-Podolsky system and the classical Schr\"{o}dinger equation, we show a precise description of the asymptotic behavior of the normalized ground states as the mass vanishes or tends to infinity. Finally, the strong instability of standing waves at the mountain-pass energy level is studied by constructing an equivalent minimizing problem. Also, as a byproduct, we prove that the mountain-pass energy level gives a threshold for global existence based on this equivalent minimizing problem.</description>

      <title>A diagram-free approach to the stochastic estimates in regularity structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.10739v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the version of Hairer's regularity structures based on a greedier index set than trees, as introduced by Otto, Sauer, Smith and Weber. More precisely, we construct and stochastically estimate the renormalized model avoiding the use of Feynman diagrams but still in a fully automated, i. e. inductive way. This is carried out for a class of quasi-linear parabolic PDEs driven by noise in the full singular but renormalizable range. We assume a spectral gap inequality on the (not necessarily Gaussian) noise ensemble. The resulting control on the variance of the model naturally complements its vanishing expectation arising from the BPHZ-choice of renormalization. We capture the gain in regularity on the level of the Malliavin derivative of the model by describing it as a modelled distribution. Symmetry is an important guiding principle and built-in on the level of the renormalization Ansatz. Our approach is analytic and top-down rather than combinatorial and bottom-up.</description>

      <title>Characterizing models in regularity structures: a quasilinear case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.18192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a novel characterization of the centered model in regularity structures which persists for rough drivers even as a mollification fades away. We present our result for a class of quasilinear equations driven by noise, however we believe that the method is robust and applies to a much broader class of subcritical equations. Furthermore, we prove that a convergent sequence of noise ensembles, satisfying uniformly a spectral gap assumption, implies the corresponding convergence of the associated models. Combined with the characterization, this establishes a universality-type result.</description>

      <title>Strong cosmic censorship for the spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell-charged-Klein-Gordon system with positive $\Lambda$: stability of the Cauchy horizon and $H^1$ extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14420v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interior of a dynamical black hole as described by the Einstein-Maxwell-charged-Klein-Gordon system of equations with a cosmological constant, under spherical symmetry. In particular, we consider a characteristic initial value problem where, on the outgoing initial hypersurface, interpreted as the event horizon $\mathcal{H}^+$ of a dynamical black hole, we prescribe: a) initial data asymptotically approaching a fixed sub-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter solution; b) an exponential Price law upper bound for the charged scalar field. After showing local well-posedness for the corresponding first-order system of partial differential equations, we establish the existence of a Cauchy horizon $\mathcal{CH}^+$ for the evolved spacetime, extending the bootstrap methods used in the case $\Lambda = 0$ by Van de Moortel. In this context, we show the existence of $C^0$ spacetime extensions beyond $\mathcal{CH}^+$. Moreover, if the scalar field decays at a sufficiently fast rate along $\mathcal{H}^+$, we show that the renormalized Hawking mass remains bounded for a large set of initial data. With respect to the analogous model concerning an uncharged and massless scalar field, we are able to extend the known range of parameters for which mass inflation is prevented, up to the optimal threshold suggested by the linear analyses by Costa-Franzen and Hintz-Vasy. In this no-mass-inflation scenario, which includes near-extremal solutions, we further prove that the spacetime can be extended across the Cauchy horizon with continuous metric, Christoffel symbols in $L^2_{\text{loc}}$ and scalar field in $H^1_{\text{loc}}$. By generalizing the work by Costa-Gir\~ao-Nat\'ario-Silva to the case of a charged and massive scalar field, our results reveal a potential failure of the Christodoulou-Chru\'sciel version of the strong cosmic censorship under spherical symmetry.</description>
