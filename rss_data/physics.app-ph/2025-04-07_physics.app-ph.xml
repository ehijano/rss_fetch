      <title>First Demonstration of Underground Muon Imaging at an Archaeological Site in Ancient Jerusalem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel underground imaging system that utilizes cosmic-ray muons to explore the subsurface environment at the City of David archaeological site in ancient Jerusalem. This report details the initial findings from measurements conducted at a large cistern, commonly called "Jeremiah's cistern" (referenced in Jeremiah 38:6). The system aims to locate and map hidden voids and structural anomalies within the overburden. Our primary outcome is the derivation of the angular ground depth, which serves as a proxy for understanding the integrated density distribution of the overburden. This work represents a significant interdisciplinary effort to deepen our understanding of this historically important site.</description>

      <title>Time Varying Resonators in Acoustic Waveguides: A Transfer Matrix Formalism for Space-time Modulated Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transfer matrix method remains a simple yet powerful tool for modeling acoustic systems, particularly in a closed waveguide geometry. Here we present a generalisation of this method based on the theory of mode matching, that incorporates the effect of ultra--fast temporal variations in the geometry, applying it to a system of side-branching resonant cavities (quarter wavelength resonators) fixed to an acoustic waveguide, modulated through alteration of the cavity length. We calculate propagation in a waveguide containing both a single resonator and a periodic array. In particular we predict the generation of additional Doppler-like terms in the reflected and transmitted fields that leads to modification of the band structure, comparing our results to finite element simulations of space-time modulated acoustic crystals.</description>

      <title>Spring-loaded: Engineering Dispersion Relations Using Complex Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent theoretical and experimental interest in metamaterials comprising non-local coupling terms, we present an analytic framework to realise materials with arbitrary complex dispersion relations. Building on the inverse design method proposed by Kazemi \textit{et al}. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 176101 (2023)], which demonstrated arbitrary real dispersion relations with real non-local coupling terms, we show that using \textit{complex} non-local couplings not only can band structures be drawn, but that arbitrary attenuation of the supported modes can be achieved by tuning their trajectory in the complex frequency plane. This is demonstrated using a canonical mass-spring lattice with higher-order spatial connections; we consider the energy velocity in such systems and show that competing loss and gain of the complex interactions can produce exotic wave dispersion.</description>

      <title>Elastic instability of wormlike micelle solution flow in serpentine channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wormlike micelle (WLM) solutions are abundant in energy, environmental, and industrial applications, which often rely on their flow through tortuous channels. How does the interplay between fluid rheology and channel geometry influence the flow behavior? Here, we address this question by experimentally visualizing and quantifying the flow of a semi-dilute WLM solution in millifluidic serpentine channels. At low flow rates, the base flow is steady and laminar, with strong asymmetry and wall slip. When the flow rate exceeds a critical threshold, the flow exhibits an elastic instability, producing spatially-heterogeneous, unsteady three-dimensional (3D) flow characterized by two notable features: (i) the formation and persistence of stagnant but strongly-fluctuating and multistable "dead zones" in channel bends, and (ii) intermittent 3D "twists" throughout the bulk flow. The geometry of these dead zones and twisting events can be rationalized by considering the minimization of local streamline curvature to reduce flow-generated elastic stresses. Altogether, our results shed new light into how the interplay between solution rheology and tortuous boundary geometry influences WLM flow behavior, with implications for predicting and controlling WLM flows in a broad range of complex environments.</description>

      <title>Thermal Lensing Effects in Two-Photon Light-Sheet Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM), the axial resolution is governed by the illumination beam profile, motivating the development of advanced beam-shaping techniques to enhance imaging performance. Two-photon LSFM (2P-LSFM), in particular, improves the signal-to-background ratio by reducing laser scattering and distortion in biological specimens. However, we report a potentially detrimental thermal effect in 2P-LSFM: the high laser powers required for two-photon excitation induce localized heating, which alters the refractive index of the medium and effectively forms a divergent thermal lens in water. At 500 mW the light-sheet waist broadens by 25% and shifts by 300 $\mu$m before stabilizing several seconds after the laser shutter is opened. Both experiments and simulations reveal that this thermal lensing effect scales with laser power and the path length the beam travels through water. The resulting degradation in resolution and signal-to-noise ratio may compromise imaging applications that require high laser powers for rapid volumetric imaging of large specimens or functional brain imaging. This limitation is particularly critical in dynamic sample environments, such as during stepwise repositioning or flow-based delivery of chemical or hydrodynamic sensory stimuli, where changes occur on timescales comparable to the thermal settling time.</description>

      <title>Griffin Plots of vortex-induced vibrations: revealing self-similarity for quick estimation from transient displacement responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03564v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Griffin plot relates the peak amplitudes of vortex-induced vibration to structrual mass-damping parameter, known as the Scruton number. Griffin plot serves as a fundamental tool in many engineering fields. This study confirms a general self-similarity in Griffin plots, where plots derived from transient responses at any Scruton number converge to a single, consisten curve. This self-similarity arises from weak aeroelastic nonlinearity in vortex-induced vibration, manifasting as amplitude-dependent aerodynamic damping. Based on this self-similarity property, we propose a numerical method to estimate Griffin plots from transient displacement responses at any Scruton number. The resulting plots align closely with experimental data for both cross-flow and torsional vortex-induced vibrations, highlighting robust self-similar behavior across different Scruton numbers. Furthermore, we observe a consistent trend in Griffin plots for a rectangular cylinder, closed-box, and double-girder bridge deck: the reciprocal of peak amplitudes shows an approximately linear relationship with the Scruton number, especially in torsional vortex-induced vibration. To generate this linearity, we develop a simple empirical model of vortex-induced forces. This model accurately reproduces the Griffin plot for a rectangular cylinder using aeroelastic parameters derived from a single Scruton number, significantly reducing the need for extensive experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Dual axis atomic magnetometer and gyroscope enabled by nuclear spin perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05319v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alkali-noble-gas comagnetometers have become an essential tool for tests of fundamental physics and offer a compact platform for precision gyroscopy. They are, however, limited by technical noise at low frequencies, commonly due to their limited suppression of magnetic noise. Here we investigate a new method for co-magnetometry between a single noble gas and alkali species. While similar to well-known devices using self-compensation, our scheme introduces magnetic pulses that controllably perturb the noble gas and pulsed optical pumping to polarise the alkali atoms. These applied pulses allow our scheme to measure, rather than just suppress, the effect of magnetic noise thereby offering reduced cross-talk. We show numerically that our scheme retrieves four signals (rotations and magnetic fields on two transverse axes) with similar sensitivity to a single axis device. We also present a proof-of-principle experiment based on a 87Rb-129Xe cell. Our data shows a low magnetic-rotation cross-talk of $0.2 \pm 0.1\mu$Hz$/$pT, which is already on par with the most sensitive devices relying on self-compensation.</description>

      <title>On the distributed resistor-constant phase element transmission line in a reflective bounded domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we derive and study the analytical solution of the voltage and current diffusion equation for the case of a finite-length resistor-constant phase element (CPE) transmission line (TL) network that can represent a model for porous electrodes in the absence of any Faradic processes. The energy storage component is considered to be an elemental CPE per unit length of impedance $z_c(s)={1}/{(c_{\alpha} s^{\alpha})}$ with constant parameters $(c_{\alpha},\alpha)$ instead of the ideal capacitor of impedance $z(s)={1}/{(c\, s)}$ usually assumed in TL modeling. The problem becomes a time-fractional diffusion equation for the voltage that we solve under galvanostatic charging, and derive from it a reduced impedance function of the form $z_{\alpha}(s_n)=s_n^{-\alpha/2}\coth({s_n^{\alpha/2}})$, where $s_n = j\omega_n$ is a normalized frequency. We also derive the system's step response, and the distribution function of relaxation times associated with it. The analysis can be viewed and used as a support for the fractal finite-length Warburg model.</description>

      <title>Miniaturized optical system for a chip based cold atom inertial sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We miniaturized the complex optical system responsible for the cooling, pumping and imaging of an on-chip based cold atom inertial sensor. This optical bench uses bonded miniature optics and includes all the necessary optical functions. The bench has a volume of 35x25x5~cm$^3$. We developed a laser frequency lock adapted to the optical bench using saturated absorption in a rubidium cell. The entire laser source based on frequency doubling of 1.56~$\mu$m fiber lasers, including the control system and the saturated absorption module, fits in a $5U$-rack. Using the miniaturized bench, we realized two and three dimensional magneto optical traps for Rubidium 87 atoms.</description>
