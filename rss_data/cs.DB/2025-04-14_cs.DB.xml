      <title>eST$^2$ Miner -- Process Discovery Based on Firing Partial Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Process discovery generates process models from event logs. Traditionally, an event log is defined as a multiset of traces, where each trace is a sequence of events. The total order of the events in a sequential trace is typically based on their temporal occurrence. However, real-life processes are partially ordered by nature. Different activities can occur in different parts of the process and, thus, independently of each other. Therefore, the temporal total order of events does not necessarily reflect their causal order, as also causally unrelated events may be ordered in time. Only partial orders allow to express concurrency, duration, overlap, and uncertainty of events. Consequently, there is a growing need for process mining algorithms that can directly handle partially ordered input. In this paper, we combine two well-established and efficient algorithms, the eST Miner from the process mining community and the Firing LPO algorithm from the Petri net community, to introduce the eST$^2$ Miner. The eST$^2$ Miner is a process discovery algorithm that can directly handle partially ordered input, gives strong formal guarantees, offers good runtime and excellent space complexity, and can, thus, be used in real-life applications.</description>

      <title>SQL-R1: Training Natural Language to SQL Reasoning Model By Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) enables intuitive interactions with databases by transforming natural language queries into structured SQL statements. Despite recent advancements in enhancing human-computer interaction within database applications, significant challenges persist, particularly regarding the inference performance in complex scenarios involving multi-table joins and nested queries. Current methodologies primarily utilize supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to train the NL2SQL model, which may limit adaptability and interpretability in new environments (e.g., finance and healthcare). In order to enhance the reasoning performance of the NL2SQL model in the above complex situations, we introduce SQL-R1, a novel NL2SQL reasoning model trained by the reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. We design a specialized RL-based reward function tailored for NL2SQL tasks and discussed the impact of cold start on the effectiveness of intensive training. In addition, we achieve competitive accuracy using only a tiny amount of synthetic NL2SQL data for augmented training and further explore data engineering for RL. In existing experiments, SQL-R1 achieves execution accuracy of 88.6% and 66.6% on the benchmark Spider and BIRD, respectively, only using the 7B base model.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Selection using Smooth Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentially private selection mechanisms offer strong privacy guarantees for queries aiming to identify the top-scoring element r from a finite set R, based on a dataset-dependent utility function. While selection queries are fundamental in data science, few mechanisms effectively ensure their privacy. Furthermore, most approaches rely on global sensitivity to achieve differential privacy (DP), which can introduce excessive noise and impair downstream inferences. To address this limitation, we propose the Smooth Noisy Max (SNM) mechanism, which leverages smooth sensitivity to yield provably tighter (upper bounds on) expected errors compared to global sensitivity-based methods. Empirical results demonstrate that SNM is more accurate than state-of-the-art differentially private selection methods in three applications: percentile selection, greedy decision trees, and random forests.</description>

      <title>Orchestrating Agents and Data for Enterprise: A Blueprint Architecture for Compound AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant interest in industry due to their impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, the widespread adoption of LLMs presents several challenges, such as integration into existing applications and infrastructure, utilization of company proprietary data, models, and APIs, and meeting cost, quality, responsiveness, and other requirements. To address these challenges, there is a notable shift from monolithic models to compound AI systems, with the premise of more powerful, versatile, and reliable applications. However, progress thus far has been piecemeal, with proposals for agentic workflows, programming models, and extended LLM capabilities, without a clear vision of an overall architecture. In this paper, we propose a 'blueprint architecture' for compound AI systems for orchestrating agents and data for enterprise applications. In our proposed architecture the key orchestration concept is 'streams' to coordinate the flow of data and instructions among agents. Existing proprietary models and APIs in the enterprise are mapped to 'agents', defined in an 'agent registry' that serves agent metadata and learned representations for search and planning. Agents can utilize proprietary data through a 'data registry' that similarly registers enterprise data of various modalities. Tying it all together, data and task 'planners' break down, map, and optimize tasks and queries for given quality of service (QoS) requirements such as cost, accuracy, and latency. We illustrate an implementation of the architecture for a use-case in the HR domain and discuss opportunities and challenges for 'agentic AI' in the enterprise.</description>

      <title>LearnedKV: Integrating LSM and Learned Index for Superior Performance on Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present LearnedKV, a novel tiered key-value store that seamlessly integrates a Log-Structured Merge (LSM) tree with a Learned Index to achieve superior read and write performance on storage systems. While existing approaches use learned indexes primarily as auxiliary components within LSM trees, LearnedKV employs a two-tier design where the LSM tree handles recent write operations while a separate Learned Index accelerates read performance. Our design includes a non-blocking conversion mechanism that efficiently transforms LSM data into a Learned Index during garbage collection, maintaining high performance without interrupting operations. LearnedKV dramatically reduces LSM size through this tiered approach, leading to significant performance gains in both reads and writes. Extensive evaluations across diverse workloads show that LearnedKV outperforms state-of-the-art LSM-based solutions by up to 4.32x for read operations and 1.43x for writes. The system demonstrates robust performance across different data distributions, access patterns, and storage media including both SSDs and HDDs.</description>

      <title>HotStuff-1: Linear Consensus with One-Phase Speculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces HotStuff-1, a BFT consensus protocol that improves the latency of HotStuff-2 by two network-hops while maintaining linear communication complexity against faults. Additionally, HotStuff-1 incorporates an incentive-compatible leader rotation regime that motivates leaders to commit consensus decisions promptly.
  HotStuff-1 achieves a reduction by two network hops by sending clients early finality confirmations speculatively, after one phase of the protocol. Unlike previous speculation regimes, the early finality confirmation path of HotStuff-1 is fault-tolerant and the latency improvement does not rely on optimism. An important consideration for speculation regimes in general, which is referred to as the prefix speculation dilemma, is exposed and resolved.
  HotStuff-1 embodies an additional mechanism, slotting, that thwarts real-world delays caused by rationally-incentivized leaders. Leaders may also be inclined to sabotage each other's progress. The slotting mechanism allows leaders to drive multiple decisions, thus mitigating both threats, while dynamically adapting the number of allowed decisions per leader to network transmission delays.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Prescriptive Analytics Applications: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prescriptive Analytics (PSA), an emerging business analytics field suggesting concrete options for solving business problems, has seen an increasing amount of interest after more than a decade of multidisciplinary research. This paper is a comprehensive survey of existing applications within PSA in terms of their use cases, methodologies, and possible future research directions. To ensure a manageable scope, we focus on PSA applications that develop data-driven, automatic workflows, i.e., Data-Driven PSA (DPSA). Following a systematic methodology, we identify and include 104 papers in our survey. As our key contributions, we derive a number of novel taxonomies of the field and use them to analyse the field's temporal development. In terms of use cases, we derive 10 application domains for DPSA, from Healthcare to Manufacturing, and subsumed problem types within each. In terms of individual method usage, we derive 5 method types and map them to a comprehensive taxonomy of method usage within DPSA applications, covering mathematical optimization, data mining and machine learning, probabilistic modelling, domain expertise, as well as simulations. As for combined method usage, we provide a statistical overview of how different method usage combinations are distributed and derive 2 generic workflow patterns along with subsumed workflow patterns, combining methods by either sequential or simultaneous relationships. Finally, we derive 4 possible research directions based on frequently recurring issues among surveyed papers, suggesting new frontiers in terms of methods, tools, and use cases.</description>

      <title>Role of Databases in GenAI Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is transforming industries by enabling intelligent content generation, automation, and decision-making. However, the effectiveness of GenAI applications depends significantly on efficient data storage, retrieval, and contextual augmentation. This paper explores the critical role of databases in GenAI workflows, emphasizing the importance of choosing the right database architecture to optimize performance, accuracy, and scalability. It categorizes database roles into conversational context (key-value/document databases), situational context (relational databases/data lakehouses), and semantic context (vector databases) each serving a distinct function in enriching AI-generated responses. Additionally, the paper highlights real-time query processing, vector search for semantic retrieval, and the impact of database selection on model efficiency and scalability. By leveraging a multi-database approach, GenAI applications can achieve more context-aware, personalized, and high-performing AI-driven solutions.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a pseudocode algorithm for translating Entity-Relationship data models into (Elementary) Mathematical Data Model schemes. We prove that this algorithm is linear, solid, complete, and optimal. We apply this algorithm to an Entity-Relationship data model for a teaching sub-universe.

      <title>A Parametrizable Algorithm for Distributed Approximate Similarity Search with Arbitrary Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13795v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have explored alternative distance measures for similarity search in spaces with diverse topologies, emphasizing the importance of selecting an appropriate distance function to improve the performance of k-Nearest Neighbour search algorithms. However, a critical gap remains in accommodating such diverse similarity measures, as most existing methods for exact or approximate similarity search are explicitly designed for metric spaces.
  To address this need, we propose PDASC (Parametrizable Distributed Approximate Similarity Search with Clustering), a novel Approximate Nearest Neighbour search algorithm. PDASC combines an innovative multilevel indexing structure particularly adept at managing outliers, highly imbalanced datasets, and sparse data distributions, with the flexibility to support arbitrary distance functions achieved through the integration of clustering algorithms that inherently accommodate them.
  Experimental results show that PDASC constitutes a reliable ANN search method, suitable for operating in distributed data environments and for handling datasets defined in different topologies, where the selection of the most appropriate distance function is often non-trivial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14111v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing has emerged as a promising tool for transforming the landscape of computing technology. Recent efforts have applied quantum techniques to classical database challenges, such as query optimization, data integration, index selection, and transaction management. In this paper, we shift focus to a critical yet underexplored area: data management for quantum computing. We are currently in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, where qubits, while promising, are fragile and still limited in scale. After differentiating quantum data from classical data, we outline current and future data management paradigms in the NISQ era and beyond. We address the data management challenges arising from the emerging demands of near-term quantum computing. Our goal is to chart a clear course for future quantum-oriented data management research, establishing it as a cornerstone for the advancement of quantum computing in the NISQ era.</description>
