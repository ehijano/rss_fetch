      <title>Multidimensional Soliton Systems: an Update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A briefly formulated update of the recently published review [1] on the topic of multidimensional solitons (chiefly, in nonlinear optics and atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs)) is presented. The update briefly summarizes some notable results on this topic that have been reported very recently, and offers a compact outline of the directions of the current experiment and theoretical work in this and related fields. In particular, as concerns newest experimental findings, included are the creation of multiple quantum droplets in prolate BEC, and the observation of expanding toroidal light structures in linear optics. The update of theoretical results includes the analysis of 2D solitons in the optical system with the quadratic nonlinearity and fractional diffraction, and the prediction of stable 3D vortex solitons in various BEC schemes with long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving Physics-Informed Neural Network for the Korteweg--de Vries (KdV) Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offer a flexible framework for solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs), yet conventional implementations often fail to preserve key physical invariants during long-term integration. This paper introduces a \emph{structure-preserving PINN} framework for the nonlinear Korteweg--de Vries (KdV) equation, a prototypical model for nonlinear and dispersive wave propagation. The proposed method embeds the conservation of mass and Hamiltonian energy directly into the loss function, ensuring physically consistent and energy-stable evolution throughout training and prediction. Unlike standard \texttt{tanh}-based PINNs~\cite{raissi2019pinn,wang2022modifiedpinn}, our approach employs sinusoidal activation functions that enhance spectral expressiveness and accurately capture the oscillatory and dispersive nature of KdV solitons. Through representative case studies -- including single-soliton propagation (shape-preserving translation), two-soliton interaction (elastic collision with phase shift), and cosine-pulse initialization (nonlinear dispersive breakup) -- the model successfully reproduces hallmark behaviors of KdV dynamics while maintaining conserved invariants. Ablation studies demonstrate that combining invariant-constrained optimization with sinusoidal feature mappings accelerates convergence, improves long-term stability, and mitigates drift without multi-stage pretraining. These results highlight that computationally efficient, invariant-aware regularization coupled with sinusoidal representations yields robust, energy-consistent PINNs for Hamiltonian partial differential equations such as the KdV equation.</description>

      <title>Topological Soliton Frequency Comb in Nanophotonic Lithium Niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency combs have revolutionized metrology, ranging, and optical clocks, which have motivated substantial efforts on the development of chip-scale comb sources. The on-chip comb sources are currently based on electro-optic modulation, mode-locked lasers, quantum cascade lasers, or soliton formation via Kerr nonlinearity. However, the widespread deployment of on-chip comb sources has remained elusive as they still require RF sources, high-Q resonators, or complex stabilization schemes while facing efficiency challenges. Here, we demonstrate an on-chip source of frequency comb based on the integration of a lithium niobate nanophotonic circuit with a semiconductor laser that can alleviate these challenges. For the first time, we show the formation of temporal topological solitons in a on-chip nanophotonic parametric oscillator with quadratic nonlinearity and low finesse. These solitons, independent of the dispersion regime, consist of phase defects separating two $\pi$-out-of-phase continuous wave solutions at the signal frequency, which is at half the input pump frequency. We use on-chip cross-correlation for temporal measurements and confirm formation of topological solitons as short as 60 fs around 2 $\mu$m, in agreement with a generalized parametrically forced Ginzburg-Landau theory. Moreover, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept turn-key operation of a hybrid-integrated source of topological frequency comb. Topological solitons offer a new paradigm for integrated comb sources, which are dispersion-sign agnostic and do not require high-Q resonators or high-speed modulators and can provide access to hard-to-access spectral regions, including mid-infrared.</description>

      <title>Exact periodic solutions of the generalized Constantin-Lax-Majda equation with dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present exact pole dynamics solutions to the generalized Constantin-Lax-Majda (gCLM) equation in a periodic geometry with dissipation $-\Lambda^\sigma$, where its spatial Fourier transform is $\widehat{\Lambda^\sigma}=|k|^\sigma$. The gCLM equation is a simplified model for singularity formation in the 3D incompressible Euler equations. It includes an advection term with parameter $a$, which allows different relative weights for advection and vortex stretching. There has been intense interest in the gCLM equation, and it has served as a proving ground for the development of methods to study singularity formation in the 3D Euler equations. Several exact solutions for the problem on the real line have been previously found by the method of pole dynamics, but only one such solution has been reported for the periodic geometry. We derive new periodic solutions for $a=0$ and $1/2$ and $\sigma=0$ and $1$, for which a closed collection of (periodically repeated) poles evolve in the complex plane. Self-similar finite-time blow-up of the solutions is analyzed and compared for the different values of $\sigma$, and to a global-in-time well-posedness theory for solutions with small data presented in a previous paper of the authors. Motivated by the exact solutions, the well-posedness theory is extended to include the case $a=0$, $\sigma \geq 0$. Several interesting features of the solutions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Beyond mean-field effects in Josephson oscillations and self-trapping of Bose-Einstein condensates in two-dimensional dual-core traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a binary Bose gas in a symmetric dual-core, pancake-shaped trap, modelled by two linearly coupled two-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equations with Lee-Huang-Yang corrections. Two different cases are considered. First, we consider a spatially uniform condensate, where we identify the domains of parameters for macroscopic quantum tunnelling, self-trapping and localisation revivals. The analytical formulas for the Josephson frequencies in the zero- and $\pi$-phase modes are derived. As the total atom number varies, the system displays a rich bifurcation structure. In the zero-phase, two successive pitchfork bifurcations generate bistability and hysteresis, while the $\pi$-phase exhibits a single pitchfork bifurcation.
  The second case is when the quantum droplets are in a dual-core trap. Analytical predictions for the oscillation frequencies are derived via a variational approach for the coupled dynamics of quantum droplets, and direct numerical simulations validate the results. We identify critical values of the linear coupling that separate Josephson and self-trapped regimes as the particle number changes. We also found the Andreev-Bashkin superfluid drag effect in numerical simulations of the droplet-droplet interactions in the two-core geometry.</description>
