      <title>Nanophotonic thermal management in X-ray tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In X-ray tubes, more than 99% of the kilowatts of power supplied to generate X-rays via bremsstrahlung are lost in the form of heat generation in the anode. Therefore, thermal management is a critical barrier to the development of more powerful X-ray tubes with higher brightness and spatial coherence, which are needed to translate imaging modalities such as phase-contrast imaging to the clinic. In rotating anode X-ray tubes, the most common design, thermal radiation is a bottleneck that prevents efficient cooling of the anode$\unicode{x2014}$the hottest part of the device by far. We predict that nanophotonically patterning the anode of an X-ray tube enhances heat dissipation via thermal radiation, enabling it to operate at higher powers without increasing in temperature. The focal spot size, which is related to the spatial coherence of generated X-rays, can also be made smaller at a constant temperature. A major advantage of our "nanophotonic thermal management" approach is that in principle, it allows for complete control over the spectrum and direction of thermal radiation, which can lead to optimal thermal routing and improved performance.</description>

      <title>Near-visible low power tuning of nematic-liquid crystal integrated silicon nitride ring resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of compact, low-power, and high-performance integrated photonic phase shifters is critical for advancing emerging technologies such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR), optical information processing and quantum applications. Liquid crystal (LC)-based phase shifters offer a promising solution thanks to their large refractive index contrast and their low power consumption. However, it remains challenging to incorporate LCs into integrated photonics and the operating wavelength has been limited to near infrared. Here, we demonstrate a liquid-crystal-based phase shifter operating at 780 nm, a relevant wavelength for cold atom-based quantum applications, by incorporating nematic LCs (E7) into a silicon nitride (SiN) ring resonator. Our device achieves 2pi phase modulation with very low power of 2.1 nW and low driving voltages of 7 V with exceptionally low Vpi times L (half wave voltage times length) value of 0.014 V-cm, enabling precise control over light propagation in a compact footprint. This work marks a significant step toward realizing low-power, compact, and efficient LC integrated photonic circuits based on SiN platform for next-generation LiDAR and quantum optical systems.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity spatial information transfer through dynamic scattering media by an epsilon-near-zero time-gate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transparent conducting oxides (TCO) such as indium-tin-oxide (ITO) exhibit strong optical nonlinearity in the frequency range where their permittivities are near zero. We leverage this nonlinear optical response to realize a sub-picosecond time-gate based on upconversion (or sum-) four-wave mixing (FWM) between two ultrashort pulses centered at the epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) wavelength in a sub-micron-thick ITO film. The time-gate removes the effect of both static and dynamic scattering on the signal pulse by retaining only the ballistic photons of the pulse, that is, the photons that are not scattered. Thus, the spatial information encoded in either the intensity or the phase of the signal pulse can be preserved and transmitted with high fidelity through scattering media. Furthermore, in the presence of time-varying scattering, our time-gate can reduce the resulting scintillation by two orders of magnitude. In contrast to traditional bulk nonlinear materials, time gating by sum-FWM in a sub-wavelength-thick ENZ film can produce a scattering-free upconverted signal at a visible wavelength without sacrificing spatial resolution, which is usually limited by the phase-matching condition. Our proof-of-principle experiment can have implications for potential applications such as \textit{in vivo} diagnostic imaging and free-space optical communication.</description>

      <title>Long-Short Term Memory Model for $\chi^{(2)}$ Nonlinear Processes: Enhancing Simulation with ML</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling second-order $\left(\chi^{(2)}\right )$ nonlinear optical processes remains computationally expensive due to the need to resolve fast field oscillations and simulate wave propagation using methods like the split-step Fourier method (SSFM). This can become a bottleneck in real-time applications, such as high-repetition-rate laser systems requiring rapid feedback and control. We present an LSTM-based surrogate model trained on SSFM simulations generated from a start-to-end model of the photocathode drive laser at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory's Linac Coherent Light Source II. The model achieves over 250x speedup while maintaining high fidelity, enabling future real-time optimization and laying the foundation for data-integrated modeling frameworks.</description>

      <title>Hot-electron-injection-induced symmetry breaking in bilayer MoS$_2$ probed by second-harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry governs the selection rules of light-matter interactions in crystalline materials, making symmetry manipulation a powerful tool for tuning their optical properties. Here, we demonstrate that the hot-electron injection from a plasmonic resonator breaks the centrosymmtry of an adjacent transition metal dichalcogenide bilayer, probed via second-harmonic generation (SHG) in a Au-nanoparticle@bilayer-MoS$_2$@Au-film hybrid system. Power-dependent SHG measurements exhibit saturation behavior, consistent with a capacitor model where interfacial charge accumulation creates a dynamic barrier limiting further electron injection. Polarization-resolved SHG measurements confirm that this symmetry breaking induces both in-plane and out-of-plane second-order susceptibility components, with their relative strengths providing a quantitative measure of the degree of symmetry breaking. First-principles calculations support these experimental findings of out-of-plane symmetry breaking and elucidate the evolution of MoS$_2$ nonlinear optical responses under hot-electron injection, modeled by a perpendicular electric field. Our work establishes SHG as an effective probe of hot-electron-induced symmetry breaking in 2D materials, demonstrating a promising approach for ultrafast manipulation of material properties through controlled charge injection at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Timing-injection locking in a self-starting Mamyshev oscillator induced by the dissipative Faraday instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mamyshev oscillators (MOs), a novel class of passively mode-locked fiber lasers, serve as an excellent platform to explore complex nonlinear dynamics, ranging from localized sturctures to chaos. Despite their versatility, achieving self-starting mode-locking remains a significant challenge, especially in the normal dispersion regime. In this study, we unveil the critical role of the dissipative Faraday instability (DFI) in facilitating the self-starting process of MOs, where the DFI triggers the symmetry breaking of the homogeneous solution to overcome the initiation barriers. This discovery provides a panoramic view of several distinct operational regimes with distinct DFI patterns for the very first time, namely the non-self-starting states, the irregular patterns, the harmonic mode locking regime, the stable single pulse and the stable multi pulse regime. For the lattest case, we uncover the origins of randomness in these pulse sequences through analyzing the causality between the timing of the random pulses and the initial iterative condition, referred to as the embryonic light. Building upon these findings, we propose the novel time-injection locking (TIL) technique to customize the temporal locations of the pulses as well as the pattern timing in MOs, thus demonstrating its potential for applications in all-optical data storage and tunable ultrashort pulse sources.</description>

      <title>Polarization-dependent third harmonic generation in starch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a deep insight into the third harmonic generation (THG) signals originating from starch granules. By varying the direction of the excitation linear polarization, and performing polarization-dependent THG (P-THG) measurements, we observe two different P-THG signal modulations in the same granule, which correspond to two distinct regions, i.e., the outer shell, and the inner region. We employ a theoretical model, that assumes orthorhombic mm2 symmetry for the THG sources, and we extract the susceptibility ratios of the contributing \c{hi}(3) tensor elements, as well as the mean orientational average of the THG molecular structures. We define the anisotropy-ratio (AR=(\c{hi}_xxxx^((3) ))/(\c{hi}_yyyy^((3)))) which characterizes the molecular structures in the granules and we find that the outer shell, exhibits different values compared to the inner region. This indicates that the outer shell of starch granules differs from the inner portion. This work provides the tools for interpreting the P-THG contrast and a means to acquire additional information than that obtained with intensity only THG measurements, in a biological sample governed by orthorhombic mm2 symmetry.</description>

      <title>Low-loss silicon nitride Kerr-microresonators fabricated with metallic etch masks via metal lift-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stoichiometric silicon nitride has emerged as a widely used integrated photonic material owing to its high index of refraction, nonlinear optical properties, and broad transparency window spanning visible to mid-IR frequencies. However, silicon nitride is generally more resistant to reactive ion etching than are typical etch masks made of polymer-based resist. This necessitates resist layers that are significantly thicker than the silicon nitride and results in mask patterns which are tall and narrow. These high-aspect-ratio patterns inhibit the plasma transport of reactive ion etching, which leads to difficulties in accurately reproducing dimensions and creating well-defined, vertical waveguide sidewalls. In this work, we overcome these challenges by developing a metallic etch mask that provides a 30:1 nitride-to-metal etch rate ratio, representing a near 20-fold reduction in the required mask thickness. We demonstrate the quality of this technique by etching microring resonators with near-vertical waveguide sidewalls and intrinsic quality factors of over 1 million. Leveraging the low optical loss of our resonators, we generate optical frequency combs with more than an octave of bandwidth and dual dispersive waves. These results establish metal lift-off as a viable and easy-to-implement technique capable of producing low optical loss waveguides.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capturing biological specimens at large scales with sub-micron resolution is crucial for biomedical research, but conventional cameras often can't handle the pixel requirements. While most microscopes use motorized stages to move samples and capture images tile by tile, we propose a method that eliminates the need for sample movement. Our approach integrates a scanning mechanism within the microscope's detection unit, enabling sequential capture of sub-areas of the field of view without physically moving the sample. This "remote scanning" method works with all camera-based microscopes and we demonstrate its effectiveness in both bright-field and epifluorescence microscopy. This technique is ideal for imaging motion-sensitive samples and large biological specimens, as evidenced in this study with millimeter-scale engineered tissues.</description>

Abstract: In this work, Ag0 nanoparticles (NPs)were synthesized and detected by flow-injection analysis coupled to collinear dual-beam thermal lens spectrometric (TLS) detection. The estimated limit of detection was 0.8 microgram/L. The use of 2 the IonPac Cryptand G1 column enabled Ag0 NPs detection in the presence of interfering ions normally present in water. Ag0 nanofluids (NFs) were further characterized by time-resolved TLS and beam deflection spectrometry to determine the NFs thermal diffusivity and conductivity.

      <description>arXiv:2503.21384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In vivo application of dynamic optical coherence tomography (DOCT) is hindered by bulk motion of the sample. We demonstrate DOCT imaging of \invivo human skin by adopting a sample-fixation attachment to suppress bulk motion and a subsequent software motion correction to further reduce the effect of sample motion. The performance of the motion-correction method was assessed by DOCT image observation, statistical analysis of the mean DOCT values, and subjective image grading. Both the mean DOCT value analysis and subjective grading showed statistically significant improvement of the DOCT image quality. In addition, a previously unobserved high DOCT layer was identified though image observation, which may represent the stratum basale with high keratinocyte proliferation.</description>

      <title>First broadband optical fibre with an attenuation lower than 0.1 decibel per kilometre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Throughout history, the development of novel technologies for long-distance communications has had profound influences on societal progress. Landmark scientific discoveries have enabled the transition from short message transmissions via single-wire electrical telegraphs to voice communications through coaxial cables, and ultimately to the optical fibres that powered the internet revolution. Central to these advancements was the invention of novel waveguides to transport electromagnetic waves with lower attenuation over broader spectral ranges. In the past four decades, despite extensive research, the spectral bandwidth and attenuation of silica-based telecommunication fibres have remained relatively unchanged. In this work, we report an optical waveguide with an unprecedented bandwidth and attenuation. Its measured loss reaches 0.091 dB/km at 1550 nm and remains below 0.2 dB/km over 66 THz, substantially better than the 0.14 dB/km and 26 THz achievable with existing technology. Our innovative, microstructured optical fibre replaces the traditional glass core with air, employing a meticulously engineered tubular glass structure to guide light. This approach not only reduces attenuation and other signal degradation phenomena, but it also increases transmission speeds by 50%. Furthermore, it theoretically enables further loss reductions and operation at wavelengths where broader bandwidth amplifiers exist, potentially heralding a new era in long-distance communications.</description>

      <title>Experimental and numerical investigation of wavelength and resolution dependency of dynamic optical coherence tomography signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wavelength and system-resolution dependencies of dynamic optical coherence tomography (DOCT) are investigated experimentally and numerically. Experimental investigations demonstrate significant wavelength dependency for the DOCT values but no resolution dependency. Numerical simulations were performed using diffusion, random-ballistic motion, and mono-directional flow-based motion models. Diffusion and random-ballistic motion-based simulations show significant wavelength dependency. Additionally, small but certain resolution dependency was revealed by these simulations. Mono-directional flow simulations did not show wavelength dependency, but did demonstrate resolution dependency. The DOCT value is sensitive to both tissue dynamics and the OCT system specification. These effects should be considered when interpreting DOCT images.</description>

      <title>Amplifying solid-state high harmonic generations with momentum k-gaps in band structure engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel amplification mechanism for high harmonic generation (HHG) in solids by leveraging bandgap engineering with momentum k-gaps. By constructing a simple diatomic lattice featuring balanced, alternating gain and loss profiles, facilitated by an array of four-level systems, we explore the physics of k-gap-amplified Bloch oscillations in the intraband channel of solid-state HHG. Through numerical simulations, we elucidate the coexistence of amplification and harmonic radiation processes in a solid. Our finding reveals that advanced bandgap engineering can define k-space optical devices - such as Brillouin cavity, Bloch-Zener oscillator and k-gap amplifier - thereby enabling the coherent manipulation of semiconductor radiation and high harmonic generation in both semiconductor superlattices and artificial materials. Furthermore, we analyze the spectrogram and material realizations required for amplifying solid-state HHG. These results underscore the potential of k-gap band structure engineering to advance coherent light sources at extremely short wavelengths.</description>

      <title>All-Optical High-speed Programmable Nonlinear Activation Functions using a Fabry-Perot Laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The threads of photonics are eagerly awaited to redefine the future of neuromorphic data processing, especially as the computing-intensive artificial intelligence models become an unavoidable part of our everyday lives. Still, there is much to be improved within the domain of photonic nonlinear activation functions, as the programmable, all-optical, energy-efficient nonlinearities remain beyond the grasp of today's state of the art. In this paper, we address the issue at hand and propose a novel approach in the realization of high-performing all-optical photonic activations. Through simulations and experiments, we show that Fabry-Perot laser diodes (FP-LDs) exhibit richness and high programmability of their nonlinear response to input optical pulses with widths as low as 25 ps. We demonstrate a variety of sigmoid-like and inverted PReLU-like trends to be used as all-optical activation functions in photonic neural networks, testing their performance in stringent, real-life training scenarios with randomized data patterns at repetition rates up to 10 GHz. The programmability of activations is shown using a multitude of experimental operating parameters, among which we highlight the power variation of an additional continuous wave laser, injected into the FP-LD, enriching our approach with all-optical control of all-optical activations. With very low static power consumption of our active element, we achieve a record-breaking energy draw on the order of pJ to hundreds of fJ per nonlinear operation.</description>

      <title>Vortex-Free Intrinsic Orbital Angular Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For three decades, optical orbital angular momentum (OAM) has been synonymous with phase vortices. Here, our research challenges this paradigm by demonstrating a vortex-free intrinsic OAM arising from three-dimensional caustic trajectories in structured light fields, distinct from traditional vortex-based mechanisms. Optical OAM was traditionally considered rare, predominantly manifesting during high-order atomic and molecular transitions. The conceptual shift initiated by Allen et al. in 1992, which showed that laser beams with optical vortex--characterized by their twisted wavefronts--naturally carry intrinsic OAM, laid the groundwork for subsequent studies. However, the exploration of intrinsic OAM in vortex-free laser modes remains a largely untapped area. Addressing this gap, our research proposes a third category of optical intrinsic angular momentum--termed "vortex-free OAM"--that complements spin angular momentum (SAM) in circularly polarized beams and OAM in vortex beams. This new form of OAM is governed by a hydrodynamic analogy between light propagation and fluid dynamics, linking the orbital motion of energy streamlines to quantifiable angular momentum. Through numerical simulations, experimental measurements, and investigations of the mechanical transfer of OAM to trapped particles using optical tweezers, we establish vortex-free OAM as a universal property of structured fields with three-dimensional caustic trajectories. Furthermore, we propose a unified hydrodynamic framework that transcends traditional wavefront-centric models, facilitating the generalization of OAM analysis to both vortex and vortex-free regimes. This framework not only enhances our understanding of the physical origin of optical angular momentum but also unlocks new opportunities in optical manipulation, classical and quantum communications, and light-matter interaction technologies.</description>

      <title>Emergent Non-Markovian Gain in Open Quantum Systems</title>

Abstract: Non-Markovian dynamics go beyond the Markovian approximation by capturing memory effects and information backflow in open quantum systems, which are crucial for describing realistic physical processes. In this work, we study the exact non-Markovian dynamics of a driven cavity coupled to an anisotropic three-dimensional photonic-crystal environment via counterrotating-wave interactions. We derive an exact analytical expression for the cavity amplitude satisfying the integro-differential equation, which includes the contributions of the bound states outside the continuum and the dissipative parts with the continuum spectrum. Based on the characteristic function method, we derive the exact non-Markovian master equation for the cavity, which contributes to the gain of the cavity. We give the physical origin of non-Markovian gain in the presence of bound states in the system consisting of cavity and environment, which has no Markovian counterparts due to the nonexponential gain in the non-Markovian structured environment. We find that three different types of bound states can be formed in the system, containing one bound state with no inversion of photon number, two bound states with the periodic equal-amplitude oscillation, and the gain with two complex roots without the bound states formation. We derive a current equation including the source from the driving field, the transient current induced by the change in the number of photons, and the two-photon current caused by the counterrotating-wave term. The results are compared with those given by the rotating-wave interactions and extended to a more general quantum network involving an arbitrary number of coupled cavities. Our findings may pave the way for a deeper understanding of non-Markovian dynamics with gain in quantum networks involving counterrotating-wave effects.</description>

      <title>Probing cellular activity via charge-sensitive quantum nanoprobes</title>

Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) based quantum sensors hold great potential for real-time single-cell sensing with far-reaching applications in fundamental biology and medical diagnostics. Although highly sensitive, the mapping of quantum measurements onto cellular physiological states has remained an exceptional challenge. Here we introduce a novel quantum sensing modality capable of detecting changes in cellular activity. Our approach is based on the detection of environment-induced charge depletion within an individual particle that, owing to a previously unaccounted transverse dipole term, induces systematic shifts in the zero-field splitting (ZFS). Importantly, these charge-induced shifts serve as a reliable indicator for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated inflammatory response in macrophages. Furthermore, we demonstrate that surface modification of our diamond nanoprobes effectively suppresses these environment-induced ZFS shifts, providing an important tool for differentiating electrostatic shifts caused by the environment from other unrelated effects, such as temperature variations. Notably, this surface modification also leads to significant reductions in particle-induced toxicity and inflammation. Our findings shed light on systematic drifts and sensitivity limits of NV spectroscopy in a biological environment with ramification on the critical discussion surrounding single-cell thermogenesis. Notably, this work establishes the foundation for a novel sensing modality capable of probing complex cellular processes through straightforward physical measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the behavior of spin-1 vector bosons in helicoidal spacetime, focusing on photonic modes in helicoidal graphene structures. By solving the fully covariant vector boson equation, we derive exact solutions that describe the quantum states of photons in a curved helicoidal background, revealing their energy spectra, mode profiles, and decay dynamics. We find that the decay times of damped photonic modes range from \(10^{-16}\) to \(10^{-13}\) seconds as the helicoidal pitch (\(a\)) varies from \(10^3\) nanometers to \(1\) nanometer, indicating that the structure efficiently absorbs all photonic modes. Additionally, the probability density functions exhibit time dependence, complementing their spatial variation. These findings provide a foundation for the design of ultrafast graphene photodetectors, graphene photodevices for high-speed optical communications, advanced photonic devices, and quantum materials based on helicoidal graphene for various nanophotonic applications.</description>

      <title>Modelling and optimization of pulsed squeezed state generation in a ring-resonator system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a semi-analytic formalism for calculating the squeezing and antisqueezing spectrum in a channel waveguide side-coupled to a lossy ring resonator. Our approach first uses the semi-analytic evolution of the density matrix inside the ring up to the time where the squeezing is maximized. Then noting that a conservative approximate result for the squeezing can be obtained by ignoring the effect of the pump at later times, we calculate the free evolution of the field operators in the channel waveguide at all later times. We then calculate the quadrature squeezing spectrum in the waveguide, assuming that the measurement starts at the time when the squeezing in the ring is maximized. Using these results, we determine the optimum values for the pump pulse duration and amplitude and the ring-channel coupling for the pump and signal. We find that squeezing above 10 dB can be easily achieved in the channel for antisqueezing levels of less than 22 dB.</description>

      <title>In-situ Physical Adjoint Computing in multiple-scattering electromagnetic environments for wave control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling electromagnetic wave propagation in multiple scattering systems is a challenging endeavor due to the extraordinary sensitivity generated by strong multi-path contributions at any given location. Overcoming such complexity has emerged as a central research theme in recent years, motivated both by a wide range of applications -- from wireless communications and imaging to optical micromanipulations -- and by the fundamental principles underlying these efforts. Here, we show that an {\it in-situ} manipulation of the myriad scattering events, achieved through time- and energy-efficient adjoint optimization (AO) methodologies, enables {\it real time} wave-driven functionalities such as targeted channel emission, coherent perfect absorption, and camouflage. Our paradigm shift exploits the highly multi-path nature of these complex environments, where repeated wave-scattering dramatically amplifies small local AO-informed system variations. Our approach can be immediately applied to in-door wireless technologies and incorporated into diverse wave-based frameworks including imaging, power electronic and optical neural networks.</description>

      <title>Onsager reciprocal relations for charge and spin transport in periodically driven systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A time-periodic driving field can be used to generate and control transport phenomena. Any transport coefficients in the linear-response regime are restricted by the Onsager reciprocal relations, but these relations in periodically driven systems have been poorly understood. In particular, the Onsager reciprocal relation in spin transport of these systems is lacking despite its vital role. Here we establish the Onsager reciprocal relations for charge and spin transport in periodically driven systems. We consider the time-averaged charge and spin off-diagonal dc conductivities $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{C}}$ and $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{S}}$ in the nonequilibrium steady state with the pump field of light. First, we argue the Onsager reciprocal relations for these conductivities with the pump field of circularly, linearly, or bicircularly polarized light. We show that $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{C}}$ and $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{S}}$ satisfy the Onsager reciprocal relations in all the cases considered, but their main terms depend on the polarization of light. Our numerical calculations validate our general arguments. Therefore, the spin current generated in periodically driven systems is detectable by the inverse spin Hall effect. Our numerical calculations also show that $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{C}}$ cannot necessarily be regarded as the anomalous Hall conductivity even with broken time-reversal symmetry, whereas $\sigma_{yx}^{\textrm{S}}$ can be regarded as the spin Hall conductivity in all the cases considered. Our results suggest that it is highly required to check the dominant terms of the charge and spin off-diagonal conductivities in discussing the anomalous Hall and spin Hall effects, respectively. This study will become a cornerstone of theoretical and experimental studies of transport phenomena in periodically driven systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low energy valleys in the band structure of 2d materials represent a potential route to the ultrafast writing of information in quantum matter by laser light, with excited charge at the K or K$^\ast$ valleys representing the fundamental states of 1 and 0. Here we demonstrate that a second electronic feature, the saddle point, is endowed with lightwave control over information states. Linearly polarized light is shown to excite 2 of the 3 inequivalent M point saddles in graphene, generating three possible excited configurations, with which of these are realised determined by the polarization vector direction. We show that saddle excitation is highly robust, with "saddle polarized" states created both in the sub-cycle strong field regime and the long time limit of extended multi-cycle pulses. Our findings, applicable to other members of the graphene family and Xenes such as stanene, point towards a rich and ultrafast light based manipulation of matter based on the saddle point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent acoustic phonons (CAPs)$-$propagating strain waves that can dynamically modify the structure and symmetry of a crystal$-$offer unique opportunities for controlling material properties. We investigate CAP generation in the Janus-like layered alloy tungsten sulfide selenide (WS$_x$Se$_{1-x}$, hereafter WSSe). Employing high-fluence photoexcitation at 400 nm combined with ultrafast transient reflection spectroscopy, we capture the carrier-lattice dynamics governed by a cascade of processes including rapid exciton formation, phonon recycling, and thermoelastic deformation. These phenomena precede the emergence of a robust CAP mode at 27 GHz. Notably, the CAP amplitude in WSSe substantially exceeds that observed in the symmetric parent crystals WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$, which we attribute to an enhanced coupling mediated by a built-in out-of-plane electric field arising from the inversion asymmetry of the WSSe alloy. Furthermore, the implementation of a tailored two-pulse excitation sequence enables optical control of the CAP, underscoring the potential of WSSe and related Janus-like layered alloys as versatile building blocks in optomechanical and nanoacoustic device applications.</description>

Abstract: The leading order monochromatic aberrations are investigated for the optical systems, which obey single-plane symmetry and translational invariance. These aberrations are classified from the symmetry principles for the wave aberration function. The Fermat's Principle is applied for a system made of generic cylindrical surfaces and a complete set of the aberration coefficients required for calculation of the aberrations for any paraxial ray is obtained. To demonstrate the applied value of the analytical results obtained the criteria of compensation of the leading aberrations for cylindrical analog of the Cassegrain telescope were found.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a slab of wire medium composed of thin parallel metallic wires can naturally support bound states in the continuum (BICs) formed in an unusual way. The revealed BICs appear due to the strong spatial dispersion making possible the propagation of longitudinal plasma-like waves and TEM polarized modes with a flat band. The symmetry-protected (at-$\Gamma$) BICs are formed due to the polarization mismatch between the longitudinal plasma-like waves and transversal plane waves in the surrounding space, while the accidental (off-$\Gamma$) BICs appear as a result of the destructive interference between bulk TEM and plasma modes. All revealed BICs can be well-described analytically without the use of the Bloch theorem within effective medium approximation when the wire medium behaves as homogeneous 1D anisotropic plasma with strong spatial dispersion.</description>

Abstract: Photonic microring resonators are used in a variety of chip-integrated sensing applications where they allow one to measure transmission intensity changes upon external signals with a sensitivity that scales linearly with the Q factor. In this work, we suggest exploiting the nonlinear self-phase-modulation effect to increase the overall sensitivity by an additional gain factor appearing when the operational point of the nonlinear resonator is chosen just at the crossover from the monostable to the bistable regime. We present the theoretical idea together with a first proof of concept experiment displaying a gain factor of 22 on a chip-integrated silicon-nitride resonator.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Limits of Hard X-ray Coherence Length Measurement Employing Young's Double Slit Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Young's double slit experiment has been the most explored technique to gauge the coherence properties of a given system. The limits of this technique in characterizing spatial coherence properties of high emittance, hard x-ray synchrotron sources have been performed at the BXDS-IVU beamline, Canadian Light Source (CLS). High emittance synchrotron sources have always been assumed to possess sub-optimal coherence properties, especially in the hard X-ray regime. While this is largely true, it is very important to understand the limits of coherence for these existing high emittance sources. We have demonstrated that the Young's double slit experiment has harsher limits than what is normally expected in the form of inherent ambiguity. We present data obtained at multiple energies in both the horizontal and vertical direction leading to a thorough understanding of the fundamental limitations of employing Young's double slit experiment to characterize inherently low coherence length systems. We have put forth a novel numerical technique to estimate the source size directly from the Young's double slit interference patterns. With these results, we have demonstrated that CLS has functional coherent beam properties in the hard X-ray regime with Spatial coherence lengths ranging from 5.37$\mu \text{m}$ to 17.61$\mu \text{m}$ in the horizontal direction. The same in the vertical direction was at least 3 times larger. Finally, we present theoretical calculations showcasing the limits of Young's double slit experiment in characterizing diffraction limited sources.</description>

      <title>Cross-spectral purity: a generalization of spatiotemporal separability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the connection between cross-spectral purity and spatiotemporal separability of nonstationary (pulsed) scalar fields. It is found that in the case of complete coherence, there is a two-way relation between global cross-spectral purity and spatiotemporal separability of the field. Moreover, we show that cross-spectral purity generalizes the notion of spatiotemporal separability to partially coherent fields, due to the separability of the correlation functions. We also briefly discuss simple self-referencing linear measurement methods that can reveal cross-spectral purity.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Mode-Locked Single-Cavity Dual-Comb Laser Utilizing Time-Stretch Dispersive Fourier Transform Spectroscopy with Supplemental File</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As dual combs play a significant role in numerous high-precision measurements, their efficient generation has been widely researched. Although the single-cavity dual-comb generation can avoid the complex active stabilization methods, achieving and maintaining stable dual-comb mode locking within a single cavity remains a critical challenge. To break through this constraint, a two-part evaluation criterion containing a fitness function and a CNN-Transformer network is employed to achieve mode locking and classify the dual-comb mode-locked state. Simulated time-stretch dispersive Fourier transform (DFT) spectra are used as datasets, which simplifies the optimization process and does not rely on specific experimental data. A developed evolutionary algorithm (EA) for paddle-based motorized polarization controllers (MPCs) is proposed, enabling the intelligent attainment of dual-comb mode-locked states. A real-time library stores fitness and MPC angles, facilitating mode-locked state achievement within 2 seconds. Finally, long term running of dual-comb mode locking is ensured by a random collision algorithm utilizing an evaluation criterion of weak soliton peaks.</description>

      <title>Influence of the laser pulse duration in high-order harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-order harmonic generation (HHG) in gases has been studied for almost 40 years in many different conditions, varying the laser wavelength, intensity, focusing geometry, target design, gas species, etc. However, no systematic investigation of the effect of the pulse duration has been performed in spite of its expected impact on phase-matching of the high-order harmonics. Here, we develop a compact post-compression method based on a bulk multi-pass cell enabling tunable Fourier-limited pulse durations. We examine the HHG yield as a function of the pulse duration, ranging from 42 fs to 180 fs, while maintaining identical focusing conditions and generating medium. Our findings reveal that, for a given intensity, there exists an optimum pulse duration - not necessarily the shortest - that maximizes conversion efficiency. This optimum pulse duration increases as the intensity decreases. The experimental results are corroborated by numerical simulations, which show the dependence of HHG yield on the duration and peak intensity of the driving laser and underscore the importance of the interplay between light-matter interaction and phase-matching in the non-linear medium. Our conclusion explains why HHG could be demonstrated in 1988 with pulses as long as 40 ps and intensities of just a few $10^{13}$ W/cm${^2}$.</description>

      <title>General protocols for the efficient distillation of indistinguishable photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14217v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce state-of-the-art protocols to distill indistinguishable photons, reducing distinguishability error rates by a factor of $n$, while using a modest amount of resources scaling only linearly in $n$. Our resource requirements are both significantly lower and have fewer hardware requirements than previous works, making large-scale distillation experimentally feasible for the first time. This efficient reduction of distinguishability error rates has direct applications to fault-tolerant linear optical quantum computation, potentially leading to improved thresholds for photon loss errors and allowing smaller code distances, thus reducing overall resource costs. Our protocols are based on Fourier transforms on finite abelian groups, special cases of which include the discrete Fourier transform and Hadamard matrices. This general perspective allows us to unify previous results on distillation protocols and introduce a large family of efficient schemes. We utilize the rich mathematical structure of Fourier transforms, including symmetries and related suppression laws, to quantify the performance of these distillation protocols both analytically and numerically. Finally, our work resolves an open question concerning suppression laws for the $n$-photon discrete Fourier transform: the suppression laws are exactly characterized by the well-known Zero Transmission Law if and only if $n$ is a prime power.</description>

      <title>Linking structure and optical properties of plasmonic nanoparticles on tunable spherical surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03124v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The complexation of plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) and thermoresponsive microgels is widely exploited for applications, but a microscopic description of the mechanisms governing the spatial organization of the NPs is still lacking. Combining small angle X-ray scattering, state-of-the-art simulations and a simple toy model, we uncover how the volume phase transition of microgels controls NP-NP interactions, establishing for the first time a microscopic link between plasmon coupling and NP local structure. Our study paves the way to experimentally investigate phase transitions on controlled curved surfaces at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Grayscale to Hyperspectral at Any Resolution Using a Phase-Only Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of reconstructing a HxWx31 hyperspectral image from a HxW grayscale snapshot measurement that is captured using only a single diffractive optic and a filterless panchromatic photosensor. This problem is severely ill-posed, but we present the first model that produces high-quality results. We make efficient use of limited data by training a conditional denoising diffusion model that operates on small patches in a shift-invariant manner. During inference, we synchronize per-patch hyperspectral predictions using guidance derived from the optical point spread function. Surprisingly, our experiments reveal that patch sizes as small as the PSFs support achieve excellent results, and they show that local optical cues are sufficient to capture full spectral information. Moreover, by drawing multiple samples, our model provides per-pixel uncertainty estimates that strongly correlate with reconstruction error. Our work lays the foundation for a new class of high-resolution snapshot hyperspectral imagers that are compact and light-efficient.</description>

      <title>Compact and stable source of polarization-entangled photon-pairs based on a folded linear displacement interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The realization of quantum networks requires the development of robust low size, weight and power (SWaP) systems suitable for operation under harsh environments in remote and mobile nodes such as satellites. We present a source of polarization-entangled photon-pairs in a folded linear displacement interferometer based on spontaneous parametric down conversion using a Type-0 periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate crystal. Featuring a compact and stable double-pass geometry using a corner-cube retroreflector, the source has a detected pair rate of 2.5 M pairs/s/mW with a Bell state fidelity of 94.1% +/- 2.1%. The qualities and demonstrated performance of the source make it suitable for deployment in entanglement-based quantum networks.</description>
