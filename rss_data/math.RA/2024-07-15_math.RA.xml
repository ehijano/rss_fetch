      <title>Two-Term Polynomial Identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study algebras satisfying a two-term multilinear identity of the form $x_1\cdots x_n=qx_{\sigma(1)}\cdots x_{\sigma(n)}$. We show that such algebras with $q=1$ are eventually commutative in the sense that the equality $x_1\cdots x_k =x_{\tau(1)}\cdots x_{\tau(k)}$ holds for $k$ large enough and all permutations $\tau\in S_k$. For various natural examples, we prove that $k$ can be taken to be $n+1$ or $n+2$, but in other cases the minimal $k$ can be as large as $2n-3$. In the case that $q\ne1$, we establish that the algebra must be nilpotent.</description>

      <title>A poisonous example to explicit resolutions of unbounded complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that various methods for explicitly building resolutions of unbounded complexes in fact fail when applied to a rather simple and explicit complex. We show that one way to rescue these methods is to assume Roos (Ab.4$^*$)-$k$ axiom, which we adapt to encompass also resolutions in the framework of relative homological algebra. In the end we discuss the existence of model structures for relative homological algebra for unbounded complex under the relative (Ab.4$^*$)-$k$ condition, and present a variety of examples where our results apply.</description>

      <title>Rings Whose Non-Invertible Elements are Weakly Nil-Clean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In regard to our recent studies of rings with (strongly, weakly) nil-clean-like properties, we explore in-depth both the structural and characterization properties of those rings whose elements that are not units are weakly nil-clean. Group rings of this sort are considered and described as well.</description>

      <title>$5 \times 5$-graded Lie algebras, cubic norm structures and quadrangular algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study simple Lie algebras generated by extremal elements, over arbitrary fields of arbitrary characteristic. We show: (1) If the extremal geometry contains lines, then the Lie algebra admits a $5 \times 5$-grading that can be parametrized by a cubic norm structure; (2) If there exists a field extension of degree at most $2$ such that the extremal geometry over that field extension contains lines, and in addition, there exist symplectic pairs of extremal elements, then the Lie algebra admits a $5 \times 5$-grading that can be parametrized by a quadrangular algebra.
  One of our key tools is a new definition of exponential maps that makes sense even over fields of characteristic $2$ and $3$, which ought to be interesting in its own right.</description>

      <title>The growth of free inverse monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the rate of exponential growth of the free inverse monoid of rank $r$ (and hence an upper bound on the corresponding rate for all $r$-generated inverse monoids and semigroups). This turns out to be an algebraic number strictly between the obvious bounds of $2r-1$ and $2r$, tending to $2r$ as the rank tends to infinity. We also find an explicit expression for the exponential growth rate of the number of idempotents, and prove that this tends to $\sqrt{e(2k-1)}$ as $k \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>On a problem by Nathan Jacobson for Malcev algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.01155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we solve a problem for a certain class of Malcev algebras, which is an analogous of an old problem posed by Nathan Jacobson for alternative algebras. Specifically we prove a coordinatization theorem for a class of Malcev algebras containing the 3-dimensional simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{s l}_{2}(\mathbb{F})$ such that $m\,\mathfrak{s l}_{2}(\mathbb{F})\neq 0$ for any $0\neq m\in\mathcal{M}.$ We drop the last condition and we describe the structure of the same class of Malcev algebras $\mathcal{M}$ that contains $\mathfrak{s l}_{2}(\mathbb{F})$.</description>

      <title>A Survey on the Munthe-Kaas-Wright Hopf Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04381v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We survey the Munthe-Kaas--Wright Hopf algebra defined on planar rooted trees. This algebra serves a role akin to that of the Butcher--Connes--Kreimer Hopf algebra on non-planar rooted trees within the domain of numerical methods for ordinary differential equations. In the course of our presentation, we revisit Foissy's work on finite-dimensional comodules over the Butcher--Connes--Kreimer Hopf algebra and expand on his findings to include the Munthe-Kaas--Wright Hopf algebra. This involves detailing its endomorphisms and recursively constructing its primitive elements. These results are applied within the context of rough paths, where we describe an isomorphism between planarly branched and geometric rough paths. Our approach hinges on the extension of the Guin--Oudom construction to post-Lie algebras. In the case of the free post-Lie algebra defined on planar rooted trees, it yields the dual of the Munthe-Kaas--Wright Hopf algebra. Surprisingly, we uncover a natural connection between the concept of bialgebras in cointeraction and the Guin--Oudom construction. Prompted by the rough path perspective, we explore this finding through the lens of translations on rough paths. Additionally, we investigate the geometric embedding for planar regularity structures.</description>

      <title>Notes on A-infinity algebras, A-infinity categories and non-commutative geometry. I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0606241</link>
      <description>arXiv:math/0606241v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop geometric approach to A-infinity algebras and A-infinity categories based on the notion of formal scheme in the category of graded vector spaces. Geometric approach clarifies several questions, e.g. the notion of homological unit or A-infinity structure on A-infinity functors. We discuss Hochschild complexes of A-infinity algebras from geometric point of view. The paper contains homological versions of the notions of properness and smoothness of projective varieties as well as the non-commutative version of Hodge-to-de Rham degeneration conjecture. We also discuss a generalization of Deligne's conjecture which includes both Hochschild chains and cochains. We conclude the paper with the description of an action of the PROP of singular chains of the topological PROP of 2-dimensional surfaces on the Hochschild chain complex of an A-infinity algebra with the scalar product. This action is essentially equivalent to the structure of 2-dimensional Topological Field Theory associated with a Calabi-Yau category.</description>

      <title>On the Matrix Form of the Quaternion Fourier Transform and Quaternion Convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study matrix forms of quaternionic versions of the Fourier Transform and Convolution operations. Quaternions offer a powerful representation unit, however they are related to difficulties in their use that stem foremost from non-commutativity of quaternion multiplication, and due to that $\mu^2 = -1$ possesses infinite solutions in the quaternion domain. Handling of quaternionic matrices is consequently complicated in several aspects (definition of eigenstructure, determinant, etc.). Our research findings clarify the relation of the Quaternion Fourier Transform matrix to the standard (complex) Discrete Fourier Transform matrix, and the extend on which well-known complex-domain theorems extend to quaternions. We focus especially on the relation of Quaternion Fourier Transform matrices to Quaternion Circulant matrices (representing quaternionic convolution), and the eigenstructure of the latter. A proof-of-concept application that makes direct use of our theoretical results is presented, where we present a method to bound the Lipschitz constant of a Quaternionic Convolutional Neural Network.</description>
