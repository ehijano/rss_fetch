      <title>Hierarchical genotype networks and incipient ecological speciation in Q$\beta$ phage quasispecies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how viral mutant spectra organize and explore genotype space is essential for unraveling the mechanisms driving evolution at the finest scale. Here we use deep-sequencing data of an amplicon in the A2 protein of the RNA bacteriophage Q$\beta$ to reconstruct genotype networks with tens of thousands of different haplotypes. The study of populations evolved under different temperature regimes uncovers generic topological features conditioned by fundamental structural motifs of genotype networks -- tetrahedrons, triangles, and squares -- that govern their local architecture. Mutant swarms display a hierarchical structure where sequences cluster around a highly connected and abundant sequence core that sustains population diversity. The immediate neighborhood of this core is comprehensively sampled, with no signs of selection, while a few mutations away sampling becomes dynamical and sparse, showing signs of purifying selection. By aggregating genotype networks from populations adapted to different temperatures, we capture the early stages of evolutionary divergence, with overlapping populations that remain connected through short mutational paths. Even at the time scale of these experiments, evolutionary pathways might be multiple, preventing the backward reconstruction of unique trajectories once mutations have been fixed. This analysis provides a detailed view of the local, fine-scale processes shaping viral quasispecies evolution and underscores the usefulness of genotype networks as an enlightening visualization of the organization of mutant swarms.</description>

      <title>Continuum limit of the adaptive Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the adaptive Kuramoto model with slow adaptation in the continuum limit, $N\to\infty$. This model is distinguished by dense multistability, where multiple states coexist for the same system parameters. The underlying cause of this multistability is that some oscillators can lock at different phases or switch between locking and drifting depending on their initial conditions. We identify new states, such as two-cluster states. To simplify the analysis we introduce an approximate reduction of the model via row-averaging of the coupling matrix. We derive a self-consistency equation for the reduced model and present a stability diagram illustrating the effects of positive and negative adaptation. Our theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations of a large finite system. Comparisons to previous work highlight the significant influence of adaptation on synchronization behavior.</description>

      <title>Risk aversion can promote cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cooperative dynamics are central to our understanding of many phenomena in living and complex systems. However, we lack a universal mechanism to explain the emergence of cooperation. We present a novel framework for modelling social dilemma games with an arbitrary number of players by combining reaction networks, methods from quantum mechanics applied to stochastic complex systems, game theory and stochastic simulations of molecular reactions. Using this framework, we propose a novel and robust mechanism for cooperation based on risk aversion that leads to cooperative behaviour in population games. Rather than individuals seeking to maximise payouts in the long run, individuals seek to obtain a minimum set of resources with a given level of confidence and in a limited time span. We show that this mechanism can lead to the emergence of new equilibria in a range of social dilemma games.</description>
