      <title>Temperature dependence of $p$-wave contacts in a harmonically trapped Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dependence of the $p$-wave contact $C_v$ on the Fermi temperature $T_F$ and reduced temperature $T/T_F$ based on the number of closed-channel molecules. From the anisotropic pattern of dissociated molecules, we resolve the narrow $|m|=0$ and $|m|=1$ dipolar splitting of the $p$-wave Feshbach resonance in $^6$Li, enabling the independent determination of the contact for the two components. As $T_F$ increases, the anisotropy is no longer resolved and the near-resonant contact scales linearly with $\sqrt{T_F}$, indicating the contribution of the normalized effective range $k_F R_{\rm{e}}$. The $T/T_F$ dependence across the attractive regime reveals opposite trends in the strongly and weakly interacting limits, which are accurately represented by the second-order virial expansion. Our results, together with estimates from the $p$-wave virial coefficient, provide a route toward a complete understanding of the thermodynamics of strongly interacting $p$-wave Fermi gases.</description>

      <title>The Three-Body Limit Cycle: Universal Form for General Regulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Efimov effect, a remarkable realization of discrete scale invariance, emerges in the three-body problem with short-range interactions and is understood as a renormalization group (RG) limit cycle within Short-Range Effective Field Theory (SREFT). While the analytic form of the three-body renormalization relation has been established for a sharp cutoff regulator, its universality for other regulators remains underexplored. In this letter, we derive the universal functional form of the three-body renormalization relation for general separable regulators through a detailed analysis of the Skorniakov-Ter-Martirosian and Faddeev equations. We find that the relation is characterized by three parameters. This universality is verified numerically for various regulators. Although the functional form remains the same, the parameters characterizing the limit cycle exhibit regulator dependence. These findings broaden the class of RG limit cycles in SREFT and offer a more complete understanding of three-body renormalization.</description>

      <title>Ferrodark soliton collisions: breather formation, pair reproduction and spin-mass separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study collisions between a ferrodark soliton (FDS) and an antiFDS ($Z_2$ kinks in the spin order) in the easy-plane phase of spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC). For a type-I pair (type-I FDS-antiFDS pair) at low incoming velocities, the pair annihilates followed by the formation of an extremely long-lived dissipative breather on a stable background, a spatially localized wave packet with out-of-phase oscillating magnetization and number densities. Periodic emissions of spin and density waves cause breather energy dissipation and we find that the breather energy decays logarithmically in time. When the incoming velocity is larger than a critical velocity at which a stationary FDS-anti FDS pair forms, a pair with finite separating velocity is reproduced. When approaching the critical velocity from below, we find that the lifetime of the stationary type-I pair shows a power-law divergence, resembling a critical behavior. In contrast, a type-II pair (type-II FDS-antiFDS pair)never annihilates and only exhibits reflection. For collisions of a mixed type FDS-antiFDS pair, as $Z_2$ kinks in the spin order, reflection occurs in the topological structure of the magnetization while the mass superfluid density profiles pass through each other, manifesting spin-mass separation.</description>

      <title>Universal properties and dynamical bosonization of strongly interacting one-dimensional $p$-wave anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional system of strongly interacting anyons with short-range interactions under external confinement. This system, referred to as $p$-wave anyons, interpolates continuously between spin-polarized fermions with $p$-wave interactions and free bosons. At zero temperature, the correlation functions decay exponentially with distance, with oscillations governed by the statistics parameter. The decay rate is maximal for $p$-wave fermions and decreases monotonically as the statistics parameter approaches the bosonic limit, where it vanishes. The momentum distribution is asymmetric, a hallmark of one-dimensional anyons, and takes the form of a shifted Lorentzian with universal power-law tails, $\lim_{k \to \pm \infty} n(k)\sim C/k^2$. We prove analytically that, following release from a harmonic trap, the asymptotic momentum distribution converges to that of free bosons in the same trap, a phenomenon known as dynamical bosonization. We also establish the universality of the groundstate $n$-particle reduced density matrices: their natural occupations are independent of the confining potential, while the associated natural $n$-functions for different confinements are related through a simple analytical transformation. In particular, for the one-particle reduced density matrix, we derive exact expressions for both the natural occupations and the natural orbitals at arbitrary particle number. These results extend and unify earlier partial findings for $p$-wave fermions, and they provide a clear conceptual explanation of the double degeneracy observed in their spectrum.</description>

      <title>Downfolding a quantum many-body system: the quasi-1D Fermi polaron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of an impurity immersed in an ensemble of spin-polarized fermions confined in a tight quantum wire. We use a non-perturbative variational approach that accounts for virtual transverse excitations and regularizes the zero-range interaction. We compute the polaron's energy, effective mass, and spectral weight, and benchmark our results against the exactly solvable Yang-Gaudin model of a purely 1D system. While the two models agree in the weakly interacting regime, we find significant deviations in the strongly attractive limit, including a divergence of the effective mass and evidence for a polaron-to-molecule transition inherited from the underlying 3D physics, which is absent in the purely 1D description. Our work quantifies the accuracy of quasi-1D systems as analog quantum simulators and highlights the emergence of beyond-1D physics even in nominally 1D settings.</description>

      <title>Few is different: deciphering many-body dynamics in mesoscopic quantum gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergent macroscopic descriptions of matter, such as hydrodynamics, are central to our description of complex physical systems across a wide spectrum of energy scales. The conventional understanding of these many-body phenomena has recently been shaken by a number of experimental findings. Collective behavior of matter has been observed in \emph{mesoscopic} systems, such as high-energy hadron-hadron collisions, or ultra-cold gases with only few strongly interacting fermions. In such systems, the separation of scales between macroscopic and microscopic dynamics (at the heart of any effective theory) is inapplicable. To address the conceptual challenges that arise from these observations and explore the universality of emergent descriptions of matter, the EMMI Rapid Reaction Task Force was assembled. This document summarizes the RRTF discussions on recent theoretical and experimental advances in this rapidly developing field. Leveraging technological breakthroughs in the control of quantum systems, we can now quantitatively explore what it means for a system to exhibit behavior beyond the sum of its individual parts. In particular, the report highlights how the (in)applicability of hydrodynamics and other effective theories can be probed across three principal frontiers: the size frontier, the equilibrium frontier, and the interaction frontier.</description>

      <title>Supersolidity induced flux magnetism with magnetic atoms in an anti-magic wavelength optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersolidity and magnetism are fundamental phenomena characterizing strongly correlated states of matter. Here, we unveil a mechanism that establishes a direct connection between these quantum regimes and can be experimentally accessed in ultracold atomic systems. Specifically, we exploit the distinctive properties of ultracold magnetic lanthanide atoms trapped in a one dimensional anti-magic wavelength optical lattice. This allows us to design a realistic implementation of a triangular Bose-Hubbard ladder featuring two essential ingredients: strong long-range interactions and tunable gauge fields. Thanks to these unconventional properties, our numerical analysis highlights that, among the others, a robust lattice supersolid regime with finite fluxes in each triangular plaquette occurs. Remarkably, we show that the specific density distribution of the supersolid phase leads to the magnetic ordering of fluxes, which can form ferrimagnetic and ferromagnetic structures. Our results thus discover a fascinating quantum mechanical effect that bridges supersolidity and magnetism.</description>

      <title>Simulated Laser Cooling and Magneto-Optical Trapping of Group IV Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a scheme for laser cooling and magneto-optical trapping of the Group IV (a.k.a. Group 14 or tetrel) atoms silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), tin (Sn), and lead (Pb). These elements each possess a strong Type-II transition ($J \rightarrow J' = J-1$) between the metastable $s^2p^2 \,^3 P_1$ state and the excited $s^2ps'\, ^3P_0^o$ state at an accessible laser wavelength, making them amenable to laser cooling and trapping. We focus on the application of this scheme to Sn, which has several features that make it attractive for precision measurement applications. We perform numerical simulations of atomic beam slowing, capture into a magneto-optical trap (MOT), and subsequent sub-Doppler cooling and compression in a blue-detuned MOT of Sn atoms. We also discuss a realistic experimental setup for realizing a high phase-space density sample of Sn atoms.</description>

      <title>Excitable quantum systems: the bosonic avalanche laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a lasing system that is driven by a current of bosonic (quasi-) particles via a dissipative three-mode mixing process. A semi-classical analysis of this system predicts distinct dynamical regimes, where both the cavity mode and the gain medium can undergo lasing transitions. Of particular interest is an intermediate self-pulsing phase that exhibits the characteristics of an excitable system and converts random input signals into separated, quasi-periodic pulses at the output. By performing exact Monte-Carlo simulations, we extend this analysis into the quantum regime and show that despite being dominated by huge bosonic particle number fluctuations, this effect of coherence resonance survives even for rather low average photon numbers. Our system thus represents a intriguing model for an excitable quantum many-body system with practical relevance for quantum detectors or autonomous quantum machines. As an illustration, we discuss the realization of this system with superconducting quantum circuits and its application as a number-resolved avalanche detector for microwave photons.</description>

      <title>Circular dichroism on the edge of quantum Hall systems: From many-body Chern number to anisotropy measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Hall states are characterized by a topological invariant, the many-body Chern number, which determines their quantized Hall conductivity. This invariant also emerges in circular dichroic responses, namely, by applying a circular drive and comparing excitation rates for opposite orientations. This work explores the dichroic response of confined, isolated quantum Hall systems, where bulk and edge contributions cancel exactly: When the edge response is properly isolated, the circular dichroic signal becomes quantized, serving as a direct and elegant probe of the many-body Chern number encoded in the edge physics. We demonstrate that this quantized edge response is entirely captured by low-energy chiral edge modes, allowing for a universal description of this effect based on Wen's edge theory. Its low-energy nature implies that the quantized edge response can be distinguished from the bulk response in the frequency domain. The edge response is also shown to be a sensitive diagnostic of geometric features. This opens the possibility of characterizing the shape of quantum Hall droplets through edge spectroscopic measurements, without requiring knowledge of the system's boundary profile. We illustrate our findings using realistic models of integer and fractional Chern insulators, with different edge geometries, and propose detection schemes suitable for ultracold atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum droplets are formed in quantum many-body systems when the competition of quantum corrections with the mean-field interaction yields a stable self-bound quantum liquid. We predict the emergence of a quantum droplet when a Bose-Einstein condensate is placed in an optical resonator with transverse pumping. The strong coupling between the atoms and the cavity mode induces long-range interactions in the atoms and a roton mode for negative cavity detuning emerges. Using a Bogoliubov theory, we show that the roton mode competes with the repulsive atomic $s$-wave scattering. Due to the favorable scaling of the quantum fluctuations with respect to the volume, a self-bound stable quantum liquid emerges.</description>

      <title>Kelvin waves in nonequilibrium universal dynamics of relativistic scalar field theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the different degrees of freedom underlying far-from-equilibrium scaling behaviour in a relativistic, single-component $\mathrm{O}(1)$ scalar field theory in two and three spatial dimensions. In such a strongly correlated many-body system, identifying the respective roles of nonlinear wave excitations and defect dynamics is a prerequisite for understanding the universal character of time evolution far from equilibrium and thus the different possible universality classes of nonthermal fixed points. Using unequal-time two-point correlation functions, we extract information about the dominant infrared excitations and study their connections to the turbulent dynamics of topological defects created in the system. In three dimensions, the primary excitations are identified as kelvon quasiparticles, which are quantised Kelvin waves propagating along vortex lines, while in two dimensions, vortices are point defects, and the infrared dynamics is dominated by bound-state like excitations similar to Kelvin waves. In both cases, the kelvon excitations are found to be characterised by distinct time-evolving dispersion relations, subject to the coarsening dynamics close to the respective nonthermal fixed point and, thus, to the decay of superfluid turbulence in the system. Our results underline the role of topological defects and their influence on the universal dynamics of strongly correlated systems near nonthermal fixed points, complementing the analysis of large-$N$ models in $\mathrm{O}(N)$ systems.</description>

      <title>Field-sensitive dislocation bound states in two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnet is grown on a substrate, the interplay of momentum-dependent spin splittings arising from altermagnetism and Rashba spin-orbit coupling gives rise to a nodal band structure with band degeneracies enforced by a $C_{4z}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry. If we break the $C_{4z}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry by an exchange field, the band degeneracies are found to be immediately lifted, leading to a topological band structure characterized by nontrivial strong and weak topological indices. Remarkably, both the strong topological index and the $Z_{2}$-valued weak topological indices depend sensitively on the direction of the exchange field. As a consequence of the bulk-defect correspondence, we find that the unique dependence of weak topological indices on the exchange field in this system dictates that the presence or absence of topological bound states at lattice dislocations also depends sensitively on the direction of the exchange field. When the substrate is an $s$-wave superconductor, we find that a similar dependence of band topology on the exchange field gives rise to field-sensitive dislocation Majorana zero modes. As topological dislocation bound states are easily detectable by scanning tunneling microscopy, our findings unveil a promising experimental diagnosis of altermagnetic materials among an ever growing list of candidates.</description>

Abstract: We define a measurable spin for the edge of a lowest Landau level and incompressible fractional quantum Hall state in the presence of an Abelian or non-Abelian bulk quasiparticle. We show that this quantity takes a fractional value inherited from the fractional spin of the bulk quasiparticle. We present a geometric picture that does not rely on global symmetries of the wavefunction but is able to treat quasiparticles and edges with different shapes. We study finite-size many-body wavefunctions on the cylinder with circular quasiparticles and straight edges. Our results are supported by matrix-product-state calculations for the Laughlin and the k=3 Read-Rezayi states.</description>

      <title>Quantum fluctuations can enhance or reduce positional uncertainty at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16822v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The uncertainty principle guarantees a non-zero value for the positional uncertainty, $\left\langle \Delta x^2\right\rangle &gt; 0$, even without thermal fluctuations. This implies that quantum fluctuations inherently enhance positional uncertainty at zero temperature. A natural question then arises: what happens at finite temperatures, where the interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations may give rise to complex and intriguing behaviors? To address this question, we systematically investigate the positional uncertainty, $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle$, of a particle in equilibrium confined within a nonlinear potential of the form $V(x) \propto x^n$, where $n = 2, 4, 6, \dots$ represents an even exponent. Using path integral Monte Carlo simulations, we calculate $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle$ in equilibrium as a function of the thermal de Broglie wavelength $\Lambda$. Interestingly, for large values of $n$, $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle$ exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on $\Lambda$: it initially decreases with increasing $\Lambda$ at small $\Lambda$ but increases at larger $\Lambda$. To further understand this behavior, we employ a semiclassical approximation, which reveals that quantum fluctuations can reduce positional uncertainty for small $\Lambda$ when the nonlinearity of the potential is sufficiently strong. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of this result for many-body phenomena driven by strong nonlinear interactions, such as glass transitions, where the transition densities exhibit a similar non-monotonic dependence on $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Superfluid density in linear response theory : pulsar glitches from the inner crust of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The question of whether there are enough superfluid neutrons in the inner crust of neutron stars to explain pulsar glitches remains a topic of debate. Previous band structure calculations suggest that the entrainment effect significantly reduces the superfluid density. In this letter, a new derivation of the BCS expression for the superfluid density is given. We compute it in the superfluid band theory framework through linear response theory, for a small relative velocity between superfluid and normal components, under the assumption that the pairing gap in the rest frame of the superfluid is constant and not affected by the perturbation. Our result suggests that a formula extensively used in neutron star physics is incomplete. Numerical evaluations for two realistic configurations reveal that the previously neglected contribution drastically alters the picture of the superfluid reservoir in the inner crust of neutron stars, suggesting that about 90% of the neutrons are effectively superfluid.</description>

      <title>Hidden Bose-Einstein Singularities in Correlated Electron Systems: III. Thermodynamic Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study thermodynamic consequences of the hidden Bose-Einstein singularities, which have been predicted to cause a pseudogap phase, based on quantum field theory of ordered phases. Starting from the Luttinger-Ward functional for the grand thermodynamic potential, we derive expressions of the Helmholtz free energy, internal energy, entropy, and heat capacity in a form suitable for numerical studies. They are applied to the weakly attractive Hubbard model in three dimensions to calculate the thermodynamic potentials numerically and continuously for the normal, pseudogap, and superconducting phases on the same footing. It is shown that the entry into the pseudogap phase is detectable as singularities of thermodynamic potentials, especially a discontinuity in the heat capacity.</description>

      <title>Regge poles of analogous rotating black holes in binary Bose-Einstein condensates: The gapped excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the spectrum of the Regge poles (RPs), which are the counterparts of quasinormal modes, in a draining bathtub vortex within a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) system. We study the gapped excitations of the condensate with the spatially dependent energy gap term using a spatially tunable Rabi coupling, which will be treated as a perturbation. This model serves as an analogue of a rotating black hole surrounded by an environmental mass shell. We first compute the semiclassical scattering amplitude with the spatially independent mass effect due to the orbital interference. In the case of the mass-shell, bifurcation of the spectrum is observed, resulting in the destabilization of the RPs. We also study the migration of RPs by shifting the bump position. Our results show that the RPs of the co-rotating modes exhibit greater stability than those of the counter-rotating modes. Large migration and overtaking jumps of the overtone (fundamental RP) leave an imprint on the scattering amplitude at small (large) scattering angles. This can be observed in the scattering interference pattern in experiments.</description>
