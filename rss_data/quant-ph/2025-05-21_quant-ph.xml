      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Channel Mixing in RWKV Models for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in neural sequence modeling have led to architectures such as RWKV, which combine recurrent-style time mixing with feedforward channel mixing to enable efficient long-context processing. In this work, we propose QuantumRWKV, a hybrid quantum-classical extension of the RWKV model, where the standard feedforward network (FFN) is partially replaced by a variational quantum circuit (VQC). The quantum component is designed to enhance nonlinear representational capacity while preserving end-to-end differentiability via the PennyLane framework. To assess the impact of quantum enhancements, we conduct a comparative evaluation of QuantumRWKV and its purely classical counterpart across a suite of synthetic time-series forecasting tasks, including linear (ARMA), chaotic (Logistic Map), oscillatory (Damped Oscillation), and piecewise-regime signals. Our results reveal that the quantum-enhanced model achieves superior performance in several tasks characterized by nonlinear or chaotic dynamics-such as Chaotic Logistic, Noisy Damped Oscillator, and Sine Wave-while exhibiting limitations in tasks with sharp discontinuities or simple autoregressive structures. This study provides one of the first systematic comparisons between hybrid quantum-classical and classical recurrent models in temporal domains, highlighting when and how quantum circuits can offer tangible benefits in time-series learning. We conclude with a discussion on architectural trade-offs and potential future directions for expanding quantum integration into large-scale temporal learning systems.</description>

      <title>Learning to Program Quantum Measurements for Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) have sparked significant interest, driving extensive exploration of quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms to address a wide range of complex challenges. The development of high-performance QML models requires expert-level expertise, presenting a key challenge to the widespread adoption of QML. Critical obstacles include the design of effective data encoding strategies and parameterized quantum circuits, both of which are vital for the performance of QML models. Furthermore, the measurement process is often neglected-most existing QML models employ predefined measurement schemes that may not align with the specific requirements of the targeted problem. We propose an innovative framework that renders the observable of a quantum system-specifically, the Hermitian matrix-trainable. This approach employs an end-to-end differentiable learning framework, enabling simultaneous optimization of the neural network used to program the parameterized observables and the standard quantum circuit parameters. Notably, the quantum observable parameters are dynamically programmed by the neural network, allowing the observables to adapt in real time based on the input data stream. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed method effectively programs observables dynamically within variational quantum circuits, achieving superior results compared to existing approaches. Notably, it delivers enhanced performance metrics, such as higher classification accuracy, thereby significantly improving the overall effectiveness of QML models.</description>

      <title>Noise-Robust Self-Testing: Detecting Non-Locality in Noisy Non-Local Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-local games test for non-locality and entanglement in quantum systems and are used in self-tests for certifying quantum states in untrusted devices. However, these protocols are tailored to ideal states, so realistic noise prevents maximal violations and leaves many partially non-local states undetected. Selecting self-tests based on their 'robustness' to noise can tailor protocols to specific applications, but current literature lacks a standardized measure of noise-robustness. Creating such a measure is challenging as there is no operational measure for comparing tests of different dimensionalities and input-output settings. We propose and study three comparative measures: noise-tolerance, convincingness, and an analytic approximation of convincingness called the gapped score. Our computational experiments and analytic framework demonstrate that convincingness provides the most nuanced measure for noise-robustness. We then show that the CHSH game has the highest noise-robustness compared to more complex games (2-CHSH variants and the Magic Square Game) when given equal resources, while with unequal resources, some 2-CHSH variants can outperform CHSH at a high resource cost. This work provides the first systematic and operational framework for comparing noise-robustness in self-testing protocols, laying a foundation for theoretical advances in understanding noise-robustness of self-tests and practical improvements in quantum resource utilization.</description>

      <title>Fast correlated decoding of transversal logical algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is required for large-scale computation, but incurs a significant resource overhead. Recent advances have shown that by jointly decoding logical qubits in algorithms composed of transversal gates, the number of syndrome extraction rounds can be reduced by a factor of the code distance $d$, at the cost of increased classical decoding complexity. Here, we reformulate the problem of decoding transversal circuits by directly decoding relevant logical operator products as they propagate through the circuit. This procedure transforms the decoding task into one closely resembling that of a single-qubit memory propagating through time. The resulting approach leads to fast decoding and reduced problem size while maintaining high performance. Focusing on the surface code, we prove that this method enables fault-tolerant decoding with minimum-weight perfect matching, and benchmark its performance on example circuits including magic state distillation. We find that the threshold is comparable to that of a single-qubit memory, and that the total decoding run time can be, in fact, less than that of conventional lattice surgery. Our approach enables fast correlated decoding, providing a pathway to directly extend single-qubit QEC techniques to transversal algorithms.</description>

      <title>Decoding across transversal Clifford gates in the surface code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transversal logical gates offer the opportunity for fast and low-noise logic, particularly when interspersed by a single round of parity check measurements of the underlying code. Using such circuits for the surface code requires decoding across logical gates, complicating the decoding task. We show how one can decode across an arbitrary sequence of transversal gates for the unrotated surface code, using a fast "logical observable" minimum-weight-perfect-matching (MWPM) based decoder, and benchmark its performance in Clifford circuits under circuit-level noise. We propose windowed logical observable matching decoders to address the problem of fully efficient decoding: our basic windowed decoder is computationally efficient under the restriction of quiescent (slow) resets. Our two-step windowed decoder can be computationally inefficient but allows fast resets. For both windowed decoders we identify errors which scale sublinearly in $d$ - depending on the structure of the circuit - which can lead to logical failure, and we propose methods to adapt the decoding to remove such failures. Our work highlights the complexity and interest in efficient decoding of fast logic for the surface code.</description>

      <title>OH molecule as a quantum probe to jointly estimate electric and magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The OH molecule (OHM) carries both electric and magnetic dipole moments and it is characterized by a diatomic structure that simplifies its modeling. Thus, it naturally emerges as a quantum probe for joint estimation of electric and magnetic fields. In this paper, we address optimal strategies to jointly estimate the two fields and to overcome the additional quantum noise due to their incompatibility. We study and optimize stationary and dynamical estimation strategies, and devise a sequential control scheme to beat the limitations imposed by non commutativity in specific configurations.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of the family of balanced product codes was pivotal in the subsequent development of `good' low density quantum error correcting codes that have optimal scaling of the key parameters of distance and storage density. We review this family, giving a completely different presentation to the original, minimising the abstraction and technicalities wherever possible.</description>

      <title>Entropic limitations on fixed causal order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum processes can exhibit scenarios beyond a fixed order of events. We propose information inequalities that, when violated, constitute sufficient conditions to certify quantum processes without a fixed causal order -- causally separable or indefinite causal ordered processes. The inequalities hold valid for a vast class of information measures. Nevertheless, we take under scrutiny the von Neumann, $\alpha-$R\'enyi entropies with parameter $\alpha \in [1/2,1) \cup (1,\infty)$, and max- and min-entropies. We also discuss how the strong subadditivity of quantum (von Neumann) entropy, used along with the information inequality developed here, implies relevant witnesses of causally separable and indefinite causal ordered processes in marginal scenarios. Importantly, we show the violation of these inequalities for the quantum switch, a paradigmatic example of a process with indefinite causal order. Our approach contributes to the important research direction of information-theoretic characterization of quantum processes beyond fixed causal orders.</description>

      <title>Genesis: A Compiler Framework for Hamiltonian Simulation on Hybrid CV-DV Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Genesis, the first compiler designed to support Hamiltonian Simulation on hybrid continuous-variable (CV) and discrete-variable (DV) quantum computing systems. Genesis is a two-level compilation system. At the first level, it decomposes an input Hamiltonian into basis gates using the native instruction set of the target hybrid CV-DV quantum computer. At the second level, it tackles the mapping and routing of qumodes/qubits to implement long-range interactions for the gates decomposed from the first level. Rather than a typical implementation that relies on SWAP primitives similar to qubit-based (or DV-only) systems, we propose an integrated design of connectivity-aware gate synthesis and beamsplitter SWAP insertion tailored for hybrid CV-DV systems. We also introduce an OpenQASM-like domain-specific language (DSL) named CVDV-QASM to represent Hamiltonian in terms of Pauli-exponentials and basic gate sequences from the hybrid CV-DV gate set. Genesis has successfully compiled several important Hamiltonians, including the Bose-Hubbard model, $\mathbb{Z}_2-$Higgs model, Hubbard-Holstein model, Heisenberg model and Electron-vibration coupling Hamiltonians, which are critical in domains like quantum field theory, condensed matter physics, and quantum chemistry. Our implementation is available at Genesis-CVDV-Compiler(https://github.com/ruadapt/Genesis-CVDV-Compiler).</description>

      <title>An Open Quantum System of Coupled Rotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum mechanical system of two coupled rotors (particles constrained to move on a circle) is studied from an open quantum systems point of view. One of the rotors is integrated out and the reduced density operator of the other rotor is studied. It's eigenvalues are worked out explicitly using the properties of Mathieu functions, and the von Neumann entropy, which is a standard measure of entanglement, is computed in terms of the Fourier coefficients defining the Mathieu functions. Furthermore, upon introducing a time-periodic delta kick and making one of the rotors much heavier than the other, the two-rotor system can be interpreted as a system-bath model, allowing us to introduce a series of approximations to derive a master equation of the Lindblad type describing the time-evolution of the reduced density operator.</description>

      <title>Large-scale quantum reservoir computing using a Gaussian Boson Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Gaussian boson sampler (GBS) is a special-purpose quantum computer that can be practically realized at large scale in optics. Here we report on experiments in which we used a frequency-multiplexed GBS with $&gt;400$ modes as the reservoir in the quantum-machine-learning approach of quantum reservoir computing. We evaluated the accuracy of our GBS-based reservoir computer on a variety of benchmark tasks, including spoken-vowels classification and MNIST handwritten-digit classification. We found that when the reservoir computer was given access to the correlations between measured modes of the GBS, the achieved accuracies were the same or higher than when it was only given access to the mean photon number in each mode -- and in several cases the advantage in accuracy from using the correlations was greater than 20 percentage points. This provides experimental evidence in support of theoretical predictions that access to correlations enhances the power of quantum reservoir computers. We also tested our reservoir computer when operating the reservoir with various sources of classical rather than squeezed (quantum) light and found that using squeezed light consistently resulted in the highest (or tied highest, for simple tasks) accuracies. Our work experimentally establishes that a GBS can be an effective reservoir for quantum reservoir computing and provides a practical platform for experimentally exploring the role of quantumness and correlations in quantum machine learning at very large system sizes.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Nonlocal: Comparing A. O. Barut's Theory to Mine with special emphasis on That Dot on the Screen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 1980's and 90's, A. O Barut and colleagues developed a nonperturbative approach to electrodynamics eschewing so-called ``second-quantization". Based on incorporation of self-energy terms, the resulting nonlinear and nonlocal theory explained many well-known phenomena of atomic and radiation physics. In 2017, this author introduced a nonlinear, nonlocal theory with the intent of resolving the Measurement Problem. Barut also suggested that his theory resolved such paradoxes. Here I compare the two theories with special attention to That Dot on the Screen.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computational Unpredictability Entropy and Quantum Leakage Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational entropies provide a framework for quantifying uncertainty and randomness under computational constraints. They play a central role in classical cryptography, underpinning the analysis and construction of primitives such as pseudo-random generators, leakage-resilient cryptography, and randomness extractors. In the quantum setting, however, computational analogues of entropy remain largely unexplored. In this work, we initiate the study of quantum computational entropy by defining quantum computational unpredictability entropy, a natural generalization of classical unpredictability entropy to the quantum setting. Our definition builds on the operational interpretation of quantum min-entropy as the optimal guessing probability, while restricting the adversary to efficient guessing strategies. We prove that this entropy satisfies several fundamental properties, including a leakage chain rule that holds even in the presence of unbounded prior quantum side-information. We also show that unpredictability entropy enables pseudo-randomness extraction against quantum adversaries with bounded computational power. Together, these results lay a foundation for developing cryptographic tools that rely on min-entropy in the quantum computational setting.</description>

      <title>Quantum state preparation with polynomial resources: Branched-Subspaces Adiabatic Preparation (B-SAP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state preparation lies at the heart of quantum computation and quantum simulations, enabling the investigation of complex systems of many bodies across physics, chemistry, and data science. Although methods such as Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) and Adiabatic Preparation (AP) offer promising routes, each faces significant challenges. In this work, we introduce a hybrid algorithm that integrates the conceptual strengths of VQAs and AP, enhanced through the use of group-theoretic structures, to efficiently approximate ground and excited states of arbitrary many-body Hamiltonians. Our approach is validated on the one-dimensional XYZ Heisenberg model with periodic boundary conditions across a broad parameters range and system sizes. Given the system size $L$, we successfully prepare up to $L^2-L+2$ of its lowest eigenstates with high fidelity, employing quantum circuit depths that scale only polynomially with L. These results highlight the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed algorithm, which offers a compelling pathway for the actual preparation of targeted quantum states on near-term quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: We present a frequency-correlated non-degenerate photon-pair source consisting of a second-order nonlinear crystal that generates ultraviolet UV-A and infrared light via spontaneous parametric down-conversion. Quantum imaging and sensing techniques like quantum imaging with undetected light and quantum ghost imaging leverage on wavelength correlations between down-converted photon pairs to decouple sensing and detection wavelengths, thereby exploiting established camera technology within the visible spectrum. Our results open up novel quantum sensing application scenarios in the ultraviolet domain, with potential implications for advancements in biomedical and non-destructive testing fields.</description>

Abstract: We develop a quantum-optical framework demonstrating that thermal radiation can confine a significant portion of its energy in dark collective modes -- highly entangled photon states that, despite their photonic nature, remain decoupled from matter through standard electromagnetic interactions. In a system comprising $M$ thermal field modes, we show that only a fraction $1/M$ of the total energy is accessible to matter, while the remaining $(M-1)/M$ is stored in dark states, rendering it undetectable by conventional electromagnetic means. We also demonstrate that intensity measurements, commonly used to estimate field energy, can be misleading due to collective effects that suppress or enhance light-matter coupling. To explore further this phenomenon, we analyze a cavity QED model enclosing a single dissipative atom and show that symmetry breaking in the atom-field interaction enables access to the hidden energy stored in dark modes. While inconclusive, these findings suggest that dark states of light may underlie certain unexplained energy phenomena, pointing to a possible microscopic mechanism based on the collective structure of thermal radiation.</description>

      <title>Correlated noise can be beneficial to quantum transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum systems are inherently susceptible to noise -- a notorious factor that induces decoherence and limits the performance of quantum applications. To mitigate its detrimental effects, various techniques have been developed, including cryogenic cooling, bath engineering, and quantum error correction. In this paper, we demonstrate that by exploiting noise correlations in coupled quantum systems, the overall impact of noise can be significantly suppressed. Specifically, for a microwave-optical quantum transducer based on piezo-optomechanics, correlations between the noise affecting the acoustic and electrical modes can lead to substantial noise reduction, thereby enhancing the performance of quantum transduction. This reduction is primarily governed by the phase of the piezo-mechanical coupling and is also influenced by system parameters such as the coupling ratio and mode cooperativities. Since these parameters simultaneously affect the signal transmissivity, they must be optimized to achieve an optimal performance in quantum transduction. Our work provides a systematic framework for this optimization, offering a guidance for practical designs.</description>

      <title>$k$-nonseparablity and $k$-partite entanglement criteria of multipartite quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipartite quantum entanglement, as a core quantum resource, is fundamental to the advancement of quantum science and technology. In multipartite quantum systems, there are two kinds of quantum entanglement: $k$-nonseparability and $k$-partite entanglement. In this paper, we propose sufficient criteria for detecting $k$-nonseparability and $k$-partite entanglement by using the generalized Wigner-Yanase skew information and mutually unbiased measurements. Examples are given to demonstrate the detection capability and advantages of these criteria. As an application, an example of recognizing the networks by detecting the depth of quantum networks is given.</description>

      <title>Quantum Opacity, Classical Clarity: A Hybrid Approach to Quantum Circuit Obfuscation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing leverages quantum mechanics to achieve computational advantages over classical hardware, but the use of third-party quantum compilers in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era introduces risks of intellectual property (IP) exposure. We address this by proposing a novel obfuscation technique that protects proprietary quantum circuits by inserting additional quantum gates prior to compilation. These gates corrupt the measurement outcomes, which are later corrected through a lightweight classical post-processing step based on the inserted gate structure. Unlike prior methods that rely on complex quantum reversals, barriers, or physical-to-virtual qubit mapping, our approach achieves obfuscation using compiler-agnostic classical correction. We evaluate the technique across five benchmark quantum algorithms -- Shor's, QAOA, Bernstein-Vazirani, Grover's, and HHL -- using IBM's Qiskit framework. The results demonstrate high Total Variation Distance (above 0.5) and consistently negative Degree of Functional Corruption (DFC), confirming both statistical and functional obfuscation. This shows that our method is a practical and effective solution for the security of quantum circuit designs in untrusted compilation flows.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretically secure quantum timestamping with one-time universal hashing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and tamper-resistant timestamps are essential for applications demanding verifiable chronological ordering, such as legal documentation and digital intellectual property protection. Classical timestamp protocols rely on computational assumptions for security, rendering them vulnerable to quantum attacks, which is a critical limitation given the rapid progress in quantum computing. To address this, we propose an information-theoretically secure quantum timestamping protocol based on one-time universal hashing with quantum keys. Our protocol simultaneously achieves information-theoretic security and high efficiency, enabling secure timestamping for arbitrarily long documents. Simulations demonstrate a generation rate exceeding 100 timestamps per second over intercity distances. In addition, our protocol only requires weak coherent states, making it practical for large-scale deployment. This work advances the field of quantum timestamping and contributes to the broader development of quantum cryptography and the future quantum internet.</description>

      <title>State-Based Quantum Simulation: Releasing the Powers of Quantum States and Copies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing employs controllable interactions to perform sequences of logical gates and entire algorithms on quantum registers. This paradigm has been widely explored, e.g., for simulating dynamics of manybody systems by decomposing their Hamiltonian evolution in a series of quantum gates. Here, we introduce a method for quantum simulation in which the Hamiltonian is decomposed in terms of states and the resulting evolution is realized by only controlled-swap gates and measurements applied on a set of auxiliary systems whose quantum states define the system dynamics. These auxiliary systems can be identically prepared in an arbitrary number of copies of known states at any intermediate time. This parametrization of the quantum simulation goes beyond traditional gate-based methods and permits simulation of, e.g., state-dependent (nonlinear) Hamiltonians and open quantum systems. We show how classical nonlinear and time-delayed ordinary differential equations can be simulated with the state-based method, and how a nonlinear variant of shortcut to adiabaticity permits adiabatic quantum computation, preparation of eigenstates, and solution of optimization tasks.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reservoir Computing for Realized Volatility Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum computing have demonstrated its potential to significantly enhance the analysis and forecasting of complex classical data. Among these, quantum reservoir computing has emerged as a particularly powerful approach, combining quantum computation with machine learning for modeling nonlinear temporal dependencies in high-dimensional time series. As with many data-driven disciplines, quantitative finance and econometrics can hugely benefit from emerging quantum technologies. In this work, we investigate the application of quantum reservoir computing for realized volatility forecasting. Our model employs a fully connected transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian as the reservoir with distinct input and memory qubits to capture temporal dependencies. The quantum reservoir computing approach is benchmarked against several econometric models and standard machine learning algorithms. The models are evaluated using multiple error metrics and the model confidence set procedures. To enhance interpretability and mitigate current quantum hardware limitations, we utilize wrapper-based forward selection for feature selection, identifying optimal subsets, and quantifying feature importance via Shapley values. Our results indicate that the proposed quantum reservoir approach consistently outperforms benchmark models across various metrics, highlighting its potential for financial forecasting despite existing quantum hardware constraints. This work serves as a proof-of-concept for the applicability of quantum computing in econometrics and financial analysis, paving the way for further research into quantum-enhanced predictive modeling as quantum hardware capabilities continue to advance.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating Coherent Quantum Routers for Bucket-Brigade Quantum Random Access Memory on a Superconducting Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum routers (QRouters) are essential components of bucket-brigade quantum random access memory (QRAM), enabling quantum applications such as Grover's search and quantum machine learning. Despite significant theoretical advances, achieving scalable and coherent QRouters experimentally remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate coherent quantum routers using a superconducting quantum processor, laying a practical foundation for scalable QRAM systems. The quantum router at the core of our implementation utilizes the transition composite gate (TCG) scheme, wherein auxiliary energy levels temporarily mediate conditional interactions, substantially reducing circuit depth compared to traditional gate decompositions. Moreover, by encoding routing addresses in the non-adjacent qutrit states $|0\rangle$ and $|2\rangle$, our design inherently enables eraser-detection capability, providing efficient post-selection to mitigate routing errors. Experimentally, we achieve individual QRouter fidelities up to 95.74%, and validate scalability through a two-layer quantum routing network achieving an average fidelity of 82.40%. Our results represent a significant advancement in quantum routing technology, providing enhanced fidelity, built-in error resilience, and practical scalability crucial for the development of future QRAM and large-scale quantum computing architectures.</description>

      <title>A heralded quantum amplifier of multi-photon states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale quantum networking systems will inevitably require methods to overcome photon loss. While the no-cloning theorem forbids perfect and deterministic amplification of unknown quantum states, probabilistic heralded amplification schemes offer a viable path forward. Yet, for over a decade, successful multi-photon state amplification has remained out of reach, despite the fundamental importance of such states in achieving quantum advantage in optical applications. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a high-fidelity and post-selection-free amplifier for multi-photon states. We achieve heralded amplification of states with up to two photons in a single optical mode, with over a hundredfold intensity gain, and verify the coherence-preserving operation of our scheme. Our approach is scalable to higher photon numbers and enables noiseless amplification of complex multi-photon quantum states, with applications in large-scale quantum communication systems, distributed quantum metrology, and information processing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Contextuality Requires Counterfactual Gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum contextuality, where measurement outcomes depend on the measurement context, implies a failure of classical realism in quantum systems. As recently shown, the transition between measurement contexts can be mapped onto the path that a quantum particle takes through an interferometer. Here, we investigate the relation between contextuality and the counterfactual gain observed in the output ports of such an interferometer when one of the paths is blocked. It is shown that experimental evidence of contextuality can only be obtained when counterfactual gain is observed for a specific combination of blocked path and output port. Using a silicon photonic integrated circuit, we experimentally observe the counterfactual gain for a selection of input states and evaluate the associated evidence for contextuality. The results confirm that contextuality can only be observed in the presence of counterfactual gain.</description>

      <title>Disentangling signalling and causal influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The causal effects activated by a quantum interaction are studied, modelling the last one as a bipartite unitary channel. The two parties, say Alice and Bob, can use the channel to exchange messages -- i.e. to signal. On the other hand, the most general form of causal influence includes also the possibility for Alice, via a local operation on her system, to modify Bob's correlations and viceversa. The presence or absence of these two effects are equivalent, but when they both occur, they can differ in their magnitude.
  We study the properties of two functions that quantify the amount of signalling and causal influence conveyed by an arbitrary unitary channel. The functions are proved to be continuous and monotonically increasing with respect to the tensor product of channels. Monotonicity is instead disproved in the case of sequential composition.
  Signalling and causal influence are analytically computed for the quantum SWAP and CNOT gates, in the single use scenario, in the $n$-parallel uses scenario, and in the asymptotic regime. A finite gap is found between signalling and causal influence for the quantum CNOT, thus proving the existence of extra causal effects that cannot be explained in terms of communication only. However, the gap disappears in the asymptotic limit of an infinite number of parallel uses, leaving room for asymptotic equivalence between signalling and causal influence.</description>

Abstract: Fluctuation-induced forces, primarily represented by quantum and critical Casimir effects, play a pivotal role at the nanoscale. This review explores the theoretical and experimental landscapes of these forces, offering a comprehensive analysis of their similarities and distinctions. We emphasize the effects of material properties, geometry, and temperature in shaping these forces and their roles in various nanoscale systems, both colloidal and solid-state. We devote special attention to the Casimir torque, the influence of magnetism on the Casimir force, and the use of Casimir effects for the generation of optical resonators. Through this comparative study, we elucidate the underlying physics of these phenomena, fostering insights that advance applications in nanomechanics, optomechanics, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we map NISQ-friendly implementations of the non-interacting QCA to a circuit Quantum Electrodynamics (cQED) hardware. We perform both noiseless and noisy simulations of the QCA one particle sector, namely the Quantum Walk, on N-cycles and NxN torus graphs. Moreover, in such a framework we also investigate the searching problem. The noiseless simulations are conducted with the Qiskit Aer simulator, while the noisy simulations with C12 Quantum Electronics in-house noisy emulator, Callisto. We benchmark the performance of our implementations by analyzing the simulations via relevant metrics and quantities such as the state count distributions, the Hellinger Fidelity, the l1 distance, the hitting time, and success probability. Our results demonstrate that the QCA framework, in combination with cQED processors, holds promise as an effective platform for early NISQ implementations of Quantum Walk and Quantum Walk Search algorithms.</description>

      <title>Versatile Quantum-Safe Hybrid Key Exchange and Its Application to MACsec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in quantum computing pose a significant threat to most of the cryptography currently deployed. Fortunately, cryptographic building blocks to mitigate the threat are already available; mostly based on post-quantum and quantum cryptography, but also on symmetric cryptography techniques. Notably, quantum-safe building blocks must be deployed as soon as possible due to the ``harvest-now decrypt-later'' attack scenario, which is already challenging our sensitive and encrypted data today.
  Following an agile defense-in-depth approach, Hybrid Authenticated Key Exchange (HAKE) protocols have recently been gaining significant attention. Such protocols modularly combine conventional, post-quantum, and quantum cryptography to achieve confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity guarantees for network channels. Unfortunately, only a few protocols have yet been proposed (mainly Muckle and Muckle+) with different flexibility guarantees.
  Looking at available standards in the network domain (especially at the Media Access Control Security (MACsec) standard), we believe that HAKE protocols could already bring strong security benefits to MACsec today. MACsec is a standard designed to secure communication at the data link layer in Ethernet networks by providing security for all traffic between adjacent entities. In addition, MACsec establishes secure channels within a Local Area Network (LAN), ensuring that data remain protected from eavesdropping, tampering, and unauthorized access, while operating transparently to higher layer protocols. Currently, MACsec does not offer enough protection in the event of cryptographically relevant quantum computers.
  In this work, we tackle the challenge and propose a new versatile HAKE protocol, dubbed VMuckle, which is sufficiently flexible for the use in MACsec to provide LAN participants with hybrid key material ensuring secure communication.</description>

      <title>QSVM-QNN: Quantum Support Vector Machine Based Quantum Neural Network Learning Algorithm for Brain-Computer Interfacing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A brain-computer interface (BCI) system enables direct communication between the brain and external devices, offering significant potential for assistive technologies and advanced human-computer interaction. Despite progress, BCI systems face persistent challenges, including signal variability, classification inefficiency, and difficulty adapting to individual users in real time. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid quantum learning model, termed QSVM-QNN, which integrates a Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) with a Quantum Neural Network (QNN), to improve classification accuracy and robustness in EEG-based BCI tasks. Unlike existing models, QSVM-QNN combines the decision boundary capabilities of QSVM with the expressive learning power of QNN, leading to superior generalization performance. The proposed model is evaluated on two benchmark EEG datasets, achieving high accuracies of 0.990 and 0.950, outperforming both classical and standalone quantum models. To demonstrate real-world viability, we further validated the robustness of QNN, QSVM, and QSVM-QNN against six realistic quantum noise models, including bit flip and phase damping. These experiments reveal that QSVM-QNN maintains stable performance under noisy conditions, establishing its applicability for deployment in practical, noisy quantum environments. Beyond BCI, the proposed hybrid quantum architecture is generalizable to other biomedical and time-series classification tasks, offering a scalable and noise-resilient solution for next-generation neurotechnological systems.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is based on the laws of quantum mechanics to enable provably secure communication. Despite its theoretical security promise, practical QKD systems are vulnerable to serious attacks, including side-channel attacks and detector loopholes, and assumes a trusted device characterization. Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution (DIQKD) overcomes these limitations by relying solely on observed nonlocal correlations, certified through Bell inequality violations, thereby removing assumptions about the internal workings of the measurement devices.
  In this paper, we first review the foundational principles underlying DIQKD, including Bell tests and security definitions. We then examine a range of protocol designs, including CHSH-based schemes, and non-local game frameworks, alongside with their security proofs. We also assess recent experimental implementations and discuss source architectures, detection technologies, and finite-key analyses. Finally, we identify current open problems, such as noise tolerance, generation rates, and integration with quantum networks, and outline promising directions for future research to realize robust, high-performance DIQKD.</description>

      <title>Rubidium-Doped KTiOPO$_4$ Waveguides as a Dual-Type Photon Pair Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dual generation of type-0 and type-II spontaneous parametric down conversions (SPDCs) within a single periodically poled rubidium-doped KTiOPO$_4$ (PPRKTP) waveguide. By coupling a 45 degree linearly polarized pump laser into the waveguide, both SPDC processes are concurrently excited: the type-0 SPDC process is facilitated via third-order quasi-phase matching (QPM) utilizing the nonlinear coefficient $d_{33}$ , while the type-II SPDC process employs first-order QPM with the nonlinear coefficient $d_{24}$. This dual-SPDC scheme holds potential for applications in quantum communication protocols targeting the telecommunication wavelength.</description>

      <title>An engineering guide to superconducting quantum circuit shielding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this review, we provide a practical guide on protection of superconducting quantum circuits from broadband electromagnetic and infrared-radiation noise by using cryogenic shielding and filtering of microwave lines. Recently, superconducting multi-qubit processors demonstrated quantum supremacy and quantum error correction below the surface code threshold. However, the decoherence-induced loss of quantum information still remains a challenge for more than 100 qubit quantum computing. Here, we review the key aspects of superconducting quantum circuits protection from stray electromagnetic fields and infrared radiation, namely, multilayer shielding design, materials, filtering of the fridge lines and attenuation, cryogenic setup configurations, and methods for shielding efficiency evaluation developed over the last 10 years. In summary, we make recommendations for creation of an efficient and compact shielding system as well as microwave filtering for a large-scale superconducting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Waveguides in a quantum perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid state quantum devices, operated at dilution cryostat temperatures, are relying on microwave signals to both drive and read-out their quantum states. These signals are transmitted into the cryogenic environment, out of it towards detection devices, or even between quantum systems by well-designed waveguides, almost lossless when made of superconducting materials. Here we report on the quantum theory that describes the simplest Cartesian-type geometries: parallel plates, and rectangular tubes. The aim of the article is twofold: first on a technical and pragmatic level, we provide a full and compact quantum description of the different traveling wave families supported by these guides. Second, on an ontological level, we interpret the results and discuss the nature of the light fields corresponding to each mode family. The concept of potential difference is extended from transverse electric-magnetic (TEM) waves to all configurations, by means of a specific gauge fixing. The generalized flux $\phi$ introduced in the context of quantum electronics becomes here essential: it is the scalar field, conjugate of a charge $Q$, that confines light within the electrodes, let them be real or virtual. The gap in the dispersion relations of non-TEM waves turns out to be linked either to a potential energy necessary for the photon confinement, or to a kinetic energy arising from a photon mass. We finally compute the field zero-point fluctuations in every configuration. The theory is predictive: the lowest transverse magnetic (TM) modes should have smaller quantum noise than the higher ones, which at large wavevectors recover a conventional value similar to TEM and transverse electric (TE) ones. Such low-noise modes might be particularly useful for the routing of quantum information.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking data encoding methods in Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data encoding plays a fundamental and distinctive role in Quantum Machine Learning (QML). While classical approaches process data directly as vectors, QML may require transforming classical data into quantum states through encoding circuits, known as quantum feature maps or quantum embeddings. This step leverages the inherently high-dimensional and non-linear nature of Hilbert space, enabling more efficient data separation in complex feature spaces that may be inaccessible to classical methods. This encoding part significantly affects the performance of the QML model, so it is important to choose the right encoding method for the dataset to be encoded. However, this choice is generally arbitrary, since there is no "universal" rule for knowing which encoding to choose based on a specific set of data. There are currently a variety of encoding methods using different quantum logic gates. We studied the most commonly used types of encoding methods and benchmarked them using different datasets.</description>

      <title>Lifting a CSS code via its handlebody realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a topological approach to lifting a quantum CSS code. In previous work, we proposed lifting a CSS code by constructing covering spaces over its 2D simplicial complex representation, known as the Tanner cone-complex. This idea was inspired by the work of Freedman and Hastings, which associates CSS codes with handlebodies. In this paper, we show how the handlebody realization of a code can also be used to perform code lifting, and we provide a more detailed discussion of why this is essentially equivalent to the Tanner cone-complex approach. As an application, we classify lifts of hypergraph-product codes via their handlebody realization.</description>

      <title>Approximate Wigner Approach to Coulomb Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electric interaction between two nearby evolving electrons triggers the correlation between their waves and governs the operation of logical devices called Coulomb entanglers. Of technological interest in the presence of magnetic fields are multi-spatial evolution scenarios beyond pure state descriptions. The two-electron density matrix becomes eight-dimensional even for two-dimensional spatial cases and is thus computationally prohibitive. In this work, we present two new approximations of the two-electron Wigner equation that aim at computational feasibility: a BBGKY approach for reducing the number of variables and a field approximation of the Coulomb-Wigner operator. They exhibit different conceptual aspects that illustrate alternative viewpoints to entanglement: Only the evolution provided by the latter model satisfies the orthodox definition of entanglement. Our analysis, based on the Fredholm integral representation of the models, allows us to develop an intuitive picture and physical insight into the process.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian-Driven Architectures for Non-Markovian Quantum Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Hamiltonian-level framework for non-Markovian quantum reservoir computing directly tailored for analog hardware implementations. By dividing the reservoir into a system block and an environment block and evolving their joint state under a unified Hamiltonian, our architecture naturally embeds memory backflow by harnessing entanglement-induced information backflow with tunable coupling strengths. Numerical benchmarks on short-term memory tasks demonstrate that operating in non-Markovian regimes yields significantly slower memory decay compared to the Markovian limit. Further analyzing the echo-state property (ESP), showing that the non-Markovian quantum reservoir evolves from two different initial states, they do not converge to the same trajectory even after a long time, strongly suggesting that the ESP is effectively violated. Our work provides the first demonstration in quantum reservoir computing that strong non-Markovianity can fundamentally violate the ESP, such that conventional linear-regression readouts fail to deliver stable training and inference. Finally, we experimentally showed that, with an appropriate time-evolution step size, the non-Markovian reservoir exhibits superior performance on higher-order nonlinear autoregressive moving-average(NARMA) tasks.</description>

      <title>MicroCrypt Assumptions with Quantum Input Sampling and Pseudodeterminism: Constructions and Separations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate two natural relaxations of quantum cryptographic primitives. The first involves quantum input sampling, where inputs are generated by a quantum algorithm rather than sampled uniformly at random. Applying this to pseudorandom generators ($\textsf{PRG}$s) and pseudorandom states ($\textsf{PRS}$s), leads to the notions denoted as $\textsf{PRG}^{qs}$ and $\textsf{PRS}^{qs}$, respectively. The second relaxation, $\bot$-pseudodeterminism, relaxes the determinism requirement by allowing the output to be a special symbol $\bot$ on an inverse-polynomial fraction of inputs.
  We demonstrate an equivalence between bounded-query logarithmic-size $\textsf{PRS}^{qs}$, logarithmic-size $\textsf{PRS}^{qs}$, and $\textsf{PRG}^{qs}$. Moreover, we establish that $\textsf{PRG}^{qs}$ can be constructed from $\bot$-$\textsf{PRG}$s, which in turn were built from logarithmic-size $\textsf{PRS}$. Interestingly, these relations remain unknown in the uniform key setting.
  To further justify these relaxed models, we present black-box separations. Our results suggest that $\bot$-pseudodeterministic primitives may be weaker than their deterministic counterparts, and that primitives based on quantum input sampling may be inherently weaker than those using uniform sampling.
  Together, these results provide numerous new insights into the structure and hierarchy of primitives within MicroCrypt.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a general protocol for distributed quantum computing that accommodates arbitrary unknown subroutines. It can be applied to scale up quantum computing through multi-chip interconnection, as well as to tasks such as estimating unknown parameters or processes for circuit depth reduction and constructing secure quantum cryptographic protocols. Our protocol builds upon a few techniques we develop, such as the oblivious quantum teleportation and control, which can circumvent quantum no-go theorems on the manipulation of unknown objects. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this protocol can be physically implemented using currently available quantum computing platforms. These results suggest that our framework could provide a foundation for developing more advanced quantum algorithms and protocols in the future.</description>

Abstract: We prove formulas for the multi-instanton corrections to the overlap and energies of a 1D same-level asymmetric double well using the Euclidean path integral. The asymmetry primarily means that the potential at neighboring wells can have different Hessians/curvatures, which modify Coleman's original formulas. Examples of symmetric double and triple wells are worked out.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum multiparameter estimation promises to extend quantum advantage to the simultaneous high-precision measurements of multiple physical quantities. However, realizing this capability in practical quantum sensors under realistic conditions remains challenging due to intrinsic system imperfections. Here, we experimentally demonstrate multiparameter estimation using a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, a widely adopted solid-state quantum sensor. Leveraging electronic-nuclear spin entanglement and optimized Bell state measurement at room temperature, we simultaneously estimate the amplitude, detuning, and phase of a microwave drive from a single measurement sequence. Despite practical constraints, our results achieve linear sensitivity scaling for all parameters with respect to interrogation time. This work bridges the gap between foundational quantum estimation theory and real-world quantum sensing, opening pathways toward enhanced multiparameter quantum sensors suitable for diverse scientific and technological applications.</description>

      <title>Assessing Projected Quantum Kernels for the Classification of IoT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of quantum computing for machine learning is among the most exciting applications of quantum technologies. Researchers are developing quantum models inspired by classical ones to find some possible quantum advantages over classical approaches. A major challenge in the development and testing of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) algorithms is the lack of datasets specifically designed for quantum algorithms. Existing datasets, often borrowed from classical machine learning, need modifications to be compatible with current noisy quantum hardware. In this work, we utilize a dataset generated by Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices in a format directly compatible with the proposed quantum algorithms, eliminating the need for feature reduction. Among quantum-inspired machine learning algorithms, the Projected Quantum Kernel (PQK) stands out for its elegant solution of projecting the data encoded in the Hilbert space into a classical space. We detail how a PQK approach can be employed to construct a prediction model on IoT data. We compare PQK with common Quantum Kernel methods and their classical counterparts, while also investigating the impact of various feature maps in encoding classical IoT data into quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mpemba effects occur after a sudden quench of control parameters if for ''far'' (or ''hot'') initial states with respect to a final target state, the relaxation time toward the target state is shorter than for ''close'' (or ''cold'') initial states. Following a strategy of fishermen in Pontus described by Aristotle, we introduce the Pontus-Mpemba effect as a two-step protocol which includes the time needed for preparing the system in the ''far'' initial state. For Markovian (classical or quantum) systems coupled to multiple reservoirs, all possible Pontus-Mpemba effects fall into three classes. The theory is applied to open two-state systems where all three classes can be realized.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Tree-Type Photonic Cluster State Generation with Recurrent Quantum Photonic Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large, multi-dimensional clusters of entangled photons are among the most powerful resources for emerging quantum technologies, as they are predicted to enable global quantum networks or universal quantum computation. Here, we propose an entirely new architecture and protocol for their generation based on recurrent quantum photonic neural networks (QPNNs) and focusing on tree-type cluster states. Unlike other approaches, QPNN-based generators are not limited by the the coherence of quantum emitters or by probabilistic multi-photon operations, enabling arbitrary scaling only limited by loss (which, unavoidably, also affects all other methods). We show that a single QPNN can learn to perform all of the many different operations needed to create a cluster state, from photon routing to entanglement generation, all with near-perfect fidelity and at loss-limited rates, even when it is created from imperfect photonic components. Although these losses ultimately place a limit on the size of the cluster states, we show that state-of-the-art photonics should already allow for clusters of 60 photons, which can grow into the 100s with modest improvements to losses. Finally, we present an analysis of a one-way quantum repeater based on these states, determining the requisite platform quality for a global quantum network and highlighting the potential of the QPNN to play a vital role in high-impact quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>A quantum unstructured search algorithm for discrete optimisation: the use case of portfolio optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum unstructured search algorithm to find the extrema or roots of discrete functions, $f(\mathbf{x})$, such as the objective functions in combinatorial and other discrete optimisation problems. The first step of the Quantum Search for Extrema and Roots Algorithm (QSERA) is to translate conditions of the form $f(\mathbf{x}_*) \simeq f_*$, where $f_*$ is the extremum or zero, to an unstructured search problem for $\mathbf{x}_*$. This is achieved by mapping $f(\mathbf{x})$ to a function $u(z)$ to create a quantum oracle, such that $u(z_*) = 1$ and $u(z \neq z_*) = 0$. The next step is to employ Grover's algorithm to find $z_*$, which offers a quadratic speed-up over classical algorithms. The number of operations needed to map $f(\mathbf{x})$ to $u(z)$ determines the accuracy of the result and the circuit depth. We describe the implementation of QSERA by assembling a quantum circuit for portfolio optimisation, which can be formulated as a combinatorial problem. QSERA can handle objective functions with higher order terms than the commonly-used Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO) framework. Moreover, while QSERA requires some a priori knowledge of the extrema of $f(\mathbf{x})$, it can still find approximate solutions even if the conditions are not exactly satisfied.</description>

      <title>Quantum Optimization via Gradient-Based Hamiltonian Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With rapid advancements in machine learning, first-order algorithms have emerged as the backbone of modern optimization techniques, owing to their computational efficiency and low memory requirements. Recently, the connection between accelerated gradient methods and damped heavy-ball motion, particularly within the framework of Hamiltonian dynamics, has inspired the development of innovative quantum algorithms for continuous optimization. One such algorithm, Quantum Hamiltonian Descent (QHD), leverages quantum tunneling to escape saddle points and local minima, facilitating the discovery of global solutions in complex optimization landscapes. However, QHD faces several challenges, including slower convergence rates compared to classical gradient methods and limited robustness in highly non-convex problems due to the non-local nature of quantum states. Furthermore, the original QHD formulation primarily relies on function value information, which limits its effectiveness. Inspired by insights from high-resolution differential equations that have elucidated the acceleration mechanisms in classical methods, we propose an enhancement to QHD by incorporating gradient information, leading to what we call gradient-based QHD. Gradient-based QHD achieves faster convergence and significantly increases the likelihood of identifying global solutions. Numerical simulations on challenging problem instances demonstrate that gradient-based QHD outperforms existing quantum and classical methods by at least an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Melting of a Bosonic Mott Insulator in Kagome Optical Lattices with Sign-Inverted Hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (dTWA), we investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of ultracold bosons confined in optical kagome lattices, focusing on both unfrustrated positive and frustrated negative hopping regimes. We consider a protocol in which the system is initialized in a Mott insulating state at unit filling, and the hopping amplitude is gradually increased from zero. For positive hopping, the melting of the Mott insulator is accompanied by the emergence of a sharp peak in the momentum distribution at the $\Gamma$ point of the lowest band, signaling the onset of superfluidity. In contrast, for negative hopping, the Mott insulator melts into a highly nontrivial state without long-range phase coherence, characterized instead by a broad momentum distribution within the flat band, consistent with recent experimental observations. These results demonstrate the applicability of dTWA to highly frustrated quantum systems and offer a new route for numerically exploring the dynamics of frustrated quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>Unified Structural Embedding of Orbifold Sigma Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a unified structural embedding framework for orbifold sigma models that systematically incorporates twisted sectors, singularities, and smooth regions into a single algebraic object. Traditional approaches to orbifold theories often treat sectors separately, requiring ad hoc regularizations near singularities and failing to capture inter-sector interactions under renormalization group flow. The framework presented herein resolves these limitations through the construction of a unified orbifold algebra $\mathcal{A}(X/G)$ that decomposes canonically into idempotent-projected components corresponding to conjugacy classes of the finite group $G$ acting on the target space $X$. A generalized Laplacian operator is defined on this algebra, enabling the construction of a one-parameter family of renormalization group compatible endomorphisms that preserve the sector structure while implementing scale transformations. The formalism is shown to recover conventional sigma model results in the smooth limit where $G$ approaches the trivial group, with the internal renormalization group derivation reducing to the standard one-loop beta function proportional to the Ricci tensor. Several examples demonstrate the framework's utility, including explicit calculations for the $\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold that exhibit the decomposition into untwisted and twisted field contributions. This approach provides a mathematically rigorous foundation for quantum field theories on singular spaces while maintaining compatibility with established results for smooth manifolds.</description>

      <title>String-Membrane-Nets from Higher-Form Gauging: An Alternate Route to $p$-String Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new perspective on the $p$-string condensation procedure for constructing 3+1D fracton phases by implementing this process via the gauging of higher-form symmetries. Specifically, we show that gauging a 1-form symmetry in 3+1D that is generated by Abelian anyons in isotropic stacks of 2+1D topological orders naturally results in a 3+1D $p$-string condensed phase, providing a controlled non-perturbative construction that realizes fracton orders. This approach clarifies the symmetry principles underlying $p$-string condensation and generalizes the familiar connection between anyon condensation and one-form gauging in two spatial dimensions. We demonstrate this correspondence explicitly in both field theories and lattice models: in field theory, we derive the foliated field theory description of the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ X-Cube model by gauging a higher-form symmetry in stacks of 2+1D $\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theories; on the lattice, we show how gauging a diagonal 1-form symmetry in isotropic stacks of $G$-graded string-net models leads to string-membrane-nets hosting restricted mobility excitations. This perspective naturally generalizes to spatial dimensions $d \geq 2$ and provides a step towards building an algebraic theory of $p$-string condensation.</description>

      <title>Classical Criticality via Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum annealing provides a powerful platform for simulating magnetic materials and realizing statistical physics models, presenting a compelling alternative to classical Monte Carlo methods. We demonstrate that quantum annealers can accurately reproduce phase diagrams and simulate critical phenomena without suffering from the critical slowing down that often affects classical algorithms. To illustrate this, we study the piled-up dominoes model, which interpolates between the ferromagnetic 2D Ising model and Villain's fully frustrated ``odd model''. We map out its phase diagram and for the first time, employ finite-size scaling and Binder cumulants on a quantum annealer to study critical exponents for thermal phase transitions. Our method achieves systematic temperature control by tuning the energy scale of the Hamiltonian, eliminating the need to adjust the physical temperature of the quantum hardware. This work demonstrates how, through fine-tuning and calibration, a quantum annealer can be employed to apply sophisticated finite-size scaling techniques from statistical mechanics. Our results establish quantum annealers as robust statistical physics simulators, offering a novel pathway for studying phase transitions and critical behavior.</description>

      <title>Substrate Effect on Electronic Band Structure and Topological Property in Monolayer V2O3 Magnetic Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monolayer V2O3, a two-dimensional magnetic topological insulator with intrinsic ferromagnetic order and a nontrivial band gap, offers a promising platform for realizing quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. Using first-principles density functional theory calculations, we systematically investigate the impact of substrate selection on its electronic and topological properties. By modeling heterostructures with van der Waals (vdW) substrates, we demonstrate that non-magnetic substrates such as h-BN preserve the QAH phase with a Chern number C = 1, maintaining gapless chiral edge states. In contrast, ferromagnetic substrates induce extra electrons, destroying the topological order by shifting the Fermi level. These findings establish substrate engineering as a pivotal strategy for experimental realization of dissipationless edge transport in V2O3-based vdW heterostructures, advancing their potential applications as low-power topological electronics.</description>

      <title>Rethink the Role of Deep Learning towards Large-scale Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the ground state properties of quantum systems is fundamental to capturing their behavior but computationally challenging. Recent advances in AI have introduced novel approaches, with diverse machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models proposed for this purpose. However, the necessity and specific role of DL models in these tasks remain unclear, as prior studies often employ varied or impractical quantum resources to construct datasets, resulting in unfair comparisons. To address this, we systematically benchmark DL models against traditional ML approaches across three families of Hamiltonian, scaling up to 127 qubits in three crucial ground-state learning tasks while enforcing equivalent quantum resource usage. Our results reveal that ML models often achieve performance comparable to or even exceeding that of DL approaches across all tasks. Furthermore, a randomization test demonstrates that measurement input features have minimal impact on DL models' prediction performance. These findings challenge the necessity of current DL models in many quantum system learning scenarios and provide valuable insights into their effective utilization.</description>

      <title>Casimir effect for scalar field rotating on a disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the vacuum energy of a scalar field rotating with angular velocity $\Omega$ on a disk of radius $R$ and with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The rotation is introduced by a metric obtained by a Galilean transformation from a rest frame. The constraint $\Omega R&lt;c$ must be obeyed to maintain causality. To compute the vacuum energy, we use an imaginary frequency representation and the well-known uniform asymptotic expansion of the Bessel function. We use the zeta-functional regularization and separate the divergent contributions, which we discuss in terms of the heat kernel coefficients. The divergences are found to be independent of rotation. The renormalized finite part of the vacuum energy is negative and becomes more negative for larger rotation frequencies.</description>

      <title>Carrier-envelope phase effects in one- and two-photon directional photoionization of non-isotropic atomic states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of two-color ($\omega$ and $2\omega$) co- and counter-rotating ultrashort attosecond laser pulses on non-isotropic atomic targets through the one- and two-photon interference pattern of the photoelectron spectrum. Specifically, we take the ground state of atomic carbon, i. e., $(1s^22s^22p^2,{}^3\text{P}^\text{e})$ as a prototype. We observe and quantify the strong dependency on the relative carrier-envelope phase (CEP) of the two-color pulses and on the spatial orientation of the electronic target states. Notably, we observe that the photoelectron momentum distributions (PMDs) vary as a function of the CEP due to the interfering two-color one- and two-photon ionization paths. Besides, the PMD region corresponding to one-photon photoionization remains unaffected, with varying CEP, depending only on the ellipticity of the pulse, the central photon frequency and the magnetic quantum number of the initial state. Therefore, comparing the one-photon ionization electron ejection direction following absorption of a single ($2\omega$) photon with that of the two-photon ionization channel following absorption of two photon each with energy $\omega$ we may extrapolate information on the CEP difference between the two pulses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spin relaxation in a single-electron bilayer graphene quantum dot due to the spin-orbit coupling. The spin relaxation is assisted by the emission of acoustic phonons via the bond-length change and deformation potential mechanisms and $1/f$ charge noise. In the perpendicular magnetic-field dependence of the spin relaxation rate $T_1^{-1}$, we predict a monotonic increase of $T_1^{-1}$ at higher fields where the electron-phonon coupling via the deformation potential plays a dominant role in spin relaxation. We show a less pronounced dip in $T_1^{-1}$ at lower magnetic fields due to the competition between the electron-phonon coupling due to bond-length change and $1/f$ charge noise. Finally, detailed comparisons of the magnetic-field dependence of the spin relaxation with the existing experiments by Banszerus et al. [Nat. Commun. 13, 3637 (2022)] and G\"achter et al. [PRX Quantum 3, 020343 (2022)] are reported.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose quantum simulation experiments of the Kondo impurity problem using cold alkaline-earth(-like) atoms (AEAs) in a combination of optical lattice and optical tweezer potentials. Within an ab initio model for atomic interactions in the optical potentials, we analyze hallmark signatures of the Kondo effect in a variety of observables accessible in cold-atom quantum simulators. We identify additional terms not part of the textbook Kondo problem, mostly ignored in previous works and giving rise to a direct competition between spin and charge correlations--strongly suppressing Kondo physics. Crucially, we show that the Kondo effect can be restored by locally adjusting the chemical potential on the impurity site. We identify realistic parameter regimes and preparation protocols suited to current experiments with AEA arrays. Our work paves the way for novel quantum simulations of the Kondo problem and offers new insights into Kondo physics in unconventional regimes.</description>

Abstract: We present a theory describing parametric amplification in a Josephson junction embedded transmission line. We will focus on the process of four-wave mixing under the assumption of an undepleted pump. However, the approach taken is quite general, such that a different parametric process or the process under different assumptions is easily derived. First the classical theory of the coupled-mode equations as presented by O'Brien et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. $\mathbf{113}:157001$] is shortly reviewed. Then a derivation of the full quantum theory is given using mesoscopic quantisation techniques in terms of discrete mode operators. This results in a Hamiltonian that describes the process of parametric amplification. We show that the coupled-mode equations can be derived from this Hamiltonian in the classical limit and elaborate on the validity of the theory.</description>

Abstract: The transfer and storage of quantum information in a hybrid quantum system, consisting of an ensemble of atoms or spins interacting with a cavity, is adversely affected by the inhomogeneity of the spins, which negates the coherent exchange of excitations between the physical components. Using a full quantum treatment based on variational renormalization group, we show how quantum information encoded in the states of a parametrically driven hybrid system is strongly protected against any decoherence that may arise due to the inhomogeneity in the spin-ensemble.</description>

Abstract: A modified form of quantum mechanics which includes a new mechanism for wavefunction collapse is proposed. The collapse provides a solution to the quantum measurement problem. This modified quantum mechanics is shown to arise naturally from a fully discrete physics, where all physical quantities are discrete rather than continuous. We compare the theory to the spontaneous collapse theories of Ghirardi, Rimini, Weber and Pearle, and argue that the new theory lends itself well to a realist interpretation of the wavefunction.</description>

      <title>Extracting topological orders of generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11170v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for extracting topological data from translation invariant generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two-dimensional systems, focusing on the analysis of anyon excitations and string operators. The algorithm applies to $\mathbb{Z}_d$ qudits, including instances where $d$ is a nonprime number. This capability allows the identification of topological orders that differ from the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ toric codes. It extends our understanding beyond the established theorem that Pauli stabilizer codes for $\mathbb{Z}_p$ qudits (with $p$ being a prime) are equivalent to finite copies of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ toric codes and trivial stabilizers. The algorithm is designed to determine all anyons and their string operators, enabling the computation of their fusion rules, topological spins, and braiding statistics. The method converts the identification of topological orders into computational tasks, including Gaussian elimination, the Hermite normal form, and the Smith normal form of truncated Laurent polynomials. Furthermore, the algorithm provides a systematic approach for studying quantum error-correcting codes. We apply it to various codes, such as self-dual CSS quantum codes modified from the 2d honeycomb color code and non-CSS quantum codes that contain the double semion topological order or the six-semion topological order.</description>

      <title>Transfer learning of optimal QAOA parameters in combinatorial optimization</title>

Abstract: Solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) is a promising application of quantum computation, with the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) being one of the most studied quantum algorithms for solving them. However, multiple factors make the parameter search of the QAOA a hard optimization problem. In this work, we study transfer learning (TL), a methodology to reuse pre-trained QAOA parameters of one problem instance into different COP instances. This methodology can be used to alleviate the necessity of classical optimization to find good parameters for individual problems. To this end, we select small cases of the traveling salesman problem (TSP), the bin packing problem (BPP), the knapsack problem (KP), the weighted maximum cut (MaxCut) problem, the maximal independent set (MIS) problem, and portfolio optimization (PO), and find optimal $\beta$ and $\gamma$ parameters for p layers. We compare how well the parameters found for one problem adapt to the others. Among the different problems, BPP is the one that produces the best transferable parameters, maintaining the probability of finding the optimal solution above a quadratic speedup over random guessing for problem sizes up to 42 qubits and p = 10 layers. Using the BPP parameters, we perform experiments on IonQ Harmony and Aria, Rigetti Aspen-M-3, and IBM Brisbane of MIS instances for up to 18 qubits. The results indicate that IonQ Aria yields the best overlap with the ideal probability distribution. Additionally, we show that cross-platform TL is possible using the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer with the parameters found for BPP. We show an improvement in performance compared to the default protocols for MIS with up to 170 qubits. Our results suggest that there are QAOA parameters that generalize well for different COPs and annealing protocols.</description>

      <title>Complexity of graph-state preparation by Clifford circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the complexity of graph-state preparation. We consider general quantum algorithms consisting of Clifford operations acting on at most two qubits for graph-state preparations. We define the CZ-complexity of a graph state $|G\rangle$ as the minimum number of two-qubit Clifford operations (excluding single-qubit Clifford operations) for generating $|G\rangle$ from a trivial state $|0\rangle^{\otimes n}$. We first prove that a graph state $|G\rangle$ is generated by at most $t$ two-qubit Clifford operations if and only if $|G\rangle$ is generated by at most $t$ controlled-Z (CZ) operations. We next prove that a graph state $|G\rangle$ is generated from another graph state $|H\rangle$ by $t$ CZ operations if and only if the graph $G$ is generated from $H$ by some combinatorial graph transformation with cost $t$. As the main results, we show a connection between the CZ-complexity of graph state $|G\rangle$ and the rank-width of the graph $G$. Indeed, we prove that for any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and rank-width $r$,
  1. The CZ-complexity of $|G\rangle$ is $O(rn)$.
  2. If $G$ is connected, the CZ-complexity of $|G\rangle$ is at least $n + r - 2$.
  We also demonstrate the existence of graph states whose CZ-complexities are close to the upper and lower bounds. Finally, we present quantum algorithms for preparing graph states for three specific graph classes related to intervals: interval graphs, interval containment graphs, and circle graphs. We prove that the CZ-complexity is $O(n)$ for interval graphs, and $O(n\log n)$ for both interval containment graphs and circle graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16503v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The behavior of quantum states at exceptional points and at critical points associated with quantum phase transitions is intriguing yet puzzling. In this study, we present an alternative method for obtaining the Berry potentials using the evolution generator along the parameter induced dimension and demonstrate that they are singular at these critical points. Although these singularities may appear to indicate a breakdown in quantum state evolution, we show that the information carried by quantum states evolving across these critical points is not destroyed. Specifically, when the evolution generator of the full Hilbert space bundle is taken into account, the quantum states remain insensitive to the critical points. In physical terms, it's similar to the classical image of an object smoothly passing through a black hole's event horizon. Further similarities between exceptional points and quantum phase transitions are explored in this work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using the Krylov subspace technique to generate the spin coherent states in kicked top model, a prototype model for studying quantum chaos, the accessible system size for studying the Husimi functions of eigenstates can be much larger than that reported in the literature and our previous study Phys. Rev. E 108, 054217 (2023) [arXiv:2308.04824]. In the fully chaotic kicked top, we find that the mean Wehrl entropy localization measure approaches the prediction given by the Circular Unitary Ensemble. In the mixed-type case, we identify mixed eigenstates by the overlap of the Husimi function with regular and chaotic regions in classical compact phase space. Numerically, we show that the fraction of mixed eigenstates scales as $j^{-\zeta}$, a power-law decay as the system size $j$ increases, across nearly two orders of magnitude. This provides supporting evidence for the principle of uniform semiclassical condensation of Husimi functions and the Berry-Robnik picture in the semiclassical limit.</description>

      <title>Second Law of Entanglement Manipulation with Entanglement Battery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central question since the beginning of quantum information science is how two distant parties can convert one entangled state into another. It has been conjectured that such conversions could be executed reversibly in an asymptotic regime, mirroring the reversible nature of Carnot cycles in classical thermodynamics. While a conclusive proof of this conjecture has been missing so far, earlier studies have excluded reversible entanglement manipulation in various settings. In this work, we show that arbitrary mixed state entanglement transformations can be made reversible under local operations and classical communication, when assisted by an entanglement battery--an auxiliary quantum system that stores and supplies entanglement in a way that ensures no net entanglement is lost. In particular, the rate of transformation in the asymptotic limit can be quantitatively expressed as a ratio of entanglement present within the quantum states involved. Our setting allows to consider different entanglement quantifiers which give rise to unique principles governing state transformations, effectively constituting diverse manifestations of a ``second law'' of entanglement manipulation. These findings resolve a long-standing open question on the reversible manipulation of entangled states and are also applicable to multipartite entanglement and other quantum resource theories, including quantum thermodynamics.</description>

Abstract: We apply the quantum error detection scheme Pauli check sandwiching (PCS) to quantum networks by turning it into a distributed multiparty protocol. PCS provides protection on the targeted qubits and generally requires less resource overhead than standard quantum error correction and detection codes. We provide analytical equations for the final fidelity and postselection rate for different PCS checks. We also introduce a recursive version of PCS that generates a family of distance 2 quantum codes that are locally equivalent to CSS codes. Our analytical results are benchmarked against BBPSSW in comparable scenarios. We also perform simulations with noisy gates for entanglement swapping and attain fidelity improvements. Lastly, we discuss various setups and graph state properties of PCS.</description>

      <title>Rise of conditionally clean ancillae for efficient quantum circuit constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce conditionally clean ancilla qubits, a new quantum resource, recently explored by [NZS24], that bridges the gap between traditional clean and dirty ancillae. Like dirty ancillae, they begin and end in an unknown state and can be borrowed from existing system qubits, avoiding the space overhead of explicit qubit allocation. Like clean ancillae, they can be treated as initialized in a known state within specific computations, thus avoiding the overhead of toggle detection required for dirty ancillae. We present new circuit constructions leveraging conditionally clean ancillae to achieve lower gate counts and depths, particularly with limited ancilla availability. Specifically, we provide constructions for:
  (a) $n$-controlled NOT using $2n$ Toffolis and $O(\log{n})$ depth given 2 clean ancillae.
  (b) $n$-qubit incrementer using $3n$ Toffolis given $\log_2^*{n}$ clean ancillae.
  (c) $n$-qubit quantum-classical comparator using $3n$ Toffolis given $\log_2^*{n}$ clean ancillae.
  (d) unary iteration over $[0,N)$ using $2.5N$ Toffolis given $\log_2^*{n}$ clean ancillae.
  (e) unary iteration via skew tree over $[0, N)$ using $1.25N$ Toffolis given $n$ dirty ancillae.
  We also introduce laddered toggle detection, a technique to replace clean ancillae with dirty ancillae in all our constructions, incurring a 2x Toffoli gate overhead. Our results demonstrate that conditionally clean ancillae are a valuable tool for quantum circuit design, especially in the resource-constrained early fault-tolerant era.</description>

Abstract: Chirality is a property of a gapped phase of matter in two spatial dimensions that can be manifested through non-zero thermal or electrical Hall conductance. In this paper, we prove two no-go theorems that forbid such chirality for a quantum state in a finite dimensional local Hilbert space with strict area law entanglement entropies. As a crucial ingredient in the proofs, we introduce a new quantum information-theoretic primitive called instantaneous modular flow, which has many other potential applications.</description>

      <title>Interplay between time and energy in bosonic noisy quantum metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18791v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement and coherence often allow for protocols that outperform classical ones in estimating a system's parameter. When using infinite-dimensional probes (such as a bosonic mode), one could in principle obtain infinite precision in a finite time for both classical and quantum protocols, which makes it hard to quantify potential quantum advantage. However, such a situation is unphysical, as it would require infinite resources, so one needs to impose some additional constraint: typically the average energy employed by the probe is finite. Here we treat both energy and time as a resource, showing that, in the presence of noise, there is a nontrivial interplay between the average energy and the time devoted to the estimation. Our results are valid for the most general metrological schemes (e.g. adaptive schemes which may involve entanglement with external ancillae or any kind of continuous measurement). We apply recently derived precision bounds for all parameters characterizing the paradigmatic case of a bosonic mode, subject to Lindbladian noise. We show how the time employed in the estimation should be partitioned in order to achieve the best possible precision. In most cases, the optimal performance may be obtained without the necessity of adaptivity or entanglement with ancilla. We compare results with classical strategies. Interestingly, for temperature estimation, applying a fast-prepare-and-measure protocol with Fock states provides better scaling with the number of photons than any classical strategy.</description>

Abstract: In order to enable the sequential implementation of quantum information theoretic protocols in the continuous variable framework, we propose two schemes for resource reusability, resource-splitting protocol and unsharp homodyne measurements. We demonstrate the advantage offered by the first scheme in implementing sequential attempts at continuous variable teleportation when the protocol fails in the previous round. In the second scheme, unsharp quadrature measurements are employed to implement the detection of entanglement between several pairs of observers. Under specific conditions, our calculations show that it is possible to successfully witness the entanglement of the same two-mode state, sequentially by as many as five observers.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear semiclassical spectroscopy of ultrafast molecular polariton dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16630v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a theoretical framework that allows for the systematic and efficient description of the ultrafast nonlinear response of molecular polaritons, i.e., hybrid light-matter states, in the collective regime of large numbers of molecules $\mathcal N$ coupled to the cavity photon mode. Our approach is based on a semiclassical, mean-field evolution of the molecular Hamiltonian and the cavity field, which is complemented by a perturbative expansion of both light and matter counterparts in the input fields entering the cavity. In addition, expansion in terms of the pulse phases enables us to disentangle different excitation pathways in Liouville space, thereby distinguishing contributions to the nonlinear response. The formalism extends traditional free-space nonlinear spectroscopy by incorporating the feedback of matter onto the light field via the induced polarization. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by applying it to the calculation of pump-probe polariton spectra and show how, by storing the pulses, the cavity facilitates additional excitation pathways, which can be used to isolate purely bright state contributions. Our method, which does not scale with $\mathcal N$, is broadly applicable and can be extended to model a wide range of current experiments investigating the dynamical nonlinear response of hybrid light-matter states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the entanglement structure of states generated by random constant-depth two-dimensional quantum circuits, followed by projective measurements of a subset of sites. By deriving a rigorous lower bound on the average entanglement entropy of such post-measurement states, we prove that macroscopic long-ranged entanglement is generated above some constant critical depth in several natural classes of circuit architectures, which include brickwork circuits and random holographic tensor networks. This behaviour had been conjectured based on previous works, which utilize non-rigorous methods such as replica theory calculations, or work in regimes where the local Hilbert space dimension grows with system size. To establish our lower bound, we develop new replica-free theoretical techniques that leverage tools from multi-user quantum information theory, which are of independent interest, allowing us to map the problem onto a statistical mechanics model of self-avoiding walks without requiring large local Hilbert space dimension. Our findings have consequences for the complexity of classically simulating sampling from random shallow circuits, and of contracting tensor networks: First, we show that standard algorithms based on matrix product states which are used for both these tasks will fail above some constant depth and bond dimension, respectively. In addition, we also prove that these random constant-depth quantum circuits cannot be simulated by any classical circuit of sublogarithmic depth.</description>

Abstract: In quantum error correction, the Petz map serves as a perfect recovery map when the Knill-Laflamme conditions are satisfied. Notably, while perfect recovery is generally infeasible for most quantum channels of finite dimension, the Petz map remains a versatile tool with near-optimal performance in recovering quantum states. This work introduces and proves, for the first time, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimality of the Petz map in terms of entanglement fidelity. In some special cases, the violation of this condition can be easily characterized by a simple commutator that can be efficiently computed. We provide multiple examples that substantiate our new findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23710v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify and interpret the possible quantum thermal machine regimes with a transverse-field Ising model as the working substance. In general, understanding the emergence of such regimes in a many-body quantum system is challenging due to the dependence on the many energy levels in the system. By considering infinitesimal work strokes, we can understand the operation from equilibrium properties of the system. We find that infinitesimal work strokes enable both heat engine and accelerator operation, with the output and boundaries of operation described by macroscopic properties of the system, in particular the net transverse magnetization. At low temperatures, the regimes of operation and performance can be understood from quasiparticles in the system, while at high temperatures an expansion of the free energy in powers of inverse temperature describes the operation. The understanding generalises to larger work strokes when the temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoirs is large. For hot and cold reservoirs close in temperature, a sufficiently large work stroke can enable refrigerator and heater regimes. Our results and method of analysis will prove useful in understanding the possible regimes of operation of quantum many-body thermal machines more generally.</description>

      <title>Relating Quantum Tamper-Evident Encryption to Other Cryptographic Notions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum tamper-evident encryption scheme is a non-interactive symmetric-key encryption scheme mapping classical messages to quantum ciphertexts such that an honest recipient of a ciphertext can detect with high probability any meaningful eavesdropping. This quantum cryptographic primitive was first introduced by Gottesman in 2003. Beyond formally defining this security notion, Gottesman's work had three main contributions: showing that any quantum authentication scheme is also a tamper-evident scheme, noting that a quantum key distribution scheme can be constructed from any tamper-evident scheme, and constructing a prepare-and-measure tamper-evident scheme using only Wiesner states inspired by Shor and Preskill's proof of security for the BB84 quantum key distribution scheme.
  In this work, we further our understanding of tamper-evident encryption by formally relating it to other quantum cryptographic primitives in an information-theoretic setting. In particular, we show that tamper evidence implies encryption, answering a question left open by Gottesman, we show that it can be constructed from any encryption scheme with revocation and vice-versa, and we formalize an existing sketch of a construction of quantum money from any tamper-evident encryption scheme. These results also yield as a corollary that any scheme allowing the revocation of a message must be an encryption scheme. We also show separations between tamper evidence and other primitives, notably showing that tamper evidence does not imply authentication and does not imply uncloneable encryption.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Quantum Correlations and Entanglement Generation in Electron-Molecule Inelastic Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics and processes involved in particle-molecule scattering, including nuclear dynamics, is described and analyzed by different quantum information quantities along the different stages of the scattering. The main process studied and characterized with the information quantities is the interatomic coulombic electronic capture (ICEC), an inelastic process that can lead to dissociation of the target molecule. The analysis is focused in a one-dimensional transversely confined $\text{NeHe}$ molecule model used to simulate the scattering between an electron $\text{e}^-$(particle) and a $\text{NeHe}^+$ ion (molecule). The time-independent Schr\"odinger equation (TISE) is solved using the Finite Element Method (FEM) with a self-developed Julia package FEMTISE to compute potential energy curves (PECs) and the parameters of the interactions between particles. The time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) is solved using the Multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) algorithm. The time dependent electronic and nuclear probability densities are calculated for different electron incoming energies, evidencing elastic and inelastic processes that can be correlated to changes in von Neumann entropy, conditional mutual information and Shannon entropies. The expectation value of the position of the particles, as well as their standard deviations, are analyzed along the whole dynamics and related to the entanglement during the collision and after the process is over, hence evidencing the dynamics of entanglement generation. It is shown that the correlations generated in the collision is partially retained only when the inelastic process is active.</description>

      <title>Superactivation of memory effects in a classical Markov environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a phenomenon known as Superactivation of Backflow of Information (SBFI); namely, the fact that the tensor product of a non-Markovian dynamics with itself exhibits Backflow of Information (BFI) from environment to system even if the single dynamics does not. Such an effect is witnessed by the non-monotonic behaviour of the Helstrom norm and emerges in the open dynamics of two independent, but statistically coupled, parties. We physically interpret SBFI by means of the discrete-time non-Markovian dynamics of two open qubits collisionally coupled to an environment described by a classical Markov chain. In such a scenario SBFI can be ascribed to the decrease of the qubit-qubit-environment correlations in favour of those of the two qubits, only. We further prove that the same mechanism at the roots of SBFI also holds in a suitable continuous-time limit. We also show that SBFI does not require entanglement to be witnessed, but only the quantumness of the Helstrom ensemble.</description>

Abstract: Symmetry-resolved entanglement, capturing the refined structure of quantum entanglement in systems with global symmetries, has attracted a lot of attention recently. In this manuscript, introducing the notion of symmetry-resolved generalized entropies, we aim to develop a computational framework suitable for the study of excited state symmetry-resolved entanglement as well as the dynamical evolution of symmetry-resolved entanglement in symmetry-preserving out-of-equilibrium settings. We illustrate our framework using the example of (1+1)-d free massless compact boson theory, and benchmark our results using lattice computation in the XX chain. As a byproduct, our computational framework also provides access to the probability distribution of the symmetry charge contained within a subsystem and the corresponding full counting statistics.</description>

      <title>Modes, states and superselection rules in quantum optics and quantum information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03943v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A convenient way to represent quantum optical states is through the quadrature basis of single-modes of the field. This framework provides intuitive definitions for quasi-classical states, their phase-space representations, and enables the definition of a universal gate set. In this widely adopted representation of quantum optics, most pure states consist of coherent superpositions of photon-number states. However, this approach neglects the particle-number superselection rule - which prohibits coherence between states of differing photon numbers - and implicitly assumes a phase reference. We adopt a representation of quantum optical states that respects the superselection rule and revisit key tools and results in quantum optics and information encoding within quantum optics. This approach preserves the intuitive aspects of the traditional quadrature representation while unifying insights from quantum optics with those from symmetric spin-like and angular momentum systems. More than just an alternative representation, we show that a superselection rule-compliant framework provides a unified formalism for all bosonic encodings, from single-photon to continuous-variable encodings. This perspective allows for a precise characterization of the roles of Gaussian and non-Gaussian resources, as well as the interplay between modes and states in quantum universality and potential computational advantage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11064v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bell's theorem states that no model that respects Local Causality and Statistical Independence can account for the correlations predicted by quantum mechanics via entangled states. This paper proposes a new approach, using backward-in-time conditional probabilities, which relaxes conventional assumptions of temporal ordering while preserving Statistical Independence as a "fine-tuning condition. It is shown how such models can account for EPR/Bell correlations and, analogously, the GHZ predictions while nevertheless forbidding superluminal signalling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement distribution across remote distances is critical for many quantum applications. Currently, the de facto approach for remote entanglement distribution relies on optical fiber for on-the-ground entanglement distribution. However, the fiber-based approach is incapable of global-scale entanglement distribution due to intrinsic limitations. This paper investigates a new hybrid ground-satellite quantum network architecture (QuESat) for global-scale entanglement distribution, integrating an on-the-ground fiber network with a global-scale passive optical network built with low-Earth-orbit satellites. The satellite network provides dynamic construction of photon lightpaths based on near-vacuum beam guides constructed via adjustable arrays of lenses, forwarding photons from one ground station to another with very high efficiency over long distances compared to using fiber. To assess the feasibility and effectiveness of QuESat for global communication, we formulate lightpath provisioning and entanglement distribution problems, considering the orbital dynamics of satellites and the time-varying entanglement demands from ground users. A two-stage algorithm is developed to dynamically configure the beam guides and distribute entanglements, respectively. The algorithm combines randomized and deterministic rounding for lightpath provisioning to enable global connectivity, with optimal entanglement swapping for distributing entanglements to meet users' demands. By developing a ground-satellite quantum network simulator, QuESat achieves multi-fold improvements compared to repeater networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09345v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in quantum information is to understand the operational significance of quantum resources. Quantum resource theories (QRTs) provide a powerful theoretical framework that aids in analyzing and comprehending the operational meaning of these resources. Early resource theories primarily focused on analyzing static quantum resources. Recently, there has been growing interest in the study of dynamic quantum resources. In this paper, we utilize superchannel theory to describe the dynamic resource theory of quantum coherence. In this dynamic resource theory, we treat classical channels as free channels and consider two classes of free superchannels that preserve channel incoherence (maximally incoherent superchannels (MISC) and dephasing-covariant incoherent superchannels (DISC)) as free resources. We regard the quantum Fourier transform as the golden unit of dynamic coherence resources. We first establish the one-shot theory of dynamic coherence cost and dynamic coherence distillation, which involves converting the quantum Fourier transform into an arbitrary quantum channel using MISC and DISC. Next, we introduce a class of free superchannels known as $\delta$-MISC, which asymptotically generate negligible dynamic coherence. Finally, we provide upper and lower bounds for the one-shot catalytic dynamic coherence cost of quantum channels under the action of these $\delta$-MISC superchannels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of two-stroke heat engines where two bosonic modes $a$ and $b$ are coupled by the general nonlinear interaction $V_{\theta} = \exp {(\theta a^{\dagger n}b^m -\theta^* a^n b^{\dagger m})}$. By adopting the two-point measurement scheme we retrieve the distribution of the stochastic work, and hence the relative fluctuations of the extracted work up to the second order in the coupling $\theta$. We identify the optimal interactions providing large average work with small fluctuations in the operational regime of the heat engine. Then, we consider the specific cases $n=2$, $m=1$ and $n=1$, $m=2$ up to the fourth order in $\theta$. We optimize the average work and the signal-to-noise ratio over the frequencies of the bosonic modes and the temperatures of the reservoirs. Finally, we determine the thermodynamic uncertainty relations for these processes in relation with the order of the expansion of the unitary interaction $V_{\theta}$.</description>

      <title>Entropic Diagram Characterization of Quantum Coherence: Degenerate Distillation and the Maximum Eigenvalue Uncertainty Bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a rigorous framework for quantifying quantum coherence in finite-dimensional systems by applying the Schur-Horn majorization theorem to relate eigenvalue distributions and diagonal entries of density matrices. Building on this foundation, we introduce a versatile suite of coherence measures, including the relative cross-entropy of coherence and its partial variants, that satisfy all resource theoretic axioms under incoherent operations. This unifying approach clarifies the geometric boundaries of physically realizable states in von Neumann-Tsallis entropy space and uncovers the phenomenon of degenerate coherence distillation where symmetry in the eigenvalue spectrum enables enhanced coherence extraction in higher-dimensional systems. In addition, we strengthen the entropy-based uncertainty relation by refining the Massen-Uffink bound to account for the largest eigenvalues across distinct measurement bases. This refinement forges a deeper connection between entropy and uncertainty, which yields operationally meaningful constraints for quantum information tasks. Altogether, our findings illustrate the power of majorization in resource-theoretic analyses of quantum coherence, which offer valuable tools for both fundamental research and real-world applications in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>The stellar decomposition of Gaussian quantum states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the stellar decomposition, a novel method for characterizing non-Gaussian states produced by photon-counting measurements on Gaussian states. Given an (m+n)-mode Gaussian state G, we express it as an (m+n)-mode "Gaussian core state" G_core followed by a fixed m-mode Gaussian transformation T that only acts on the first m modes. The defining property of the Gaussian core state G_core is that measuring the last n of its modes in the photon-number basis leaves the first m modes on a finite Fock support, i.e. a core state. Since T is measurement-independent and G_core has an exact and finite Fock representation, this decomposition exactly describes all non-Gaussian states obtainable by projecting n modes of G onto the Fock basis. For pure states we prove that a physical pair (G_core, T) always exists with G_core pure and T unitary. For mixed states, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for (G_core, T) to be a Gaussian mixed state and a Gaussian channel. Finally, we develop a semidefinite program to extract the "largest" possible Gaussian channel when these conditions fail. The stellar decomposition leads to practical bounds on achievable state quality in photonic circuits and for GKP state generation in particular. Our results are based on a new characterization of Gaussian completely positive maps in the Bargmann picture, which may be of independent interest. As a result, this work provides novel tools for improved simulations of quantum optical systems, and for understanding the generation of non-Gaussian resource states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18173v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on an industry-grade CMOS-compatible qubit fabrication approach using a CMOS pilot line, enabling a yield of functional devices reaching 92.8%, with a resistance spread evaluated across the full wafer 200 mm diameter of 12.4% and relaxation times (T1) approaching 80 us. Furthermore, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of wafer-scale room temperature (RT) characteristics collected from multiple wafers and fabrication runs, focusing on RT measurements and their correlation to low temperature qubit parameters. From defined test structures, a across-wafer junction area variation of 10.1% and oxide barrier variation of 7.2% was calculated. Additionally, we notably show a close-correlation between qubit junction resistance and frequency in accordance with the Ambegaokar-Baratoff relation with a critical temperature Tc of about 0.71 K. This overarching relation sets the stage for pre-cooldown qubit evaluation and sorting. In particular, such early-on device characterization and validation are crucial for increasing the fabrication yield and qubit frequency targeting, which currently represent major scaling challenges. Furthermore, it enables the fabrication of large multichip quantum systems in the future. Our findings highlight the great potential of CMOS-compatible industry-style fabrication of superconducting qubits for scalable quantum computing in a foundry pilot line cleanroom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a framework which allows to systematically and arbitrarily scale the code distance of local fermion-to-qubit encodings in one and two dimensions without growing the weights of stabilizers. This is achieved by embedding low-distance encodings into the surface code in the form of topological defects. We introduce a family of Ladder Encodings (LE), which is optimal in the sense that the code distance is equal to the weights of density and nearest-neighbor hopping operators of a one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model. In two dimensions, we show how to scale the code distance of LE as well as other low-distance encodings such as Verstraete-Cirac and Derby-Klassen. We further introduce Perforated Encodings, which locally encode two fermionic spin modes within the same surface code structure. We show that our strategy is also extendable to other topological codes by explicitly embedding the LE into a 6.6.6 color code.</description>

We present the utilized proof-of-concept chip designs for qubit- and carrier chip, as well as the respective front-end and back-end fabrication techniques. In characterization of the newly developed microbump technology based on metallized KOH-etched Si-islands, we observe a superconducting transition of the used metal stacks and radio frequency (RF) signal transfer through the bump connection with negligible attenuation.

      <title>CMOS-Compatible, Wafer-Scale Processed Superconducting Qubits Exceeding Energy Relaxation Times of 200us</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08424v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of an industry-grade fabrication of superconducting qubits on 200 mm wafers utilizing CMOS-established processing methods. By automated waferprober resistance measurements at room temperature, we demonstrate a Josephson junction fabrication yield of 99.7% (shorts and opens) across more than 10000 junctions and a qubit frequency prediction accuracy of 1.6%. In cryogenic characterization, we provide statistical results regarding energy relaxation times of the qubits with a median T1 of up to 100 us and individual devices consistently approaching 200 us in long-term measurements. This represents the best performance reported so far for superconducting qubits fabricated by industry-grade, wafer-level subtractive processes.</description>

      <title>Exponential concentration and symmetries in Quantum Reservoir Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) is an emerging framework for near-term quantum machine learning that offers in-memory processing, platform versatility across analogue and digital systems, and avoids typical trainability challenges such as barren plateaus and local minima. The exponential number of independent features of quantum reservoirs opens the way to a potential performance improvement compared to classical settings. However, this exponential scaling can be hindered by exponential concentration, where finite-ensemble noise in quantum measurements requires exponentially many samples to extract meaningful outputs, a common issue in quantum machine learning. In this work, we go beyond static quantum machine learning tasks and address concentration in QRC for time-series processing using quantum-scrambling reservoirs. Beyond discussing how concentration effects can constrain QRC performance, we demonstrate that leveraging Hamiltonian symmetries significantly suppresses concentration, enabling robust and scalable QRC implementations. We illustrate our approach with concrete examples, including an established QRC design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many computational problems are unchanged under some symmetry operation. In classical machine learning, this can be reflected with the layer structure of the neural network. In quantum machine learning, the ansatz can be tuned to correspond to the specific symmetry of the problem. We investigate this adaption of the quantum circuit to the problem symmetry on graph classification problems. On random graphs, the quantum machine learning ansatz classifies whether a given random graph is connected, bipartite, contains a Hamiltonian path or cycle, respectively. We find that if the quantum circuit reflects the inherent symmetry of the problem, it vastly outperforms the standard, unsymmetrized ansatzes. Even when the symmetry is only approximative, there is still a significant performance gain over non-symmetrized ansatzes. We show how the symmetry can be included in the quantum circuit in a straightforward constructive method.</description>

      <title>Partite-wise Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that $\rho^{AB}$ as a bipartite reduced state of the 3-qubit GHZ state is separable, but part $A$ and part $B$ are indeed entangled with each other without tracing out part $C$. Namely, whether a state containing entanglement is always dependent on the global system it lives in. We explore here such entanglement in any $n$-partite system with arbitrary dimensions, $n\geqslant3$, and call it partite-wise entanglement (PWE) which contains pairwise entanglement (PE) proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 032420(2024)] as a special case. In particular, we investigate the partite-wise entanglement extensibility, and from which we find that the reduced state of a genuine entangled state could be any mixed state without pure reduced states. We then propose three classes of the partite-wise entanglement measures which are based on the genuine entanglement measure, minimal bipartition measure, and the minimal distance from the partite-wise separable states, respectively. The former two methods are far-ranging since all of them are defined by the reduced functions. Consequently, we establish the framework of the resource theory of the partite-wise entanglement and the genuine partite-wise entanglement for which the free states are the pure states and the states with pure reduced states, respectively.</description>

      <title>Butterfly velocity and chaos suppression in de Sitter space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.02258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study the holographic CFT in the de Sitter static patch at finite temperature $T$ and chemical potential. We find that butterfly velocity $v_B$ in such field theory degenerates for all values of the Hubble parameter $H$ and $T$. We interpret this as a chaos disruption caused by the interplay between the expansion of chaotic correlations constrained by $v_B$ and effects caused by de Sitter curvature. The chemical potential restores healthy butterfly velocity for some range of temperatures. Also, we provide some analogy of this chaos suppression with the Schwinger effect in de Sitter and black hole formation from shock wave collision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.04783v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that there exists an operational way to establish the observability of the notions of space and time. Specifically, we propose a theory-independent protocol for a gedanken-experiment, whose outcome is a signal establishing the observability of the spacetime manifold, without a priori assuming its existence. The experimental signal contains the information about the dimension and the topology of spacetime (with the currently achievable precision), and establishes its manifold structure, while respecting its underlying diffeomorphism symmetry. We also introduce and discuss appropriate criteria for the concept of emergence of spacetime, which any tentative theoretical model of physics must satisfy in order to claim that spacetime does emerge from some more fundamental concepts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study discussed Dirac's bra-ket formalism for the identical particles system based on the rigged Hilbert space reformulated by R. Madrid [J. Phys A:Math. Gen. 37, 8129 (2004)]. The bra and ket vectors for a composite system that form the basis of an identical particle system are described in dual and anti-dual spaces for the tensor product of rigged Hilbert spaces. The permutation operator that characterizes the symmetry of identical particles is constructed as the operator on such dual spaces. We also show that the nuclear spectral theorem in the tensor product of rigged Hilbert spaces endows the spectral expansion of the self-adjoint operator in the dual and anti-dual spaces and the expansion is consistent with the identicle particle system when the permutation operator commutes the self-adjoint operator.</description>

Abstract: Introducing a class of SU(2) invariant quantum unitary circuits generating chiral transport, we examine the role of broken space-reflection and time-reversal symmetries on spin transport properties. Upon adjusting parameters of local unitary gates, the dynamics can be either chaotic or integrable. The latter corresponds to a generalization of the space-time discretized (Trotterized) higher-spin quantum Heisenberg chain. We demonstrate that breaking of space-reflection symmetry results in a drift in the dynamical spin susceptibility. Remarkably, we find a universal drift velocity given by a simple formula which, at zero average magnetization, depends only on the values of SU(2) Casimir invariants associated with local spins. In the integrable case, the drift velocity formula is confirmed analytically based on the exact solution of thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations. Finally, by inspecting the large fluctuations of the time-integrated current between two halves of the system in stationary maximum-entropy states, we demonstrate violation of the Gallavotti-Cohen symmetry, implying that such states cannot be regarded as equilibrium ones. We show that the scaled cumulant generating function of the time-integrated current instead obeys a generalized fluctuation relation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We write down a class of two-dimensional quantum spin-1/2 Hamiltonians whose eigenspectra are exactly solvable via the Jordan-Wigner transformation. The general structure corresponds to a suitable grid composed of XY or XX-Ising spin chains and ZZ-Ising spin chains and is generalizable to higher dimensions. They can host stacks of one-dimensional spinless fermion liquids with gapless excitations and power-law correlations coexisting with ordered spin moments (localized spinless fermions). Bond-dependent couplings thus can be an alternate mechanism than geometric frustration of SU(2)-symmetric couplings to obtain spinless fermionic excitations. Put in a different way, bond-dependent couplings allow for an embedding of one-dimensional spinless fermion (Tomonoga-Luttinger) liquids and solids and also Majorana excitations in higher dimensions. They can accommodate a simpler set of site-local conserved quantities apart from the more intricate, interlocked set of plaquette-local or bond-local conserved quantities in Kitaev's honeycomb model with Majorana excitations. The proposed grid structure may provide an architecture for quantum engineering with controllable qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fubini-Study metric is a central element of information geometry. We explore the role played by information geometry for determining the circuit complexity of Virasoro circuits and their deformations. To this effect, we study unitary quantum circuits generated by the Virasoro algebra and Fourier modes of a primary operator. Such primary-deformed Virasoro circuits can be realized in two-dimensional conformal field theories, where they provide models of inhomogeneous global quenches. We consider a cost function induced by the Fubini-Study metric and provide a universal expression for its time-evolution to quadratic order in the primary deformation for general source profiles. For circuits generated by the Virasoro zero mode and a primary, we obtain a non-zero cost only if spatial inhomogeneities are sufficiently large. In this case, we find that the cost saturates when the source becomes time-independent. The exact saturation value is determined by the history of the source profile. As a byproduct, returning to undeformed circuits, we relate the Fubini-Study metric to the K\"ahler metric on a coadjoint orbit of the Virasoro group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of both magnetic field and chemical potential on the emergence of chaotic dynamics in the QCD confining string from the holographic principle. An earlier developed bottom-up model of Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity, which mimics QCD features quite well, is used. The qualitative information about the chaos is obtained using the Poincar\'{e} sections and Lyapunov exponents. We find signatures of chaos in energetically disfavored string configurations, that are closer to the horizon, whereas no chaos is observed in energetically favored string configurations that are away from the horizon. Our results depend quite strongly on the frame we consider in the analysis. In the string frame, the chemical potential and the magnetic field suppress the chaotic dynamics in both parallel and perpendicular orientations of the string with respect to the magnetic field. Meanwhile, in the Einstein frame, the magnetic field suppresses/enhances the chaotic dynamics when the string is orientated perpendicular/parallel to the magnetic field, while the chemical potential enhances the chaotic dynamics for both orientations. The reported Lyapunov exponents are consistent with a classical analogue of the MSS bound in the parameter space of the model and we find it to be always satisfied in both frames.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive explicit closed-form expressions for the generating function $C_N(A)$, which enumerates classical closed random walks on square and triangular lattices with $N$ steps and a signed area $A$, characterized by the number of moves in each hopping direction. This enumeration problem is mapped to the trace of powers of anisotropic Hofstadter-like Hamiltonian and is connected to the cluster coefficients of exclusion particles: exclusion strength parameter $g = 2$ for square lattice walks, and a mixture of $g = 1$ and $g = 2$ for triangular lattice walks. By leveraging the intrinsic link between the Hofstadter model and high energy physics, we propose a conjecture connecting the above signed area enumeration $C_N(A)$ in statistical mechanics to the quantum A-period of associated toric Calabi-Yau threefold in topological string theory: square lattice walks correspond to local $\mathbb{F}_0$ geometry, while triangular lattice walks are associated with local $\mathcal{B}_3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Kitaev chains have emerged as a promising platform for realizing topological quantum computing. Once the chains are formed and the Majorana zero modes are braided/fused, reading out the parity of the chains is essential for further verifying the non-Abelian property of the Majorana zero modes. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of using a superconducting transmon qubit, which incorporates an end of a four-site quantum dot-superconductor chain based on a Ge/Si nanowire, to directly detect the singlet/doublet state, and thus the parity of the entire chain. We also demonstrate that for multiple-dot chains there are two types of 0-{\pi} transitions between different charging states: the parity-flip 0-{\pi} transition and the parity-preserved 0-{\pi} transition. Furthermore, we show that the inter-dot coupling, hence the strengths of cross Andreev reflection and elastic cotunneling of electrons, can be adjusted by local electrostatic gating in chains fabricated on Ge/Si core-shell nanowires. Our exploration would be helpful for the ultimate realization of topological quantum computing based on artificial Kitaev chains.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Synthetic Gauge Fields in Ultracold Atoms via Spatially Engineered Vector Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15479</link>

Abstract: Ultracold atoms, typically manipulated by scalar beams with uniform polarization, have propelled advances in quantum simulation, computation, and metrology. Yet, vector beams (VBs) -- structured light with spatially varying polarization -- remain unexplored in this context, despite their enhanced tunability and broad optical applications. Here, we demonstrate a novel scheme to generate synthetic gauge fields in ultracold atoms via VB-mediated coupling of internal states. This approach enables angular stripe phases across an expanded parameter range, achieving a three-order-of-magnitude enhancement in the phase diagram and facilitating experimental observation. We further present an all-optical method to create topologically nontrivial giant skyrmions in spin space, with tunable topology governed by VB parameters. Our findings establish VBs as powerful tools for quantum control and the exploration of exotic quantum states and phases.</description>

      <title>Limitations of the paraxial beam model in the study of quantum vacuum signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studies of nonlinear quantum vacuum signals often model the driving laser fields as paraxial beams. This in particular holds for analytic approaches. While this allows for reliable predictions in most situations, there are also notable exceptions. A prominent example is the overestimation of the polarization-flipped signal photon yield in the collision of two equally focused, parallel polarized laser beams by a factor of about six. In the present work, we identify the origin of this deficiency and devise a strategy to obtain accurate closed-form expressions also in cases challenging the conventional (leading order) paraxial beam model. We demonstrate the potential of our approach on the example of two linearly polarized laser pulses colliding at a generic collision angle.</description>

      <title>Approximation of diffeomorphisms for quantum state transfers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14450v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we seek to combine two emerging standpoints in control theory. On the one hand, recent advances in infinite-dimensional geometric control have unlocked a method for controlling (with arbitrary precision and in arbitrarily small times) state transfers for bilinear Schr\"odinger PDEs posed on a Riemannian manifold $M$. In particular, these arguments rely on controllability results in the group of the diffeomorphisms of $M$. On the other hand, using tools of $\Gamma$-convergence, it has been proved that we can phrase the retrieval of a diffeomorphism of $M$ as an ensemble optimal control problem. More precisely, this is done by employing a control-affine system for \emph{simultaneously} steering a finite swarm of points towards the respective targets. Here we blend these two theoretical approaches and numerically find control laws driving state transitions (such as eigenstate transfers) in small time in a bilinear Schr\"odinger PDE posed on the torus. Such systems have experimental relevance and are currently used to model rotational dynamics of molecules, and cold atoms trapped in periodic optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Multipole Skin Effects Challenge Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of quenched disorder on the non-Hermitian skin effect in systems that conserve a U(1) charge and its associated multipole moments. In particular, we generalize the Hatano-Nelson argument for a localization transition in disordered, non-reciprocal systems to the interacting case. When only U(1) charge is conserved, we show that there is a transition between a skin effect phase, in which charges cluster at a boundary, and a many-body localized phase, in which charges localize at random positions. In the dynamics of entanglement, this coincides with an area to volume law transition. For systems without boundaries, the skin effect becomes a delocalized phase with a unidirectional current. If dipoles or higher multipoles are conserved, we show that the non-Hermitian skin effect remains stable to arbitrary disorder. Counterintuitively, the system is therefore always delocalized under periodic boundary conditions, regardless of disorder strength.</description>
