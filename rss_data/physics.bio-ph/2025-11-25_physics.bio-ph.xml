      <title>Iterative improvement of free energy landscape reconstructions with optimal protocols derived from differentiable simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free energy landscapes encode the kinetics, intermediates, and transition states that govern molecular processes and are thus a key target of single biomolecule research. Typical approaches to deriving optimal, error-minimizing, non-equilibrium driving protocols for estimating these landscapes require a priori knowledge of the landscape. Here, we present an alternative: an iterative algorithm for optimizing full free energy landscape reconstructions which can be used alongside experiments on unknown landscapes. Our approach (i) takes experimental or simulated trajectory data; (ii) reconstructs an `approximate' energy landscape; (iii) derives optimal control protocols from low-dimensional differentiable Brownian dynamics simulations on the candidate landscape using automatic differentiation; (iv) re-runs the experiment or simulation using the updated protocol; and (v) iterates until convergence. Using this approach, we recover known benchmarks from the literature and probe far-from-equilibrium regimes for symmetric, asymmetric, and triple-well energy landscapes under both 1- and 2-dimensional control. Our control protocols -- derived with no a priori knowledge of the energy landscape -- yield substantially reduced variance and bias in free energy landscape reconstructions compared to naive linear protocols.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Multimodal and Multiscale Analysis of Alzheimer Disease in 5xFAD Mice: Optical Spectroscopies, TEM, Neuropathological, and Behavioral Investigations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer disease (AD) is considered one of the leading causes of death in the United States, and there is no effective cure for it. Understanding the neuropathological mechanisms underlying AD is essential for identifying early, reliable biomarkers and developing effective therapies. In this paper, we report on a comprehensive multimodal study of AD pathology using the 5xFAD mouse model. We employed light-scattering techniques, Partial Wave Spectroscopy (PWS) and Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR), to detect nanoscale structural alterations in brain tissues, nuclear components, and mitochondria. To support the light-scattering experiments, behavior, and histopathological studies were conducted. These analyses revealed significant increases in structural heterogeneity and mass density fluctuations in the brains of 5xFAD mice compared with Non-transgenic controls. Behavioral assessment demonstrated memory impairment in 5xFAD mice, reflected by a reduced recognition index. Histopathological analysis further revealed increased amyloid beta plaques and microglia activation in the hippocampus and cortex of 5xFAD mice compared with Non-transgenic controls. An increase in structural disorder within brain tissues can be attributed to higher mass density fluctuations, likely arising from macromolecular rearrangement driven by amyloid beta aggregation and neuroinflammatory responses as the disease progresses. Our findings suggest that PWS and IPR-derived metrics provide sensitive biophysical indicators of early cellular and subcellular disruption, offering potential as quantitative biomarkers for the detection and progression of AD.</description>

      <title>Many-Eyes and Sentinels in Selfish and Cooperative Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective vigilance describes how animals in groups benefit from the predator detection efforts of others. Empirical observations typically find either a many-eyes strategy with all (or many) group members maintaining a low level of individual vigilance, or a sentinel strategy with one (or a few) individuals maintaining a high level of individual vigilance while others do not. With a general analytical treatment that makes minimal assumptions, we show that these two strategies are alternate solutions to the same adaptive problem of balancing the costs of predation and vigilance. Which strategy is preferred depends on how costs scale with the level of individual vigilance: many-eyes strategies are preferred where costs of vigilance rise gently at low levels but become steeper at higher levels (convex; e.g. an open field); sentinel strategies are preferred where costs of vigilance rise steeply at low levels and then flatten out (concave; e.g. environments with vantage points). This same dichotomy emerges whether individuals act selfishly to optimise their own fitness or cooperatively to optimise group fitness. The model is extended to explain discrete behavioural switching between strategies and differential levels of vigilance such as edge effects.</description>

      <title>Predictability of viral load dynamics in the early phases of SARS-CoV-2 through a model-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03158v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A pipeline to evaluate the evolution of viral dynamics based on a new model-driven approach has been developed in the present study. The proposed methods exploit real data and the multiscale structure of the infection dynamics to provide robust predictions of the epidemic dynamics. We focus on viral load kinetics whose dynamical features are typically available in the symptomatic stage of the infection. Hence, the epidemiological evolution is obtained by relying on a compartmental approach characterized by a varying infection rate to estimate early-stage viral load dynamics, of which few data are available. We test the proposed approach with real data of SARS-CoV-2 viral load kinetics collected from patients living in an Italian province. The considered database refers to early-phase infections, whose viral load kinetics have not been affected by the mass vaccination policies in Italy.</description>
