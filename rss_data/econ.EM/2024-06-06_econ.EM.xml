      <title>When is IV identification agnostic about outcomes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many identification results in instrumental variables (IV) models have the property that identification holds with no restrictions on the joint distribution of potential outcomes or how these outcomes are correlated with selection behavior. This enables many IV models to allow for arbitrary heterogeneity in treatment effects and the possibility of selection on gains in the outcome variable. I call this type of identification result "outcome-agnostic", and provide a necessary and sufficient condition for counterfactual means or treatment effects to be identified in an outcome-agnostic manner, when the instruments and treatments have finite support. In addition to unifying many existing IV identification results, this characterization suggests a brute-force approach to revealing all restrictions on selection behavior that yield identification of treatment effect parameters. While computationally intensive, the approach uncovers even in simple settings new selection models that afford identification of interpretable causal parameters.</description>

      <title>Is local opposition taking the wind out of the energy transition?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local opposition to the installation of renewable energy sources is a potential threat to the energy transition. Local communities tend to oppose the construction of energy plants due to the associated negative externalities (the so-called 'not in my backyard' or NIMBY phenomenon) according to widespread belief, mostly based on anecdotal evidence. Using administrative data on wind turbine installation and electoral outcomes across municipalities located in the South of Italy during 2000-19, we estimate the impact of wind turbines' installation on incumbent regional governments' electoral support during the next elections. Our main findings, derived by a wind-speed based instrumental variable strategy, point in the direction of a mild and not statistically significant electoral backlash for right-wing regional administrations and of a strong and statistically significant positive reinforcement for left-wing regional administrations. Based on our analysis, the hypothesis of an electoral effect of NIMBY type of behavior in connection with the development of wind turbines appears not to be supported by the data.</description>

      <title>Identification of structural shocks in Bayesian VEC models with two-state Markov-switching heteroskedasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a Bayesian framework for cointegrated structural VAR models identified by two-state Markovian breaks in conditional covariances. The resulting structural VEC specification with Markov-switching heteroskedasticity (SVEC-MSH) is formulated in the so-called B-parameterization, in which the prior distribution is specified directly for the matrix of the instantaneous reactions of the endogenous variables to structural innovations. We discuss some caveats pertaining to the identification conditions presented earlier in the literature on stationary structural VAR-MSH models, and revise the restrictions to actually ensure the unique global identification through the two-state heteroskedasticity. To enable the posterior inference in the proposed model, we design an MCMC procedure, combining the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The methodology is illustrated both with a simulated as well as real-world data examples.</description>

      <title>Decision synthesis in monetary policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The macroeconomy is a sophisticated dynamic system involving significant uncertainties that complicate modelling. In response, decision makers consider multiple models that provide different predictions and policy recommendations which are then synthesized into a policy decision. In this setting, we introduce and develop Bayesian predictive decision synthesis (BPDS) to formalize monetary policy decision processes. BPDS draws on recent developments in model combination and statistical decision theory that yield new opportunities in combining multiple models, emphasizing the integration of decision goals, expectations and outcomes into the model synthesis process. Our case study concerns central bank policy decisions about target interest rates with a focus on implications for multi-step macroeconomic forecasting.</description>
