      <title>SN 2023ixf: The Closest Supernova of the Decade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova 2023ixf occurred on May 18th 2023 in the nearby galaxy Messier 101 (D ~ 6.85 Mpc), making it the closest supernova in the last decade. Following its discovery, astronomers around the world rushed to observe the explosion across the electromagnetic spectrum in order to uncover its early-time properties. Based on multi-wavelength analysis during its first year post-explosion, supernova 2023ixf is a type II supernova that interacted with dense, confined circumstellar material in its local environment -- this material being lost from its red supergiant progenitor in the final years before explosion. In this article, we will review the findings of &gt;80 studies already published on this incredible event as well as explore how the synthesis of SN 2023ixf observations across the electromagnetic spectrum can be used to constrain both type II supernova explosion physics in addition to the the uncertain mass loss histories of red supergiant stars in their final years.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Neutrino Flux in Segments along the Galactic Plane with IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray emission from the plane of the Milky Way is understood as partly originating from the interaction of cosmic rays with the interstellar medium. The same interaction is expected to produce a corresponding flux of neutrinos. In 2023, IceCube reported the first observation of this galactic neutrino flux at 4.5$\sigma$ confidence level. The analysis relied on neutrino flux predictions - based on gamma ray observations - to model the expected neutrino emission from the galactic plane. Three signal hypotheses describing different possible spatial and energy distributions were tested, where the single free parameter in each test was the normalization of the neutrino flux. We present first results of an analysis that can improve the characterization of Galactic neutrino emission by dividing the galactic plane into segments in galactic longitude. An unbinned maximum-likelihood analysis is used that can fit the spectral index and the flux normalization separately in each segment. While gamma ray telescopes can not differentiate between hadronic and leptonic emission, neutrino production must come from hadronic processes. Measuring a spectral index can further help to understand the contribution of unresolved neutrino sources inside the galactic plane. This work uses a full-sky cascade dataset and provides model-independent insight into the variation of the neutrino flux and energy distribution from different regions of the galactic plane.</description>

      <title>Results from IceCube Searches for High-energy Neutrinos Coincident with Gravitational-Wave Alerts in LVK O4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mergers of compact objects, binary black holes and mergers including at least one neutron star, are a predicted source of high-energy neutrinos. These astrophysical events are now routinely detected through observation of their gravitational wave signature and, at least in one instance, their electromagnetic counterparts were also detected. Particles accelerated during the coalescence of compact objects may also interact to produce high-energy neutrinos, which have yet to be detected, but observations are ongoing. The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration publicly releases information on candidate gravitational wave events from compact binary coalescences in low latency during the current observing run (O4). To aid the electromagnetic follow-up, using data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, we search, in real time, for neutrinos spatially and temporally coincident with these gravitational wave candidate events using a time window of 1000 seconds centered on the merger time. We use two methods, both of which have been previously used to search for neutrino emission from gravitational-wave transients: an unbinned maximum likelihood analysis applied to significant alerts and a Bayesian analysis with astrophysical priors, applied to both significant and low-significance alerts. In addition, we search for long-duration neutrino emission up to 14 days after the merging of binaries containing a neutron star. We report analysis results determined in real time for these searches, and set upper limits on both flux and isotropic-equivalent energy emitted in neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Enhancing searches for astrophysical neutrino sources in IceCube with machine learning and improved spatial modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searches for astrophysical neutrino sources in IceCube rely on an unbinned likelihood that consists of an energy and spatial component. Accurate modeling of the detector, ice, and spatial distributions leads to improved directional and energy reconstructions, resulting in increased sensitivity. In this work, we utilize our best knowledge of the detector ice properties and detector calibrations to reconstruct in-ice particle showers. The spatial component of the likelihood is parameterized either by a 2D Gaussian or a von Mises Fisher (vMF) distribution at small and large angular uncertainties, respectively. Here, we use a gradient-boosted decision tree with a vMF spatial likelihood loss function, reparameterized through two coordinate transformations, to predict per-event point spread functions (PSF). Additionally, we discuss the search for PeV cosmic ray sources using the IceCube Multi-Flavor Astrophysical Neutrino (ICEMAN) sample. Our search contains both an analysis of individual neutrino sources coincident with greater than 100 TeV gamma-ray sources and also a stacking analysis. We outline the prospects for extended neutrino emission originating from the Cygnus Cocoon region.</description>

      <title>Universal energy limits of radiation belts in planetary and brown dwarf magnetospheric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation belts are regions of magnetically trapped particle radiation found around all of the sufficiently magnetized planets in the Solar System and recently also observed around brown dwarfs, yet despite their ubiquity, there is not yet a general theory or model to predict the uppermost energy limits that any particular magnetospheric system's radiation belts can attain. By considering only the most fundamental loss processes, a model and corresponding theory are developed that successfully bound and explain the maximum observed energies of all documented radiation belt systems. Interestingly, this approach yields a relatively simple function for the uppermost energy limit that depends on only the surface magnetic field strength of the system. The model predicts an energy limit for all radiation belt systems that asymptotes at 7 +/- 2 TeV (for protons and electrons), offering intriguing new insight on potential sources of galactic cosmic rays. This model is also applied to an exoplanetary system, demonstrating that the planet is likely a synchrotron emitter and showcasing the model's use for identifying candidate targets for synchrotron-emitting astrophysical systems and revealing details critical to habitability at those remote worlds.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Diffuse Astrophysical Flux from the Galactic Plane with 12.1 Years of IceCube Starting Tracks, Throughgoing Tracks and Cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has measured an isotropic astrophysical neutrino flux through various detection channels for over 12 years. IceCube has also detected neutrino emission from the Galactic plane at the 4.5$\sigma$ significance level compared to a background-only hypothesis, testing three models of Galactic diffuse emission: Fermi-LAT $\pi^0$, KRA$_{\gamma}^{5}$, KRA$_{\gamma}^{50}$. We present an analysis combining 3 detection channels: throughgoing tracks, starting tracks and cascades. The throughgoing track sample is restricted to the northern sky to reduce atmospheric backgrounds, while the starting track and cascade samples reduce the atmospheric neutrino backgrounds in the southern sky by vetoing accompanying muons. We will use this combination of event samples from 12.1 years of data to measure the Galactic neutrino spectrum in the TeV to PeV energy range and independently for multiple galactic regions in a model independent procedure. We will simultaneously measure the isotropic cosmic neutrino flux.</description>

      <title>Detecting Intermediate-mass Black Holes Using Miniature Pulsar Timing Arrays in Globular Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical models predict that intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) exist in globular clusters (GCs), but observational evidence remains elusive. Millisecond pulsars (MSPs), which are abundant in GCs and have served as precise probes for gravitational waves (GWs), offer a unique opportunity to detect potential IMBH binaries in GCs. Here, we consider the possibility of using multiple MSPs in a GC to form a miniature pulsar timing array (PTA), so as to take advantage of their correlated timing residuals to search for potential IMBH binaries in the same cluster. Our semi-analytical calculations reveal that nearby IMBH binaries around MSPs in GCs could induce microsecond-level timing residuals. In GCs like $\omega$ Centauri and M15, favorable configurations are found which could lead to the detection of binaries with mass ratios $q\gtrsim0.1$ and orbital periods of a few days. We estimate that future higher-precision timing programs could achieve $100$-nanosecond sensitivity, substantially expanding the searchable parameter space and establishing mini-PTAs as powerful detectors of IMBHs.</description>

      <title>GW231123: a Binary Black Hole Merger with Total Mass 190-265 $M_{\odot}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On 2023 November 23 the two LIGO observatories both detected GW231123, a gravitational-wave signal consistent with the merger of two black holes with masses $137^{+22}_{-17}\, M_\odot$ and $103^{+20}_{-52}\, M_\odot$ (90\% credible intervals), at luminosity distance 0.7-4.1 Gpc and redshift of $0.39^{+0.27}_{-0.24}$, and a network signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim$22.5. Both black holes exhibit high spins, $0.9^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and $0.80^{+0.20}_{-0.51}$ respectively. A massive black hole remnant is supported by an independent ringdown analysis. Some properties of GW231123 are subject to large systematic uncertainties, as indicated by differences in inferred parameters between signal models. The primary black hole lies within or above the theorized mass gap where black holes between 60-130 $M_\odot$ should be rare due to pair instability mechanisms, while the secondary spans the gap. The observation of GW231123 therefore suggests the formation of black holes from channels beyond standard stellar collapse, and that intermediate-mass black holes of mass $\sim$200 $M_\odot$ form through gravitational-wave driven mergers.</description>

      <title>Time Variation in the TeV Cosmic Ray Anisotropy with IceCube and Energy Dependence of the Solar Dipole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is an observed anisotropy in the arrival direction distribution of cosmic rays in the TeV-PeV regime with variations on the scale of one part in a thousand. While the origin of this anisotropy is an open question, a possible factor is cosmic-ray interactions with interstellar and heliospheric magnetic fields. These magnetic fields may change over time - for example, due to changes in solar activity throughout its 11-year solar cycle. The cosmic-ray anisotropy can reflect these time-dependent magnetic fields. In addition to these speculative sources, there are several known sources of time variation in this anisotropy, such as the Compton-Getting Effect from the Earth's orbital motion. We discuss a preliminary study with limited statistics of time variation undertaken by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, including a measurement of the Compton-Getting Effect as well as a general, model-independent search for other time variations. Further, we use the Compton-Getting Effect to present a preliminary measurement of the cosmic-ray spectral index as a function of energy below the knee.</description>

      <title>SDSS-V LVM: Collisionless Shocks in the Supernova Remnant RCW86</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The supernova remnant (SNR) RCW86 is among the few SNRs with Balmer-emission lines containing broad and narrow spectral components that trace fast, non-radiative shocks in partially-ionized gas.\ These are invaluable laboratories for collisionless shock physics, especially for poorly-understood phenomena like electron-ion equilibration, and shock precursors. Here we present the first $\sim$0.3 pc spatial scale integral field unit (IFU) observations of the southwestern RCW86 shock, obtained as part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V Local Volume Mapper (SDSS-V LVM). The forward shock, clearly visible as thin filaments in narrowband images, have broad H$\alpha$ components, indicating shock velocities varying from 500--900 km/s in the south to 1000--1500 km/s in the north. The varying velocity widths and broad-to-narrow intensity ratios show that electrons and ions have lower equilibration ($T_e/T_p \rightarrow 0.1$) in faster ($&gt;$800 km/s) shocks, in line with previous studies. The broad components are generally redshifted from the narrow components by $\lesssim$100 km/s, likely due to shock-obliquity or non-Maxwellian post-shock distributions. We observe high extinction-corrected Balmer-decrements of 3--5 in the narrow components, indicating that conversion of Ly$\beta$ photons to H$\alpha$ is more efficient than Ly$\gamma$ to H$\beta$. Broad HeII$\lambda$4686 was marginally ($\gtrsim$2$\sigma$) detected in the southern shock, meaning the shock is impacting gas with high ($&gt;$30--100\%) neutral fraction. We also find the first evidence of an intermediate H$\alpha$ component in RCW86, with $\Delta$V(FWHM) = 193--207 km/s, likely due to a neutral precursor. We also briefly discuss the southwestern radiative shock, and lay out the exciting future of studying astrophysical shocks with LVM.</description>

      <title>Einstein Probe discovery of the short period intermediate polar EP J115415.8-501810</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The X-ray transient source EP240309a/EP\,J115415.8$-$501810 was first detected by the Wide-Field X-ray Telescope (WXT) on board Einstein Probe (EP) during the commissioning phase. Subsequent optical observations confirmed it as a Cataclysmic Variable of the intermediate polar type with a 238.2\,s spinning white dwarf in a $\sim$3.76\,hr orbit. We report on the source discovery and follow-up studies made with the Follow-up X-ray Telescope (FXT) of EP. A periodic variation of 231\,s is detected in the 0.3$-$2\,keV band, while no obvious pulsation appears in the 2$-$10\,keV band. The spectral analysis shows that the X-ray emission could be described by an absorbed bremsstrahlung model with $kT$\textgreater\,11\,keV. The partial covering absorption, with an hydrogen column density $N_H$ = 2.0$\times 10^{22}\,\rm cm^{-2}$ and covering fraction around 0.9, is much larger than the interstellar absorption along the line of sight. According to the distance $d = 309.5$\,pc obtained from Gaia parallax, we estimate that the luminosity of this source in the 0.3$-$10\,keV range is $\sim 2\times10^{32}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$. In addition, phase-resolved spectral analysis reveals that the detected periodic variation is mainly caused by the change in the absorption column density. In this scenario the spin modulation arises due to absorption from the pre-shock accretion flow of the X-ray emitting pole, while the optical radiation is modulated at the orbital side band ($\omega_{\rm spin} - \Omega_{\rm orbit}$) due to reprocessing in regions within the binary system. Due to its unusual transient behaviour for an intermediate polar, we have also searched for radio signals similar to those observed in the new class of long period transients. We derived upper limits with ASKAP (200--300\,$\mu$Jy\,beam$^{-1}$ between 800--1500 MHz) and MWA (40--90\,mJy\,beam$^{-1}$ between 80--300 MHz).</description>

      <title>How a Klein-Nishina Modified Eddington limited accretion explains rapid black hole growth in the early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of quasars and their supermassive black holes (SMBHs) over $10^{9} M_{\odot}$ merely hundreds of millions of years after the Big Bang generates tension with the idea of Eddington-limited accretion and pressures the community into exploring the concept of massive black hole seeds and/or super-Eddington accretion. The observation that many black holes have reached supermassive status while obeying the Eddington limit is puzzling as accretion models are not spherically symmetric. We address this issue by illustrating the physics behind a picture of inner disk accretion involving a geometrically thick, hot quasi-spherical flow and argue that such an inner region provides the radiation that instantiates the Eddington limit. Given the energetics of the inner disk edge, we show how the characteristic electron cross-section drops below its Thomson value, allowing black holes to grow rapidly despite being Eddington-limited. Indeed, after implementing a modified cross-section calculated via the Klein-Nishina Formula, we find that SMBH formation time drops by up to $47\%$. In this context, we show how a $10^{9} M_{\odot}$ black hole can form from a seed $10 M_{\odot}$ black hole within $500$ Myr by way of accretion and mergers. While our picture is over-simplified and contrived in a number of ways that we discuss, we suggest that our scenario is interesting in that it offers a solution to two issues at the intersection of astrophysics and cosmology, namely the reason the Eddington limit is obeyed and how some black holes have grown rapidly despite that limit.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical neutrino flux measurement and search for tau neutrino induced cascades with 11 years of IceCube data</title>

Abstract: IceCube measured the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux for all flavors up to PeV energies. The high energy (TeV-PeV) IceCube cascade sample is particularly effective at selecting electron and tau neutrinos. We present the results of Single Power Law (SPL) and Broken Power Law (BPL) flux measurements based on 11 years of cascade data. From this cascade sample, we study the identification of high energy (~100 TeV) tau neutrinos by detecting a double cascade signature produced by a charged-current neutrino interaction and the subsequent decay of the tau lepton. A Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) is employed to search for the double cascade signature, achieving a significantly improved signal-to-background ratio of 9:1 compared to previous analyses. The selected sample has a tau-neutrino purity of approximately 90% and a weighted mean reconstruction error on the tau decay length of about 4m. We present sensitivities for a maximum likelihood fit of the flavor composition and constraints on the astrophysical neutrino flavor ratios using this sample in combination with IceCube's northern muon neutrino-induced track sample.</description>

      <title>Ion-rich acceleration during an eruptive flux rope event in a multiple null-point configuration</title>

Abstract: We report on the $\gamma$-ray emission above 100~MeV from the GOES M3.3 flare SOL2012-06-03. The hard X-ray (HXR) and microwave emissions have typical time profiles with a fast rise to a well-defined peak followed by a slower decay. The $&gt;$100~MeV emission during the prompt phase displayed a double-peaked temporal structure with the first peak following the HXR and microwaves, and the second one, about three times stronger, occurring $17 \pm 2$ seconds later. The time profiles seem to indicate two separate acceleration mechanisms at work, where the second $\gamma$-ray peak reveals a potentially pure or at least largely dominant ion acceleration. The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly imaging shows a bright elliptical ribbon and a transient brightening in the north-western (NW) region. Nonlinear force-free extrapolations at the time of the impulsive peaks show closed field lines connecting the NW region to the south-eastern part of the ribbon and the magnetic topology revealed clusters of nulls. These observations suggest a spine-and-fan geometry, and based on these observations we interpret the second $\gamma$-ray peak as being due to the predominant acceleration of ions in a region with multiple null points. The $&gt;$100 MeV emission from this flare also exhibits a delayed phase with an exponential decay of roughly 350 seconds. We find that the delayed emission is consistent with ions being trapped in a closed flux tube with gradual escape via their loss cone to the chromosphere.</description>

      <title>Investigating field burial by magnetically confined accretion mounds on Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the problem of magnetic confinement of accreted matter forming an accretion mound near the magnetic poles of a neutron star. We calculate the magnetic field geometry of the accreted mound by solving the magnetostatic Grad Shafranov (GS) equation in radially stretched spherical coordinates with high resolution and an extended domain. In this work, we propose a new physically motivated multipolar current free boundary condition at the outer radial boundary. We have evaluated a large suite of GS solutions for different neutron star magnetic fields and mound configurations. We find that with sufficient resolution, the ring-shaped mound profiles spread latitudinally on the neutron star surface, towards the equator, with a potential decline in dipole moment at outer radii, demonstrating the onset of field burial. A higher latitudinal spread towards the equator leads to more effective magnetic field burial. Along with the ring-shaped mound profile on a hard crust majorly used in this work, we also model mounds formed on a pre-existing ocean, which is more physically motivated. Additionally, we explore different GS solutions for a quadru-dipolar surface magnetic field. We find that such configurations lead to asymmetric polar mounds. We discuss the validity of such solutions for different relative strengths of the quadrupole and dipolar components.</description>

      <title>Recent Highlights from the Auger Engineering Radio Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) consists of 153 autonomous antenna stations deployed over 17 km^2 to measure the radio emission from extensive air showers initiated by cosmic rays with energies between 0.1 and 10 EeV in the 30 to 80 MHz frequency band. It operates in coincidence with the other detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory particularly the Surface Detector (SD) and the Fluorescence Detector (FD). As the largest cosmic-ray radio detector worldwide before the recent Observatory upgrade AugerPrime, AERA has played a pioneering role in the development of radio technique for cosmic rays, providing complementary measurements and serving as a testbed for ideas that motivated the build-up of a new Radio Detector (RD) as part of AugerPrime. We report on measurements of the depth of the shower maximum using the radio footprint, demonstrating compatibility and competitive resolution with established FD results. An absolute calibration of AERA is achieved by monitoring the sidereal modulation of the diffuse Galactic radio emission for nearly a decade, confirming the long-term stability of a radio detector with no significant aging effects observed. This stability suggests that radio detectors could also be used to monitor potential aging effects in other detector systems. Additionally, we investigate the muon content of inclined air showers using hybrid SD-AERA events. Our results indicate that the muon content in measured data is consistent with expectations for iron nuclei as predicted by current-generation hadronic interaction models, confirming the well-known muon deficit for the first time with radio data. These findings reinforce the value of radio detection for cosmic-ray studies and provide a foundation for the next generation of analyses with the AugerPrime RD.</description>

      <title>Limits on WIMP-Scattering Cross Sections using Solar Neutrinos with Ten Years of IceCube Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although dark matter (DM) comprises 84\% of the matter content of the Universe, its nature remains unknown. One broad class of particle DM motivated by extensions of the Standard Model (SM) is weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). Generically, WIMPs will scatter off nuclei in large celestial bodies such as the Sun, thus becoming gravitationally bound. Subsequently, WIMPs can annihilate to stable SM particles, ultimately releasing most of their energy as high-energy neutrinos which escape from the Sun. Thus, an excess of neutrinos from the Sun's direction would be evidence for WIMPs. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is well-suited to such searches since it is sensitive to WIMPs with masses in the region preferred by supersymmetric extensions of the SM. I will present the results of IceCube's most recent solar WIMP search, which includes all neutrino flavors, covers the WIMP mass range from 20 GeV to 10 TeV, and has world-leading sensitivity over this entire range for most channels considered.</description>

      <title>Simulation and Performance Studies for the Tau Air-Shower Mountain-Based Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While IceCube's detection of astrophysical neutrinos at energies up to a few PeV has opened a new window to our Universe, much remains to be discovered regarding these neutrinos' origin and nature. In particular, the difficulty of differentiating electron- and tau-neutrino charged-current (CC) events limits our ability to measure precisely the flavor ratio of this flux. The Tau Air-Shower Mountain-Based Observatory (TAMBO) is a next-generation neutrino observatory capable of producing a high-purity sample of tau-neutrino CC events in the energy range from 1 PeV--100 PeV, i.e. just above the IceCube measurements. An array of water Cherenkov tanks and plastic scintillators deployed in the Colca Canyon will observe the air-shower produced when a tau lepton, produced in a tau-neutrino CC interaction, emerges from the opposite face and decays in the air. In this contribution, I will present the performance studies for TAMBO -- including the expected rates, effective areas, and discrimination potential -- as well as the simulation on which these studies are based.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Diffusion of $e^\pm$ in Pulsar Halos over Multiple Coherence of Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The slow particle diffusion in pulsar halos, inferred from TeV gamma-ray surface brightness profiles, is attributed to cross-field diffusion under the anisotropic diffusion model. This model assumes sub-Alfv\'enic interstellar turbulence in the surrounding medium of the pulsar and a rough alignment of the line-of-sight of observers towards the pulsars with the local mean magnetic field direction in the halo. In this model, the expected morphology of a pulsar halo is highly dependent on the properties of the interstellar magnetic field. We investigate the anisotropic diffusion of electron-positron pairs across multiple coherence of magnetic fields in pulsar halos in this work. We focus particularly on their influences on the predicted gamma-ray surface brightness profile and the asymmetry of the halo's morphology, as well as the observational expectations by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). Our results indicate that the requirement of a specific magnetic field geometry can be alleviated when accounting for a limited (and realistic) coherence length of the magnetic field in the model. Also, the halo's morphology may appear less asymmetric, especially after being smoothed by the point spread function of instruments. It largely relaxes the tension between the asymmetric morphology of halos predicted by the model and lack of apparent asymmetric halos detected so far. Our findings demonstrate the important influence of the coherence length of interstellar magnetic field on the distribution of particles around their accelerators, and the consequence on the measured source morphology.</description>

      <title>A thermonuclear supernova interacting with hydrogen- and helium-deficient circumstellar material. SN 2020aeuh as a SN Ia-CSM-C/O?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the progenitors of thermonuclear supernovae (Type Ia supernovae; SNe Ia) remains a key objective in contemporary astronomy. The rare subclass of SNe Ia that interacts with circumstellar material (Type Ia-CSM) allows for studies of the progenitor's environment before explosion, and generally favours single-degenerate progenitor channels. The case of SN Ia-CSM PTF11kx clearly connected thermonuclear explosions with hydrogen-rich CSM-interacting events, and the more recent SN 2020eyj connected SNe Ia with helum-rich companion progenitors. Here we present a study of SN 2020aeuh, a Type Ia-CSM with delayed interaction. We analyse photometric and spectroscopic data that monitor the evolution of SN 2020aeuh and compare its properties with those of peculiar SNe Ia and core-collapse SNe. At early times, the evolution of SN 2020aeuh resembles a slightly overluminous SN Ia. Later, the interaction-dominated spectra develop the same pseudocontinuum seen in Type Ia-CSM PTF11kx and SN 2020eyj. However, the later-time spectra of SN 2020aeuh lack hydrogen and helium narrow lines. Instead, a few narrow lines could be attributed to carbon and oxygen. We fit the pseudobolometric light curve with a CSM-interaction mode, yielding a CSM mass of 1-2 M$_{\odot}$. We propose that SN 2020aeuh was a Type Ia supernova that eventually interacted with a dense medium which was deficient in both hydrogen and helium. Whereas previous SNe Ia-CSM constitute our best evidence for nondegenerate companion progenitors, the CSM around SN 2020aeuh is more difficult to understand. We include a hydrodynamical simulation for a double-degenerate system to showcase how the dynamical evolution of such a progenitor scenario could produce the CSM observed around SN 2020aeuh. It is clear that SN 2020aeuh challenges current models for stellar evolution leading up to a SN Ia explosion.</description>

      <title>A survey for radio pulsars and transients in the 10 pc region around Sgr A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we report on a new survey for pulsars and transients in the 10 pc region around Sgr A* using the Effelsberg radio telescope at frequencies between 4 to 8 GHz. Our calibrated full-Stokes data were searched for pulsars and transients using PulsarX, TransientX and PRESTO. Polarisation information is used in the scoring of the candidates. Our periodicity acceleration and jerk searches allowed us to maintain good sensitivity towards binary pulsars in $\gtrsim$ 10-hr orbits. In addition we performed a dedicated search in linear polarisation for slow transients. While our searches yielded no new discovery beyond the redetection of the magnetar SGR J1745-2900, we report on a faint single pulse candidate in addition to several weak periodicity search candidates. After thoroughly assessing our survey's sensitivity, we determined that it is still not sensitive to a population of millisecond pulsars. Next generation radio interferometers can overcome the limitations of traditional single-dish pulsar searches of the Galactic Centre.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an update on the arrival-direction analyses conducted on intermediate angular scales using the complete Phase I data of the Pierre Auger Observatory up to the end of $2022$ with a total exposure of $135{,}000\,\text{km}^2\,\text{sr}\,\text{yr}$. We show the arrival-direction distribution of the ultra-high-energy cosmic rays along the supergalactic plane above $20\,\text{EeV}$, and an update in the search for magnetically-induced signatures in the arrival directions. Furthermore, we present the potential of introducing estimators for the rigidity ordering of the events to enhance arrival-direction analyses on small to intermediate angular scales. To achieve this, we take advantage of two estimators working on the response of the surface detector: an analytical fit based on air-shower universality and a deep neural network.</description>

      <title>A composition-informed search for large-scale anisotropy with the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large-scale dipolar structure in the arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with energies above $8\,$EeV observed by the Pierre Auger Collaboration is a well-established anisotropy measurement. This anisotropy is understood to be of extragalactic origin, as the maximum of the dipolar component is located ${\sim}115^\circ$ away from the Galactic Center. Cosmic rays interact with background radiation and magnetized regions on their path from their sources to Earth. These interactions, which depend on the cosmic-ray energy, charge and mass composition, give rise to different horizons and deflections that are expected to lead to different anisotropies in the arrival directions of cosmic rays at Earth. The Auger Collaboration has determined that the mass composition of cosmic rays at ultra-high energies is mixed, becoming increasingly heavier as a function of energy. Thus, different dipole amplitudes are expected to be measured at a given energy when separating the data into composition-distinct subsets of lighter and heavier elements.
  In this contribution, we investigate the composition signature on the large-scale anisotropy taking advantage of composition estimators obtained from the data gathered with the surface detector. A way of probing for composition signatures in anisotropy patterns is then to divide the data into subsets of ``lighter'' and ``heavier'' elements per energy bin. In a simulation library, we evaluate the possibility of measuring a separation in total dipole amplitude between two such populations of the measured dataset under a source-agnostic model. We present the results using two different composition estimators, one based on air-shower universality and one inferred with deep learning.</description>

      <title>Prospects for sub-GeV astrophysical neutrino detection with IceCube</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is currently the largest and most sensitive detector for astrophysical neutrinos and has pioneered the field of high-energy neutrino astronomy. Despite being designed with the primary goal of identifying astrophysical TeV neutrinos and their corresponding sources, recent studies, utilising the DeepCore subdetector, have shown IceCube's proficiency in being sensitive to astrophysical neutrinos at GeV energies. Currently, there is a gap in sensitivity between the supernova detection system at MeV energies and the lowest-energy triggering events around 1 GeV. In this contribution, we present the ongoing efforts to cover this gap and increase the sensitivity of IceCube to sub-GeV astrophysical neutrinos. Despite high background rates, we show how the complimentary use of manifold and supervised machine learning can make IceCube sensitive to neutrinos from transient sources down to energies of 100 MeV.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the cosmic-ray energy spectrum above 2.5 EeV using 19 years of operation of the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the spectrum of cosmic rays with energies above 2.5 EeV measured at the Pierre Auger Observatory after 19 years of operation, covering the period before the AugerPrime upgrade. Two independent event sets from the surface array of 1500 m-spaced detectors are combined, yielding a total exposure of approximately 100,000 km$^2$ sr yr. The first set includes events with zenith angles less than 60$^\circ$, while the second consists of events between 60$^\circ$ and 80$^\circ$, for which azimuthal asymmetries must be accounted for in the energy estimator. The threshold energy is chosen to ensure a trigger efficiency of the surface detector greater than 97%, thus minimizing composition biases. The energy scale is determined using high-quality fluorescence measurements, providing calorimetric estimates without reliance on simulations.
  A statistically successful combination is achieved within the uncorrelated systematic uncertainties of the individual spectra. All spectra are consistent when analyzing potential declination dependences, except for a mild modulation expected from the previously reported dipolar anisotropy. In particular, this statement applies to the northernmost declination band [+25$^\circ$,+45$^\circ$], where only contribute events with zenith angles between 60$^\circ$ and 80$^\circ$. Beyond the firmly established ankle and suppression spectral features, the combined spectrum across declinations $-90^\circ$ to +45$^\circ$ provides high-precision measurements of the instep feature with more than 5$\sigma$ confidence.</description>

      <title>Observation of the Shadows of the Moon and Sun Using the Pierre Auger Observatory at an Average Energy of $7\times10^{17}\,$eV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of cosmic rays with celestial bodies such as the Moon or the Sun produces a shadow in the arrival direction distribution of the cosmic rays reaching the Earth. Such deficits from an isotropic flux have been observed by astroparticle observatories below energies of $10^{15}\,$eV. Above this energy, measurements were limited due to the low number of events as a result of the steeply falling cosmic-ray flux with energy. With more than 10.6 million events recorded during 20 years of operation of the Pierre Auger Observatory, we report the first observation of the shadow of the Moon at an average energy of $7\times10^{17}\,$eV with a maximum significance above 3$\sigma$. The shadow is an end-to-end check that the celestial directions are correctly reconstructed from the air shower data, and it is used here to derive the effective angular resolution for this dataset. Additionally, we present the results of a similar study on the shadow of the Sun.</description>

      <title>XMM-Newton follow-up of two eROSITA X-ray binary candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the follow-up observations with XMM-Newton of two X-ray binary candidates identified in the first eROSITA all-sky survey data (eRASS1), 1eRASS J061330.8+160440 and 1eRASS J161201.9-464622. Based on the obtained results, in particular, the observed X-ray spectra and lack of pulsations, as well as properties of the identified optical counterparts, we conclude that both candidates are unlikely to be XRBs. Based on LAMOST optical spectroscopy and SED fit results for 1eRASS J061330.8+160440 we classify it as an M0 chromospherically active subgiant star. ZTF and TESS photometry reveal highly significant period for this object of 7.189 days, which likely attributed to starspot(s). On the other hand, SALT follow-up spectroscopy of 1eRASS J161201.9-464622 solidly classifies this source as a bright novalike cataclysmic variable (CV), the second discovered with eROSITA. A persistent 4.802 h signal is found across all three available TESS observations, and is tentatively identified as the orbital period of the binary. Follow-up high-speed photometry and time-resolved spectroscopy are required to confirm the derived orbital modulation.</description>

      <title>Spectra for the Vacuum Cherenkov Effect in Astrophysical Electromagnetic Cascades with Lorentz Invariance Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance violation is a feature of several quantum gravity models in which Lorentz symmetry is broken at high energies, possibly leading to changes in particle behavior and interactions. In this work, we investigate vacuum Cherenkov radiation, a reaction in which an electron spontaneously emits a photon. This process, forbidden when Lorentz symmetry is unbroken, is a phenomenological consequence of some quantum gravity models. We derive, for the first time, the spectra for the vacuum Cherenkov reaction, and confirm our results numerically. These results can be used to derive limits on Lorentz invariance violation.</description>

      <title>Precision spectral measurements of Chromium and Titanium from 10 to 250 GeV$/n$ and sub-Iron to Iron ratio with the Calorimetric Electron Telescope on the ISS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Calorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET), in operation on the International Space Station since 2015, collected a large sample of cosmic-ray (CR) iron and sub-iron events over a wide energy interval. In this paper we report an update of our previous measurement of the iron flux and we present - for the first time - a high statistics measurement of the spectra of two sub-iron elements Cr and Ti in the energy interval from 10 to 250 GeV/n. The analyses are based on 8 years of data. Differently from older generations of cosmic-ray instruments which, in most cases, could not resolve individual sub-iron elements, CALET can identify each nuclear species from proton to nickel (and beyond) with a measurement of their electric charge. Thanks to the improvement in statistics and a more refined assessment of systematic uncertainties, the iron spectral shape is better resolved, at high energy, than in our previous paper and we report its flux ratio to chromium and titanium. The measured fluxes of Cr and Ti show energy dependences compatible with a single power law with spectral indices $-2.74 \pm 0.06$ and $-2.88 \pm 0.06$, respectively.</description>

      <title>The IceCube Collaboration -- Contributions to the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC2025)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube Observatory at the South Pole has been operating in its full configuration since May 2011 with a duty cycle of about 99%. Its main component consists of a cubic-kilometer array of optical sensors deployed deep in the Glacial ice designed for the detection of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos. A surface array for cosmic ray air shower detection, IceTop, and a denser inner subdetector, DeepCore, significantly enhance the capabilities of the observatory, making it a multipurpose facility. This list of contributions to the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference in Geneva, Switzerland (July 15-24, 2025) summarizes the latest results from IceCube covering a broad set of key questions in physics and astrophysics. The papers in this index are grouped topically to highlight IceCube contributions related to high-energy neutrino and multi-messenger astrophysics, atmospheric fluxes, cosmic-ray physics, low-energy neutrino transients, physics beyond the Standard Model, detector calibration and event reconstruction, and the status and performance of the IceCube Upgrade, a dense sensor infill complemented by calibration devices to be deployed by the end of 2025. Contributions related to IceCube-Gen2, the planned future extension of IceCube, are available in a separate collection.</description>

      <title>The role of dissipation distance on reconnection-driven multi-messenger signals from blazar jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blazars are characterized by relativistic jets that are closely aligned with our line of sight. This results in relativistic beaming, making blazars among the most luminous extragalactic sources across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to gamma-rays and, potentially, in high-energy neutrinos. We present a comprehensive study of multi-messenger emission from blazar jets powered by magnetic reconnection occurring at varying distances from the supermassive black hole (SMBH). By generalizing previous models, we explore how the emission characteristics depend self-consistently on the spatial evolution of key jet properties, including magnetization, bulk Lorentz factor, and external photon fields (accretion disc, broad-line region, and dusty torus). Using numerical simulations, we examined the impact of the initial jet magnetization, particle acceleration efficiency, jet-to-accretion power ratio, and mass accretion rate on the broadband photon spectra and neutrino emission. Our findings reveal distinct emission regimes characterized by different dominant radiative processes: synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton dominate closer to the SMBH where magnetization is high, while external Compton (EC) processes become significant near the broad-line region (BLR). Neutrino production efficiency is highest upstream of the BLR, driven by enhanced photon target densities from synchrotron and external photons available for photopion interactions, whereas the proton particle distribution is hard. Our model predictions are compared with observations of gamma-ray luminosities and synchrotron peak energies of Fermi-detected blazars, highlighting magnetic reconnection as a potential mechanism driving both electromagnetic and neutrino emissions in astrophysical jets.</description>

      <title>Advances in reconstructing the cosmic-ray energy spectrum with IceTop</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceTop array at the surface of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory measures extensive air showers produced by cosmic-ray particles with energies from PeV up to EeV, covering the transition region from galactic to extragalactic sources. This contribution presents significant improvements that will enhance the measurement of the cosmic-ray energy spectrum. (I) To analyze more than a decade of data with increasing snow overburdens on the detector, an improved method to handle the time-dependent attenuation of the detector signals was developed. (II) New analysis cuts have been developed to increase the measured event rate while improving the reconstruction quality. (III)~A~new reconstruction method that separately fits the electromagnetic and muonic components, while incorporating data from the deep in-ice detector, enables the reconstruction of air showers with cores outside the IceTop array, up to zenith angles of 50{\deg}. These improvements will significantly increase the event statistics and extend the IceTop spectrum towards higher energies.</description>

      <title>IceCube searches for GeV neutrino counterparts associated with high-energy starting events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the astrophysical neutrino flux observed by IceCube is largely unknown. To help decipher its astrophysical origin, we propose an IceCube analysis that conducts follow-up searches for GeV neutrinos associated with neutrino events above 60 TeV, which are known to have a high probability to be of astrophysical origin. It could not only identify a new component of the astrophysical neutrino flux, but also characterize how its spectrum extrapolates from GeV to PeV energies. This would in turn give valuable insights into the internal processes of neutrino sources. Astrophysical transients, such as collapsars, have been proposed as sources of time-correlated GeV- and high-energy neutrinos. Conducting this search in such short time scales allows for a substantial reduction in the dominant background rate for GeV neutrino candidate events. We introduce the statistical method and sensitivity of this search as well as dedicated data quality checks. None of the searches yield statistically significant results, and we present the first limits on GeV neutrino emission associated to VHE neutrino events at short time scales.</description>

      <title>Unambiguous GeV gamma-rays from molecular clouds illuminated by particles diffusing from the adjacent supernova remnant G335.2+0.1 that is confined in an expanding bubble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of GeV gamma-ray emission likely associated with supernova remnant (SNR) G335.2+0.1 and the finding of a molecular cloud ($\sim20$--$30^\prime$ in angular size) that is very likely in physical contact with the SNR and responsible for the gamma-ray emission. Using the 16.8 yr Fermi-LAT data, an extended emission, with a significance of 13.5 $\sigma$ and a radius 0.24{\deg} in 0.2--500 GeV in the uniform-disk model, was found to the adjacent east of the SNR. With archival Mopra CO-line data, a large molecular clump at local-standard-of-rest velocity $\sim-48$ to $-43$ km s$^{-1}$ was revealed appearing coincident with the gamma-ray source. The SNR was found located in a cavity encircled by a 'C'-shaped ring-like molecular shell at $-45$ to $-43$ km s$^{-1}$. This morphological agreement, together with the position-velociy diagrams made along lines cutting across the cavity, suggests that the SNR was evolving in the expanding molecular bubble created by the stellar wind of the progenitor with a mass $\gtrsim 15 M_{\mathrm{sun}}$. The giant molecular cloud, visible at around $-46$ km s$^{-1}$, and the associated SNR are thus estimated to lie at a kinematic distance of 3.1 kpc, with the HI absorption taken into account. We suggest that the SNR has entered the radiative phase after the blastwave recently struck the cavity wall. With the evolutionary scenario of the SNR, we demonstrate that the gamma-ray emission reported here can be naturally interpreted by the hadronic interaction between the accelerated protons that escaped from the SNR shock and the eastern large molecular clump.</description>

      <title>Statistical Analysis of Early Spectra in Type II and IIb Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the early spectra of type II and type IIb supernovae (SNe) to explore their diversity and distinguishable characteristics. Using 866 publicly available spectra from 393 SNe, 407 from type IIb SNe (SNe IIb) and 459 from type II SNe (SNe II), we analysed H$\alpha$ and He~I 5876 A at early phases ($&lt;40$ days from the explosion) to identify possible differences between these two SN types. By comparing the pseudo-equivalent width (pEW) and full width at half maximum (FWHM), we find that the strength of the absorption component of these lines serves as a quantitative discriminator, with SNe IIb exhibiting stronger lines at all times. The most significant differences emerge within the first 10-20 days. To assess the statistical significance of these differences, we apply statistical methods and machine-learning techniques. Population density evolution reveals a clear distinction in both pEW and FWHM. Quadratic Discriminant Analysis confirms distinct evolutionary patterns, particularly in pEW, while FWHM variations are less pronounced. A combination of t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding and Linear Discriminant Analysis effectively separates the two SN types. Additionally, a Random Forest Classifier demonstrates the robustness of pEW and FWHM as classification criteria, allowing for accurate classification of newly observed SNe II and IIb based on computed classification probabilities. Applying our method to low-resolution spectra obtained from the Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient, a magnitude-limited survey, we identified 34 misclassified SNe. This revision increases the estimated fraction of SNe IIb from 4.0% to 7.26%. This finding suggests that misclassification significantly impacts the estimated core-collapse SN rate. Our approach enhances classification accuracy and provides a valuable tool for future supernova studies.</description>

      <title>Low-latency neutrino follow-up combining diverse IceCube selections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino observations are crucial for multi-messenger astronomy, but currently limited by effective area and atmospheric background. However, while other telescopes must point their limited field of view, IceCube can perform full-sky realtime follow-up of astrophysical transient sources with high uptime. For this, IceCube uses its Fast Response Analysis (FRA), which can provide results from an unbinned maximum likelihood analysis within tens of minutes of an astrophysical transient. Besides manually selected transient candidates, it also routinely scans areas of the sky compatible with gravitational wave alerts from LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA and the IceCube event singlets most likely to originate from an astrophysical source. Currently the analysis uses TeV muon neutrino candidate events whose signature permits especially precise angular reconstruction, selected and reconstructed at the South Pole and transmitted with low-latency over satellite. Recently, different event selections are also being included in IceCube analyses. These efforts include the follow-up of gravitational wave events with GeV neutrinos detected by IceCube-DeepCore and the observation of the Galactic plane with cascade events produced by all neutrino flavors. If made available on a day-scale latency, these event selections can also be used in FRAs. Moreso, multiple event samples can be combined in a Fast Response Analysis that is sensitive to a broader energy range of a neutrino transient spectrum and ensures the inclusion of all neutrino flavors. We present the analysis method and technical aspects of such an extension of the existing framework. This includes a proposed new pipeline allowing the inclusion of the more computationally-intensive reconstruction methods used by the aforementioned event selections. The extension is validated using example analyses implemented in this framework. (abbreviated)</description>

      <title>Measuring the Astrophysical Galactic Plane Neutrino Flux and Searching for Galactic PeVatrons using the IceCube Multi-Flavor Astrophysical Neutrino Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has provided new insights into the high-energy universe, in particular, unveiling neutrinos from the galactic plane. However, galactic neutrino sources are still unresolved. The recent detection of multi-PeV photons by LHAASO from the Cygnus region highlights its potential as a galactic neutrino source. Additionally, LHAASO, HAWC, and HESS have reported over forty galactic gamma-ray sources with energies above 100 TeV. Detecting neutrinos correlated with high-energy gamma-ray sources would provide compelling evidence of cosmic-ray acceleration in these galactic sources. In this work, we compile a 12.3-year, full-sky, all-flavor dataset, the IceCube Multi-Flavor Astrophysics Neutrino sample (ICEMAN). ICEMAN is the combination of three largely independent neutrino samples of different event morphologies and builds upon the previous work of the DNN-based cascade sample, Enhanced Starting Track Event Selection, and the Northern Track sample. Recent improvements in ice modeling and detector calibration are also incorporated into the cascade reconstruction. In addition to revisiting the galactic plane, we adopt two different analysis methods to search for galactic PeVatrons. First, we use a template-based approach to probe the Cygnus Cocoon region. Second, we use a point source hypothesis to find correlations between IceCube neutrinos and gamma-ray sources detected at energies greater than 100 TeV.</description>

      <title>All-flavor Time-dependent Search for Transient Neutrino Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transient sources are among the preferred candidates for the sources of high-energy neutrino emission. Intriguing examples so far include blazar flares and tidal disruption events coincident with IceCube neutrinos. Here, we report the first all-flavor, all-sky time-dependent search for neutrino sources by combining IceCube throughgoing tracks, starting tracks and cascades. Throughgoing tracks provide the best sensitivity in the Northern Sky, while cascades have worse angular resolution but yield better sensitivity in the Southern Sky than tracks. The relatively new starting tracks sample has reduced contamination from atmospheric muons. This analysis takes advantage of the strengths of each of the datasets, combining them for increased statistics and obtaining the best accessible all-sky sensitivity for transient searches. In this search, we look for unbound $E^{-\gamma}$ power-law sources, as well as $E^{-2}$ sources with low and high-energy exponential cutoffs, optimizing the sensitivity for the duration of the flares.</description>

      <title>Mining the Alerts: A Preliminary Catalog of Compact Binaries from the Fourth Observing Run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a preliminary catalog of compact binary merger candidates from the ongoing fourth observing run (O4) of Advanced LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, based on an analysis of public alerts distributed through GraceDB as of May 2025. We developed and applied methods to estimate the source-frame chirp mass for each candidate by utilizing information from public data products, including source classification probabilities, sky localizations, and observatory status. Combining our O4 analysis with previous catalogs, we provide updated estimates for the local merger rate density. For sources with chirp mass characteristic of binary neutron stars ($[1, 1.5]\,M_\odot$), we find a rate of $56^{+99}_{-40}$ $\textrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\textrm{yr}^{-1}$. For systems in the expected neutron star--black hole chirp mass range ($[1.5, 3.5]\,M_\odot$), the rate is $36^{+32}_{-20}$ $\textrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\textrm{yr}^{-1}$, and for heavier binary black holes ($[3.5, 100]\,M_\odot$), we estimate a rate of $19^{+4}_{-2}$ $\textrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\textrm{yr}^{-1}$. This work provides an early glimpse into the compact binary population being observed in O4; we identify a number of high-value candidates up to signal-to-noise $\sim 80$, which we expect to enable precision measurements in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceAct telescopes are Imaging Air Cherenkov telescopes installed as part of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the geographic South Pole. They consist of a 61 pixel camera and are small and robust to withstand the harsh environmental conditions. IceAct detects Cherenkov light produced by cosmic-ray particles with energies above approximately 10\,TeV interacting inside the atmosphere, which is complementary to the measurement of the air shower at the surface by IceTop and the high-energy muons in the deep ice. Two telescopes have been taking data since 2019 with a conservative estimated duty cycle of around 10\%. A graph neural network is used to reconstruct the basic air shower properties, like geometry and primary energy. This work focuses on the current progress in analyzing the energy spectrum of cosmic rays using IceAct data.</description>

      <title>Tidal Disruption Event Demographics in Supermassive Black Hole Binaries Over Cosmic Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) offer a unique probe of supermassive black hole (SMBH) demographics, but their observed rates remain difficult to reconcile with standard single-SMBH models. In this work, we use simulations of SMBH binaries, including the combined effects of eccentric Kozai-Lidov oscillations and two-body relaxation, to explore how TDE rates scale with SMBH mass and redshift. We find that binary systems exhibit increasing TDE rates with mass, in contrast to the declining trend expected for single SMBHs. These binary-driven rates match those observed in post-starburst galaxies, suggesting that a subset of TDE hosts may contain SMBH binaries. TDE light curves in some massive galaxies exhibit unexpectedly short durations, suggesting that the disrupting SMBH may be less massive than implied by host galaxy scaling relations, consistent with disruptions by the less massive black hole in a binary. By convolving our mass-dependent rates with the SMBH mass function, we predict redshift-dependent TDE rates, which we show can be used to constrain the supermassive black hole binary fraction. Our results provide a testable framework for interpreting TDE demographics in upcoming wide-field surveys such as LSST and Roman.</description>

      <title>A model-agnostic gravitational-wave background characterization algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors improve in sensitivity, gravitational-wave background (GWB) signals will progressively become detectable. Currently, searches for the GWB model the signal as a power law, however deviations from this model will be relevant at increased sensitivity. Therefore, to prepare for the range of potentially detectable GWB signals, we propose an interpolation model implemented through a transdimensional reverse-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm. This interpolation model foregoes a specific physics-informed model (of which there are a great many) in favor of a flexible model that can accurately recover a broad range of potential signals. In this paper, we employ this framework for an array of GWB applications. We present three dimensionless fractional GW energy density injections and recoveries as examples of the capabilities of this spline interpolation model. We further demonstrate how our model can be implemented for hierarchical GW analysis on $\Omega_{\rm GW}$.</description>

      <title>newASTROGAM -- The New MeV to GeV Gamma-ray Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: newASTROGAM is a breakthrough mission concept for the study of the non-thermal Universe from space with gamma rays in the energy range from 15 keV to 3 GeV. It is based on advanced space-proven detector technologies, which will achieve unprecedented sensitivity, angular and energy resolution combined with polarimetric capability. Since the MeV gamma-ray energy range is the most under-explored electromagnetic window to the Universe, a mission in this energy range can for the first time sensitively address fundamental astrophysics questions connected to the physics of compact objects and merger events, jets and their environments, supernovae and the origin of the elements, potentially constrain the nature of dark matter and many more science objectives. The mission will detect and follow-up many of the key sources of multi-messenger astronomy in the 2040s.
  newASTROGAM provides an unprecedentedly broad energy coverage from keV to GeV energies. The payload concept consists of a Silicon tracker combined with a crystal calorimeter. Both detectors are surrounded by an anti-coincidence detector to reject charged cosmic rays. In addition, a thin X-ray coded mask provides very good imaging capabilities. Such a mission can uniquely detect gamma rays via the photoelectric effect, Compton scattering and electron-positron pair production. newASTROGAM is proposed to the ESA call for medium-class mission ideas (M8).</description>

      <title>Evidence of .Ia Supernova Detonations in 3D Hydrodynamical Simulations of Double Degenerate Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report detailed 3D simulations of 1.1 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ Oxygen-Neon (ONe) white dwarfs (WDs) merging with a 0.35 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ helium WD, conducted with the moving-mesh hydrodynamic code AREPO. The simulations utilise self-consistent chemical profiles for the primary WD which were generated by a stellar evolution code incorporating the effects of semi-degenerate carbon burning. We find that a helium detonation is ignited at the base of the helium layer, starting a thermonuclear runaway which encircles the WD and ejects material as a sub-luminous supernovae. Our canonical simulation, (C-120), ejects 0.103 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ of primarily $^{4}\mathrm{He}$, $^{28}\mathrm{Si}$, and $^{32}\mathrm{S}$, after which the primary begins accreting again from the surviving secondary. Our results depend qualitatively on the "inspiral time" simulation parameter, which describes the length of a period of accelerated angular momentum loss. For example, the binary does not survive when inspiral time is too long. We compare the results using our self-consistent chemical profiles to a constant-composition WD structure and find the same explosion pattern when the inspiral time is short. However, we are able to obtain a typical Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) which destroys the primary by using the constant-composition structure and long inspiral. The shock-convergence in this simulation follows the "x-scissor mechanism" described by Gronow et al. in 2020, and causes a secondary detonation due to higher temperatures and higher number density of $^{12}\mathrm{C}$ at the convergence site. These results highlight the potential for unrealistic outcomes when conducting simulations that incorporate unrealistically large enhancements in angular momentum losses and (or) non-realistic chemical structures for the primary WD.</description>

      <title>Defining eccentricity for spin-precessing binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standardizing the definition of eccentricity is necessary for unambiguous inference of the orbital eccentricity of compact binaries from gravitational wave observations. In previous works, we proposed a definition of eccentricity for systems without spin-precession that relies solely on the gravitational waveform, is applicable to any waveform model, and has the correct Newtonian limit. In this work, we extend this definition to spin-precessing systems. This simple yet effective extension relies on first transforming the waveform from the inertial frame to the coprecessing frame, and then adopting an amplitude and a phase with reduced spin-induced effects. Our method includes a robust procedure for filtering out spin-induced modulations, which become non-negligible in the small eccentricity and large spin-precession regime. Finally, we apply our method to a set of Numerical Relativity and Effective One Body waveforms to showcase its robustness for generic eccentric spin-precessing binaries. We make our method public via Python implementation in \texttt{gw\_eccentricity}.</description>

      <title>The Optical Sensor for IceCube-Gen2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An innovative optical module (OM) with segmented light-sensitive area has been developed for IceCube-Gen2 that will take neutrino astronomy at the South Pole to the next level. It builds on the successful features of the mDOM and D-Egg modules of IceCube Upgrade while adapting to the smaller borehole diameter of IceCube-Gen2. The newly developed OM, which is being tested in IceCube Upgrade, serves as a prototype for the planned mass production of about 10,000 OMs for IceCube-Gen2. To simplify the assembly process, important changes were made to the design, in particular to integrate the new gel pad concept. This replaces the 3D-printed support structure of the mDOM while maintaining through total internal reflection the increased light collection efficiency of the reflector rings. In addition, the design features local generation of high voltage for each photomultiplier tube (PMT) via a Cockcroft-Walton circuit and the full digitization of the signal on each PMT base with a sampling rate of 60 MSpS. This significantly reduces the complexity of the mainboard so that it fits into the limited space available. This article describes the development status and presents the performance of the first prototypes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A precise understanding of the optical properties of the instrumented Antarctic ice sheet is crucial to the performance of optical Cherenkov telescopes such as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and its planned successor, IceCube-Gen2. One complication arising from the large envisioned footprint of IceCube-Gen2 is the larger impact of the so-called ice tilt. It describes the undulation of ice layers of constant optical properties within the detector. In this contribution, we will describe the project to build a co-deployed laser dust logger. This is a device to measure the stratigraphy of impurities in the ice to derive the ice tilt. It consists of a light source that will be co-deployed with the photosensor modules, meaning it is part of the deployment string and operated during the deployment of the detector. The newly developed device will be tested during the deployment of the IceCube Upgrade in the 2025/26 austral summer to pave the way for IceCube-Gen2.</description>

      <title>Null geodesics, causal structure, and matter accretion in Lorentzian-Euclidean black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, we introduced the Lorentzian-Euclidean black hole, a static and spherically symmetric solution of vacuum Einstein equations that exhibits a change in metric signature across the event horizon. In this framework, the analysis of radial trajectories of freely falling bodies proves that the central singularity can be avoided via a mechanism we interpret as atemporality, which is responsible for the shift of the time variable from real to imaginary values.
  In this paper, we further explore this model by first examining the behavior of null geodesics. Our investigation requires a set of signature-adaptive coordinate changes that generalize the local Lorentz transformations underlying General Relativity. We find that photon orbits, like their massive counterparts, cannot traverse the event horizon, thereby strengthening the previous result on the impossibility to reach the $r=0$ singularity. Additionally, we discuss the causal structure of the spacetime, provide the corresponding Penrose diagram, and analyze the process of matter accretion in the outer region of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Plasma instability in the front of ejected energetic electrons and Type III solar radiobursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type III radio bursts are a signature of the flux of near-relativistic electrons ejected during solar flares. These bursts are frequently observed by spacecraft such as the Parker Solar Probe. It is traditionally believed that these electron beams generate Langmuir waves through the two-stream instability, which are then converted into electromagnetic waves. In this study, we revise that model by examining how the electron distribution becomes truncated due to the "time-of-flight" effect as the beam travels through a randomly inhomogeneous, and gently varying solar-wind plasma. Rather than the two-stream instability, this truncation destabilizes the distribution and leads to the generation of Langmuir waves via a linear instability; we confine our analysis to this linear regime and do not take into account the back reaction of the generated Langmuir waves on the electron distribution, which is nonlinear. The instability grows until slower electrons arrive and dampen the waves. Our qualitative analysis shows that the resulting wave intensity growth and decay closely match the intensity-time profile of observed Type III radio bursts at the fundamental frequency, supporting this modified theory.</description>

      <title>Ion acceleration in Fermi-LAT behind-the-limb solar flares: the role of coronal shock waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between the gamma-ray emission measured with Fermi-LAT and radio signatures of coronal shock waves in four behind-the-limb (BTL) solar flares. All events were associated with metric type II radio burst. Both start and end times of the radio bursts were synchronized with the gamma-ray emission. The type II bursts associated with the BTL gamma-ray flares had higher speeds and lower formation heights than those of an average sample. These findings support the notion that the highly relativistic ions that produce the gamma-rays in BTL flares are accelerated at CME-driven propagating coronal shock waves rather than in large-scale coronal loops.</description>

      <title>Chemical abundances and small-scale gas kinematics in the local star-forming galaxy NGC 2366</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed spectroscopic study of ionised gas in the nearby (~3.3Mpc) dwarf galaxy NGC 2366, a local analogue of Green Pea galaxies, based on observations with the SCORPIO-2 instrument at the Russian 6-m BTA telescope. Using scanning Fabry-Perot interferometry and long-slit spectroscopy, we examine the gas kinematics, excitation mechanisms, and chemical abundances across the disc of NGC 2366, including its prominent starburst region Mrk 71 and the companion region NGC 2363. We identified 20 regions with locally elevated Ha velocity dispersion, only four of which correspond to known high-energy sources. We argue that one of the remaining objects can be a previously unidentified Wolf-Rayet star and two - supernova remnants. For 15 HII regions, we measure electron temperatures, oxygen and nitrogen abundances via the `direct' Te method, with 12 + log(O/H) ranging from 7.6 to 8.0 in most of the regions. We show that Mrk 71 has higher oxygen abundance compared to the other \HII regions in the galaxy, contrary to the previous indirect estimates suggesting flat gradient throughout the galaxy. Together with the localized spatial variations of metallicity in the area, it is indicative of metal enrichment by the outflow from the super star cluster in the centre of Mrk 71.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Understanding R-Process Nucleosynthesis in Metal-Poor Stars and Stellar Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid neutron-capture process (r-process) is responsible for the creation of roughly half of the elements heavier than iron, including precious metals like silver, gold, and platinum, as well as radioactive elements such as thorium and uranium. Despite its importance, the nature of the astrophysical sites where the r-process occurs, and the detailed mechanisms of its formation, remain elusive. The key to resolving these mysteries lies in the study of chemical signatures preserved in ancient, metal-poor stars. In this review, we explore r-process nucleosynthesis, focusing on the sites, progenitors, and formation mechanisms. We discuss the role of potential astrophysical sites such as neutron star mergers, core-collapse supernovae, magneto-rotational supernovae, and collapsars, that can play a key role in producing the heavy elements. We also highlight the importance of studying these signatures through high-resolution spectroscopic surveys, stellar archaeology, and multi-messenger astronomy. Recent advancements, such as the gravitational wave event GW170817 and detection of the r-process in the ejecta of its associated kilonovae, have established neutron star mergers as one of the confirmed sites. However, questions remain regarding whether they are the only sites that could have contributed in early epochs or if additional sources are needed to explain the signatures of r-process found in the oldest stars. Additionally, there are strong indications pointing towards additional sources of r-process-rich nuclei in the context of Galactic evolutionary timescales. This review summarizes what has been learned so far, the challenges that remain, and the exciting prospects for future discoveries. The increasing synergy between observational facilities, computational models, and large-scale surveys is poised to transform our understanding of r-process nucleosynthesis in the coming years.</description>

Abstract: On January 14, 2025 the LIGO interferometers detected a gravitational wave from the merger of two black holes, GW250114. Using publicly available information, we estimate that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of GW250114 was $\sim 80$. This would make it three to four times louder than any other gravitational wave detected to date. GW250114 therefore offers a unique opportunity to make precise measurements of its source parameters and to test general relativity. In anticipation of its public data release, we analyze a set of simulated signals that have parameters similar to what we estimate for GW250114 and explore what new insights may be gained from this significant event.</description>

Abstract: The prompt phase X- and $\gamma$-ray light curves of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) exhibit erratic and complex behaviour, often with multiple pulses. The temporal shape of individual pulses is often modelled as 'fast rise exponential decay' (FRED). Here, we introduce a novel fitting function to quantify pulse asymmetry. We conduct a light curve and a time-resolved spectral analysis on 61 pulses from 22 GRBs detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor. Contrary to previous claims, we find that only $\sim 50\%$ of pulse lightcurves in our sample show a FRED shape, while about $25\%$ have a symmetric lightcurve, and the other $25\%$ have a mixed shape. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a clear trend: in multi-pulse bursts, the initial pulse tends to exhibit the most symmetric light curve, while subsequent pulses become increasingly asymmetric, adopting a more FRED-like shape. Additionally, we correlate the temporal and spectral shapes of the pulses. By fitting the spectra with the classical "Band" function, we find a moderate positive Spearman correlation index of 0.23 between pulse asymmetry and the low-energy spectral index $\alpha_{\max}$ (the maximum value across all time bins covering an individual pulse). Thus, during GRB light curves, the pulses tend to get more asymmetric and spectrally softer with time. We interpret this as a transition in the dominant emission mechanism from photospheric (symmetric-like and hard) to non-thermal emission above the photosphere and show that this interpretation aligns with a GRB jet Lorentz factor of the order of a few 10s in many cases.</description>

      <title>Long-lived neutron-star remnants from asymmetric binary neutron star mergers: element formation, kilonova signals and gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present 3D general-relativistic neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics simulations of two asymmetric binary neutron star mergers producing long-lived neutron stars remnants and spanning a fraction of their cooling time scale. The mergers are characterized by significant tidal disruption with neutron rich material forming a massive disc around the remnant. The latter develops one-armed dynamics that is imprinted in the emitted kilo-Hertz gravitational waves. Angular momentum transport to the disc is initially driven by spiral-density waves and enhanced by turbulent viscosity and neutrino heating on longer timescales. The mass outflows are composed by neutron-rich dynamical ejecta of mass ${\sim}10^{-3}-10^{-2}M_\odot$ followed by a persistent spiral-wave/neutrino-driven wind of ${\gtrsim}10^{-2}M_\odot$ with material spanning a wide range of electron fractions, ${\sim}0.1-0.55$. Dynamical ejecta (winds) have fast velocity tails up to ${\sim}0.8$ (${\sim}0.4$) c. The outflows are further evolved to days timescale using 2D ray-by-ray radiation-hydrodynamics simulations that include an online nuclear network. We find complete $r$-process yields and identify the production of $^{56}$Ni and the subsequent decay chain to $^{56}$Co and $^{56}$Fe. Synthetic kilonova light curves predict an extended (near-) infrared peak a few days postmerger originating from $r$-process in the neutron-rich/high-opacity ejecta and UV/optical peaks at a few hours (ten minutes) postmerger originating from weak $r$-process (free-neutron decay) in the faster ejecta components. Additionally, the fast tail of tidal origin generates kilonova afterglows potentially detectable in radio and X band on a few to ten years time scale. Quantitative effects originating from the tidal disruption merger dynamics are reflected in the multimessenger emissions.</description>

      <title>Looking into the Jet Cone of the Neutrino-Associated Very High Energy Blazar PKS 1424+240</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The acceleration process of massive particles as well as the production of very high energy (VHE) photons and neutrinos remains a fundamental challenge in astrophysics. We investigate the parsec-scale jet structure and magnetic field of the blazar PKS 1424+240, that has been selected on the basis of strong VHE gamma-ray emission and identified with one of the highest peaks in the IceCube 9-year neutrino sky. We analyze 15 GHz VLBA observations of this BL Lac object, stacking 42 polarization-sensitive images collected in 2009-2025 to enhance the signal and reveal persistent parsec-scale structure. Our observations uncover a rare scenario. The object is viewed inside the jet cone, very close to the axis of its relativistic jet, with a viewing angle of &lt;0.6 deg. This effectively maximizes Doppler boosting to values ~30 and enhances both electromagnetic and neutrino emission in the observer's direction. Based on polarimetric observations, we unambiguously detect a net toroidal component of the jet's magnetic field, indicating a current carrying jet flowing almost directly towards our line of sight. Blazars with very small jet viewing angles offer a solution to the longstanding mismatch between Doppler factors inferred from low VLBI apparent jet speed and those derived from VHE observations -- the so-called "Doppler factor crisis". We show that relativistic beaming plays the critical role in the gamma-ray and neutrino emission of blazars, with direct implications for models of their multi-messenger emission.</description>

      <title>Inferring Dense Confined Circumstellar Medium around Supernova Progenitors via Long-term Hydrodynamical Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Circumstellar interaction of supernova (SN) ejecta is an essential process in its evolution and observations of SNe have found the signature of circumstellar interaction both in the early and late evolutionary phase of SNe. In this Letter, we show that if the SN forward shock plunges into tenuous stellar wind from dense circumstellar medium (CSM) in the vicinity of the progenitor (i.e., confined CSM), the subsequent time evolutions of the SN-CSM interaction system deviates from the prediction of self-similar solution. In this case, after all of the confined CSM is swept up by the SN forward shock (roughly $10$ days after the explosion), the propagation of the shocked shell will be driven by the freely expanding ram pressure of the confined CSM component, instead of the SN ejecta. Meanwhile, the forward shock decelerates faster than the prediction of thin-shell approximation once the confined CSM component reaches homologous expansion. This lasts until the reverse shock in the confined CSM component reaches the head of the SN ejecta, leading to the restoration of the system into the evolutionary model without confined CSM, where the SN ejecta drives the expansion of the system. We also show that this peculiar evolution will be reflected in observational signatures originating from SN-CSM interaction, taking rapid decline and rebrightening of radio emission as examples. Our results shed light on the importance of taking into account the effect of initial SN-CSM interaction even when we focus on observational properties of SNe a few years after the explosion.</description>

      <title>Do multifrequency polarimetric observations of BL Lac rule out a hadronic origin for its X-ray emission?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent multifrequency polarimetric observations of the eponymous blazar BL Lac reveal an extremely large degree of polarization in the optical band (average of $25\%$, reaching $45\%$), together with a small ($\lesssim 7\%$) degree of polarization in the X-ray band. This has been interpreted as evidence that the X-rays are produced through inverse Compton emission by relativistic electrons, thus ruling out alternative models based on hadronic processes. Here we revisit the observational evidence, interpreting it in a framework where the observed radiation is entirely produced through synchrotron emission. Electrons produce the radio-to-optical component and protons produce the X-rays and the gamma-rays. We determine the jet magnetic fields from an MHD model of magnetically dominated stationary axisymmetric outflows, and show that the X-ray emission from the protons is naturally less polarized than the optical emission from the electrons. The model parameters required to reproduce the multifrequency polarimetric observations are fully compatible with blazar jets.</description>

      <title>A pipeline to search for signatures of line-of-sight acceleration in gravitational wave signals produced by compact binary coalescences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compact binary coalescences (CBCs), such as merging binary black holes (BBHs), binary neutron stars (BNSs), or neutron star black holes (NSBHs), hosted by dense stellar environments, could produce gravitational waves (GWs) that contain signatures of line-of-sight acceleration (LOSA) imparted by the environment's gravitational potential. We calculate the Post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the $(2,\,2)$ mode GW phase due to a finite LOSA, starting from the leading order at -4 PN below the quadrupole order, up to 3.5 PN above the quadrupole order. We do so for binaries whose component spins are aligned with the orbital angular momentum, as well as for binaries with non-zero tidal deformation. We implement these corrections into the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) collaboration's flagship parameter estimation (PE) software \textsc{Bilby\_tgr}. We study the systematics associated with recovering LOSAs. We find that, when the injection and recovery waveform models are identical, LOSAs are recovered as expected. We test the robustness of the pipeline against waveforms with strong higher-mode signatures or signatures of beyond-general-relativistic (beyond-GR) effects, to delimit the range of applicability of our GR-consistent quasi-circular LOSA-corrected waveforms.</description>

      <title>Advanced techniques of searching for flares of ultra-high-energy photons from point sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astrophysical flares are one of the possible prominent source classes of ultra-high-energy (UHE, $E &gt; 10^{17}$ eV) cosmic rays, which can be detected by recording clusters of extensive air showers in arrays of detectors. The search for sources of neutral particles offers distinct advantages over searching for sources of charged particles, as the former traverse cosmic distances undeflected by magnetic fields. While no cosmic-ray photons exceeding $10^{17}$ eV have been definitively detected, identifying the clustering of events in cosmic-ray data would provide compelling evidence for their existence. We compare two analysis methods for detecting direction-time clustering in UHE extensive air showers: an approach that examines multiplets, and the stacking method, which analyzes sets of doublets that are not necessarily consecutive, thus making it sensitive to multiple flares. Both techniques combine time-clustering algorithms with unbinned likelihood study. Background events (initiated by hadrons) can be more efficiently distinguished from photon-induced events (signals) by using a photon tag that employs probability distribution functions to classify each event as more likely to be initiated by either a photon or a hadron. We demonstrate that these methods can effectively distinguish between events initiated by photons and those initiated by hadrons (background), and can accurately reproduce both the number of photon events within flares and their duration. We calculate the discovery potentials, i.e., the number of events required to identify a photon flare. The methods discussed can be used to search for cosmic ray sources and/or improve limits on the fluxes of UHE photons.</description>

      <title>Black hole spectroscopy and nonlinear echoes in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14259v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory with a nonminimal coupling between the electromagnetic and scalar field, we study linear (non)radial perturbations and nonlinear radial dynamics of spherically symmetric black holes. In a certain region of the parameter space, this theory admits hairy black holes with a stable photon sphere. This has a counterpart in the effective potential of linear perturbations, featuring multiple maxima and minima. The corresponding quasinormal mode spectrum contains long-lived modes trapped in the potential cavity and the time-domain linear response displays echoes, as previously observed for horizonless compact objects. Interestingly, the black-hole dynamics in this theory can be studied at the nonlinear level. By performing fully-fledged 1+1 simulations, we show that echoes are present even when the nonlinearities are significant. To our knowledge, this is the first example of echoes appearing in a consistent theory beyond a linearized analysis. In a follow-up work we will study whether this feature is also present in the post-merger signal from black hole collisions in this theory.</description>

      <title>Cataclysmic Variables in Triples: Formation Models and New Discoveries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of cataclysmic variables (CVs) has long been modeled as a product of common envelope evolution (CEE) in isolated binaries. However, a significant fraction of intermediate-mass stars -- the progenitors of the white dwarfs (WDs) in CVs -- are in triples. We therefore investigate the importance of triple star dynamics in CV formation. Using Gaia astrometry and existing CV catalogs, we construct a sample of $\sim50$ CVs in hierarchical triples within 1 kpc of the Sun, containing main-sequence (MS) and WD tertiaries at separations of 100 - 30,000 au. We infer that at least 10% of CVs host wide tertiaries. To interpret this discovery, we evolve a population of 2000 triples using detailed three-body simulations, 47 of which become CVs. We predict that 20% of CVs in triples form without ever experiencing CEE, where the WD and donor are brought together by the eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism after the formation of the WD. These systems favor larger donor stars and longer birth orbital periods (8-20 hrs) than typical CVs. Among systems that do undergo CEE, about half would not have interacted without the presence of the tertiary. Triple formation channels both with and without CEE require initially wide inner orbits ($\gtrsim 1$ au), which in turn require larger tertiary separations to be stable. Consistent with this prediction, we find that the observed Gaia CV triples have wider separations on average than normal wide binaries selected in the same way. Our work underscores the importance of triples in shaping interacting binary populations including CVs, ultracompact binaries, and low-mass X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>Explodability criteria for the neutrino-driven supernova mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23856v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive stars undergoing iron core-collapse at the end of their evolution terminate their lives either in successful or failed supernovae (SNe). The physics of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is complex, and their understanding requires computationally expensive simulations. Using these to predict CCSN outcomes over large, densely sampled parameter spaces of SN progenitors, as is needed e.g. for population synthesis studies, is thus not feasible. To remedy this situation, we present explodability criteria that allow us to predict the final fates of stars by evaluating stellar structure variables at the onset of core-collapse. The criteria are calibrated to predictions of a semi-analytical SN model, evaluated over a set of $\sim$~3,900 heterogeneous stellar progenitors (single, binary-stripped and accretor stars). Over these, the criteria achieve an accuracy of &gt;99\% agreement with the semi-analytical model. The criteria are tested on 29 state-of-the-art 3D CCSN simulation outcomes from two different groups.
  Furthermore, we find that all explodability proxies needed for our pre-SN structure-based criteria have two distinct peaks and intervening valleys as a function of the carbon-oxygen (CO) core mass $M_\mathrm{CO}$, which coincide with failed and successful SNe, respectively. The CO core masses of explodability peaks shift systematically with metallicity, $Z$, and with timing of hydrogen-rich envelope removal by binary mass transfer. With these, we identify critical values in $M_\mathrm{CO}$ that define windows over which black holes form by direct collapse and formulate a CCSN recipe based on $M_\mathrm{CO}$ and $Z$, applicable for rapid binary population synthesis and other studies. Our explodability formalism is consistent with observations of Type~IIP, IIb/Ib and Ic supernova progenitors and partially addresses the missing Red Supergiant Problem by direct black hole formation.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass ratio inspirals around topological stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a point scalar charge in circular orbit around a topological star, a regular, horizonless soliton emerging from dimensional compactification of Einstein-Maxwell theory in five dimensions, which could describe qualitative properties of microstate geometries for astrophysical black holes. This is the first step towards studying extreme mass-ratio inspirals around these objects. We show that when the particle probes the spacetime close to the object, the scalar-wave flux deviates significantly from the corresponding black hole case. Furthermore, as the topological star approaches the black-hole limit, the inspiral can resonantly excite its long-lived modes, resulting in sharp features in the emitted flux. Although such resonances are too narrow to produce detectable dephasing, we estimate that a year-long inspiral down to the innermost stable circular orbit could accumulate a significant dephasing for most configurations relative to the black hole case. While a full parameter-estimation analysis is needed, the generically large deviations are likely to be within the sensitivity reach of future space-based gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Observation of the Crab Nebula with the Single-Mirror Small-Size Telescope stereoscopic system at low altitude</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Single-Mirror Small-Size Telescope (SST-1M) stereoscopic system is composed of two Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) designed for optimal performance for gamma-ray astronomy in the multi-TeV energy range. It features a 4-meter-diameter tessellated mirror dish and an innovative SiPM-based camera. Its optical system features a 4-m diameter spherical mirror dish based on the Davies-Cotton design, maintaining a good image quality over a large FoV while minimizing optical aberrations. In 2022, two SST-1M telescopes were installed at the Ond\v{r}ejov Observatory, Czech Republic, at an altitude of 510 meters above sea level, and have been collecting data for commissioning and astronomical observations since then. We present the first SST-1M observations of the Crab Nebula, conducted between September 2023 and March 2024 in both mono and stereoscopic modes. During this observation period, 46 hours for the SST-1M-1 and 52 hours for the SST-1M-2 were collected for which 33 hours are in stereoscopic mode. We use the Crab Nebula observation to validate the expected performance of the instrument, as evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations carefully tuned to account for instrumental and atmospheric effects. We determined that the energy threshold at the analysis level for the zenith angles below $30^\circ$ is 1 TeV for mono mode and 1.3 TeV for stereo mode. The energy and angular resolutions are approximately 20% and $0.18^\circ$ for mono mode and 10% and $0.10^\circ$ for stereo mode, respectively. We present the off-axis performance of the instrument and a detailed study of systematic uncertainties. The results of a full simulation of the telescope and its camera is compared to the data for the first time, allowing a deep understanding of the SST-1M array performance.</description>

      <title>A forecasting framework for galactic cosmic ray flux in space weather applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intensity and energy spectrum of galactic cosmic rays in the heliosphere are significantly influenced by the 11-year solar cycle, a phenomenon known as solar modulation. Understanding this effect and its underlying physical mechanisms is essential for assessing radiation exposure and associated risks during space missions. Starting from a previously developed effective predictive model of solar modulation, validated using cosmic ray flux measurements from space-based detectors such as PAMELA and AMS-02, we build a generalizable forecasting strategy for the long-term evolution of cosmic ray fluxes. This strategy is based on identifying delayed cross-correlation relationships between solar proxies and the model's parameters. It integrates recent findings on time lags between cosmic ray fluxes and solar activity, and incorporates advanced time-series signal processing techniques. The framework not only performs well in reproducing observed data, but also shows strong potential for applications in space radiation monitoring and forecasting. By efficiently capturing the long-term variability of galactic cosmic rays, our approach contributes valuable insights for evaluating radiation risks, ultimately supporting safer and more effective space exploration.</description>
