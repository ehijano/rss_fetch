      <title>Parallel Repetition for $3$-Player XOR Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a $3$-$\mathsf{XOR}$ game $\mathcal{G}$, the verifier samples a challenge $(x,y,z)\sim \mu$ where $\mu$ is a probability distribution over $\Sigma\times\Gamma\times\Phi$, and a map $t\colon \Sigma\times\Gamma\times\Phi\to\mathcal{A}$ for a finite Abelian group $\mathcal{A}$ defining a constraint. The verifier sends the questions $x$, $y$ and $z$ to the players Alice, Bob and Charlie respectively, receives answers $f(x)$, $g(y)$ and $h(z)$ that are elements in $\mathcal{A}$ and accepts if $f(x)+g(y)+h(z) = t(x,y,z)$. The value, $\mathsf{val}(\mathcal{G})$, of the game is defined to be the maximum probability the verifier accepts over all players' strategies.
  We show that if $\mathcal{G}$ is a $3$-$\mathsf{XOR}$ game with value strictly less than $1$, whose underlying distribution over questions $\mu$ does not admit Abelian embeddings into $(\mathbb{Z},+)$, then the value of the $n$-fold repetition of $\mathcal{G}$ is exponentially decaying. That is, there exists $c=c(\mathcal{G})&gt;0$ such that $\mathsf{val}(\mathcal{G}^{\otimes n})\leq 2^{-cn}$. This extends a previous result of [Braverman-Khot-Minzer, FOCS 2023] showing exponential decay for the GHZ game. Our proof combines tools from additive combinatorics and tools from discrete Fourier analysis.</description>

      <title>Efficient Online Sensitivity Analysis For The Injective Bottleneck Path Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tolerance of an element of a combinatorial optimization problem with respect to a given optimal solution is the maximum change, i.e., decrease or increase, of its cost, such that this solution remains optimal. The bottleneck path problem, for given an edge-capacitated graph, a source, and a target, is to find the $\max$-$\min$ value of edge capacities on paths between the source and the target. For this problem and a network with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, there is known the Ramaswamy-Orlin-Chakravarty's algorithm to compute all tolerances in $O(m+n\log n)$ time. In this paper, for any in advance given sample of the problem with pairwise distinct edge capacities, we present a constant-time algorithm for computing both tolerances of an arbitrary edge with a preprocessing time $O\big(m \alpha(m,n)\big)$, where $\alpha(\cdot,\cdot)$ is the inverse Ackermann function. For given $k$ source-target pairs, our solution yields an $O\big((\alpha(m,n)+k)m\big)$-time algorithm to find tolerances of all edges with respect to optimal paths between the sources and targets, while the known algorithm takes $O\big(k(m+n\log n)\big)$ time to find them.</description>

      <title>Forbidden paths and cycles in the undirected underlying graph of a 2-quasi best match graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The undirected underlying graph of a 2-quasi best match graph (2-qBMG) is proven not to contain any induced graph isomorphic to $P_6$ or $C_6$. This new feature allows for the investigation of 2-BMGs further by exploiting the numerous known results on $P_6$ and $C_6$ free graphs together with the available polynomial algorithms developed for their studies. In this direction, there are also some new contributions about dominating bicliques and certain vertex decompositions of the undirected underlying graph of a 2-qBMG.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for the ferromagnetic Potts model on expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.01923v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give algorithms for approximating the partition function of the ferromagnetic $q$-color Potts model on graphs of maximum degree $d$. Our primary contribution is a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for $d$-regular graphs with an expansion condition at low temperatures (that is, bounded away from the order-disorder threshold). The expansion condition is much weaker than in previous works; for example, the expansion exhibited by the hypercube suffices. The main improvements come from a significantly sharper analysis of standard polymer models; we use extremal graph theory and applications of Karger's algorithm to count cuts that may be of independent interest. It is \#BIS-hard to approximate the partition function at low temperatures on bounded-degree graphs, so our algorithm can be seen as evidence that hard instances of \#BIS are rare. We also obtain efficient algorithms in the Gibbs uniqueness region for bounded-degree graphs. While our high temperature proof follows more standard polymer model analysis, our result holds in the largest known range of parameters $d$ and $q$.</description>

      <title>Edge Multiway Cut and Node Multiway Cut are NP-complete on subcubic graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.12203v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Edge Multiway Cut (also called Multiterminal Cut) and Node Multiway Cut are NP-complete on graphs of maximum degree $3$ (also known as subcubic graphs). This improves on a previous degree bound of $11$. Our NP-completeness result holds even for subcubic graphs that are planar.</description>

      <title>Regenerative Ulam-von Neumann Algorithm: An Innovative Markov chain Monte Carlo Method for Matrix Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an extension of the classical Ulan-von Neumann Markov chain Monte-Carlo algorithm for the computation of the matrix inverse. The algorithm presented in this paper, termed as \emph{regenerative Ulam-von Neumann algorithm}, utilizes the regenerative structure of classical, non-truncated Neumann series defined by a non-singular matrix and produces an unbiased estimator of the matrix inverse. Furthermore, the accuracy of the proposed algorithm depends on a single parameter that controls the total number of Markov transitions simulated thus avoiding the challenge of balancing between the total number of Markov chain replications and its corresponding length as in the classical Ulam-von Neumann algorithm. To efficiently utilize the Markov chain transition samples in the calculation of the regenerative quantities, the proposed algorithm quantifies automatically the contribution of each Markov transition to all regenerative quantities by a carefully designed updating scheme that utilized three separate matrices containing the current weights, total weights, and regenerative cycle count, respectively. A probabilistic analysis of the performance of the algorithm, including the variance of the estimator, is provided. Finally, numerical experiments verify the qualitative effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Various Properties of Various Ultrafilters, Various Graph Width Parameters, and Various Connectivity Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02299v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Filters are collections of sets that are closed under supersets and finite intersections, serving as fundamental tools in topology and set theory. An ultrafilter, a maximal filter on a set, plays a crucial role in these fields by rigorously handling limits, convergence, and compactness. A connectivity system is defined as a pair (X,f) , where X is a finite set and f is a symmetric submodular function. Understanding the duality in these parameters elucidates the relationship between different decompositions and measures of a graph's complexity. In this paper, we delve into ultrafilters on connectivity systems, applying Tukey's Lemma to these systems. Additionally, we explore prefilters, ultra-prefilters, and subbases within the context of connectivity systems. Furthermore, we introduce and investigate new parameters related to width, length, and depth, enhancing our understanding of these mathematical structures.</description>
