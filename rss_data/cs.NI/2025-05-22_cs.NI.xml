      <title>Dynamic Spectrum Sharing Based on the Rentable NFT Standard ERC4907</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Centralized Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) faces challenges like data security, high management costs, and limited scalability. To address these issues, a blockchain-based DSS scheme has been proposed in this paper. First, we utilize the ERC4907 standard to mint Non-Fungible Spectrum Tokens (NFSTs) that serve as unique identifiers for spectrum resources and facilitate renting. Next, we develop a smart contract for NFST auctions, ensuring secure spectrum transactions through the auction process. Lastly, we create a Web3 spectrum auction platform where users can access idle spectrum data and participate in auctions for NFST leases corresponding to the available spectrum. Experimental results demonstrate that our NFST, designed according to the ERC4907 standard, effectively meets users' secure and efficient DSS requirements, making it a feasible solution.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Optimizing Latency for Delayed Hit Caching with Stochastic Miss Latency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Caching is crucial for system performance, but the delayed hit phenomenon, where requests queue during lengthy fetches after a cache miss, significantly degrades user-perceived latency in modern high-throughput systems. While prior works address delayed hits by estimating aggregate delay, they universally assume deterministic fetch latencies. This paper tackles the more realistic, yet unexplored, scenario where fetch latencies are stochastic. We present, to our knowledge, the first theoretical analysis of delayed hits under this condition, deriving analytical expressions for both the mean and variance of the aggregate delay assuming exponentially distributed fetch latency. Leveraging these insights, we develop a novel variance-aware ranking function tailored for this stochastic setting to guide cache eviction decisions more effectively. The simulations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed algorithm significantly reduces overall latency compared to state-of-the-art delayed-hit strategies, achieving a $3\%-30\%$ reduction on synthetic datasets and approximately $1\%-7\%$ reduction on real-world traces.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Mobile Environment for Vehicular Visible Light Communication Using Multiple LEDs and Event Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the fields of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Driving (AD), sensors that serve as the ``eyes'' for sensing the vehicle's surrounding environment are essential. Traditionally, image sensors and LiDAR have played this role. However, a new type of vision sensor, event cameras, has recently attracted attention. Event cameras respond to changes in the surrounding environment (e.g., motion), exhibit strong robustness against motion blur, and perform well in high dynamic range environments, which are desirable in robotics applications. Furthermore, the asynchronous and low-latency principles of data acquisition make event cameras suitable for optical communication. By adding communication functionality to event cameras, it becomes possible to utilize I2V communication to immediately share information about forward collisions, sudden braking, and road conditions, thereby contributing to hazard avoidance. Additionally, receiving information such as signal timing and traffic volume enables speed adjustment and optimal route selection, facilitating more efficient driving. In this study, we construct a vehicle visible light communication system where event cameras are receivers, and multiple LEDs are transmitters. In driving scenes, the system tracks the transmitter positions and separates densely packed LED light sources using pilot sequences based on Walsh-Hadamard codes. As a result, outdoor vehicle experiments demonstrate error-free communication under conditions where the transmitter-receiver distance was within 40 meters and the vehicle's driving speed was 30 km/h (8.3 m/s).</description>

      <title>PSMOA: Policy Support Multi-Objective Optimization Algorithm for Decentralized Data Replication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient data replication in decentralized storage systems must account for diverse policies, especially in multi-organizational, data-intensive environments. This work proposes PSMOA, a novel Policy Support Multi-objective Optimization Algorithm for decentralized data replication that dynamically adapts to varying organizational requirements such as minimization or maximization of replication time, storage cost, replication based on content popularity, and load balancing while respecting policy constraints. PSMOA outperforms NSGA-II and NSGA-III in both Generational Distance (20.29 vs 148.74 and 67.74) and Inverted Generational Distance (0.78 vs 3.76 and 5.61), indicating better convergence and solution distribution. These results validate PSMOA's novelty in optimizing data replication in multi-organizational environments.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Aware Remote Estimation of Multiple Markov Sources Under Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the remote estimation of multiple Markov sources over a lossy and rate-constrained channel. Unlike most existing studies that treat all source states equally, we exploit the \emph{semantics of information} and consider that the remote actuator has different tolerances for the estimation errors. We aim to find an optimal scheduling policy that minimizes the long-term \textit{state-dependent} costs of estimation errors under a transmission frequency constraint. The optimal scheduling problem is formulated as a \emph{constrained Markov decision process} (CMDP). We show that the optimal Lagrangian cost follows a piece-wise linear and concave (PWLC) function, and the optimal policy is, at most, a randomized mixture of two simple deterministic policies. By exploiting the structural results, we develop a new \textit{intersection search} algorithm that finds the optimal policy using only a few iterations. We further propose a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to compute the optimal policy without knowing \textit{a priori} the channel and source statistics. To avoid the ``curse of dimensionality" in MDPs, we propose an online low-complexity \textit{drift-plus-penalty} (DPP) algorithm. Numerical results show that continuous transmission is inefficient, and remarkably, our semantic-aware policies can attain the optimum by strategically utilizing fewer transmissions by exploiting the timing of the important information.</description>
