      <title>Unprecedented Multipoint Observation of Spatially Varying ICME Turbulence of Different Ages during October 2024 Extreme Solar Storm at 1 AU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding turbulence in interplanetary coronal mass ejections is fundamental to space plasma research and critical for assessing the impact of space weather on geospace. Turbulence governs energy cascade, plasma heating, magnetic reconnection, and solar wind magnetosphere coupling, thereby influencing both ICME evolution and geoeffectiveness. While previous event-based and statistical studies have examined ICME turbulence and its radial evolution in great detail, no significant measurements of ICME magnetic turbulence at a specific vantage point have been made using multiple observatories separated azimuthally. Here, we present the first multipoint analysis of MHD turbulence across ICME plasma regions, using four spacecraft at the Sun-Earth L1 point, separated by 80 RE along the dawn-dusk direction. Previous studies reveal that ICME shocks, sheaths, and magnetic clouds are highly non-uniform, with strong azimuthal variability. Using high-resolution magnetic field observations from ISRO's Aditya-L1, NASA's Wind and ACE, and NOAA's DSCOVR, we analyze turbulence associated with the 10th October 2024 solar storm, which triggered the second-strongest geomagnetic storm of solar cycle 25. Our results reveal significant variability and differing turbulence maturity across small separations, supported by analysis of field-aligned and perpendicular magnetic field cascades, indicating strong anisotropies. Sheath turbulence is substantially modified by shock induced energy injection. Evidence of compressible turbulence and plasma energization at the flux rope interaction region indicates that internal processes, such as magnetic reconnection, strongly influence ICME plasma evolution, highlighting pronounced spatial variability in turbulence and plasma states observed by multiple L1 monitors near Earth and underscoring their potential role in space weather impacts.</description>

      <title>Solar active region scaling laws revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The systematic variation of solar active region (AR) properties with their magnetic flux has been the subject of numerous studies but the proposed scaling laws still vary rather widely. A correct representation of these laws and the deviations from them is important for modelling the source term in surface flux transport and dynamo models of space climate variation, and it may also help constrain the subsurface origin of active regions. Here we determine active region scaling laws based on the recently constructed ARISE active region data base listing bipolar ARs for cycle 23, 24 and 25. For the area $A$, pole separation $d$ and tilt angle $\gamma$ we find scalings against magnetic flux $\Phi$ and heliographic latitude $\lambda$. Residuals from these relations are also modelled. These scaling relations are recommended for use in space climate research for the modelling of future data or missing past data, as well as for the identification of candidate rogue ARs. We confirm that the tilt angle distribution of non-Hale ARs shows a significant excess at low tilts (anti-Hale ARs). In contrast to earlier studies we show that neither the anti-Hale ARs nor non-Hales in general follow Joy's law: instead, their tilt angle distribution is best represented by vanishing mean tilt. These results are most easily reconciled with a scenario where the AR flux loops originate in the deep convective zone or below, gaining tilt during their rise under the action of the Coriolis force. A small fraction of the loops is subjected to extreme, intermittent torques resulting in either very large tilts or anti-Hale orientation. Anti-Hale ARs are suggested to be fully curled `XO-loops', and their excess is caused by a simple mechanical effect, as the contact of their legs increases resistance against further deformation by the torque.</description>

      <title>AT 2025abao: the fourth luminous red nova in M 31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of luminous red nova (LRN) AT 2025abao, the fourth discovered in M 31. The LRN, associated to the AGB star WNTR23bzdiq, was discovered during the fast rise following the minimum phase. It reached the peak at $g=15.1$ mag ($M_g=-9.5\pm0.1$ mag), and then it settled onto a long-duration plateau in the red bands, lasting 70 days, while it was slowly linearly declining in the blue bands. The object showed similarities at peak with the canonical LRNe V838 Monocerotis, V1309 Scorpii, and with the faint and fast-evolving AT 2019zhd, the third LRN in M31, though the later evolution is different. Spectroscopically, AT 2025abao evolved as a canonical LRN: the early spectra present a blue continuum with narrow Balmer lines in emission; at peak, the spectral continuum has cooled to a yellow colour, with a photospheric temperature of 6000 K. Balmer lines have weakened while absorption lines from metals (Fe I, Fe II, Sc II, Ba II, Ti II) have developed, and in particular broad (FWHM$\sim$700 km/s) from the UV Ca II H&amp;K lines. Medium- and high-resolution spectra reveal a counter-P Cygni absorption profile in H$\alpha$. Finally, late time spectra show an orange continuum ($T\sim$4000-5000 K), a return in strength of the Balmer lines and the formation of molecular absorption bands. AT 2025abao is the rare case of a LRN with detailed archival information regarding the progenitor system. For the first time, we obtained the spectral energy distribution in the infrared of the precursor of a LRN, which is consistent with that of an M giant/AGB. We propose that the dichotomy of light curve behaviour in LRNe (two peaks vs. plateau) can be explained by the extent and H-richness of the common envelope.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Break in the Specific Angular Momentum within the Envelope-Disk Transition Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observations of protostellar systems show a transition in the radial profile of specific angular momentum (and rotational velocity), evolving from $j\sim{\rm constant}$ ($v_{\phi}\sim r^{-1}$) in the infalling-rotating envelope to $j\propto r^{1/2}$ ($v_{\phi}\sim r^{-1/2}$) in the Keplerian disk. We employ global MHD disk simulations of gravitational collapse starting from a supercritical prestellar core, that forms a disk and envelope structure in a self-consistent manner, in order to determine the physics of the Envelope-Disk Transition Zone (ENDTRANZ). Our numerical results show the transition from the infalling-rotating envelope to Keplerian disk happens through a jump in the $j-r$ profile over a finite radial range, which is characterized by the positive local gravitational torques. The outer edge of the ENDTRANZ is identified where the radial infall speed ($v_r$) begins a sharp decline in magnitude and $j$ begins a transition from $j\sim{\rm constant}$ toward $j\sim r^{1/2}$. Moving radially inward, the centrifugal radius ($r_{\rm CR}$) is defined where $v_{\phi}$ first transitions to Keplerian velocity at the disk's edge. Farther inward of $r_{\rm CR}$, model disk develops a super-Keplerian rotation due to self-gravity. The inner edge of the ENDTRANZ is defined at the centrifugal barrier ($r_{\rm CB}$) where $v_r$ drops to negligible values. Inside $r_{\rm CB}$, a net negative gravitational torque drives mass accretion onto the protostar. On observational grounds, we identify a jump in the observed $j-r$ profile in L1527 IRS for the first time using the ALMA eDisk data. Comparison with the numerical radial behavior from our MHD disk simulations suggests the observed $j-r$ jump can be used as a kinematical tracer for the existence of ENDTRANZ. Our results offer insights into the observable imprint of angular momentum redistribution mechanisms during star-disk formation.</description>

      <title>Habitable Zones Around Massive Stars: From the Main Sequence to Supergiants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars dominate the radiative and mechanical feedback of young stellar populations, yet their intense ultraviolet fields and strong winds are typically presumed to preclude Earth-like habitability. We quantify this expectation by mapping time dependent habitable zones (HZs) for solar-metallicity stars with initial masses of $0.8$-$120\,M_\odot$. From rotating and non-rotating \textsc{GENEC} tracks we derive bolometric ``climate'' HZ boundaries and enforce XUV energy-limited escape and wind ram-pressure retention constraints for a dipole-magnetized Earth analogue. The operational inner edge is set by the most restrictive limit, and we measure the annulus lifetime, the longest continuous residence at fixed orbit, and the maximum number of dynamically packed terrestrial planets it can host. We find a sharp main-sequence ceiling: while a $9\,M_\odot$ star sustains an operational HZ for $\sim 30$~Myr at $\sim 70$-$130$~AU, the main-sequence annulus becomes brief and extremely narrow by $12\,M_\odot$ and disappears by $15\,M_\odot$. Post main-sequence evolution can reopen HZs up to $\sim 25$-$30\,M_\odot$, but only for $\sim 0.03$-$1.5$~Myr at hundreds to $\sim 10^3$~AU, disappearing by $\sim 40\,M_\odot$. Rotation modestly increases habitable lifetimes near the upper main sequence without altering the high mass ceiling. Initial Mass Function (IMF) weighting shows that massive stars contribute only $\sim 10^{-4}$ of the habitable planet-time budget. Even so, they still add of order a few $10^{5}$ operationally habitable Earth analogues to the Milky Way at any instant. This implies that massive star systems are unlikely to dominate the Galaxy wide habitability budget, but they may still provide a set of short-lived, observationally distinct targets for biosignature searches.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional kink modes in solar coronal slabs: group velocities and their implications for impulsively excited waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Little attention has been paid to group velocities of three-dimensional (3D) MHD waves in solar coronal seismology. This study aims to present a rather comprehensive examination on the group velocities of trapped 3D kink modes in coronal slabs, emphasizing the connection of mode analysis to both mode characterization and impulsively excited 3D kink waves. We work in linear, ideal, pressureless MHD, and take the equilibrium slab to be symmetrically structured only in one transverse direction. The dispersion relation is numerically solved, with the results understood by making in-depth analytical progress. We address both the transverse fundamental and its first overtone. We develop a three-subgroup scheme for categorizing 3D kink modes on the plane spanned by the axial and out-of-plane wavenumbers. The group ($\vec{v}_{\rm gr}$) and phase velocities ($\vec{v}_{\rm ph}$) sit on the same side of the equilibrium magnetic field ($\vec{B}_0$) for the ``$\vec{B}_0$-same-side A'' and ``$\vec{B}_0$-same-side F'' subgroups, which are further discriminated by the directional similarity of $\vec{v}_{\rm gr}$ and $\vec{B}_0$. The ``$\vec{B}_0$-straddling'' subgroup is peculiar in that $\vec{v}_{\rm gr}$ and $\vec{v}_{\rm ph}$ lie astride $\vec{B}_0$, a feature that cannot be found for waves in unbounded uniform media in pressureless MHD. This ``$\vec{B}_0$-straddling'' subgroup pertains to both the fundamental and its overtones. We further place our results in the context of impulsive waves, employing the method of stationary phase to predict the large-time wavefront morphology in the plane of symmetry of the equilibrium slab. Wavefronts directed toward $\vec{B}_0$ derive exclusively from ``$\vec{B}_0$-straddling'' modes, and are confined to narrow sectors.</description>

      <title>Superhumps and their Relation to the Disk Instability Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the discovery of superhumps in 1974, these photometric modulations have provided a crucial observational window into disk instabilities in cataclysmic variable stars, particularly the tidal instability associated with the 3:1 resonance. Over the past few decades, extensive time-resolved photometry has revealed a rich diversity of superhump-related phenomena, including delayed superhump development, early superhumps in WZ Sge-type dwarf novae, systematic stage A-B-C evolution, negative superhumps, and superhumps observed in related systems such as intermediate polars and AM CVn stars. In this invited review, we summarize key observational advances since the establishment of the thermal-tidal instability framework, discuss their theoretical interpretations within the disk instability model, and highlight remaining open problems. These developments have been driven by coordinated networks of amateur observers, wide-field robotic surveys, and continuous high-precision space-based photometry from Kepler and TESS. Together, they demonstrate that superhumps remain a powerful probe of disk dynamics, binary parameters, and the interplay between thermal, tidal, and geometric effects in accretion disks.</description>

      <title>S-PLUS: Beyond Spectroscopy IV. Stellar Parameters and Elemental-abundance Ratios for Six Million Stars from DR4 and First Results for the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine narrow/medium-band filter photometry from the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) DR4 with ultra broad-band filter photometry from Gaia EDR3 to derive fundamental stellar parameters ($T_{\rm eff}$, $\log g$, [Fe/H], ages) and elemental-abundance ratios ([C/Fe] and [$\alpha$/Fe]) for 5.4 million stars in the Galaxy (4.9 million dwarfs and 0.5 million giants), as well as for over 0.7 million red giant stars in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC). The precisions of the abundance estimates range from 0.05-0.10 dex for metallicity in the relatively metal-rich range ([Fe/H] $&gt; -1.0$) to 0.10-0.30 dex in the metal-poor regime ([Fe/H] $&lt;-1.0$), 0.10-0.20\,dex for [C/Fe], and 0.05 dex for [$\alpha$/Fe]. The stellar parameters for LMC and SMC member stars are somewhat less precise than those from the S-PLUS main survey, primarily because of the effect of high reddening. The use of both metallicity- and carbon-sensitive filters provides unbiased measurements of both [Fe/H] and [C/Fe], of particular importance for very low-metallicity ([Fe/H] $&lt; -2.0$) stars, where carbon enhancement can lead to systematically high estimates of [Fe/H] when only a single metallicity-sensitive filter is employed. Furthermore, multiple narrow-band filters enable metallicity estimates down to [Fe/H] $\sim -4.0$ with an accuracy of around 0.3 dex, exceeding the precision typically achieved by low/medium-resolution spectroscopy. This extensive photometric dataset, combined with the other three datasets in this series, will serve as a valuable legacy resource for Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds studies.</description>

      <title>I-Band Asymptotic Giant Branch (IAGB) Stars: I. Exploring a New Standard Candle for the Extragalactic Distance Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the I-band color-magnitude diagrams (CMD) of resolved nearby galaxies, the reddest asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars form a previously unremarked-upon, but nevertheless distinct and easily-identified population of high-luminosity stars. Hereafter we refer to this population as being comprised of I-Band AGB (IAGB) stars. Identifying these stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and in NGC4258 (for all three of which there are published geometric distances) we find that the marginalized luminosity functions are each well approximated by single-peaked Gaussians, having one-sigma dispersions of +/- 0.22 mag, +/- 0.25 mag and +/- 0.24 mag, respectively. The zero points for the modal I-band absolute magnitudes of IAGB stars are found to be M_I = -4.49 +/- 0.003 mag (stat) in the LMC (4204 stars), M_I = -4.67 +/- 0.008 mag (stat), for the SMC sample (916 stars), and M_I = -4.78 +/- 0.030 mag (stat) for NGC4258 (62 stars). A global average over these three independent calibrations of the IAGB zero point (weighted inversely by squares of their systematic errors) gives &lt;M_I&gt; = -4.65 +/- 0.119 mag (stat) +/- 0.025 (sys). In Paper II we will show the results of applying the IAGB Method to 92 galaxies additional galaxies resolved by HST, reaching out to distances just short of 10 Mpc.</description>

      <title>Gaia FGK Benchmark Stars: Selecting Infrared Lines for Abundance Determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of new and more powerful infrared spectrographs has significantly motivated the advancement of the study of atomic and molecular line lists and stellar atmosphere models. While optical abundance determinations rely on extensively validated line lists and modeling frameworks, infrared measurements still face larger uncertainties, largely driven by the choice of atmospheric models and the quality of the available atomic data. In this work, we aim to deliver a homogeneous and reproducible set of atomic absorption lines in the Y, J, and H bands (9800 - 18000 (Angstrom)), based exclusively on laboratory atomic data. We analyse CRIRES spectra of six Gaia FGK Benchmark Stars spanning a wide range in effective temperature, surface gravity, and chemical composition. Synthetic spectra are computed using the benchmark stellar parameters, and each transition is evaluated independently in every star through a quantitative sequence that examines line depth, saturation, blending (purity), and the agreement between observed and synthetic line profiles. We identify a set of robust atomic transitions in these bands that remain consistent across the full range of stellar parameters represented in our sample. Lines of alpha-elements such as Mg I, Si I, and Ca I, together with several Fe I transitions, satisfy all robustness criteria. Among the neutron-capture species explored, only Sr II provides lines that consistently meet our requirements. Beyond the specific list of accepted transitions, this study demonstrates that a fully quantitative, multi-criteria framework provides a transparent and reproducible foundation for near-infrared line validation as laboratory data, stellar atmosphere models, and instrumentation continue to improve.</description>

      <title>I-Band Asymptotic Giant Branch (IAGB) Stars: II. A First Estimate of their Precision and a Differential Zero Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of 92 galaxies that have a strong showing of I-band Asymptotic Giant Branch (IAGB) stars in their color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), are used to measure the relative offset between the mean apparent I-band magnitudes of the IAGB population and the corresponding apparent I-band magnitudes of the TRGB as measured in the same frames (and CMDs) of those individual galaxies. This first exploratory, large-sample comparison is independent of any extinction (foreground or internal) that may be shared by these two populations. The marginalized luminosity functions used to determine the modal value of the {\it IAGB } population are well fit by a single, symmetric Gaussian. The difference in the two apparent magnitudes (in the sense IAGB minus TRGB) is -0.589 mag, with a combined standard deviation of +/- 0.119 mag. Adopting M_I = -4.05 mag for the TRGB stars, the modal absolute magnitude of the IAGB is then calculated to be M_I(IAGB) = -4.64 +/- 0.12 mag. The ensemble dispersion quoted above gives a standard error on the mean of +/- 0.012 mag (based on the full sample of 92 galaxies). Independently, the three geometry-based zero points for I-band AGB stars are found (in Paper I) to be M_I = -4.49 +/- 0.003~mag in the LMC (4204 stars), M_I = -4.67 +/- 0.008 mag, for the SMC (916 stars) and M_I = -4.78 +/- 0.030 mag for NGC4258 (62 stars), leading to a global zero-point (weighted) average of &lt;M_I&gt; = -4.64 +/- 0.15 mag (stat). The scatter found in the anchors is comparable to the scatter in the field sample discussed here, but the calibration sample is small. The application of this method to galaxies well outside of the Local Group, shows that these standard candles can readily be found and measured out to at least 9 Mpc, using already available archival data</description>

      <title>Seismic detection of core magnetic fields in red giants using the gravity offset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields are known to efficiently redistribute angular momentum in stars. They have been recently measured in the cores of red giant stars using asteroseismology. It was shown that core magnetic fields, if unaccounted for, can bias the measurements of the gravity offset $\epsilon_g$, which is otherwise well characterised for red giants. Exploiting this bias as a way to detect magnetic fields in the cores of red giants, we wish to increase the number of magnetic field detections in red giants, but also to establish a method that could be widely applicable to all red giants. We selected 218 Kepler red giants showing abnormal measured values of $\epsilon_g$. We used robust statistical criteria based on the expected lifetime of mixed modes to identify significant modes. We then adjusted an asymptotic expression for mixed modes to the observed frequencies, taking magnetic field and rotation into account, using Bayesian inference. We then assessed the probability of magnetic field detection and measured the magnetic field intensity using stellar models for the favourable cases. We found new magnetic red giant stars with fields ranging from 34 to 260 kG. For these stars, we measured values for $\epsilon_g$ now in agreement with the expected value. Adding these new detections to those of previous studies, we showed that the mass distribution of magnetic giants is similar to that of the complete catalogue of red giants, but different from the mass distribution of red giants with suppressed dipole modes. We also found that the core rotation of magnetic red giants follows a similar distribution as red giants in general. This could either mean that the detected fields do not have a predominant impact on the redistribution of angular momentum, or that other red giants also harbour an internal field that is currently non-detectable or has not yet been detected.</description>

      <title>Infrared spectra of methane-containing ice mixtures for JWST data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Solid methane (CH$_4$) is an important molecule in interstellar and planetary environments, serving as a precursor to complex organic compounds and a potential biosignature in exoplanetary studies. Despite its significance, laboratory data on low-temperature phase of methane below 10 K remain limited.
  Aims. We aim to obtain spectra of methane in binary mixtures at 10 K and compare it to the spectra obtained at 6.7 K. These temperatures correspond to phases II and II* of pure methane and are representative of dark molecular clouds and protostars at early stages. We also aim to test the obtained data applicability to JWST data interpretation.
  Methods. Laboratory reference spectra were obtained on the ISEAge setup via FTIR spectroscopy in transmission mode. A weighted $\chi^2$ minimization is used for the fitting.
  Results. We present infrared spectra with corresponding band strengths of pure methane and binary mixtures with methane: CH$_4$:H$_2$O,CH$_4$:CO$_2$, CH$_4$:CH$_3$OH, CH$_4$:NH$_3$ at 6.7 K and 10 K showing a 20\% increase in mixtures compared to commonly used 10 K band strength value of pure methane. We also test the usability of the spectra on open JWST data by probing the spatial distribution of methane in B335. We also present additional experiments concerning the phase transition of methane between phase II* and phase II.
  Conclusions. Our results reveal distinct spectral features for methane in non-H$_2$O environments, enabling more accurate interpretation of JWST observations. The dataset of spectra, publicly available on Zenodo, can be used for fitting JWST data.</description>

      <title>Infrared period-luminosity relations of Galactic Miras based on multi-epoch photometry and the Gaia parallax uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Miras and other long-period variable (LPV) stars on the AGB follow period-luminosity (PL) relations. These relations have been difficult to study for Galactic LPVs because their distances were poorly known in the past. We aim to establish the PL relations of solar-neighbourhood Miras for several near-IR photometric bands. To this end, we used multi-epoch photometry from the DIRBE and unTimely/WISE catalogues, Gaia parallax distances, and contemporary pulsation periods obtained from optical observations of a well-selected sample of solar-neighbourhood Miras. We show that clearly defined PL relations in the nine investigated near-IR bands emerge from our data, and we report the slopes and zero-point magnitudes. We find that Galactic Miras are fainter in the near-IR than their Large Magellanic Cloud siblings. We derive average period-temperature, period-bolometric-luminosity, and period-radius relations from fits to synthetic SEDs constructed from the PL relations. By applying AGB evolutionary models, the scatter of stars around the PL sequences can also be used to test whether the parallax uncertainties quoted in the Gaia catalogue are realistic. Furthermore, we performed such tests based on a comparison with parallaxes obtained with the VLBI and with a sample of LPVs in the globular cluster 47 Tuc. We conclude that, for Galactic Miras with a fractional parallax uncertainty of &lt;0.1 in the Gaia catalogue, the parallax uncertainty is underestimated by factors between 1.0 and 1.7, and most likely by $\sim1.3$. For more uncertain parallaxes, we find evidence that the distances (parallaxes) are generally overestimated (underestimated). Nevertheless, we find strong evidence that the large error-inflation factors reported for AGB stars in the literature are unrealistic. Our results lend confidence to the parallax measurements of these highly extended, variable stars.</description>

      <title>Evidence for the merger hypothesis in V4332 Sgr: a low $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio and multiple outbursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the detections of the first extragalactic ``Luminous Red Nova'' (LRN) M31 RV in 1989, and its first Galactic counterpart V4332~Sgr in 1994, there have been many discoveries of similar, or closely related, objects. They are important because they bridge the luminosity gap between the brightest novae and supernovae, a largely unexplored parameter space. The cause of eruptions in LRNe is still unclear, a stellar merger being the most favored mechanism. However, barring V1309~Sco, there has been no direct evidence for a merger in the other objects. Here we present strong evidence that V4332~Sgr was a merger event. High resolution infrared observations of the CO fundamental band show an unusually small $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of $3.5\pm1$. This indicates that a violent event had occurred, whose effects penetrated deep enough to allow CNO cycle processed $^{13}$C in the inner H burning shell to be brought to the surface. We rule out planetary ingestion, and propose that the eruption was due to a merger between V4332~Sgr and a companion star. It is shown that V4332~Sgr was likely surrounded by an edge-on disk before its eruption. If this disk was a flattened common envelope containing V4332~Sgr and a companion star, then a merger scenario would not be inconsistent. Furthermore, V4332~Sgr had multiple outbursts, previously unreported but an important piece of information, since multiple outbursts are a trait shared by many LRNe.</description>

      <title>First detection of the TiO i1Pi-a1Delta system in stellar spectra and its laboratory characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TiO plays an important role in determining the atmospheric structure of M-type stars and in shaping the visual part of their spectra. We compute synthetic spectra for late-type M giants and identify systematic discrepancies in the wavelength range 5810-5850 A. To investigate the origin of these discrepancies, we analyse experimental TiO absorption cross-sections. We report the detection of a molecular band of the singlet system $^{1}\Pi$-a$^{1}\Delta$ of the TiO, with an R-head located at 5814.8 A, overlapping the 1-3 band of the C$^3\Delta$-X$^3\Delta$ system. The lower state of the band is identified as the a$^1\Delta$ v"=0 state, while the upper state is most likely the $^1\Pi$ in its ground vibrational state. The empirical band intensity is derived by comparing the relative strengths of neighbouring bands from the C$^3\Delta$-X$^3\Delta$ and B$^3\Pi$-X$^3\Delta$ systems in the experimental cross-section. The band intensity is further validated by synthetic spectrum calculations for the late-type giant 30 Her (M6 III) and comparison with its observed spectrum from the MELCHIORS library. The newly identified band is sufficiently strong to affect the flux distribution in the spectra of cool stars.</description>

      <title>[C/N] Ages and Extra-Mixing for [Fe/H] &lt;- 0.5: Insights from the LMC and SMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The [C/N]-age relation has become a powerful tool for reconstructing the formation history of the Milky Way (MW), providing the largest age sample for field giant stars. However, at metallicities below [Fe/H] $&lt; -0.5$, stellar surfaces are altered by a poorly understood process known as extra mixing, which modifies [C/N] in a mass- and metallicity-dependent manner. This effect complicates the application of the traditional [C/N]-age relation in metal-poor regimes. Within the MW, constraining the mass dependence of extra mixing is particularly challenging because stars at [Fe/H] $&lt; -0.5$ are predominantly old and therefore low-mass, leading to strong degeneracies between mass and metallicity. In this work, we explore the potential of the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) to disentangle these effects and constrain extra mixing as a function of age and metallicity. By comparing empirical corrections calibrated in the MW with predictions from thermohaline mixing models, we isolate the mass dependence of extra mixing in the MCs down to [Fe/H] $\sim-0.7$. We find that the empirical calibration performs well for lower-mass stars ($&lt; 1.25$ $M_{\odot}$), while theoretical models successfully reproduce the observed mass dependence down to $\sim$ 1.25 $M_{\odot}$. We further present the first observational evidence that extra mixing becomes ineffective above $\sim$ 1.8 $M_{\odot}$ at [Fe/H] $\sim -0.7$. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of deriving [C/N]-based ages for individual stars in external galaxies. Future observations targeting higher-$\log g$ or fainter stars in the MCs will provide stronger constraints on extra-mixing processes and enable the calibration of [C/N]-age relation that can be applied to low-metallicity individual stars in the MW or external galaxies.</description>

      <title>The radial velocity curve for HeII emission cannot be used for component mass determination in SS433</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: More than 150 measurements of the HeII 4686A emission line in spectra of SS433 were obtained during 388 nights in 2020-2025 with the Transient Double-beam Spectrograph on the 2.5 m telescope of Caucasian Mountain Observatory of Sternberg Astronomical Institute. We found that the HeII emission line formation region is not eclipsed and is significantly larger than both the donor star and the photosphere of the supercritical accretion disk. The HeII radial velocity curve was found to be independent of the precessional phase and inconsistent with the photometric curve. These findings suggest that the HeII line does not reflect the orbital motion of the compact object. Therefore, spectroscopic estimates of the masses of the components in SS433 based on the HeII emission line can be unrealistic.</description>

      <title>Generalization from Low- to Moderate-Resolution Spectra with Neural Networks for Stellar Parameter Estimation: A Case Study with DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-survey generalization is a critical challenge in stellar spectral analysis, particularly in cases such as transferring from low- to moderate-resolution surveys. We investigate this problem using pre-trained models, focusing on simple neural networks such as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), with a case study transferring from LAMOST low-resolution spectra (LRS) to DESI medium-resolution spectra (MRS). Specifically, we pre-train MLPs on either LRS or their embeddings and fine-tune them for application to DESI stellar spectra. We compare MLPs trained directly on spectra with those trained on embeddings derived from transformer-based models (self-supervised foundation models pre-trained for multiple downstream tasks). We also evaluate different fine-tuning strategies, including residual-head adapters, LoRA, and full fine-tuning. We find that MLPs pre-trained on LAMOST LRS achieve strong performance, even without fine-tuning, and that modest fine-tuning with DESI spectra further improves the results. For iron abundance, embeddings from a transformer-based model yield advantages in the metal-rich ([Fe/H] &gt; -1.0) regime, but underperform in the metal-poor regime compared to MLPs trained directly on LRS. We also show that the optimal fine-tuning strategy depends on the specific stellar parameter under consideration. These results highlight that simple pre-trained MLPs can provide competitive cross-survey generalization, while the role of spectral foundation models for cross-survey stellar parameter estimation requires further exploration.</description>

      <title>Dyad: a binary-star dynamics and statistics library for Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dyad is a Python library for studying the dynamics of binary stars considered as gravitational two-body systems. The dynamics of a binary star are determined by its primary and secondary stars' masses along with the secondary star's six orbital elements as defined in a frame comoving with the primary star. In a population of binary stars these eight parameters vary from member to member and can each be treated as a random variable having some probability distribution. Dyad provides a class, dyad.TwoBody, and a module, dyad.stats, for dealing with such a population of binary stars. The dyad.TwoBody class represents a gravitational two-body system while the dyad.stats module provides a suite of classes representing the probability distributions of (1) stellar masses (including those proposed by Kroupa, 2001, and Salpeter, 1955) as well as (2) mass ratios and orbital elements (including those proposed by Duquennoy &amp; Mayor, 1991, and Moe &amp; Di Stefano, 2017).

      <title>Revising the Milky Way Cepheid Calibration: Quantifying and Correcting for Previously Undetected Distance Modulus Errors in the Gaia-based Multi-Wavelength Period-Luminosity Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the multi-wavelength period-luminosity-color relations for Cepheid variables in the Large and Small magellanic Clouds and the Milky Way. From first-principles stellar physics, the luminosity of a Cepheid is determined by its radius and surface temperature, yielding a fundamental PLC relation whose observational proxies are pulsation period and intrinsic color. Using Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds, we show that the PLC relation recovers the known geometries and line-of-sight tilts of their disks, confirming its ability to detect true distance-modulus variations that are achromatic and consistent across all filters. Surprisingly, for Milky Way Cepheids with individually determined reddenings and HST and Gaia parallaxes, the residuals from multi-wavelength PL fits are also found to be achromatic, identical in sign and amplitude across all passbands, in this case indicating that parallax errors are the dominant source of scatter. Applying bandpass-averaged corrections to individual Cepheids recovers the theoretically expected wavelength-dependent narrowing of the instability strip, and results in revised parallaxes with a median improvement in precision of roughly a factor of two. In addition, they show no statistically significant correlation with metallicity over the range -0.2 &lt; Fe/H &lt; 0.05 dex. The final extinction- and reddening-corrected PLC relation yields an rms scatter of 0.04 mag, corresponding to 2 percent precision in distance per star. Use of a physically grounded PLC will provide a more robust foundation for the Cepheid-based extragalactic distance scale and the determination of the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Surveying the Giant HII Regions of the Milky Way with SOFIA: VIII. W43 Main</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this eighth paper of the SOFIA-FORCAST series on Milky Way GHII regions, we present an analysis of the massive star-forming complex W43 Main. We compared our 11 - 37 micron maps with multi-wavelength observations from the near-infrared to radio, and investigated the physical nature of compact sources and dust substructures. We applied SED fitting to constrain properties of the compact infrared objects, and examined the evolutionary states of the extended subregions. We identified 20 compact infrared objects, 16 (80%) of which we classify as massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) or candidate MYSOs. W43 Main resides at the junction of the Scutum spiral arm and the Galactic Bar, a location where enhanced turbulence is anticipated and has been proposed as a potential influence on star-formation activity. Nevertheless, our analysis shows that its Lyman continuum photon production rate, the mass of its most massive MYSO, and its MYSO density are all consistent with the survey-wide median values. We therefore conclude that, despite W43 Main's unique Galactic environment, its present star formation activity appears broadly consistent with that of an average Galactic GHII region.</description>

      <title>Leveling of MHD turbulence imbalance in shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in plane shear flows with a streamwise background magnetic field in the super-Alfv\'enic regime. We show that the large-scale velocity shear suppresses turbulence imbalance, driving the system toward a balanced state -- the energies of counter-propagating Alfv\'en waves become essentially equal, even at initially perfectly imbalanced Alfv\'enic turbulence. This balancing is due to the shear-induced linear non-modal dynamics of Alfv\'en waves, including their transient growth and over-reflection. This linear route to balancing turbulence is new -- fundamentally different from nonlinear ones operative in shearless MHD turbulence -- and have direct implications for understanding balanced/imbalanced MHD turbulence in the solar wind, which is modeled as a shear flow in a thermodynamically complex plasma.</description>

      <title>Description of 4 Spacecraft, Moving on Elliptic Kepler Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The four-spacecraft formation is essential for measurements of various physical fields. The use of this formation on substantially elliptical heliocentric Kepler orbits allows measuring gradients of gravitation field in Solar system. The accuracy of the measurements will be sufficient to confirm or to refute modified theories of gravity. In this paper a new approach for the description of this formation is presented. The analytical solutions of the linearized motion equations are obtained. The distinctive feature of the solutions is that they use Cartesian coordinates of one of the spacecraft, termed the chief. These solutions have a clear physical meaning. It is shown, that the volume of a tetrahedron formed by spacecraft is a polynomial of 3-rd degree of Cartesian coordinates of the chief. The polynomial's coefficients are functions of initial spacecraft coordinates and velocities and linearly depend on time. If all spacecraft have the same periods of rotation around the Sun, the volume is a polynomial of 2-nd degree of the chief coordinates with time-independent coefficients. In this case the volume can be zeroed from 0 to 4 times per the period. Suggested approach can significantly simplify planning missions for measurements of various interplanetary fields.</description>

      <title>Effective Magnetic Susceptibility of Dust Grains with Superparamagnetic Inclusions and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic properties of dust grains play a fundamental role in their alignment with ambient magnetic fields and magnetic dipole emission. In the radiative torque (RAT) paradigm, superparamagnetic inclusions (SPIs) embedded within dust grains are expected to significantly enhance magnetic susceptibility and alignment efficiency. Previous studies have generally assumed SPIs of a single characteristic size. In this work, we develop an effective superparamagnetism model that explicitly accounts for a power-law size distribution of SPIs. We show that the effective zero-frequency susceptibility can be described by the superparamagnetic susceptibility of uniform-sized inclusions evaluated at the critical blocking size, reduced by a factor $F_{\rm eff}\sim 0.1$. It exhibits a slight increase with dust temperature $T_{d}$, in contrast to the rapid decrease for the case of single-size SPIs. For rotating grains at angular frequency $\omega$, we identify a characteristic resonance size of SPIs that dominates the magnetic response, $N_{\rm res} = (T_{d}/T_{\rm act}) \ln (\nu_{0}/\omega)$ with $T_{\rm act}$ activation temperature and $\nu_{0}$ the characteristic attempt frequency of SPIs. The frequency-dependent effective susceptibility is well described by the maximum susceptibility $\chi_{\rm eff}^{\rm max}(\omega)$ at $N_{\rm res}$, reduced by a factor $G_{\rm eff}\sim 0.1$. Unlike models assuming uniform-sized inclusions, we find that the effective susceptibility exhibits a nearly flat spectrum for frequency below $\nu_{0}$, arising from the progressive activation of larger inclusions at lower frequencies. This effective superparamagnetism model based on the SPI size distrbution has important implications for magnetic grain alignment, dust polarization, and magnetic dipole emission across diverse environments.</description>

      <title>The Physical Properties of PS1-12sk and the Implications to Its Progenitor System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PS1-12sk is a type Ibn supernova (SN) found at the host environment showing no obvious ongoing star formation, which challenges the massive star explosion scenario. We use the ejecta-circumstellar medium (CSM) interaction (CSI) and the CSI plus $^{56}$Ni models in the context of double white dwarf (WD) merger to fit the bolometric light curve (LC) of PS1-12sk, since the He emission lines at the photospheric phases indicated the interaction between the SN ejecta and He-rich CSM. We find that the CSI model failed to explain the LC, but the CSI plus $^{56}$Ni model can account for the bolometric LC. The derived masses of the two WDs and $^{56}$Ni are $\sim 0.70 M_\odot$, $\sim 0.40 M_\odot$, and $\sim 0.09\,M_\odot$, respectively. The facts that the ejecta mass ($\sim 0.984 M_\odot$) is well below the Chandrasekhar limit ($\sim 1.4 M_\odot$) and that the $^{56}$Ni mass is comparable to the $^{56}$Ni yields of the explosions of some sub-Chandrasekhar explosion models support the scenario that PS1-12sk might be from a sub-Chandrasekhar explosion induced by the merger of two low-mass WDs. The derived innermost radius ($\sim 13.81 \times 10^{12}$ cm) and the mass of the CSM ($\sim 0.116 M_\odot$) disfavor the possibility that the CSM was formed in the merger phase. We suggest that the flybys before the merger can account for the position and mass of the CSM.</description>

      <title>Recalibrating the Sensitivities of the STIS First-Order, Medium-Resolution Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sensitivities of STIS first-order, medium resolution modes were redetermined from on-orbit observations and CALSPEC models (version 11) of the primary white-dwarf spectrophotometric standard stars G191-B2B, GD 71, and GD 153. The sensitivity of an additional configuration was updated by comparing observations of the secondary standard BD +75 325 with the STIS low-resolution spectrum that has been calibrated consistently with the version 11 models. The procedures used to derive the sensitivities and verify the PHOTTAB reference files prior to their activation in CRDS (on May 1, 2025) are described. Results are presented in graphical form in an extensive appendix. Issues and uncertainties are discussed briefly, along with recommendations for future work.</description>

      <title>Multi-frequency mapping of the S255IR region at a wavelength of 1~mm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The results of interferometric observations of the star-forming region S255IR in the frequency range 210--250 GHz are presented. The observations were carried out with the antenna array SMA (Hawaii, USA). Fifty-three molecules were detected, including complex organic molecules (COMs) such as CH$_3$CHO, CH$_3$CN, CH$_3$CH$_2$CN, and many others. Typical rotational temperatures in the hot core SMA1 fall in the range 100--200 K. Optical depths in the lines of methanol and some other molecules in the cores SMA1 and SMA2 were estimated. In SMA1, the optical depth of one of the strongest methanol lines, $5_{-1}-4_{-1}E$, proved to be $23.8 \pm 1.5$. Based on this value, one can assume that the lines of other oxygen-containing COMs, such as CH$_3$OCHO, CH$_3$OCH$_3$, CH$_3$CH$_2$OH, which are typically much less abundant in hot cores than methanol, are optically thin in SMA1.
  Most of the detected molecules can be roughly divided into two groups. The molecules of the first group emit exclusively toward the hot core SMA1, while some or all lines of the molecules of the second group, in addition to SMA1, can be seen toward a ring-like structure to the west of SMA1. This structure is most likely associated with the walls of a cavity formed by high-velocity outflows driven by young stellar objects (YSOs) in molecular cores SMA1, SMA2, and possibly SMA3. The gas temperature and density in the cavity walls were estimated using methanol lines. The temperature was found to be about 50--60 K, and the density about $10^7-10^8$ cm$^{-3}$. The column density of methanol near the brightness peaks in the lines of this molecule is about $5\times 10^{15}$~cm$^{-2}$. The column densities of other COMs in the ring-like structure will be determined in future studies with increased sensitivity achieved by spectral line stacking.</description>

      <title>Modeling YSO Jets in 3D II: Accretion-Fed, Star-Anchored Poynting Jets in the Low-Density Polar Cavity Powered by Disk-Magnetosphere Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of jets in young stellar objects (YSOs) remains a subject of active investigation. We present a 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulation of jet launching in YSOs, focusing on the interaction between the stellar magnetosphere and the accretion disk. In our model, a fast, low-density bipolar jet is powered by disk-magnetosphere interaction and launched through the polar cavity that is mass-loaded from the disk rather than the star. Specifically, outflows are driven by toroidal magnetic pressure generated along "two-legged" field lines, anchored at a magnetically dominated stellar footpoint and a mass-dominated point on the (magnetically elevated) disk surface via a cyclic "load-fire-reload" process: in the "load" stage, differential rotation between stellar and disk footpoints generates toroidal magnetic pressure; in the "fire" stage, vertical gradients in the toroidal field accelerate plasma and transport Poynting flux into the polar cavity; in the "reload" stage, magnetic reconnection allows the cycle to repeat, reforming "two-legged" field lines. These field lines are not required to be fully reset to a dipolar loop configuration; it is only required that the disk-end be shallowly embedded in the (elevated) disk surface. This rapid, asynchronous process produces a continuous, large-scale outflow. The resulting magnetically dominated (Poynting) jet, accelerated by magnetic pressure within the low-density polar cavity, is distinct from the denser, slower disk wind launched through the classic magnetic-tower mechanism. Comparison with a disk-only model shows that the rotating stellar magnetosphere promotes bipolar jet launching by shaping a magnetic geometry favorable to symmetric outflows.</description>

      <title>Two unseen massive white dwarf candidates in close binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of two binary systems, each consisting of a slightly bloated G-type main-sequence star and an unseen companion, identified through photometric data from TESS and radial velocity variation from Gaia. High-resolution spectroscopy confirms orbital periods of 1.37 and 2 .67 d with circular orbits. The visible components have masses of $\sim$0.9--1.0$\,M_\odot$, while the minimum masses of the unseen companions are $1.078^{+0.058}_{-0.060}\, M_\odot$ and $0.943^{+0.048}_{-0.049}\, M_\odot$, respectively. Assuming tidal synchronization, we estimate the companion masses to be $1.13^{+0.11}_{-0.08} M_\odot$ and $1.05^{+0.15}_{-0.10} M_\odot$. The absence of detectable spectral features from the companions rules out main-sequence stars of these masses, suggesting that the unseen companions are likely O/Ne or C/O massive white dwarfs. The short orbital periods imply that these systems are post-common envelope binaries. Their subsequent evolution is uncertain, with possible outcomes including cataclysmic variables, Type Ia supernovae, or accretion-induced collapse, depending on the nature of future mass transfer.</description>

      <title>Quantifying sunspot group nesting with density-based unsupervised clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17364v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sunspot groups often emerge in spatial-temporal clusters, known as nests or complexes of activity. Quantifying how frequently such nesting occurs is important for understanding the organisation and recurrence of solar magnetic fields. We introduce an automated approach based on kernel density estimation and DBSCAN clustering to identify nests in the longitude-time domain and to measure the fraction of sunspot groups that belong to them. The method combines a smooth representation of emergence patterns with a density-based clustering procedure, validated using synthetic solar-like cycles and corrected for variations in data density. We apply this method to 151 years of sunspot-group observations from the Royal Greenwich Observatory Photoheliographic Results (RGO, 1874-1976) and Kislovodsk Mountain Astronomical Station (KMAS, 1955-2025) catalogues. Across all cycles and latitude bands, the mean nesting degree is $\langle D\rangle = 0.61 \pm 0.12$, implying that about 60 percent all sunspot groups emerge within nests. Nesting is strongest at mid-latitudes (10$^\circ$-20$^\circ$), and results from the two independent datasets agree in the period of overlap. The nesting degree significantly correlates with the solar activity level, with the correlation strengthening when small groups are excluded. The characteristic inter-nest spacing contracts from $\sim$200-500~Mm at low activity to $\sim$60-100~Mm at solar maximum, approaching typical sunspot-group dimensions. The identified nests range from compact clusters to long-lived, drifting structures, offering new quantitative constraints on the persistence and organisation of solar magnetic activity.</description>

      <title>Two late-T dwarfs at kiloparsec distances revealed by JWST UNCOVER survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conducted a search for brown dwarf candidates in a James Webb Space Telescope deep field around A2744 to investigate the space density of these objects at kiloparsec distances. Our methodology employed an initial selection based on photometric colours, followed by spectral energy distribution fitting to both stellar atmospheric models and high-redshift galaxy templates. This approach yielded two robust T dwarf candidates and one possible L subdwarf candidate. The T dwarfs have estimated Galactic heights of 0.43 and 0.86 kpc, likely residing near the outer edges of the Galactic thin and thick discs, respectively. We measure a T dwarf surface number density of 0.094 per squared arcmin in the UNCOVER field, lower than previous predictions but consistent at the order-of-magnitude level. We also provide space number density estimates for T5-T8.9 dwarfs across different effective temperature and spectral type bins, finding that T5-T7 dwarfs out to 2 kpc have significantly lower densities than their solar neighbourhood counterparts, whilst T8 dwarfs within the thick disc exhibit densities comparable to local values. Our analysis demonstrates that broad-band near- to mid-infrared photometry provides high sensitivity to late-T dwarfs but is relatively less sensitive to L and early-T dwarfs. Spectroscopy is typically required to distinguish photometric candidates of L dwarfs, early-T subdwarfs, and high-redshift galaxies in JWST deep fields. This study demonstrates the potential for expanding our understanding of brown dwarf distributions and characteristics at unprecedented distances, offering new insights into substellar populations beyond the solar neighbourhood.</description>

      <title>Reassessing the Spin of Second-born Black Holes in Coalescing Binary Black Holes and Its Connection to the chi_eff-q Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mass ratio q and effective inspiral spin chi_eff of binary black hole (BBH) mergers in GWTC-4.0 show a weaker anti-correlation than in GWTC-3.0, motivating investigation of its physical origin. Within the isolated binary evolution framework, we adopt a recently proposed He-star wind prescription to study the spin of the second-born BH and its impact on the q-chi_eff relation. Using \texttt{MESA}, including the updated He-star wind, internal differential rotation, and tidal interactions, we examine how initial conditions and key processes determine the BH spin. We also perform rapid population synthesis with \texttt{COMPAS} to predict the population-level q-chi_eff correlation. The updated wind prescription is significantly weaker than the standard Dutch scheme, particularly at subsolar metallicity. Detailed binary models of He stars with BH companions show that the resulting BH spin is largely insensitive to the He star's evolutionary stage at the onset of tidal interaction and to the companion mass. Instead, wind mass loss dominates: more massive He-star progenitors produce lower-spinning BHs. Initial stellar rotation has only a minor effect, especially under strong tidal coupling. We provide a fitting formula for the spin of the second-born BH. Combining this formula with rapid population synthesis under default assumptions, we find that 85.8% of BBHs formed via stable mass transfer undergo mass-ratio reversal, compared to only 2.8% in the common-envelope channel. Notably, no correlation between q and chi_eff is found in either channel. Future work will explore alternative physical prescriptions and compare our predictions with BBH mergers reported by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration.</description>

      <title>Detailed Abundance Determination of Metal-Poor Stars with X-Shooter I. Unusual Chemistry in Halo Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed chemical analysis study of 16 candidate metal-poor stars, previously identified with 2dF + AAOmega, using X-Shooter spectra and the Korg 1D local thermodynamic equilibrium spectral synthesis code. We confirm the earlier metallicity estimates and reveal six extremely metal-poor ([Fe/H] $&lt; -3$) stars in the current sample. Two of these stars, including the most metal poor at [Fe/H] = $-3.89 \pm 0.07$, are kinematically associated with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) accretion event, increasing the number of known GSE stars with [Fe/H] $&lt; -3.5$ to eight. From the X-Shooter spectra we determine abundances for 16 elements, with the element-to-iron abundance ratios generally consistent with high-resolution studies of Galactic halo stars. Within the sample, we identify three peculiar stars: the first is a GSE nitrogen enhanced metal-poor ([N/Fe] $= 1.60 \pm 0.10$ and [C/Fe] $= 0.23 \pm 0.08$) star with unusually high Na ([Na/Fe] $= 2.26 \pm 0.07$) and Li (A(Li)$_{\rm 3DNLTE} = 1.90 \pm 0.08$) abundances, but lacking enhancements in [Al/Fe] or [Mg/Fe]. The second is a halo r-II star significantly enhanced in Sr ([Sr/Ba] $= 0.39 \pm 0.08$), suggesting mixture of r-process and s-process enrichment, uncommon for r-II stars. Whilst the third is a halo star very depleted in N ([N/Fe] $&lt; -1.11$), with low C ([C/Fe] $= -0.33 \pm 0.08$) and otherwise 'normal' [X/Fe] abundances, suggesting enrichment with Type II supernova that proceeds enrichment from massive asymptotic giant branch stars. This study reveals the substantial degree of chemical diversity in the stellar populations which assembled the early Milky Way.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the velocity evolution of free-floating planets and interstellar objects (``free floaters'') through gravitational scatterings by field stars (with the stellar mass $m$ much larger than the mass of the floater, $m_p$). We show that the equilibrium velocity -- where dynamical friction balances stochastic acceleration -- is given by $\sigma \sqrt{2\ln(m/m_p)}$ (where $\sigma$ is the velocity disperson of the field stars), diverging from the standard energy equipartition scaling. While the timescale to reach this equilibrium is prohibitively long, we find that slow floaters ($v \lesssim \sigma$) undergo mass-independent acceleration, doubling their velocities within a few relaxation times. Consequently, free floaters initially following the Maxwellian distribution of their parent stars develop distinctly non-Maxwellian velocity distributions on a relaxation timescale. Since the relaxation time of the Galactic disk is longer than the age, our results suggest that the kinematics of low-mass free floaters in the disk may preserve signatures of their parent stars and ejection history.</description>

Abstract: The Magellanic Clouds (MCs) offer a unique laboratory for studying galaxy interaction and the evolution of dwarf galaxies. By investigating when and how stars formed, the star formation history (SFH) is a powerful tool to provide constraints for dynamical modeling of the system's past interactions and understand the processes of stripping and triggered star formation in tidally influenced environments. We aim to reconstruct the SFH of the Magellanic Bridge, the gaseous and stellar stream connecting the two Clouds. We used data from the deep optical STEP survey, which covers 54 $\mathrm{deg\, {^{2}}}$ across the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and the Bridge, reaching stars below the oldest main sequence turnoff at the distance of the MCs. We applied the synthetic color-magnitude diagram (CMD) technique to 14 deg$^2$ of STEP data. We constructed two libraries of synthetic stellar populations based on the PARSEC-COLIBRI and BaSTI stellar evolutionary models, with metallicities in the range $-2.0\leq[$Fe/H$]\leq0$ across the whole Hubble time. We find a clear peak of recent star formation $\sim100$ Myr ago in the Magellanic Bridge, which becomes increasingly pronounced toward the SMC. The low metallicity of this population suggests that it formed from gas stripped from the SMC during its most recent close encounter with the LMC. In the eastern part of the Bridge (LMC side), the star formation peaks at earlier times, around 10 Gyr and 2 Gyr ago. We estimate a total stellar mass in the Bridge of $ (5.1 \pm 0.2) \times 10^5 M_\odot$ and a present-day stellar metallicity of $[$Fe/H$]\sim-0.6$ dex, close to SMC value.</description>
