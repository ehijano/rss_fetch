      <title>Spectroscopy of light atoms and bounds on physics beyond the standard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Newly calculated bounds on the strength of the coupling of an electron to a proton or a neutron by a fifth force are presented. These results are derived from the high precision spectroscopic data currently available for hydrogen, deuterium, helium-3 and helium-4. They do not depend on specific assumptions on how the interaction would couple to a deuteron compared to a proton or would couple to an $\alpha$ particle compared to a helion. They depend on its coupling to a muon, but not in a significant way for carrier masses below 100~keV if one assumes that the strength of the interaction with a muon would be of a similar order of magnitude as the strength of the interaction with an electron in that mass region.</description>

      <title>Non-Linearities In Atomic Quantum Receivers: Harmonic And Intermodulation Distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg sensors offer a unique approach to radio frequency (RF) detection, leveraging the high sensitivity and quantum properties of highly-excited atomic states to achieve performance levels beyond classical technologies. Non-linear responses and distortion behavior in Rydberg atom receivers are critical to evaluating and establishing performance metrics and capabilities such as spur-free dynamic range and tolerance to unwanted interfering signals. We report here on the measurement and characterization of non-linear behavior and spurious response of a Rydberg atomic heterodyne receiver. Single-tone and two-tone testing procedures are developed and implemented for measurement of harmonic and inter-modulation distortion in Rydberg atomic receivers based on multi-photon Rydberg spectroscopy and radio-frequency heterodyne signal detection and demodulation in an atomic vapor. For a predetermined set of atomic receiver parameters and RF carrier wave in the SHF band near-resonant to a cesium Rydberg transition, we measure and characterize atomic receiver selectivity, bandwidth, roll-off, compression point (P1dB), second-order (IP2) and third-order (IP3) intercepts, and spur-free dynamic range. Receiver intermodulation distortion is characterized for the case of an interfering signal wave applied at two frequency offsets relative to the near-resonant reference local oscillator, $\Delta F/F= 10^{-4}$ at 6dB and $10^{-6}$ at 22dB single-tone bandwidths, respectively. We observe that under suitable operating conditions the atomic receiver can exhibit a suppression of harmonic and inter-modulation distortion relative to that of classical receiver mixer amplifiers. Finally, we describe how the non-linear behaviors of atomic receivers can provide unique, controllable RF signatures inaccessible by classical counterparts and propose their use to realize secure communication modalities and applications.</description>

      <title>Comagnetometry using mirror-symmetric ions in a crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searches for physics beyond the Standard Model using spin sensors are susceptible to spurious frequency shifts and noise due to magnetic fields. Therefore a comagnetometer -- an auxiliary sensor that allows mundane magnetic field effects to be differentiated from new physics -- is an essential feature of many precision searches. Here we demonstrate the operation of a novel type of comagnetometer using nuclear spins of dopant ions in a crystal, comparing four different sub-ensembles of ions. We demonstrate rejection of magnetic-field-induced shifts to better than 1 part in 10$^5$ using this system, laying the groundwork for improved searches of time-reversal symmetry violation using solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing analogue Unruh effect via superradiance in a cylindrical cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to detect the Unruh effect in a circularly rotated Unruh-DeWitt detector enclosed within a cylindrical cavity. This technique relies on the enhanced atomic spontaneous emission rate related to the counter-rotating coupling between the detector and massless scalar fields. Our analysis demonstrates that the integration of a cylindrical cavity, coherent light excitation, and multi-atom super-radiation significantly enhances the signal strength, as the radiation rate associated with the standard rotating-wave coupling can be greatly suppressed within the cavity. Compared to linear acceleration, circular motion can significantly reduce the atomic acceleration path length, leading to increased detection efficiency and lower experimental difficulty. Our method provides a novel avenue for exploring relativistic effects on a compact, tabletop platform.</description>

      <title>Applications of maximum likelihood estimations for analyzing photon counts in few atom experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for determining the atom number distribution of few atoms in a tight optical tweezer from their fluorescence distributions. In the tight tweezer regime, the detection light causes rapid atom loss due to light-assisted collisions. This in turn leads to non-Poissonian and overlapping fluorescence distributions for different initial atom numbers, and commonly used threshold techniques fail. We use maximum likelihood estimation algorithms to fit model distributions that account for the atom loss. This gives accurate atom number distributions for relatively few experimental runs (about 600 is sufficient) to sample a photon number distribution. We show that the method can be extended to situations when the photon number distributions for known initial atom numbers cannot be modeled, at the cost of requiring a higher number of experimental runs.</description>

      <title>Cavity-enhanced continuous-wave microscopy using unstabilized cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microscopy gives access to spatially resolved dynamics in different systems, from biological cells to cold atoms. A big challenge is maximizing the information per used probe particle to limit the damage to the probed system. We present a cavity-enhanced continuous-wave microscopy approach that provides enhanced signal-to-noise ratios at fixed damage. Employing a self-imaging 4f cavity, we show contrast enhancement for controlled test samples as well as biological samples. For thick samples, the imaging cavity leads to a new form of dark-field microscopy, where the separation of scattered and unscattered light is based on optical path length. We theoretically show that enhanced signal, signal-to-noise, and signal-to-noise per damage are also retrieved when the cavity cannot be stabilized. Our results provide an approach to cavity-enhanced microscopy with unstabilized cavities and might be used to enhance the performance of dispersive imaging of ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>A 3-dimensional scanning trapped-ion probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-atom quantum sensors offer high spatial resolution and high sensitivity to electric and magnetic fields. Among them, trapped ions offer exceptional performance in sensing electric fields, which has been used in particular to probe these in the proximity of metallic surfaces. However, the flexibility of previous work was limited by the use of radio-frequency trapping fields, which has restricted spatial scanning to linear translations, and calls into question whether observed phenomena are connected to the presence of the radio-frequency fields. Here, using a Penning trap instead, we demonstrate a single ion probe which offers three-dimensional position scanning at distances between $50$ $\mu\mathrm{m}$ and $450$ $\mu\mathrm{m}$ from a metallic surface and above a $200\times200$ $\mu\mathrm{m}^{2}$ area, allowing us to reconstruct static and time-varying electric as well as magnetic fields. We use this to map charge distributions on the metallic surface and noise stemming from it. The methods demonstrated here allow similar probing to be carried out on samples with a variety of materials, surface constitutions and geometries, providing a new tool for surface science.</description>

      <title>Irreducible Three-Loop Vacuum-Polarization Correction in Muonic Bound Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-loop electronic vacuum-polarization corrections due to irreducible diagrams are evaluated for two-body muonic ions with nuclear charge numbers 1 &lt;= Z &lt;= 6. The corrections are of order alpha^3 (Zalpha)^2 m_r, where alpha is the fine-structure constant and m_r is the reduced mass. Numerically, the energy corrections are found to be of the same order-of-magnitude as the largest of the order alpha^2 (Zalpha)^6 m_r corrections, and are thus phenomenologically interesting. Our method of calculation eliminates numerical uncertainty encountered in other approaches.</description>

      <title>Doppler-free three-photon spectroscopy on narrow-line optical transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate coherent Doppler-free three-photon excitation of the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{0}$ optical clock transition and the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{1}$ intercombination transition in free-space thermal clouds of $^{88}$Sr atoms. By appropriate orientation of the wavevectors of three lasers incident on the atoms, the first-order Doppler shift can be eliminated for all velocity classes. Three-photon excitation of the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{1}$ transition enables high-contrast Ramsey spectroscopy with interrogation times comparable to the 21$\mu$s natural lifetime using a single near-resonant laser source. Three-photon spectroscopy on the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{0}$ clock transition, using only laser frequencies nearly resonant with the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{0}$ and $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{1}$ transitions, enables a reduction in Doppler broadening by two orders of magnitude and a corresponding $\sim470$Hz linewidth without a confining potential.</description>

      <title>Robust High-frequency Laser Phase Noise Suppression by Adaptive Pound-Drever-Hall Feedforward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suppressing high-frequency laser phase noise, particularly at frequencies near and beyond typical feedback bandwidths of a few MHz, is a critical yet challenging task in many advanced applications. Feedforward-based methods generally outperform feedback in high-frequency range, but their performances are more susceptible to perturbations. In this work, we focus on the Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH)-feedforward method we demonstrated recently [Yu-Xin Chao et al., Optica 11(7), 945-950 (2024)] and analyze the factors that affect its long-term stability. By constructing a simple circuit allowing for adaptive control of the feedforward gain in response to power fluctuations of cavity transmission, we demonstrate a robust $\geq 40$ dB suppression of laser phase noise around 2 MHz and a noise suppression bandwidth up to 50 MHz. In comparison, when using normal PDH feedback, robust noise suppression of over 40 dB can only occur for frequencies below tens of kHz in most setups. Our findings may pave the way for general usage of PDH feedforward and allow for simple construction of low-noise lasers for precise quantum controls and precision metrology.</description>

      <title>Transporting, splitting, and connecting spin singlet pairs in a topological pump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transporting and connecting quantum states are key capabilities for larger-scale quantum information processing. Concrete challenges are the coherent shuttling and the manipulation of distant quantum states in an optical lattice. Here, we create spin singlet pairs of two magnetic states of fermionic potassium-40 atoms in an optical lattice and use a bi-directional topological Thouless pump to transport, coherently split, and separate the pairs, as well as to demonstrate interaction between them via tuneable $($swap$)^\alpha$-gate operations. We achieve pair pumping with a single-shift fidelity of 99.78(3)% over 50 lattice sites and split the pairs within a decoherence-free subspace. Gates are implemented by superexchange interaction, allowing us to produce interwoven spin singlets. For read-out, we apply a magnetic field gradient, resulting in single- and multi-frequency singlet-triplet oscillations. Our work shows avenues to create complex patterns of entanglement and new approaches to quantum processing, sensing, and atom interferometry.</description>
