      <title>Understanding In-Chamber Plasma Behavior Using a Dimensionally Scaled Gridded Ion Thruster in Three-Dimensional Kinetic Particle-in-Cell Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate facility effects on a reduced-scale gridded ion thruster plume using a fully kinetic, three-dimensional Particle-in-Cell/Monte Carlo Collision (PIC-MCC) solver coupled with a Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) neutral background. This approach enables detailed examination of key plasma processes governing beam neutralization and wall interactions under ground-test conditions. We find that inelastic electron cooling is essential for achieving a physically consistent, neutralized beam. Increasing the background pressure enhances ion-neutral collisions, leading to more charge- and momentum-exchange events that reduce ion mean energies, broaden the beam, and increase sidewall losses. Including inelastic processes flattens the potential, sustains quasi-neutrality, and preserves beam collimation farther downstream. Single-particle trajectory analyses show that primary electrons undergo mixed escape and temporary trapping, while low energy post-inelastic electrons remain confined, sustaining the neutralization cloud. Sheath diagnostics reveal that at the beam dump, classical Child-Langmuir and Hutchinson models underpredict the sheath length due to residual electrons, while near the sidewall, the sheath is truncated by beam-sheath interference within the compact domain. Current-flow analysis indicates that higher background pressure conditions yield lower beam energies and increased sidewall currents.</description>

      <title>Plasma oscillations within Israel-Stewart theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that, at zero wavenumber, the non-hydrodynamic frequencies of uncharged kinetic theory are purely imaginary. On the other hand, it was recently shown that, in resistive magnetohydrodynamics, the interplay between the Israel-Stewart relaxation equation and the Amp\`{e}re-Maxwell law can give rise to a pair of oscillating non-hydrodynamic modes. In this work, we analyze this phenomenon in detail. We first demonstrate that these oscillatory modes are exact solutions of the Drude model, corresponding to ordinary plasma oscillations. We then invoke the Onsager-Casimir principle to explain that their oscillatory nature reflects the distinct PT-transformation properties of the degrees of freedom: the distribution function is even, while the electric field is odd. Finally, we establish that, in a kinetic theory of charged particles, there can be at most one such pair of oscillatory modes per spatial dimension, while all other modes still must sit on the imaginary axis.</description>

      <title>Real-time time-dependent density functional theory for high-energy density physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic response properties of high-energy density (HED) systems influence planetary structure, drive evolution of fusion targets, and underpin diagnostics in laboratory astrophysics. Real-time time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) offers a versatile modeling framework capable of accurately predicting the dynamic response of HED materials -- including free-free, bound-free, and bound-bound contributions without requiring ad hoc state partitioning; capturing both collective and non-collective behavior; and applicable within the linear-response regime and beyond. We review the theoretical formalism of real-time TDDFT as applied to HED systems, provide a practical tutorial for computing relevant response properties (dynamic structure factors, conductivity, and stopping power), and comment on avenues for further development of this powerful computational method in service of HED science.</description>

      <title>Dual Origins of Rapid Flare Ribbon Downflows in an X9-class Solar Flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We detect rapid downflows of 150-217 km/s in IRIS Si IV 1402.77 nm measurements of an X9-class solar flare on 2024 October 3rd. The fast redshift values persist for over 15 minutes from flare onset, and can be split into two distinct stages of behavior, suggesting that multiple mechanisms are responsible for the downwards acceleration of flare ribbon plasma. The first stage of rapid downflows are synchronized with peaks in emission from the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory Hard X-ray Imager (ASO-S/HXI) and Large Yield Radiometer (LYRA) Lyman-alpha measurements, indicative that the chromospheric downflows (with a maximum redshift of 176 km/s) result from chromospheric condensations associated with impulsive energy release in the solar flare. Later in the event, strong Si IV flare ribbon downflows persist (to a maximum value of 217 km/s), despite the magnetic flux rate falling to zero, and high-energy HXR and Lyman-alpha measurements returning to background levels. This is reflective of downflows in the flare ribbon footpoints of flare-induced coronal rain. Hard X-ray spectral analysis supports this scenario, revealing strong non-thermal emission during the initial downflow stage, falling near background levels by the second stage. Despite these distinct and contrasting stages of ribbon behavior, Si IV Doppler velocities exhibit quasi-periodic pulsations with a constant ~50 s period across the 15-minute flare evolution (independently of loop length). We deduce that these pulsations are likely caused by MHD oscillations in the magnetic arcade. Finally, we utilize machine learning K-means clustering methods to quantify line profile variations during the stages of rapid downflows.</description>

      <title>Universal regimes of strong turbulence in the multi-component Gross-Pitaevskii model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) model, also known as the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, is arguably the most universal model in classical and quantum physics, describing spectrally narrow or long-wavelength distributions of interacting waves or particles. Modern applications -- from oceanic and atmospheric flows to photonics and cold atoms -- predominantly involve states that are far from equilibrium, culminating in the regime of fully developed turbulence. To date, a consistent theoretical description of such states has only existed for weakly interacting quasiparticles. Here we present a theory of strong turbulence in the two-dimensional $N$-component Gross-Pitaevskii model for both repulsive and attractive interactions, corresponding to the defocusing and focusing cases, respectively. In the focusing case, we show that attraction is enhanced by multi-wave effects, leading to a critical-balance state independent of the pumping level. In the defocusing case, repulsion is suppressed by collective effects, giving rise to another type of universality in strong turbulence -- independence from the bare coupling constant. The theory is confirmed by analytical results in the many-component limit and by direct numerical simulations of the single-component GP model.</description>

      <title>MHD waves with mixed properties / Alfv\'{e}n waves with pressure variations: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-uniformity plays an important role for MHD waves. For a uniform plasma of infinite extent the MHD waves can be subdivided in two classes with distinct properties. The first class contains the Alfv\'en waves. The Alfv\'en waves are incompressible and propagate parallel vorticity. They do not have a parallel component of displacement, they do not cause variations in pressure and are driven by magnetic tension only. The second class contains the magneto-sonic waves. They are compressible and have a parallel component of displacement. They do not propagate parallel vorticity and are driven by pressure and magnetic tension. In non-uniform plasmas the situation can be very different. The clear division between Alfv\'en waves and magneto-sonic waves is no longer present. In a given part of the equilibrium an MHD wave can strongly resemble a magneto-sonic wave with little or no resemblance to Alfv\'en waves; while in another part of the equilibrium the MHD wave is practically an Alfv\'en wave, which has the amazing property of being accompanied by variations in pressure.</description>

      <title>The Formation of Solar Prominences: Plasma Origin and Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar prominences, or solar filaments, are cool and dense plasma structures in the hot solar corona, whose formation mechanisms have remained a fundamental challenge in solar physics. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current theoretical, numerical, and observational understanding of prominence formation, with a focus on the origin of the dense plasma component. We begin by summarizing the magnetic field configurations that enable prominence support, followed by a classification of four representative plasma formation mechanisms: injection, levitation, evaporation--condensation, and in-situ condensation. Each mechanism is analyzed in terms of its physical basis, numerical realizations, and observational diagnostics. A central focus is placed on the evaporation--condensation scenario, which has seen significant development over the past decade through numerical simulations. We also discuss recent progress in modeling in-situ condensation triggered by magnetic reconnection and levitation dynamics. Throughout, we emphasize the complementary nature of different mechanisms and their potential coexistence in forming and maintaining prominence mass. Observational constraints and recent high-resolution data are reviewed to assess the physical plausibility of each mechanism. We conclude by highlighting open questions and future directions in connecting multi-scale physical processes to the observed diversity of prominence behaviors.</description>

      <title>High-charge relativistic electrons by vacuum laser acceleration from plasma mirrors using flying focus pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistic electron beams produced by intense lasers over short distances have important applications in high energy density physics and medical technologies. Vacuum laser acceleration with plasma mirrors injectors has garnered substantial research interest recently. However, a persistent challenge remains unresolved that electrons inevitably detach from the laser acceleration phase due to velocity mismatch. Here, we employ flying focus lasers to address this limitation. Through three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we demonstrate that flying focus lasers can achieve a substantial enhancement in relativistic electron charge yield compared to conventional Gaussian lasers. This improvement stems from two key attributes: (1) The subluminal propagation velocity of the peak intensity keeps a larger electron population synchronized within the longitudinal ponderomotive acceleration region, and (2) Flying focus lasers sustain higher magnitudes of the longitudinal ponderomotive force over longer distances in comparison to Gaussian lasers. This approach offers high-charge relativistic electron sources ideal for demanding applications such as high-flux Thomson scattering and radiography.</description>

      <title>A study of the electronic and ionic structure, for competing states of fully and partially ionized hydrogen, using the neutral pseudo-atom method as well as a classical map for the electron subsystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00388v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prof. Bonitz and his collaborators have made seminal contributions to the study of the uniform electron fluid and the electron-proton fluid, viz., hydrogen, in using {\it ab initio} simulations, as reflected in this festschrift. Here we review the theoretical methods available for these systems where traditional small-parameter methods fail. We use the neutral-pseudo atom (NPA) method, and a classical map for quantum electrons to study hydrogen plasmas. We show that {\it both} fully-ionized and partially-ionized hydrogen phases can exist with the same nominal density and temperature, at pressures and temperatures of interest to planetary physics. The mean ionization $\bar{Z}$, pair-distribution functions, free energies, pressures and conductivities are calculated for the competing phases. Here $\bar{Z}$ is also a measure of the miscibility of fully ionized and un-ionized hydrogen. Recent studies using path-integral Monte Carlo methods, and $N$-atom Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations have provided essential structure data including the electron-electron structure factor $S_{ee}(k)$ that enters into interpretation of X-ray Thomson scattering and other diagnostics. We show that these structure data can be inexpensively evaluated using classical-map schemes for fully ionized plasmas, and more generally, using one-atom (average-atom) DFT methods for partially ionized systems.</description>

      <title>High Gain Fusion Target Design using Generative Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20105v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By returning to the topological basics of fusion target design, Generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) is used to specify how to initially configure and drive the optimally entangled topological state, and stabilize that topological state from disruption. This can be applied to all methods; including tokamaks, laser-driven schemes, and pulsed-power driven schemes. The result is practical, room temperature targets that can yield up to 10 GJ of energy, driven by as little as 3 MJ of absorbed energy. The genAI is based on the concept of Ubuntu that replaces the Deep Convolutional Neural Network approximation of a functional, with the formula for the generating functional of a canonical transformation from the domain of the canonical field momentums and fields, to the domain of the canonical momentums and coordinates, that is the Reduced Order Model. This formula is a logical process of renormalization, enabling Heisenberg's canonical approach to field theory, via calculation of the S-matrix, given observation of the fields. This can be viewed as topological characterization and control of collective, that is complex, systems.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantum effects on radiation reaction in strong fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiation reaction, the force experienced by an accelerated charge due to radiation emission, has long been the subject of extensive theoretical and experimental research. Experimental verification of a quantum, strong-field description of radiation reaction is fundamentally important, and has wide-ranging implications for astrophysics, laser-driven particle acceleration, next-generation particle colliders and inverse-Compton photon sources for medical and industrial applications. However, the difficulty of accessing regimes where strong field and quantum effects dominate inhibited previous efforts to observe quantum radiation reaction in charged particle dynamics with high significance. We report the first high significance (&gt; 5{\sigma}) observation of strong-field radiation reaction on electron spectra where quantum effects are substantial. We obtain the first, quantitative, strong evidence favouring the quantum-continuous and quantum-stochastic models over the classical model; the quantum models perform comparably. The lower electron energy losses predicted by the quantum models accounts for their improved performance. Model comparison was performed using a novel Bayesian framework which has widespread utility for laser-particle collision experiments, including those utilising conventional accelerators, where some collision parameters cannot be measured directly.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Cooling of Planar Motion in a Penning Trap Ion Crystal to Sub-Millikelvin Temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional planar ion crystals in a Penning trap are a platform for quantum information science experiments. However, the low-frequency planar modes of these crystals are not efficiently cooled by laser cooling, which can limit the utility of the drumhead modes for quantum information processing. Recently, it has been shown that nonlinear mode coupling can enhance the cooling of the low-frequency planar modes. Here, we demonstrate in numerical simulations that this coupling can be dynamically tuned by adiabatically changing the rotation frequency of the ion crystal during experiments. Furthermore, we show that this technique can, in addition, produce lower temperatures for the low-frequency planar modes via an adiabatic cooling process. This result allows cooling of the planar modes to sub-millikelvin temperatures, resulting in improved spectral resolution of the drumhead modes at experimentally relevant rotation frequencies, which is crucial for quantum information processing applications.</description>

      <title>Measuring the properties of homogeneous turbulence in curved spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulence in curved spacetimes in general, and in the vicinity of black holes (BHs) in particular, represents a poorly understood phenomenon that is often analysed employing techniques developed for flat spacetimes. We here propose a novel approach to study turbulence in strong gravitational fields that is based on the computation of structure functions on generic manifolds and is thus applicable to arbitrary curved spacetimes. In particular, we introduce, for the first time, a formalism to compute the characteristic properties of turbulence, such as the second-order structure function or the power spectral density, in terms of proper lengths and volumes and not in terms of coordinate lengths and volumes, as customarily done. By applying the new approach to the turbulent rest-mass density field from simulations of magnetised disc accretion onto a Kerr BH, we inspect in a rigorous way turbulence in regions close to the event horizon, but also in the disc, the wind, and in the jet. We demonstrate that the new approach can capture the typical behavior of an inertial-range cascade and that differences up to $40-80\%$ emerge in the vicinity of the event horizon with respect to the standard flat-spacetime approach. While these differences become smaller at larger distances, our study highlights that special care needs to be paid when analysing turbulence in strongly curved spacetimes.</description>
