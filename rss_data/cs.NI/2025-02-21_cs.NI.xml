      <title>Prediction of Received Power in Low-Power Networks Deployed on the Surface of Rough Waters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-power and cost-effective IoT sensing nodes enable scalable monitoring of different environments. Some of these environments impose rough and extreme operating conditions, requiring continuous adaptation and reconfiguration of physical and link layer parameters. In this paper, we closely investigate the stability of the wireless links established between nodes deployed on the surface of different water bodies and propose a model to predict the received power. Our model is based on Minimum Mean Square Estimation (MMSE) and relies on the statistics of received power and the motion the nodes experience during communication. One of the drawbacks of MMSE is its reliance on matrix inversion, which is at once computationally expensive and difficult to implement with resource constrained devices. We forgo this stage by estimating model parameters using the gradient-descent approach, which is much simpler to implement. The model achieves a prediction accuracy of 91% even with a small number of iterations.</description>

      <title>Optimal Popularity-based Transmission Range Selection for D2D-supported Content Delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering device-to-device (D2D) wireless links as a virtual extension of 5G (and beyond) cellular networks to deliver popular contents has been proposed as an interesting approach to reduce energy consumption, congestion, and bandwidth usage at the network edge. In the scenario of multiple users in a region independently requesting some popular content, there is a major potential for energy consumption reduction exploiting D2D communications. In this scenario, we consider the problem of selecting the maximum allowed transmission range (or equivalently the maximum transmit power) for the D2D links that support the content delivery process. We show that, for a given maximum allowed D2D energy consumption, a considerable reduction of the cellular infrastructure energy consumption can be achieved by selecting the maximum D2D transmission range as a function of content class parameters such as popularity and delay-tolerance, compared to a uniform selection across different content classes. Specifically, we provide an analytical model that can be used to estimate the energy consumption (for small delay tolerance) and thus to set the optimal transmission range. We validate the model via simulations and study the energy gain that our approach allows to obtain. Our results show that the proposed approach to the maximum D2D transmission range selection allows a reduction of the overall energy consumption in the range of 30% to 55%, compared to a selection of the maximum D2D transmission range oblivious to popularity and delay tolerance.</description>

      <title>Counter Pools: Counter Representation for Efficient Stream Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the large data volume and number of distinct elements, space is often the bottleneck of many stream processing systems. The data structures used by these systems often consist of counters whose optimization yields significant memory savings. The challenge lies in balancing the size of the counters: too small, and they overflow; too large, and memory capacity limits their number.
  In this work, we suggest an efficient encoding scheme that sizes each counter according to its needs. Our approach uses fixed-sized pools of memory (e.g., a single memory word or 64 bits), where each pool manages a small number of counters. We pay special attention to performance and demonstrate considerable improvements for various streaming algorithms and workload characteristics.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning with Graph Attention for Routing and Wavelength Assignment with Lightpath Reuse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many works have investigated reinforcement learning (RL) for routing and spectrum assignment on flex-grid networks but only one work to date has examined RL for fixed-grid with flex-rate transponders, despite production systems using this paradigm. Flex-rate transponders allow existing lightpaths to accommodate new services, a task we term routing and wavelength assignment with lightpath reuse (RWA-LR). We re-examine this problem and present a thorough benchmarking of heuristic algorithms for RWA-LR, which are shown to have 6% increased throughput when candidate paths are ordered by number of hops, rather than total length. We train an RL agent for RWA-LR with graph attention networks for the policy and value functions to exploit the graph-structured data. We provide details of our methodology and open source all of our code for reproduction. We outperform the previous state-of-the-art RL approach by 2.5% (17.4 Tbps mean additional throughput) and the best heuristic by 1.2% (8.5 Tbps mean additional throughput). This marginal gain highlights the difficulty in learning effective RL policies on long horizon resource allocation tasks.</description>

      <title>Online Resource Management for the Uplink of Wideband Hybrid Beamforming System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the radio resource management (RRM) for the \emph{uplink} (UL) of a cellular system with codebook-based \emph{hybrid beamforming}. We consider the often neglected but highly practical multi-channel case with fewer radio frequency chains in the base station than user equipment (UEs) in the cell, assuming one RF chain per UE. As for any UL RRM, a per-time slot solution is needed as the allocation of power to subchannels by a UE can only be done once it knows which subchannels it has been allocated. The RRM in this system comprises beam selection, user selection and power allocation, three steps that are intricately coupled and we will show that the order in which they are performed does impact performance and so does the amount of coupling that we take into account. Specifically, we propose 4 online sequential solutions with different orders in which the steps are called and of different complexities, i.e., different levels of coupling between the steps. Our extensive numerical campaign for a mmWave system shows how a well-designed heuristic that takes some level of couplings between the steps can make the performance exceedingly better than a benchmark.</description>

      <title>DFDT: Dynamic Fast Decision Tree for IoT Data Stream Mining on Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Internet of Things generates massive data streams, with edge computing emerging as a key enabler for online IoT applications and 5G networks. Edge solutions facilitate real-time machine learning inference, but also require continuous adaptation to concept drifts. Ensemble-based solutions improve predictive performance, but incur higher resource consumption, latency, and memory demands. This paper presents DFDT: Dynamic Fast Decision Tree, a novel algorithm designed for energy-efficient memory-constrained data stream mining. DFDT improves hoeffding tree growth efficiency by dynamically adjusting grace periods, tie thresholds, and split evaluations based on incoming data. It incorporates stricter evaluation rules (based on entropy, information gain, and leaf instance count), adaptive expansion modes, and a leaf deactivation mechanism to manage memory, allowing more computation on frequently visited nodes while conserving energy on others. Experiments show that the proposed framework can achieve increased predictive performance (0.43 vs 0.29 ranking) with constrained memory and a fraction of the runtime of VFDT or SVFDT.</description>

      <title>Tracking and Assigning Jobs to a Markov Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a time-slotted communication system with a machine, a cloud server, and a sampler. Job requests from the users are queued on the server to be completed by the machine. The machine has two states, namely, a busy state and a free state. The server can assign a job to the machine in a first-in-first-served manner. If the machine is free, it completes the job request from the server; otherwise, it drops the request. Upon dropping a job request, the server is penalized. When the machine is in the free state, the machine can get into the busy state with an internal job. When the server does not assign a job request to the machine, the state of the machine evolves as a symmetric Markov chain. If the machine successfully accepts the job request from the server, the state of the machine goes to the busy state and follows a different dynamics compared to the dynamics when the machine goes to the busy state due to an internal job. The sampler samples the state of the machine and sends it to the server via an error-free channel. Thus, the server can estimate the state of the machine, upon receiving an update from the source. If the machine is in the free state but the estimated state at the server is busy, the sampler pays a cost. We incorporate the concept of the age of incorrect information to model the cost of the sampler. We aim to find an optimal sampling policy such that the cost of the sampler plus the penalty on the machine gets minimized. We formulate this problem in a Markov decision process framework and find how an optimal policy changes with several associated parameters. We show that a threshold policy is optimal for this problem. We show a necessary and sufficient condition for a threshold policy to be optimal. Finally, we find the optimal threshold without bounding the state space.</description>

      <title>An infinite server system with packing constraints and ranked servers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A service system with multiple types of customers, arriving as Poisson processes, is considered. The system has infinite number of servers, ranked by $1,2,3, \ldots$; a server rank is its ``location." Each customer has an independent exponentially distributed service time, with the mean determined by its type. Multiple customers (possibly of different types) can be placed for service into one server, subject to ``packing'' constraints. Service times of different customers are independent, even if served simultaneously by the same server. The large-scale asymptotic regime is considered, such that the mean number of customers $r$ goes to infinity.
  We seek algorithms with the underlying objective of minimizing the location (rank) $U$ of the right-most (highest ranked) occupied (non-empty) server. Therefore, this objective seeks to minimize the total number $Q$ of occupied servers {\em and} keep the set of occupied servers as far at the ``left'' as possible, i.e., keep $U$ close to $Q$. In previous work, versions of {\em Greedy Random} (GRAND) algorithm have been shown to asymptotically minimize $Q/r$ as $r\to\infty$. In this paper we show that when these algorithms are combined with the First-Fit rule for ``taking'' empty servers, they asymptotically minimize $U/r$ as well.</description>
