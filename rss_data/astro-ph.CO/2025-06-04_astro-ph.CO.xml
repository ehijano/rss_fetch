      <title>Primordial Gravitational Waves from Phase Transitions during Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study primordial gravitational waves (GWs) generated from first-order phase transitions (PTs) during cosmic reheating. Using a minimal particle physics model, and a general parametrization of the inflaton energy density and the evolution of the Standard Model temperature, we explore the conditions under which PTs occur and determine the corresponding PT parameters (the PT temperature, duration and strength), which depend on the evolution of the background during reheating. We find that, in certain cosmological scenarios, PTs can be delayed and prolonged compared to the standard post-inflationary evolution. Incorporating these PT parameters, we compute the resulting GW spectrum generated from the various processes occurring during a first-order PT: bubble collisions, sound waves, and magneto-hydrodynamic turbulence. We find that, in comparison to the standard cosmological history, the GW amplitude and peak frequency can be modified by several orders of magnitude due to the additional enhancement or suppression arising from the cosmological evolution during reheating. In particular, the GW spectra could be within the reach of next-generation GW and CMB observatories.</description>

      <title>Uplifting, Depressing, and Tilting Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current data in the form of baryon acoustic oscillation, supernova, and cosmic microwave background distances prefer a cosmology that accelerates more strongly than $\Lambda$CDM at $z\approx0.5-1.5$, and more weakly at $z\lesssim0.5$. We examine dark energy physics that can accommodate this, showing that interactions (decays, coupling to matter, nonminimal coupling to gravity) fairly generically tend not to give a satisfactory solution (in terms of fitting both distances and growth) even if they enable the effective dark energy equation of state to cross $w=-1$. To fit the cosmological data it appears the dark energy by itself must cross $w=-1$, a highly unusual physical behavior.</description>

      <title>Nonminimal infrared gravitational reheating in light of ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inflation is known to produce large infrared scalar fluctuations. Further, if a scalar field $(\chi)$ is non-minimally coupled with gravity through $\xi \chi^2 R$, those infrared modes experience \textit{tachyonic instability} during and after inflation. Those large non-perturbative infrared modes can collectively produce hot Big Bang universe upon their horizon entry during the post-inflationary period. We indeed find that for reheating equation of state (EoS), $w_{\phi} &gt; 1/3$, and coupling strength, $\xi&gt;1/6$, large infrared fluctuations lead to successful reheating. We further analyze perturbative reheating by solving the standard Boltzmann equation in both Jordan and Einstein frames, and compare the results with the non-perturbative ones. Finally, embedding this infrared reheating scenario into the well-known $\alpha-$attractor inflationary model, we examine possible constraints on the model parameters in light of the latest ACT, DESI results. To arrive at the constraints, we take into account the latest bounds on tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r_{0.05}\leq 0.038$, isocurvature power spectrum, $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{S}} \lesssim 8.3\times 10^{-11}$, and effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \lesssim 0.17 $. Subject to these constraints, we find successful reheating to occur only for EoS $w_{\phi}\gtrsim 0.6$, which translates to a sub-class of $\alpha-$attractor models being favored and placing them within the 2$\sigma$ region in the $ n_s-r$ plane of the latest ACT, DESI data. In this range of EoS, we find that the coupling strength should lie within $2.11\lesssim\xi\lesssim 2.95$ for $w_{\phi}=0.6$. Finally, we compute secondary gravitational wave signals induced by the scalar infrared modes, which are found to be strong enough to be detected by future GW observatories, namely BBO, DECIGO, LISA, and ET.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian PINN Framework for Barrow-Tsallis Holographic Dark Energy with Neutrinos: Toward a Resolution of the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Barrow-Tsallis Holographic Dark Energy (BTHDE) model using both traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and a Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework, employing a range of cosmological observations. Our analysis incorporates data from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), CMB lensing, Cosmic Chronometers (CC), and the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova compilation. We focus on constraining the Hubble constant $ H_0 $, the nonextensive entropy index $ q $, the Barrow exponent $ \Delta $, and the Granda-Oliveros parameters $ \alpha $ and $ \beta $, along with the total neutrino mass $ \Sigma m_\nu $. The Bayesian PINN approach yields more precise constraints than MCMC, particularly for $ \beta $, and tighter upper bounds on $ \Sigma m_\nu $. The inferred values of $ H_0 $ from both methods lie between those from Planck 2018 and SH$_0$ES (R22), alleviating the Hubble tension to within $ 1.3\sigma $-$2.1\sigma $ depending on the dataset combination. Notably, the Bayesian PINN achieves consistent results across CC and Pantheon+ datasets, while maintaining physical consistency via embedded differential constraints. The combination of CMB and late-time probes leads to the most stringent constraints, with $ \Sigma m_\nu &lt; 0.114 $ eV and $ H_0 = 70.6 \pm 1.35 $ km/s/Mpc. These findings suggest that the BTHDE model provides a viable framework for addressing cosmological tensions and probing modified entropy scenarios, while highlighting the complementary strengths of machine learning and traditional Bayesian inference in cosmological modeling.</description>

      <title>Caustic fringes for wave dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave dark matter is composed of particles sufficiently light that their de Broglie wavelength exceeds the average inter-particle separation. A typical wave dark matter halo exhibits granular substructures due to wave interference. In this paper, we explore the wave interference effects around caustics. These are locations of formally divergent density in cold collisionless systems. Examples include splashback in galaxy clusters, and tidal shells in merging galaxies, where the pile-up of dark matter close to apogee gives rise to caustics. We show that wave interference modifies the density profile in the vicinity of the caustics, giving rise to a fringe pattern well-described by the Airy function. This follows from approximating the gravitational potential as linear close to apogee. This prediction is verified in a series of numerical simulations in which the gravitational potential is computed exactly. We provide a formula expressing the fringe separation in terms of the wave dark matter mass and halo parameters, which is useful for interpreting and stacking data. The fringe separation near caustics can be significantly larger than the naive de Broglie scale (the latter set by the system's velocity dispersion). This opens up the possibility of detecting caustic fringes for a wide range of wave dark matter masses.</description>

      <title>SPINN: Advancing Cosmological Simulations of Fuzzy Dark Matter with Physics Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for solving differential equations by integrating physical laws into the learning process. This work leverages PINNs to simulate gravitational collapse, a critical phenomenon in astrophysics and cosmology. We introduce the Schr\"odinger-Poisson informed neural network (SPINN) which solve nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Poisson (SP) equations to simulate the gravitational collapse of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) in both 1D and 3D settings. Results demonstrate accurate predictions of key metrics such as mass conservation, density profiles, and structure suppression, validating against known analytical or numerical benchmarks. This work highlights the potential of PINNs for efficient, possibly scalable modeling of FDM and other astrophysical systems, overcoming the challenges faced by traditional numerical solvers due to the non-linearity of the involved equations and the necessity to resolve multi-scale phenomena especially resolving the fine wave features of FDM on cosmological scales.</description>

      <title>Euclid preparation. Constraining parameterised models of modifications of gravity with the spectroscopic and photometric primary probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Euclid mission has the potential to understand the fundamental physical nature of late-time cosmic acceleration and, as such, of deviations from the standard cosmological model, LCDM. In this paper, we focus on model-independent methods to modify the evolution of scalar perturbations at linear scales. We consider two approaches: the first is based on the two phenomenological modified gravity (PMG) parameters, $\mu_{\rm mg}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm mg}$, which are phenomenologically connected to the clustering of matter and weak lensing, respectively; and the second is the effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy and modified gravity, which we use to parameterise the braiding function, $\alpha_{\rm B}$, which defines the mixing between the metric and the dark energy field. We discuss the predictions from spectroscopic and photometric primary probes by Euclid on the cosmological parameters and a given set of additional parameters featuring the PMG and EFT models. We use the Fisher matrix method applied to spectroscopic galaxy clustering (GCsp), weak lensing (WL), photometric galaxy clustering (GCph), and cross-correlation (XC) between GCph and WL. For the modelling of photometric predictions on nonlinear scales, we use the halo model to cover two limits for the screening mechanism: the unscreened (US) case, for which the screening mechanism is not present; and the super-screened (SS) case, which assumes strong screening. We also assume scale cuts to account for our uncertainties in the modelling of nonlinear perturbation evolution. We choose a time-dependent form for $\{\mu_{\rm mg},\Sigma_{\rm mg}\}$, with two fiducial sets of values for the corresponding model parameters at the present time, $\{\bar{\mu}_0,\bar{\Sigma}_0\}$, and two forms for $\alpha_{\rm B}$, with one fiducial set of values for each of the model parameters, $\alpha_{\rm B,0}$ and $\{\alpha_{\rm B,0},m\}$.

      <title>TDCOSMO 2025: Cosmological constraints from strong lensing time delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03023v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present cosmological constraints from 8 strongly lensed quasars (hereafter, the TDCOSMO-2025 sample). Building on previous work, our analysis incorporated new deflector stellar velocity dispersions measured from spectra obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Keck Telescopes, and the Very Large Telescope (VLT), utilizing improved methods. We used integrated JWST stellar kinematics for 5 lenses, VLT-MUSE for 2, and resolved kinematics from Keck and JWST for RX J1131-1231. We also considered two samples of non-time-delay lenses: 11 from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) sample with Keck-KCWI resolved kinematics; and 4 from the Strong Lenses in the Legacy Survey (SL2S) sample. We improved our analysis of line-of-sight effects, the surface brightness profile of the lens galaxies, and orbital anisotropy, and corrected for projection effects in the dynamics. Our uncertainties are maximally conservative by accounting for the mass-sheet degeneracy in the deflectors' mass density profiles. The analysis was blinded to prevent experimenter bias. Our primary result is based on the TDCOSMO-2025 sample, in combination with $\Omega_{\rm m}$ constraints from the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae (SN) dataset. In the flat $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter (CDM), we find $H_0=72.1^{+4.0}_{-3.7}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. The SLACS and SL2S samples are in excellent agreement with the TDCOSMO-2025 sample, improving the precision on $H_0$ in flat $\Lambda$CDM to 4.4%. Using the Dark Energy Survey SN Year-5 dataset (DES-SN5YR) or DESI-DR2 baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) likelihoods instead of Pantheon+ yields very similar results. We also present constraints in the open $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, $w_0w_a$CDM, and $w_{\phi}$CDM cosmologies. The TDCOSMO $H_0$ inference is robust and consistent across all presented cosmological models, and our cosmological constraints in them agree with those from the BAO and SN.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Wormholes under f(R, T) Theory, the Karmarkar Condition and the Casimir Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, both the evolution of wormholes (by examining both the energy conditions and using the TOV equations) and the effects of the Karmarkar condition on the solutions obtained under certain specific cases were examined in the light of the $f(R,T)$ gravity theory, using two $f(R,T)$ functions predicted to describe the accelerated expansion of the universe. In this context, for the first time in the literature, a generalized shape function was obtained using the Karmarkar condition. It was observed that solutions of the type $R-a_{1}^2/R+a_{2}g(T)$ satisfy the energy conditions (with the dominant energy condition being partially satisfied), whereas solutions of the type $R+a_{1}^2R^2+a_{2}g(T)$ require the presence of exotic matter. In both cases, stable, static, and traversable wormhole solutions were obtained. By applying the Karmarkar condition to the $R+a_{1}^2R^2+a_{2}g(T)$ type solutions, which violate the energy conditions, the relationship between wormhole geometry and energy conditions was investigated. The study examined whether the Karmarkar condition eliminates the need for exotic matter, and it was found that the solutions do not remove the necessity of exotic matter. Additionally, it was demonstrated that a specific value of the parameter, ${\beta}$, which determines the radial variation of the shape function, could ensure the stability of the wormhole throat with the aid of Casimir energy. In other words, it is considered possible that the geometric evolution of the wormhole throat could trigger the transition from positive energy (baryonic matter) to negative energy (dark matter, dark energy, or other exotic matter) by inducing Casimir forces.</description>

      <title>Collisionless relaxation to quasi-steady state attractors in cold dark matter halos: origin of the universal NFW profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisionless self-gravitating systems such as cold dark matter halos are known to harbor universal density profiles despite the intricate non-linear physics of hierarchical structure formation in the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. The origin of these attractor states has been a persistent mystery, particularly because the physics of collisionless relaxation is not well understood. To solve this long-standing problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of inhomogeneous, self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governing Vlasov-Poisson equations. We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation that describes the secular evolution of the mean coarse-grained distribution function $f_0$ of accreted matter in the fluctuating force field of a halo. The diffusion coefficient not only depends on the fluctuation power spectrum but also on the evolving potential of the system, which reflects the self-consistency of the problem. Diffusive heating by an initially cored halo develops an $r^{-1}$ cusp in the density profile of the accreted material, with $r$ the halocentric radius. Subsequent accretion and relaxation around this $r^{-1}$ cusp develops an $r^{-3}$ fall-off, establishing the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile, a quasi-steady state attractor of collisionless relaxation that is not particularly sensitive to initial conditions. Given enough time though, the halo tends to Maxwellianize and develop an isothermal sphere profile. We demonstrate for the first time that the universal NFW profile emerges as an attractor solution to a self-consistent theory for collisionless relaxation.</description>

      <title>Blast-frozen Dark Matter and Modulated Density Perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-order phase transitions (FOPT) are ubiquitous in beyond the Standard Model physics and leave distinctive echoes in the history of early universe. We consider a FOPT serving the well-motivated role of dark matter mass generation and present {\it blast-frozen dark matter} (BFDM), which transitions from radiation to non-relativistic relic in a period much shorter than the corresponding Hubble time. Its cosmological imprint are strong oscillations in the dark matter density perturbations that seed structure formation on large and small scales. For a FOPT occurring not long before the matter-radiation equality, next generation cosmological surveys bear a strong potential to discover BFDM and in turn establish the origin of dark matter mass.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy from $F(R)$ Gravity Models Unifying Inflation with Dark Energy: Confronting the Latest Observational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A class of viable $F(R)$ gravity models which can provide a unified description of inflation with the dark energy era is confronted with the latest observational data on the dark energy era. These models have the unique characteristic that the de Sitter scalaron mass in the Einstein frame counterpart theory is a monotonic function of the curvature, which renders them viable descriptions for both the inflationary and the late-time acceleration eras. We also compare these models with other well-known viable $F(R)$ gravity models and with the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model. As we show, the most phenomenologically successful models are those which deviate significantly from the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model. Also some of the models presented, provide a statistically favorable description of the dark energy eras, compared with the exponential $F(R)$ gravity model and of course compared with the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model. All the models we present in this article are confronted with the observational data from the Planck collaboration, the Pantheon plus data from Type Ia supernovae, the two rounds of observations of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, data from baryon acoustic oscillations and the Hubble constant measurements by SH0ES group. As we show, two of the models are statistically favorable by the data.</description>

      <title>Four-point correlation functions in axion inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study parity violation in the early universe by examining the four-point correlation function within the axion inflation model. Using an open quantum system formalism from our previous work, we calculate the influence functional to fourth order, from which we then derive the inflaton four-point correlation function. When we decompose this function using isotropic basis functions, the expansion coefficients $\zeta_{\ell',\ell'',\ell'''}$ naturally split into parity-even and parity-odd components. In the large $\xi$ approximation, which enhances the production of right-handed photons in the model, the derivation of these coefficients simplifies. We work out the lowest-order nonvanishing parity-odd $\zeta_{234}$ term which clearly indicates the presence of parity violation. Moreover, our derived values of the coefficients are consistent with recent observational data from galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>On the Phase-Magnitude Relation in Gravitational Lensing: Reformulation and Applications of the Kramers-Kronig relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that the amplification factor, defined as the ratio of the lensed to the unlensed waveform in the frequency domain, satisfies the Kramers-Kronig (KK) relation, which connects the real and imaginary parts of the amplification factor for any lensing signal. In this work, we reformulate the KK relation in terms of the magnitude and phase of the amplification factor. Unlike the original formulation, the phase cannot be uniquely determined from the magnitude alone due to the possible presence of a Blaschke product. While this ambiguity does not arise in the case of a point-mass lens, it can appear in more complex lens models, such as those with an NFW lens profile. As an application of our formulation, we demonstrate that the leading-order behavior of the phase in the low-frequency regime is completely determined by the leading-order behavior of the magnitude in the same regime. This reproduces known results from the literature, derived via low-frequency expansions for specific lens models. Importantly, our result does not rely on any particular lens model, highlighting a universal feature that the low-frequency behavior of the amplification factor is tightly constrained by the KK relation. As a further application, we present two examples in which the phase is constructed from a given analytic form of the magnitude using the newly derived KK relation. In particular, the second example allows for an analytic evaluation of the KK integral, yielding an explicit expression for the phase. This study offers a potentially powerful method for applying the KK relation in model-agnostic searches for lensing signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the experimental simulation of cosmological perturbations governed by a Planck-scale induced Lorentz violating dispersion, aimed at distinguishing between early-universe models with similar power spectra. Employing a novel variant of the scaling approach for the evolution of a Bose-Einstein condensate with both contact and dipolar interactions, we show that scale invariance, and in turn, the duality of the power spectrum is broken at large momenta for an inflating gas, and at small momenta for a contracting gas. We thereby furnish a Planck-scale sensitive approach to analogue quantum cosmology that can readily be implemented in the quantum gas laboratory.</description>

      <title>Active galactic nuclei through the prism of galaxy clusters: bounds on axion-like particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypothetical axion-like particles (ALPs) are of interest because of their potential to act as dark matter or to reveal information about yet undiscovered fundamental constituents of matter. Such particles can be created when photons traverse regions of magnetic fields. The conversion probability depends on both the magnetic field parameters and photon energy, leading to multiple spectral absorption features as light passes through magnetized regions.
  Traditionally, astrophysical searches have focused on detecting such features in individual objects. However, the limited understanding of properties of cosmic magnetic fields have hindered the progress. Here we introduce a new approach by analyzing stacked (rather than individual) spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) positioned behind galaxy clusters -- gigantic magnetic field reservoirs. Stacking efficiently averages over the uncertainties in magnetic fields, revealing a unique step-like spectral signature of photon-to-ALP conversion.
  With this approach we advance into previously inaccessible regions of the ALP parameter space for nano-electronvolt masses. Adopting this method will significantly improve existing bounds across a wide range of masses by using different telescopes and increasing the size of the stacked datasets. The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, in particular, will extensively probe the parameter space where ALPs could serve as dark matter.</description>

      <title>About electroweak domain walls in Majoron models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some time ago it was claimed in "Spontaneous Breaking of Lepton Number and Cosmological Domain Wall Problem" (Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 151301 (2019)) that non perturbative instantons of the weak interaction $\text{SU}(2)_\text{W}$ lead to the formation of domain walls in Majoron models owing to the anomaly of the spontaneously broken global lepton number $L$ symmetry $\text{U}(1)_L$ with respect to $\text{SU}(2)_\text{W}$. We point out that it has long been known, that this effect can be completely rotated away unless there is a source of explicit $B+L$ breaking present, where $B$ denotes baryon number. We further estimate the tiny instanton induced Majoron mass from $B+L$ breaking and analyze the cosmological impact of such domain walls including possible finite temperature effects. In general this scenario does not lead to a cosmological catastrophe.</description>

      <title>Probing Dark Matter Spike with Gravitational Waves from Early EMRIs in the Milky Way Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold dark matter may form dense structures around supermassive black holes (SMBHs), significantly influencing their local environments. These dense regions are ideal sites for the formation of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), in which stellar-mass compact objects gradually spiral into SMBH, emitting gravitational waves (GWs). Space-based gravitational-wave (GW) observatories such as LISA and Taiji will be sensitive to these signals, including early-stage EMRIs (E-EMRIs) that persist in the low-frequency band for extended periods. In this work, we investigate the impact of dark matter-induced dynamical friction on E-EMRIs in the Milky Way Center, model its effect on the trajectory, and calculate the resulting modifications to the GW spectrum. Our analysis suggests that this influence might be sizable and lead to detectable deviations in the spectrum, namely suppression at low frequencies and enhancement at high frequencies, therefore providing a potential probe for dark matter with future GW detectors in space, such as LISA and Taiji.</description>

      <title>Scatter in the star formation rate-halo mass relation: secondary bias and its impact on line-intensity mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the impact of secondary bias -- specifically, the correlation between star formation rate (SFR) and halo bias at fixed halo mass -- on the line-intensity mapping (LIM) power spectrum. In LIM, the galaxy contributions are flux-weighted, and for many emission lines (e.g., H$\alpha$), flux scales with SFR. We show that the (ensemble-averaged) large-scale two-halo term of the power spectrum depends only on the mean luminosity-halo mass relation if the scatter is uncorrelated with halo bias. However, when luminosity correlates with halo bias at fixed mass, this assumption breaks down. In IllustrisTNG, this secondary bias increases the two-halo term by 5 per cent at $z \sim 1.5$ compared to a model with random scatter. We also find that SFRs of central and satellite galaxies are correlated, enhancing the one-halo term -- sensitive to intra-halo SFR distribution -- by 10 per cent relative to random pairings. To mitigate secondary bias in the two-halo term, we identify halo concentration (for haloes with mass $\log M_h \lesssim 12$) and satellite mass (for $\log M_h \gtrsim 12$) as effective secondary parameters. These results highlight the need to account for secondary bias when building mock catalogues and interpreting LIM observations.</description>

      <title>EIGER VII. The evolving relationship between galaxies and the intergalactic medium in the final stages of reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between galaxies and the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the late stages of cosmic reionization, based on the complete JWST EIGER dataset. Using deep NIRCam $3.5\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ slitless spectroscopy, we construct a sample of 948 [\OIII]$\lambda5008$-emitting galaxies with $-21.4\lesssim M_\mathrm{UV}\lesssim -17.2$ spanning $5.33&lt;z&lt;6.97$ along six quasar sightlines. We correlate these galaxies with \Lya\ and \Lyb\ transmission measured from high-resolution quasar spectra across multiple redshift intervals. We find clear redshift evolution in the correlation between galaxy density and transmission: it is suppressed in overdense regions at $z&lt;5.50$, while enhanced at $5.70&lt;z&lt;6.15$. The intermediate range exhibits a transitional behavior. Cross-correlation measurements further reveal excess absorption within $\sim 8$\,cMpc of galaxies at low redshifts, and enhanced transmission at intermediate scales ($\sim$5--20\,cMpc) at $z&gt;5.70$. Statistical tests using mock catalogs with realistic galaxy clustering but no correlation with the transmission field confirm that the observed correlations are unlikely to arise by chance. The evolving signals can be explained by stronger absorption in overdense regions, combined with the competing influences of local radiation fields and the rising background radiation. While local radiation dominates ionization of the surrounding IGM at earlier times, the background becomes increasingly important, eventually surpassing the impact of nearby galaxies. These results support an inside-out progression of reionization, with ionized regions originating around clustered, star-forming galaxies and gradually extending into underdense regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By measuring, modeling and interpreting cosmological datasets, one can place strong constraints on models of the Universe. Central to this effort are summary statistics such as power spectra and bispectra, which condense the high-dimensional data into low-dimensional representations. In this work, we introduce a modern set of estimators for computing such statistics from three-dimensional clustering data, and provide a flexible Python/Cython implementation; PolyBin3D. Working in a maximum-likelihood formalism, we derive general estimators for the two- and three-point functions, which yield unbiased spectra regardless of the survey mask and weighting scheme. These can be directly compared to theory without the need for mask-convolution. Furthermore, we present a numerical scheme for computing the optimal (minimum-variance) estimators for a given survey, which is shown to reduce error-bars on large-scales. Our Python package includes both general "unwindowed" estimators and their idealized equivalents (appropriate for simulations), each of which are efficiently implemented using fast Fourier transforms and Monte Carlo summation tricks, and additionally supports GPU acceleration using JAX. These are extensively validated in this work, with Monte Carlo convergence (relevant for masked data) achieved using only a small number of iterations (typically $&lt;10$ for bispectra). This will allow for fast and unified measurement of two- and three-point functions from current and upcoming survey data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16505v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate whether the Pre-Big Bang (PBB) scenario from string cosmology can explain the stochastic gravitational wave background signal reported in the NANOGrav 15-year dataset. Using Bayesian analysis techniques, we constrain the key parameters of the PBB model by comparing its theoretical predictions with the observed data. Our analysis yields $\beta = -0.12^{+0.06}_{-0.21}$ ($90\%$ credible interval) for the dilaton-dynamics parameter, which lies outside the theoretically allowed range $0 \leq \beta &lt; 3$ with more than $5\sigma$ confidence. Additionally, model comparison strongly favors a simple power-law spectrum over the PBB scenario, with a Bayes factor of approximately $468$. These results demonstrate that the PBB scenario, in its current formulation, cannot adequately explain the NANOGrav observations, highlighting the need for either significant modifications to the model or alternative explanations for the observed signal.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Constraints using the Void Size Function Data from BOSS DR16</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measure the void size function (VSF) from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS DR16) and perform the cosmological constraints. The BOSS DR16 galaxy sample is selected in the redshift range from $z = 0.2$ to 0.8, considering the selection criteria based on galaxy number density. We identify non-spherical voids from this galaxy catalog using the Voronoi tessellation and watershed algorithm without assuming any void shape. We select the void samples based on the void ellipticity, and derive the VSFs in two redshift bins, i.e. $z=0.2-0.5$ and $0.5-0.8$. The VSF model we use is based on the excursion-set theory, including the void linear underdensity threshold $\delta_{\rm v}$ and the redshift space distortion (RSD) parameter $B$. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is applied to perform the joint constraints on the cosmological and void parameters. We find that the VSF measurement from BOSS DR16 gives $w = -1.263_{-0.396}^{+0.329}$, $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.293_{-0.053}^{+0.060}$, and $\sigma_8 = 0.897_{-0.192}^{+0.159}$, which can be a good complementary probe to galaxy clustering measurements. Our method demonstrates the potential of using the VSF to study cosmological models, and it can provide a reference for future VSF analysis in the upcoming galaxy spectroscopic surveys.</description>

Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive study into the impact of pixelization on cosmic shear, uncovering several sources of bias in standard pseudo-$C_\ell$ estimators based on discrete catalogues. We derive models that can bring residual biases to the percent level on small scales. We elucidate the impact of aliasing and the varying shape of HEALPix pixels on power spectra and show how the HEALPix pixel window function approximation is made in the discrete spin-2 setting. We propose several improvements to the standard estimator and its modelling, based on the principle that source positions and weights are to be considered fixed. We show how empty pixels can be accounted for either by modifying the mixing matrices or applying correction factors that we derive. We introduce an approximate interlacing scheme for the HEALPix grid and show that it can mitigate the effects of aliasing. We introduce bespoke pixel window functions adapted to the survey footprint and show that, for band-limited spectra, biases from using an isotropic window function can be effectively reduced to zero. This work partly intends to serve as a useful reference for pixel-related effects in angular power spectra, which are of relevance for ongoing and forthcoming lensing and clustering surveys.</description>

      <title>An Alcock-Paczynski Test on Reionization Bubbles for Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an Alcock-Paczy\'nski (AP) test to constrain cosmology using HII bubbles during the Epoch of Reionization. Similarly to cosmic voids, a stack of HII bubbles is spherically symmetric because ionizing fronts propagate isotropically on average (even if individual bubbles may not be spherical), making them standard spheres to be used in an AP test. Upcoming 21-cm observations, from the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) for instance, will contain tomographic information about HII regions during reionization. However, extracting the bubbles from this signal is made difficult because of instrumental noise and foreground systematics. Here, we use a neural network to reconstruct neutral-fraction boxes from the noisy 21-cm signal, from which we extract bubbles using a watershed algorithm. We then run the purely geometrical AP test on these stacks, showing that a SKA-like experiment will be able to constrain the product of the angular-diameter distance $D_{\text{A}}$ and Hubble parameter $H$ at reionization redshifts with $\sim 2\%$ precision, robustly to astrophysical and cosmological uncertainties within the models tested here. This AP test, whether performed on 21-cm observations or other large surveys of ionized bubbles, will allow us to fill the knowledge gap about the expansion rate of our Universe at reionization redshifts.</description>

      <title>The Jiutian simulations for the CSST extra-galactic surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an overview of the Jiutian simulations, a hybrid simulation suite for the China Space Survey Telescope (CSST) extragalactic surveys. It consists of four complementary modules: the primary runs with high resolutions with the fiducial concordance cosmology, the emulator runs exploring the parameter uncertainties around the fiducial cosmology, the reconstruction runs intended for recovering the observed Universe position by position, and the extension runs employing extended cosmologies beyond the standard model. For the primary runs, two independent pipelines are adopted to construct subhaloes and merger trees. On top of them, four sets of mock galaxy light-cone catalogs are produced from semi-analytical models and subhalo abundance matching, providing a variety of observational properties including galaxy SED, emission lines, lensing distortions, and mock images. The 129 emulator runs are used to train the CSST emulator, achieving one percent accuracy in predicting the matter power spectrum over $k\leq 10h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $z\leq 2$. The reconstruction runs employ a number of subgrid baryonic models to predict the evolution and galaxy population resembling certain regions in the real Universe with constrained initial conditions, enabling controlled investigation of galaxy formation on top of structure formation. The extension runs cover models with warm dark matter, $f(R)$ gravity, interacting dark energy, and nonzero neutrino masses, revealing differences in the cosmic structure under alternative cosmological models. We introduce the specifications for each run, the data products derived from them, the corresponding pipeline developments, and present some main tests. Using the primary runs, we also show that the subhalo peak mass functions of different levels are approximately universal. These simulations form a comprehensive and open library for CSST surveys and beyond.</description>

      <title>Constraints on AvERA Cosmologies from Cosmic Chronometers and Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We constrain AvERA cosmologies in comparison with the flat $\Lambda$CDM model using cosmic chronometer (CC) data and the Pantheon+ sample of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The analysis includes fits to both CC and SN datasets using the \texttt{dynesty} dynamic nested sampling algorithm. For model comparison, we use the Bayesian model evidences and Anderson-Darling tests applied to the normalized residuals to assess consistency with a standard normal distribution. Best-fit parameters are derived within the redshift ranges $z \leq 2$ for CCs and $z \leq 2.3$ for SNe. For the baseline AvERA cosmology, we obtain best-fit values of the Hubble constant of ${H_0=68.32_{-3.27}^{+3.21}~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}}$ from the CC analysis and ${H_0=71.99_{-1.03}^{+1.05}~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}}$ from the SN analysis, each consistent within $1\sigma$ with the corresponding AvERA simulation value of $H(z=0)$. While both the CC and SN datasets yield higher Bayesian evidence for the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, they favor the AvERA cosmologies according to the Anderson-Darling test. We have identified signs of overfitting in each model, which suggests the possibility of overestimating the uncertainties in the Pantheon+ covariance matrix.</description>

      <title>A "Rosetta Stone" for Studies of Spatial Variation in Astrophysical Data: Power Spectra, Semivariograms, Structure Functions, and More</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From the turbulent interstellar medium to the cosmic web, astronomers in many different fields have needed to make sense of spatial data describing our Universe. Through different historical choices for mathematical conventions, many different subfields of spatial data analysis have evolved their own language for analysing structures and quantifying correlation in spatial data. Because of this history, terminology from a myriad of different fields is used, often to describe two data products that are mathematically identical. In this Note, we define and describe the differences and similarities between the power spectrum, the two-point correlation function, the covariance function, the semivariogram, and the structure functions, in an effort to unify the languages used to study spatial correlation. We also highlight under which conditions these data products are useful and describe how the results found using one method can be translated to those found using another, allowing for easier comparison between different subfields' native methods. We hope for this document to be a ``Rosetta Stone" for translating between different statistical approaches, allowing results to be shared between researchers from different backgrounds, facilitating more cross-disciplinary approaches to data analysis.</description>

      <title>Multi-component dark matter and Galactic 511 keV $\gamma$-ray emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study multi-component dark matter scenarios and the Galactic 511 keV $\gamma$-ray emission line signal in the framework of a local, dark $U(1)_D$ extension of the Standard Model. A light vector dark matter particle associated with the dark $U(1)_D$ may decay and annihilate to electron-positron pairs. The produced positrons may in turn form positroniums that subsequently annihilate to two photons, accounting for the observed line signal of the Galactic 511 keV $\gamma$-ray emission. Three scenarios are investigated. First, we consider the minimal $U(1)_D$ extension where a dark gauge boson and a dark Higgs boson are newly introduced to the particle content. As a second scenario, we consider WIMP-type dark matter with the introduction of an extra dark fermion which, in addition to the dark gauge boson, may contribute to the dark matter relic abundance. It is thus a multi-component dark matter scenario with a UV-complete dark $U(1)_D$ symmetry. In particular, the vector dark matter may account for a small fraction of the total dark matter relic abundance. Finally, we consider the scenario where the dark matter particles are of the FIMP-type. In this case, both the light vector and fermion dark matter particles may be produced via the freeze-in and super-WIMP mechanisms. Considering theoretical and observational constraints, we explore the allowed parameter space where the Galactic 511 keV $\gamma$-ray line signal and the dark matter relic can both be explained. We also discuss possible observational signatures.</description>

      <title>Optimised neural network predictions of galaxy formation histories using semi-stochastic corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel methodology to improve predictions of galaxy formation histories by incorporating semi-stochastic corrections to account for short-timescale variability. Our paper addresses limitations in existing models that capture broad trends in galaxy evolution, but fail to reproduce the bursty nature of star formation and chemical enrichment, resulting in inaccurate predictions of key observables such as stellar masses, optical spectra, and colour distributions. We introduce a simple technique to add a stochastic components by utilizing the power spectra of galaxy formation histories. We justify our stochastic approach by studying the correlation between the phases of the halo mass assembly and star-formation histories in the IllustrisTNG simulation, and we find that they are correlated only on timescales longer than 6 Gyr, with a strong dependence on galaxy type. We demonstrate our approach by applying our methodology to the predictions on a neural network trained on hydrodynamical simulations, which failed to recover the high-frequency components of star-formation and chemical enrichment histories. Our methodology successfully recovers realistic variability in galaxy properties at short timescales. It significantly improves the accuracy of predicted stellar masses, metallicities, spectra, and colour distributions and provides a practical framework for generating large, realistic mock galaxy catalogs, while also enhancing our understanding of the complex interplay between galaxy evolution and dark matter halo assembly.</description>

      <title>XMAGNET: Velocity structure functions of active galactic nucleus-driven turbulence in the multiphase intracluster medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Significant theoretical and observational efforts are underway to investigate the properties of turbulence in the hot plasma that pervades galaxy clusters. Spectroscopy has been used to study the projected line-of-sight velocities in both the hot intracluster medium and the cold gas phase using optical and X-ray telescopes. In this paper, we characterize the velocity structure functions of the multiphase intracluster medium in a simulated galaxy cluster core and study the effects of projections on the hot and cold phase of the gas. To do so, we use the fiducial run of the XMAGNET suite, a collection of exascale magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of a cool-core cluster, to compute velocity structure functions. The simulation includes radiative cooling as well as a model for active galactic nuclei feedback. Examining three-dimensional and line-of-sight velocity structure functions, we find no clear correlation between the behavior of the hot ($10^6\, \mathrm{K}\, \leq T \leq 10^8 \, \mathrm{K}$) and cold ($T\leq 10^5$ K) phases VSFs. Assuming a power law model for the VSF, we find that the power law index $m$ of the cold phase varies significantly throughout the 4 Gyr simulation time. We compare our VSFs with observations using mock optical and X-ray images, and conclude that projection effects significantly impact the amplitude and power law index of both the hot and cold phases. In the cold phase, applying a Gaussian smoothing filter to model effects of atmospheric seeing increases significantly the power law index of the projected VSF at scales below the filter's kernel size. Moreover, the VSF amplitude and power law index vary significantly depending on the viewing orientation. We conclude that observational biases such as projection effects, atmospheric seeing and the viewing angle cannot be ignored when interpreting line-of-sight velocity structure of the intracluster medium.</description>

      <title>Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1): From images to multiwavelength catalogues: the Euclid MERge Processing Function</title>

Abstract: The Euclid satellite is an ESA mission that was launched in July 2023. \Euclid is working in its regular observing mode with the target of observing an area of $14\,000~\text{deg}^2$ with two instruments, the Visible Camera (VIS) and the Near IR Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) down to $I_{\rm E} = 24.5~\text{mag}$ ($10\, \sigma$) in the Euclid Wide Survey. Ground-based imaging data in the \textit{ugriz} bands complement the \Euclid data to enable photo-$z$ determination and VIS PSF modeling for week lensing analysis. Euclid investigates the distance-redshift relation and the evolution of cosmic structures by measuring shapes and redshifts of galaxies and clusters of galaxies out to $z\sim 2$. Generating the multi-wavelength catalogues from \Euclid and ground-based data is an essential part of the \Euclid data processing system. In the framework of the \Euclid Science Ground Segment (SGS), the aim of the MER Processing Function (PF) pipeline is to detect objects in the \Euclid imaging data, measure their properties, and MERge them into a single multi-wavelength catalogue. The MER PF pipeline performs source detection on both visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) images and offers four different photometric measurements: Kron total flux, aperture photometry on PSF-matched images, template fitting photometry, and S\'ersic fitting photometry. Furthermore, the MER PF pipeline measures a set of ancillary quantities, spanning from morphology to quality flags, to better characterise all detected sources. In this paper, we show how the MER PF pipeline is designed, detailing its main steps, and we show that the pipeline products meet the tight requirements that Euclid aims to achieve on photometric accuracy. We also present the other measurements (e.g. morphology) that are included in the OU-MER output catalogues and we list all output products coming out of the MER PF pipeline.</description>

      <title>S-dual Quintessence, the Swampland, and the DESI DR2 Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19428v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a dark energy model in which a quintessence field $\phi$ rolls near the vicinity of a local maximum of its potential characterized by the simplest $S$ self-dual form $V(\phi) = \Lambda \ {\rm sech}(\sqrt{2} \, \phi/M_p)$, where $M_p$ is the reduced Planck mass and $\Lambda \sim 10^{-120} M_p^4$ is the cosmological constant. We confront the model with Swampland ideas and show that the $S$-dual potential is consistent with the distance conjecture, the de Sitter conjecture, and the trans-Planckian censorship conjecture. We also examine the compatibility of this phenomenological model with the intriguing DESI DR2 results and show that the shape of the $S$-dual potential is almost indistinguishable from the axion-like potential, $V (\phi) = m_a^2 \ f_a^2 \ [ 1 + \cos(\phi/f_a)]$, with $m_a$ and $f_a$ parameters fitted by the DESI Collaboration to accommodate the DR2 data. The self-dual potential has the advantage that one starts at the self-dual point and this is a theoretical motivation, because as the universe cools off the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry gets broken leading to a natural rolling away from the symmetric point.</description>

Abstract: We propose a mechanism for relaxing a gauge theory CP violating phase in discrete steps to very small values. The idea is that the CP violating phase includes the magnetic dual of a $4$-form flux which can discharge by the nucleation of membranes. Inside the bubbles surrounded by the membranes, the total CP violating phase is reduced. When the bubbles are produced rapidly during radiation domination in the early universe, near the chiral symmetry breaking scale, they will collide and percolate, melting away into gauge theory radiation and dramatically relaxing CP violation.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Galaxy Overdensities and Ionized Bubbles on Ly$\alpha$ Emission at $z\sim7.0-8.5$</title>

Abstract: Ly$\alpha$ spectroscopy with JWST is opening a new window on the sizes of ionized bubbles through the reionization epoch. Theoretical expectations suggest typical bubble radii should be 0.6-1.5 pMpc at $z\simeq 7$, assuming neutral hydrogen fractions of the intergalactic medium in the range $\overline{x}_{\rm HI}$=0.5-0.7. Here we investigate this picture using JWST to characterize the environment and Ly$\alpha$ emission of 292 galaxies at $7.0&lt;z&lt;8.5$ across 5 fields spanning a comoving volume of $1.3\times10^6$ Mpc$^3$. If the reionization predictions are correct, we should see overdensities and strong Ly$\alpha$ emission clustered in redshift windows of d$z=0.04-0.08$ and angular scales of 5-11 arcmin. We detect Ly$\alpha$ emission in 36 out of 292 galaxies, including nine new Ly$\alpha$ detections, two of which (in the UDS field) show extremely large equivalent widths (EW = $200_{-78}^{+50}$ A and $284_{-75}^{+56}$ A). We identify 13 significant (4-11$\times$) galaxy overdensities using redshifts from NIRCam grism and NIRSpec. Strong Ly$\alpha$ emitters are almost uniformly found in the overdensities, with nearly all located between the center and back of the structures. The overdensities that host the strong Ly$\alpha$ emitters span typical line-of-sight distances (d$z\sim 0.14$) and angular scales ($\sim 8$ arcmin) that are comparable to the predicted bubble sizes at $z\simeq 7$. We discuss evidence that the EGS is mostly ionized along a 24 pMpc sightline at $z\simeq 7.0-7.6$, based on the presence of 3 overdense structures and 10 Ly$\alpha$ emitters in this volume, and find such a large ionized region would pose tension with standard reionization models.</description>
