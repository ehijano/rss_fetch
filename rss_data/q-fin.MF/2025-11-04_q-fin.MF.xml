      <title>Robust Hedging of path-dependent options using a min-max algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an investor who wants to hedge a path-dependent option with maturity $T$ using a static hedging portfolio using cash, the underlying, and vanilla put/call options on the same underlying with maturity $ t_1$, where $0 &lt; t_1 &lt; T$. We propose a model-free approach to construct such a portfolio. The framework is inspired by the \textit{primal-dual} Martingale Optimal Transport (MOT) problem, which was pioneered by \cite{beiglbock2013model}. The optimization problem is to determine the portfolio composition that minimizes the expected worst-case hedging error at $t_1$ (that coincides with the maturity of the options that are used in the hedging portfolio). The worst-case scenario corresponds to the distribution that yields the worst possible hedging performance. This formulation leads to a \textit{min-max} problem. We provide a numerical scheme for solving this problem when a finite number of vanilla option prices are available. Numerical results on the hedging performance of this model-free approach when the option prices are generated using a \textit{Black-Scholes} and a \textit{Merton Jump diffusion} model are presented. We also provide theoretical bounds on the hedging error at $T$, the maturity of the target option.</description>

      <title>Differential Beliefs in Financial Markets Under Information Constraints: A Modeling Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the theory of McKean-Vlasov-type SDEs to study several problems related to market efficiency in the context of partial information and partially observable financial markets: (i) convergence of reduced-information market price processes to the true price process under an increasing information flow; (ii) a specific mechanism of shrinking biases under increasing information flows; (iii) optimal aggregation of expert opinions by a trader seeking a positive alpha. All these problems are studied by means of (conditional) McKean-Vlasov-type SDEs, Wasserstein barycenters, KL divergence and relevant tools of stochastic control and nonlinear filtering. We supply the theoretical results in (i)-(iii) with concrete simulations demonstrating how the proposed models can be applied in practice to model financial markets under information constraints and the arbitrage-seeking behavior of traders with differential beliefs.</description>

      <title>Robust utility maximisation under proportional transaction costs for c\`adl\`ag price processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00532v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider robust utility maximisation in continuous-time financial markets with proportional transaction costs under model uncertainty. For this purpose, we work in the framework of Chau and R\'asonyi (2019), where robustness is achieved by maximising the worst-case expected utility over a possibly uncountable class of models that are all given on the same underlying filtered probability space. In this setting, we give sufficient conditions for the existence of an optimal trading strategy, extending the result for utility functions on the positive half-line of Chau and R\'asonyi (2019) from continuous to general strictly positive c\`adl\`ag price processes and from complete to incomplete filtrations. Our result allows us to provide a positive answer to an open question pointed out in Chau and R\'asonyi (2019), and shows that the embedding into a countable product space is not essential.</description>

      <title>Martingale property and moment explosions in signature volatility models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the martingale property and moment explosions of a signature volatility model, where the volatility process of the log-price is given by a linear form of the signature of a time-extended Brownian motion. Excluding trivial cases, we demonstrate that the price process is a true martingale if and only if the order of the linear form is odd and a correlation parameter is negative. The proof involves a fine analysis of the explosion time of a signature stochastic differential equation. This result is of key practical relevance, as it highlights that, when used for approximation purposes, the linear combination of signature elements must be taken of odd order to preserve the martingale property. Once martingality is established, we also characterize the existence of higher moments of the price process in terms of a condition on a correlation parameter.</description>

      <title>Tackling estimation risk in Kelly investing using options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kelly criterion provides a general framework for optimizing the growth rate of an investment portfolio over time by maximizing the expected logarithmic utility of wealth. However, the optimality condition of the Kelly criterion is highly sensitive to accurate estimates of the probabilities and investment payoffs. Estimation risk can lead to greatly suboptimal portfolios. In a simple binomial model, we show that the introduction of a European option in the Kelly framework can be used to construct a class of growth optimal portfolios that are robust to estimation risk.</description>

      <title>Rough Path Signatures: Learning Neural RDEs for Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We tackle high-dimensional, path-dependent valuation and control and introduce a deep BSDE/2BSDE solver that couples truncated log-signatures with a neural rough differential equation (RDE) backbone. The architecture aligns stochastic analysis with sequence-to-path learning: a CVaR-tilted terminal objective targets left-tail risk, while an optional second-order (2BSDE) head supplies curvature estimates for risk-sensitive control. Under matched compute and parameter budgets, the method improves accuracy, tail fidelity, and training stability across Asian and barrier option pricing and portfolio control: at d=200 it achieves CVaR(0.99)=9.80% versus 12.00-13.10% for strong baselines, attains the lowest HJB residual (0.011), and yields the lowest RMSEs for Z and Gamma. Ablations over truncation depth, local windows, and tilt parameters confirm complementary gains from the sequence-to-path representation and the 2BSDE head. Taken together, the results highlight a bidirectional dialogue between stochastic analysis and modern deep learning: stochastic tools inform representations and objectives, while sequence-to-path models expand the class of solvable financial models at scale.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Price Formation on Trees: with Multi-Population and Non-Rational Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work solves the equilibrium price formation problem for the risky stock by combining mean-field game theory with the binomial tree framework, following the classic approach of Cox, Ross &amp; Rubinstein. For agents with exponential and recursive utilities of exponential-type, we prove the existence of a unique mean-field market-clearing equilibrium and derive an explicit analytic formula for equilibrium transition probabilities of the stock price on the binomial lattice. The agents face stochastic terminal liabilities and incremental endowments that depend on unhedgeable common and idiosyncratic factors, in addition to the stock price path. We also incorporate an external order flow. Furthermore, the analytic tractability of the proposed approach allows us to extend the framework in two important directions: First, we incorporate multi-population heterogeneity, allowing agents to differ in functional forms for their liabilities, endowments, and risk coefficients. Second, we relax the rational expectations hypothesis by modeling agents operating under subjective probability measures which induce stochastically biased views on the stock transition probabilities. Our numerical examples illustrate the qualitative effects of these components on the equilibrium price distribution.</description>

      <title>Critical Dynamics of Random Surfaces and Multifractal Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The critical dynamics of conformal field theories on random surfaces is investigated beyond the previously studied dynamics of the overall area and the genus. It is found that the evolution of the order parameter in physical time performs a generalization of the multifractal random walk. Accordingly, the higher moments of time variations of the order parameter exhibit multifractal scaling. The series of Hurst exponents is computed and illustrated at the examples of the Ising-, 3-state-Potts-, and general minimal models as well as $c=1$ models on a random surface. It is noted that some of these models can replicate the observed multifractal scaling in financial markets.</description>
