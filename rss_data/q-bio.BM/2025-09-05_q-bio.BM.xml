      <title>Modal Geometry Governs Proteoform Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fundamental laws governing proteoform dynamics have yet to be formulated. As a result, it is unclear how a specific proteoform, a distinct molecular variant of a protein, dynamically shapes its own future by evolving into new modes that exist only in potential until realised. Here, Modal Geometric Field (MGF) Theory couples real and abstract proteoform transitions through four axioms. Axioms 1 to 3 (invariant) dictate that only first-order transitions occur on the discrete, volume-invariant, non symplectic modal manifold. Axiom 4 (mutable) projects the occupancy and shape of a real, instantiated molecule into the modal manifold, generating occupancy-induced curvature. By coupling what is real to what is abstract, curvature, which is always conserved, governs proteoform dynamics by dictating the least-action modal transition. Because curvature distribution renders activation energy relative, barriers are mutable, and entropy emerges inevitably from curvature transport. This unification of energy, entropy, and curvature yields hysteresis, path dependence, fractal self similarity, and trajectories that oscillate between order and chaos. As a scale invariant and universal framework, MGF Theory reveals how modal geometry governs proteoform dynamics</description>

      <title>Morphology-Specific Peptide Discovery via Masked Conditional Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Peptide self-assembly prediction offers a powerful bottom-up strategy for designing biocompatible, low-toxicity materials for large-scale synthesis in a broad range of biomedical and energy applications. However, screening the vast sequence space for categorization of aggregate morphology remains intractable. We introduce PepMorph, an end-to-end peptide discovery pipeline that generates novel sequences that are not only prone to aggregate but self-assemble into a specified fibrillar or spherical morphology. We compiled a new dataset by leveraging existing aggregation propensity datasets and extracting geometric and physicochemical isolated peptide descriptors that act as proxies for aggregate morphology. This dataset is then used to train a Transformer-based Conditional Variational Autoencoder with a masking mechanism, which generates novel peptides under arbitrary conditioning. After filtering to ensure design specifications and validation of generated sequences through coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, PepMorph yielded 83% accuracy in intended morphology generation, showcasing its promise as a framework for application-driven peptide discovery.</description>

      <title>Diffusion on language model encodings for protein sequence generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03726v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein sequence design has seen significant advances through discrete diffusion and autoregressive approaches, yet the potential of continuous diffusion remains underexplored. Here, we present DiMA, a latent diffusion framework that operates on protein language model representations. Through systematic exploration of architectural choices and diffusion components, we develop a robust methodology that generalizes across multiple protein encoders ranging from 8M to 3B parameters. We demonstrate that our framework achieves consistently high performance across sequence-only (ESM-2, ESMc), dual-decodable (CHEAP), and multimodal (SaProt) representations using the same architecture and training approach. We extensively evaluate existing methods alongside DiMA using multiple metrics across two protein modalities, covering quality, diversity, novelty, and distribution matching of generated proteins. DiMA consistently produces novel, high-quality and diverse protein sequences and achieves strong results compared to baselines such as autoregressive, discrete diffusion and flow matching language models. The model demonstrates versatile functionality, supporting conditional generation tasks including protein family-generation, motif scaffolding and infilling, and fold-specific sequence design. This work provides a universal continuous diffusion framework for protein sequence generation, offering both architectural insights and practical applicability across various protein design scenarios.</description>

      <title>Cryo-em images are intrinsically low dimensional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11249v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference provides a powerful framework for cryo-electron microscopy, employing neural networks in methods like CryoSBI to infer biomolecular conformations via learned latent representations. This latent space represents a rich opportunity, encoding valuable information about the physical system and the inference process. Harnessing this potential hinges on understanding the underlying geometric structure of these representations. We investigate this structure by applying manifold learning techniques to CryoSBI representations of hemagglutinin (simulated and experimental). We reveal that these high-dimensional data inherently populate low-dimensional, smooth manifolds, with simulated data effectively covering the experimental counterpart. By characterizing the manifold's geometry using Diffusion Maps and identifying its principal axes of variation via coordinate interpretation methods, we establish a direct link between the latent structure and key physical parameters. Discovering this intrinsic low-dimensionality and interpretable geometric organization not only validates the CryoSBI approach but enables us to learn more from the data structure and provides opportunities for improving future inference strategies by exploiting this revealed manifold geometry.</description>
