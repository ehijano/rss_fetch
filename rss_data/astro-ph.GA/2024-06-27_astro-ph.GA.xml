      <title>Unveiling the role of magnetic fields in an accreting filament onto a young protocluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to develop a more comprehensive picture of star formation, it is essential to understand the physical relationship between dense cores and the filaments embedding them. There is evidence that magnetic fields play a crucial role in this context. We aim to understand how magnetic fields influence the properties and kinematics of an isolated filament located east of the Barnard 59 clump, belonging to the Pipe Nebula. We use near infrared polarization observations to determine the magnetic field configuration, and we apply the Davis Chandrasekhar Fermi method to infer the magnetic field strength in the plane of the sky. Furthermore, we use complementary data from the James Clerk Maxwell Submillimetre Telescope (JCMT) of C18O and 13CO J=3-2 transition to determine the filament's kinematics. Finally, we model the radial density profile of the filament with polytropic cylindrical models. Our results indicate that the filament is stable to radial collapse and is radially supported by agents other than thermal pressure. In addition, based on previous observations of emission lines on this source, we suggest that gas is flowing toward the hub, while C18O (3-2) non-thermal motions indicate that the cloud is in a quiescent state.</description>

      <title>The Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey (PIGS) X. Probing the early chemical evolution of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy with carbon abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon abundances, especially at low metallicity, reveal the early chemical evolution of a system, tracing the supernovae (SNe) that contributed and how much of their ejecta made it into the next stellar generation. Our sample from the \textit{Pristine} Inner Galaxy Survey (PIGS) includes $\sim 350$ metal-poor ([Fe/H]~$&lt;-1.5$) stars in the main body of Sgr with good quality spectroscopic observations. Our metal-poor Sgr population has a larger velocity dispersion than metal-rich Sgr from the literature, which could be explained by outside-in star formation, extreme Galactic tidal perturbations and/or the presence of a metal-rich disc/bar $+$ a metal-poor halo. The average carbon abundance in Sgr is similar to that of other classical dwarf galaxies (DGs) and consistently lower than in the Milky Way by $\sim0.2-0.3$~dex at low metallicity. The interstellar medium in DGs, including Sgr, may have retained yields from more energetic Pop III and II SNe, thereby reducing the average [C/Fe]. Additionally, SNe~Ia, producing more Fe than C, would start to contribute at lower metallicity in DGs/Sgr than in the Galaxy. The presence of a [C/Fe] gradient for Sgr stars with [Fe/H]~$\gtrsim-2.0$ ($\sim 6.8\times 10^{-4}$ dex arcmin$^{-1}$) suggests that SNe~Ia contributed in the system at those metallicities, especially in its inner regions. There is a low frequency of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in our Sgr sample. At higher metallicity/carbon abundance (mostly CEMP-s) this may be due to photometric selection effects, but those are less likely to affect CEMP-no stars. We propose that, given the lower average [C/Fe] in DGs, using the same CEMP definition ([C/Fe]~$&gt;+0.7$) as in the Galaxy under-predicts the number of CEMP stars in DGs, and for Sgr a cut at [C/Fe]$~\sim +0.35$ may be more appropriate, which brings the frequency of CEMP stars in agreement with that in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Not So Round: VLA Observations of the Starless Dark Matter Halo Candidate Cloud-9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations with FAST recently detected HI 21-cm emission near M94, revealing an intriguing object, Cloud-9, without an optical counterpart. Subsequent analysis suggests Cloud-9 is consistent with a gas-rich ($M_{\rm HI} \approx 10^{6} \ M_{\odot}$), starless dark matter (DM) halo of mass $M_{200} \approx 5 \times 10^{9} \ M_{\odot}$. Using VLA in D-array configuration, we present interferometric observations of Cloud-9 revealing it as a dynamically cold ($W_{50} \approx 12 \rm \ km \ s^{-1}$), non-rotating, and spatially-asymmetric system, exhibiting gas compression on one side and a tail-like structure towards the other, features likely originating from ram pressure. Our observations suggest Cloud-9 is consistent with a starless $\Lambda$CDM dark matter halo if the gas is largely isothermal. If interpreted as a faint dwarf, Cloud-9 is similar to Leo T, a nearby gas-rich galaxy that would fall below current optical detection limits at Cloud-9's distance ($d\approx 5 \rm \ Mpc$). Further observations with HST reaching magnitudes $m_{g} \approx 30$ would help identify such a galaxy or dramatically lower current limits to its stellar mass ($M_{\rm gal} \lesssim 10^{5} \ M_{\odot}$). Cloud-9 thus stands as the firmest starless DM halo candidate to date or the faintest galaxy known at its distance.</description>

      <title>An effective model for the tidal disruption of satellites undergoing minor mergers with axisymmetric primaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the hierarchical formation paradigm, galaxies form through mergers of smaller entities and massive black holes (MBHs), if lurking at their centers, migrate to the nucleus of the newly formed galaxy, where they form binary systems. The formation and evolution of MBH binaries, and in particular their coalescence timescale, is very relevant for current and future facilities aimed at detecting the gravitational-wave signal produced by the MBH close to coalescence. While most of the studies targeting this process are based on hydrodynamic simulations, the high computational cost makes a complete parameter space exploration prohibitive. Semi-analytic approaches represent a valid alternative, but they require ad-hoc prescriptions for the mass loss of the merging galaxies in minor mergers due to tidal stripping, which is not commonly considered or at most modelled assuming very idealised geometries. In this work, we propose a novel, effective model for the tidal stripping in axisymmetric potentials, to be implemented in semi-analytic models. We validate our semi-analytic approach against N-body simulations considering different galaxy sizes, inclinations, and eccentricities, finding only a moderate dependence on the orbit eccentricity. In particular, we find that, for almost circular orbits, our model mildly overestimates the mass loss, and this is due to the adjustment of the stellar distribution after the mass is removed. Nonetheless, the model exhibits a very good agreement with simulations in all the considered conditions, and thus represents an extremely powerful addition to semi-analytic calculations.</description>

      <title>Deriving the star formation histories of galaxies from spectra with simulation-based inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution galaxy spectra encode information about the stellar populations within galaxies. The properties of the stars, such as their ages, masses, and metallicities, provide insights into the underlying physical processes that drive the growth and transformation of galaxies over cosmic time.
  We explore a simulation-based inference (SBI) workflow to infer from optical absorption spectra the posterior distributions of metallicities and the star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies (i.e. the star formation rate as a function of time).
  We generated a dataset of synthetic spectra to train and test our model using the spectroscopic predictions of the MILES stellar population library and non-parametric SFHs. We reliably estimate the mass assembly of an integrated stellar population with well-calibrated uncertainties. Specifically, we reach a score of $0.97\,R^2$ for the time at which a given galaxy from the test set formed $50\%$ of its stellar mass, obtaining samples of the posteriors in only $10^{-4}$\,s. We then applied the pipeline to real observations of massive elliptical galaxies, recovering the well-known relationship between the age and the velocity dispersion, and show that the most massive galaxies ($\sigma\sim300$ km/s) built up to 90\% of their total stellar masses within $1$\,Gyr of the Big Bang. The inferred properties also agree with the state-of-the-art inversion codes, but the inference is performed up to five orders of magnitude faster.
  This SBI approach coupled with machine learning and applied to full spectral fitting makes it possible to address large numbers of galaxies while performing a thick sampling of the posteriors. It will allow both the deterministic trends and the inherent uncertainties of the highly degenerated inversion problem to be estimated for large and complex upcoming spectroscopic surveys, such as DESI, WEAVE, or 4MOST.</description>

      <title>Pulsational mode stability in complex EiBI-gravitating polarized astroclouds with (r, q)-distributed electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pulsational mode of gravitational collapse (PMGC) originating from the combined gravito-electrostatic interaction in complex dust molecular clouds (DMCs) is a canonical mechanisms leading to the onset of astronomical structure formation dynamics. A semi-analytic generalized model is formulated to examine the collective effects of polarization force, Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) gravity, and non-thermal (r, q)-distributed electrons on the stability of the PMGC concurrently. The ions are treated with the help of the Maxwellian thermo-statistical distribution law whereas the electrons are modelled with the non-thermal (r, q)-distribution law. The dust species including neutral and negatively charged particles are treated as fluids. A spherical normal mode analysis obtains a quartic linear dispersion relation for the PMGC. The oscillatory and propagation characteristics of the PMGC mode dynamics are investigated on a constructed numerical platform. It found that an increase in the polarization force and positive EiBI parameter significantly enhances the instability resulting in the DMC collapse, and vice versa. The electron non-thermality spectral parameters play a vital role as stabilizing factor. Its reliability and applicability are finally outlined in light of the previous astronomical studies in the same thematic direction.</description>

      <title>Chandra detects low-luminosity AGN with $M_\mathrm{BH}=10^{4}-10^{6}~M_\mathrm{\odot}$ in nearby ($z&lt;0.5$), dwarf and star-forming galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We searched the Chandra and XMM archives for observations of 900 green pea galaxies to find AGN signatures. Green peas are low-mass galaxies with prominent emission lines, similar in size and star formation rate to high-redshift dwarf galaxies. Of the 29 observations found, 9 show X-ray detections with $S/N&gt;3$. The 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity for these 9 sources exceeds $10^{40}~\mathrm{erg~s}^{-1}$, with 2 sources exceeding $10^{41}~\mathrm{erg~s}^{-1}$, suggesting the presence of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBH) or low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN) with BH masses between $100-10^6M_\mathrm{\odot}$. All X-ray detected sources (plus 6 additional sources) show He~II$\lambda4686$ emission and a broad component of the H$\alpha$ emission line, indicating winds. The line widths of the broad H$\alpha$ and He II$\lambda4686$ emitting gas clouds are weakly correlated ($R^{2}=0.15$), suggesting He II$\lambda4686$ emission is inconsistent with winds from super-Eddington accretors. However, the ratio of X-ray luminosity to star formation rate shows an anti-correlation with metallicity in 5 out of 9 X-ray detected sources, implying ultraluminous X-ray sources are key contributors to the observed X-ray luminosity. This could be due to super-Eddington accretors or IMBH. The X-ray emission is much higher than that produced by Wolf-Rayet stars and supernovae-driven winds. Thus, the X-ray luminosity in these 9 sources can only be explained by black holes with masses over $100~M_\mathrm{\odot}$. Our findings suggest the presence of LLAGN in these galaxies, with broad H$\alpha$ line widths implying BH masses of $10^4-10^6M_\mathrm{\odot}$. Given Green Peas' role as significant Lyman Continuum leakers, LLAGN in these galaxies could have contributed significantly to cosmic reionization.</description>

      <title>Tidal tails of open clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Open clusters that emerged from the star forming regions as gravitationally bound structures are subjected to star evaporation, ejection, and tidal forces throughout the rest of their lives. Consequently they form tidal tails that can stretch kiloparsecs along the cluster's orbit. Aims. Cluster members are typically found by searching for overdensities in some parameter space (positions and velocities or sometimes actions and orbital parameters of stars). However, this method is not effective in identifying stars located in the tidal tails far from the open cluster cores. We present a probabilistic method for finding distant cluster members without relying on searching for overdensities and apply it to 476 open clusters. Methods. First, we simulate the dissolution of a cluster and obtain a probability distribution (likelihood) describing where cluster members are to be found. The distribution of stars from the Gaia DR3 catalogue in high likelihood regions is then compared to the simulated stellar population of the Galaxy to define the membership probability of each star. Results. The survey of cluster members included all stars with a magnitude of G &lt; 17.5 and larger clusters with an age of &gt; 100 Myr within 3 kpc from the Sun. We successfully find stars with high membership probabilities in the tidal tails of most clusters, stretching more than a kiloparsec from the cluster cores in some cases. We analyse the morphological properties of tidal tails, demonstrate how properly normalised membership probabilities aid systematic studies of open clusters and publish a catalogue of stars found in the tidal tails.</description>

      <title>Galaxies Ages with Redshift z=2 to 4: Stellar Population Synthesis for Candidates in FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of large amount of massive galaxies with relatively old populations found at high redshifts are challenging galaxy formation scenarios within standard cosmology. Precise determinations of the average age of these galaxies would be useful for the discussion of this problem. Here we carry out a better constraint of the age of 200 V-shaped SED non-AGN galaxies at redshifts $2&lt;z&lt;4$ of the catalog of FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey, identified by V-shape in their spectral energy distribution (SED) with a Lyman and a Balmer break. SED fitting include a main stellar population in addition to a residual younger population and extinction. The galaxies are younger at higher redshift on average. However, for the galaxies with $z&gt;2.5$, we do not see a significant evolution of their average age, with all average ages of galaxies mostly remaining between 1 and 2 Gyr. Our research find that most massive galaxies ($\sim 10^{10} M_\odot$ ) are older (typically $&gt;\sim 1$ Gyr old) and formed earlier than less massive galaxies in our sample.</description>

      <title>Cloud Crushing and Dissipation of Uniformly-Driven Adiabatic Turbulence in Circumgalactic Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is responsive to kinetic disruptions generated by nearby astrophysical events. In this work, we study the saturation and dissipation of turbulent hydrodynamics within the CGM through an extensive array of 252 numerical simulations with a large parameter space. These simulations are endowed with proper cooling mechanisms to consistently explore the parameter space spanned by the average gas density, metallicity, and turbulence driving strength. A dichotomy emerges in the dynamics dissipation behaviors. Disturbances that are hot and subsonic are characterized by weak compression and slow dissipation, resulting in density fluctuations typically $\lesssim 10^{-2}$. Conversely, warm supersonic turbulence, marked by significant compression shocks and subsequent rapid cooling, is associated with substantial clumping factors $\sim 10^0-10^1$. In the supersonic cases, the kinetic energy decay is divided into a rate-limiting phase of shock dissipation and a comparatively swift phase of thermal dissipation, predominantly occurring within the overdense regions. Upon turbulence driving turnoff, the strong density contrasts decay within a relatively brief timescale of $\sim 30 - 300~{\rm Myr}$, depending on the average gas density. Dense clouds are crushed on similar timescales of $ \sim 30 - 100 ~{\rm Myr} $, depending on turbulence driving strength but independent from average gas density. Results of this work also contribute a novel dataset of dissipation timescales that incorporates an understanding of kinematics and thermodynamics in addition to the traditional cooling rate tables, which may serve as a valuable asset for forthcoming simulations that aim to explore gas dynamics on galactic and cosmological scales.</description>

      <title>Dynamical evolution of Milky Way globular clusters on the cosmological timescale I. Mass loss and interaction with the nuclear star cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Based on the Gaia DR3, we reconstructed the orbital evolution of the known Milky Way globular clusters and found that six objects, NGC 6681, NGC 6981, Palomar 6, NGC 6642, HP 1, and NGC 1904, very likely interact closely with the nuclear star cluster. Aims. We study the dynamical evolution of selected Milky Way globular clusters and their interactions with the Galactic centre over cosmological timescales. We examine the global dynamical mass loss of these globular cluster systems, their close interactions with the Galactic centre, and the potential capture of stars by the Milky Way nuclear star cluster. Methods. For the dynamical modelling of the clusters, we used the parallel N-body code phi-GPU, which allows star-by-star simulations of the systems. Our current code also enabled us to follow the stellar evolution of individual particles, including the formation of high-mass remnants. The modelling was carried out in a Milky Way-like, time-variable potential (with a dynamically changing mass and scale length), obtained from the IllustrisTNG-100 database, with a full integration time of eight billion years. Results. Based on extensive numerical modelling and analysis, we estimated the mass loss and the global and inner structures of the selected six clusters. Over an evolution of eight billion years, the clusters lost 80% of their initial mass. We analysed the phase-space evolution of the individual unbound stars NGC 6681, NGC 6642, HP 1, and NGC 1904. We found that only NGC 6642 could potentially have been a source for populating the Milky Way nuclear star cluster in the past.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Non-Thermal Pressure in Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between a galaxy cluster's hydrostatic equilibrium state, the entropy profile, $K$, of the intracluster gas, and the system's non-thermal pressure (NTP), within an analytic model of cluster structures. When NTP is neglected from the cluster's hydrostatic state, we find that the gas' logarithmic entropy slope, $k\equiv \mathrm{d}\ln K/\mathrm{d}\ln r$, converges at large halocentric radius, $r$, to a value that is systematically higher than the value $k\simeq1.1$ that is found in observations and simulations. By applying a constraint on these `pristine equilibrium' slopes, $k_\mathrm{eq}$, we are able to predict the required NTP that must be introduced into the hydrostatic state of the cluster. We solve for the fraction, $\mathcal{F}\equiv p_\mathrm{nt}/p$, of NTP, $p_\mathrm{nt}$, to total pressure, $p$, of the cluster, and we find $\mathcal{F}(r)$ to be an increasing function of halocentric radius, $r$, that can be parameterised by its value in the cluster's core, $\mathcal{F}_0$, with this prediction able to be fit to the functional form proposed in numerical simulations. The minimum NTP fraction, as the solution with zero NTP in the core, $\mathcal{F}_0=0$, we find to be in excellent agreement with the mean NTP predicted in non-radiative simulations, beyond halocentric radii of $r\gtrsim0.7r_{500}$, and in tension with observational constraints derived at similar radii. For this minimum NTP profile, we predict $\mathcal{F}\simeq0.20$ at $r_{500}$, and $\mathcal{F}\simeq0.34$ at $2r_{500}$; this amount of NTP leads to a hydrostatic bias of $b\simeq0.12$ in the cluster mass $M_{500}$ when measured within $r_{500}$. Our results suggest that the NTP of galaxy clusters contributes a significant amount to their hydrostatic state near the virial radius, and must be accounted for when estimating the cluster's halo mass using hydrostatic equilibrium approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a rigidly rotating, homogeneous ellipsoid of revolution threaded by a uniform, coaxial magnetic field is a possible figure of equilibrium. While the spheroidal shape is fully preserved, the rotation rate is modified. Accordingly, we extend the fundamental formula by Maclaurin. In contrast with the non-magnetic case, prolate shapes are permitted, but there are critical states in the form of maximum elongations, depending on ionisation fraction, ion/electron drift, magnetic field and mass-density. As checked from numerical simulations based on the Self-Consistent-Field method, prolate states survive to gas compressibility. The relevance to interstellar clouds is outlined.</description>

      <title>Rotation curves velocities obtained by warm low-density plasma simulating dark halos and dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The free electron model with Boltzmann statistics for spherical low-density plasmas is developed further with asymptotic relations obtaining the density of electrons, mass densities, and the potentials of such plasmas. Solutions are developed as function of a pure number proportional to the distance from the stellar plasma center (galaxy center) with extremely small coefficient, so that these solutions are essentially functions of large astronomical distances and masses. The present plasma is divided into a central part and very long tail, where the central part of the plasma shows an exponential dependence on the distance from the galaxy center, but a part of the large mass of this plasma is included in the long stellar plasma tail. The present model is specialized to completely ionized Hydrogen plasma (with a small correction factor considering its mixture with heavier atoms) where emission and absorption of spectral lines can be neglected in the warm low density stellar plasma. We apply the present approach for treating rotation curves measurements, A general theory for rotation curves should include the superposition of the gravitational potentials introduced by the high-density compact stars, with those of the low-density stellar plasma potentials. But for halos which are at extremely large distance from the galaxy center, the dominant effects would be those of dark matter, and such dark halos are permeating and surrounding the compact galactic stars. Such plasma is found to be transparent in most of the EM spectrum. The existence of a large mass for the warm low-density plasma may solve the problem of missing mass in rotation curves measurements.</description>

      <title>Diffuse interstellar bands in the near-infrared: Expanding the reddening range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the behaviour of three strong near-infrared diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) at {\lambda}13177 {\AA}, {\lambda}14680 {\AA}, and {\lambda}15272 {\AA}, on a larger sample of sightlines and over a wider range of extinctions than previously studied, utilizing spectra from three observatories. We applied two telluric correction techniques to reduce atmospheric contamination and have used Gaussian fits to characterise the DIB profiles and measure equivalent widths. We confirmed strong and approximately linear correlations with reddening of the {\lambda}13177 {\AA}, {\lambda}14680 {\AA} and {\lambda}15272 {\AA} DIBs, extending them to higher reddening values and strengthening their link to interstellar matter. Modelling of the {\lambda}14680 {\AA} DIB profiles revealed intrinsic variations, including line broadening, linked to their formation processes. This effect is particularly pronounced in the Galactic Centre (GC) environment, where multiple diffuse molecular clouds along the line of sight contribute to line broadening. We have detected one new DIB candidate at {\lambda}14795 {\AA} on sightlines with high reddening.</description>

      <title>M31 nucleus: molecular and ionised gas content upper limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report NOEMA and ALMA observations of the nucleus of Andromeda (M31), putting strong constraints on the presence of gas in the form of cold or warm phase, as proposed by Chang et al. M31 hosts the largest supermassive black hole (SMBH) closer than 1 Mpc from us. Its nucleus is silent with some murmurs at the level of 4 10$^{-9}$ L$_{Edd}$, and is surrounded by a 5-pc-radius disk of old stars. The mass-loss from these stars is expected to fill a molecular gas disk within the tidal truncation of 1 pc (0.26"), of 10$^4$ Mo, corresponding to a CO(1-0) signal of 2mJy with a linewidth of 1000km/s. We observed the nucleus with NOEMA in CO(2-1) and with ALMA in CO(3-2) with angular resolutions of 0.5" (1.9 pc) and 0.12" (0.46 pc) respectively. We exclude the presence of gas with a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of 195 Mo. The CO(3-2) upper limit also constrains warm gas, escaping detection in CO(1-0). The scenario proposed by Chang et al. is not verified, and instead the hot gas, expelled by the stellar winds, might never cool nor fall onto the disc. Alternatively, the stellar wind mass-loss rate can have been overestimated by a factor 50, and/or the ionised gas escaped from the nucleus. The SMBH in M31 is obviously in a low state of activity, similar to what is observed for Sgr A* in the Milky Way (MW). Recently, a cool (10$^4$ K) ionised accretion disc has been detected around Sgr A* in the H30$\alpha$ recombination line with ALMA. Re-scaling sizes, masses and fluxes according to the mass of M31's black hole (35 times higher than in the MW) and the distances, a similar disc could be easily detectable around M31 nucleus with an expected signal 8 times weaker that the signal detected in SgrA*. We searched for an ionised gas disc around M31 nucleus with NOEMA, and put a 3$\sigma$ upper limit on the H30$\alpha$ recombination line at a level twice lower than expected with a simple scaling of the SgrA*.</description>

      <title>Vector Resonant Relaxation and Statistical Closure Theory. I. Direct Interaction Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars orbiting a supermassive black hole in the center of galaxies undergo very efficient diffusion in their orbital orientations. This is "Vector Resonant Relaxation", a diffusion process formally occurring on the unit sphere. Such a dynamics is intrinsically non-linear, stochastic, and correlated, hence bearing deep similarities with turbulence in fluid mechanics or plasma physics. In that context, we show how generic methods stemming from statistical closure theory, namely the celebrated "Martin-Siggia-Rose formalism", can be used to characterize the correlations describing the redistribution of orbital orientations. In particular, limiting ourselves to the leading order truncation in this closure scheme, the so-called "Direct Interaction Approximation", and placing ourselves in the limit of an isotropic distribution of orientations, we explicitly compare the associated prediction for the two-point correlation function with measures from numerical simulations. We discuss the successes and limitations of this approach and present possible future venues.</description>

      <title>Fundamentalization of periods for first and second-overtone classical Cepheids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Almost half of all classical Cepheids do not pulsate in fundamental mode, and nowadays, the fundamentalization of their higher-mode periods is frequently applied to increase the sample size in astrophysical investigations and allow for comparison with fundamental-mode Cepheids. On the other hand, the relations used to obtain fundamentalized periods are either old or based on small samples that cover narrow period ranges. We used available data of 989 Cepheids pulsating in at least two modes to obtain modern, high-quality empirical fundamentalization relations applicable in a wide range of periods of first- and second-overtone Cepheids for metallicities typical for the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds. A clear correlation between the features of these relations and metallicity is seen, and periods with lower sensitivity to metallicity are identified. We also compare our results with double-mode Cepheids from the M31 and M33 galaxies. For the first galaxy, this indicates Cepheids have metallicities from supersolar to typical for the LMC, while for the latter, from solar to typical for the SMC. A general discussion of the usage of a different type of fundamentalization relations depending on the scientific problem is included.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Complex Ionization Environment of the Turbulent DM Tau Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ionization drives important chemical and dynamical processes within protoplanetary disks, including the formation of organics and water in the cold midplane and the transportation of material via accretion and magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) flows. Understanding these ionization-driven processes is crucial for understanding disk evolution and planet formation. We use new and archival ALMA observations of HCO+, H13CO+, and N2H+ to produce the first forward-modeled 2D ionization constraints for the DM Tau protoplanetary disk. We include ionization from multiple sources and explore the disk chemistry under a range of ionizing conditions. Abundances from our 2D chemical models are post-processed using non-LTE radiative transfer, visibility sampling, and imaging, and are compared directly to the observed radial emission profiles. The observations are best fit by a modestly reduced CR ionization rate ($\zeta_{CR}$ ~ 10$^{-18}$ s$^{-1}$) and a hard X-ray spectrum (hardness ratio [HR] = 0.3), which we associate with stellar flaring conditions. Our best-fit model under-produces emission in the inner disk, suggesting that there may be an additional mechanism enhancing ionization in DM Tau's inner disk. Overall, our findings highlight the complexity of ionization in protoplanetary disks and the need for high resolution multi-line studies.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Reionization in the JWST Era: Back to AGNs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep surveys with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed an emergent population of moderate-luminosity, broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at 4&lt; z&lt; 14 powered by accretion onto early massive black holes. The high number densities reported, together with the large Lyman-continuum (LyC) production efficiency and leakiness into the intergalactic medium (IGM) that are typical of UV-selected AGNs, lead us to reassess a scenario where AGNs are the sole drivers of the cosmic hydrogen/helium reionization process. Our approach is based on the assumptions, grounded in recent observations, that: (a) the fraction of broad-line AGNs among galaxies is around 10-15%; (b) the mean escape fraction of hydrogen LyC radiation is high, &gt;80%, in AGN hosts and is negligible otherwise; and (c) internal absorption at 4 ryd or a steep ionizing EUV spectrum delay full reionization of HeII until z~2.8-3.0, in agreement with observations of the HeII Lyman-alpha forest. In our fiducial models: 1) hydrogen reionization is 99% completed by redshift z~5.3-5.5, and reaches its midpoint at z~6.5-6.7; (2) the integrated Thomson scattering optical depth to reionization is ~0.05, consistent with constraints from cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data; and (3) the abundant AGN population detected by JWST does not violate constraints on the unresolved X-ray background.</description>

      <title>The OGLE Collection of Variable Stars: Over 18 000 Rotating Variables toward the Galactic Bulge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar rotation, a key factor influencing stellar structure and evolution, also drives magnetic activity, which is manifested as spots or flares on stellar surface. Here, we present a collection of 18 443 rotating variables located toward the Galactic bulge, identified in the photometric database of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) project. These stars exhibit distinct magnetic activity, including starspots and flares. With this collection, we provide long-term, time-series photometry in Cousins I- and Johnson V-band obtained by OGLE since 1997, and basic observational parameters, i.e., equatorial coordinates, rotation periods, mean brightness, and brightness amplitudes in both bands. This is a unique dataset for studying stellar magnetic activity, including activity cycles.</description>

      <title>Digging deeper into the dense Galactic globular cluster Terzan 5 with Electron-Multiplying CCDs. Variable star detection and new discoveries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. High frame-rate imaging was employed to mitigate the effects of atmospheric turbulence (seeing) in observations of globular cluster Terzan 5.
  Aims. High-precision time-series photometry has been obtained with the highest angular resolution so far taken in the crowded central region of Terzan 5, with ground-based telescopes, and ways to avoid saturation of the brightest stars in the field observed.
  Methods. The Electron-Multiplying Charge Coupled Device (EMCCD) camera installed at the Danish 1.54-m telescope at the ESO La Silla Observatory was employed to produce thousands of short-exposure time images (ten images per second) that were stacked to produce the normal-exposure-time images (minutes). We employed difference image analysis in the stacked images to produce high-precision photometry using the DanDIA pipeline.
  Results. Light curves of 1670 stars with 242 epochs were analyzed in the crowded central region of Terzan 5 to statistically detect variable stars in the field observed. We present a possible visual counterpart outburst at the position of the pulsar J1748-2446N, and the visual counterpart light curve of the low-mass X-ray binary CX 3. Additionally, we present the discovery of 4 semiregular variables. We also present updated ephemerides and properties of the only RR Lyrae star previously known in the field covered by our observations in Terzan 5. Finally, we report a significant displacement of two sources by ~0.62 and 0.59 arcseconds with respect to their positions in previous images available in the literature.</description>

Abstract: This white paper discusses the breadth of science related to active galactic nuclei (AGN) and associated phenomena to be enabled by a mission with microcalorimeter energy resolution in the soft X-ray band, a large collecting area, and wide-field imaging. Such a mission, the Line Emission Mapper (LEM), has been proposed to NASA's 2023 Astrophysics Probe Explorer call. While the science pillars of the PI-led part of the mission focus on galaxy evolution, the PI-led LEM All-Sky Survey (LASS) and General Observer/Investigator opportunities will enable vital discoveries for AGN science in the critical soft X-ray band.</description>

      <title>Rapid Response Mode observations of GRB 160203A: Looking for fine-structure line variability at z=3.52</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts are the most energetic known explosions. Despite fading rapidly, they allow to measure redshift and important properties of their host-galaxies. We report the photometric and spectroscopic study of GRB 160203A and its host-galaxy. Fine-structure absorption lines, detected in the afterglow at different epochs, allow us to investigate variability due to the strong fading background source. We obtained two optical to near-infrared spectra of the afterglow with X-shooter on ESO/VLT, 18 min and 5.7 hrs after the burst, allowing us to investigate temporal changes of fine-structure absorption lines. We measured HI column density log N(HI/cm-2)=21.75+/-0.10, and several heavy-element ions along the GRB sight-line in the host-galaxy: SiII,AlII,AlIII,CII,NiII,SiIV,CIV,ZnII,FeII, and FeII and SiII fine structure transitions from energetic levels excited by the afterglow, at a redshift z=3.518. We measured [M/H]TOT=-0.78+/-0.13 and [Zn/Fe]FIT=0.69+/-0.15, representing the total(dust-corrected) metallicity and dust depletion, respectively. We detected additional intervening systems along the line of sight at z=1.03,z=1.26,z=1.98,z=1.99,z=2.20 and z=2.83. We could not measure significant variability in the fine-structure lines throughout all the observations and determined an upper limit for the GRB distance from the absorber of d&lt;300 pc, adopting the canonical UV pumping scenario. However, we note that the quality of our data is not sufficient to conclusively rule out collisions as an alternative mechanism. GRB 160203A belongs to a growing sample of GRBs with medium resolution spectroscopy, provided by the Swift/X-shooter legacy program, which enables detailed investigation of the interstellar medium in high-redshift GRB host-galaxies. In particular, this host galaxy shows relatively high metal enrichment and dust depletion already in place when the universe was only 1.8 Gyr old.</description>

      <title>Effects of Two Quantum Correction Parameters on Chaotic Dynamics of Particles Near Renormalized Group Improved Schwarzschild Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A renormalized group improved Schwarzschild black hole spacetime contains two quantum correction parameters. One parameter $\gamma$ represents the identification of cutoff of the distance scale, and another parameter $\Omega$ stems from nonperturbative renormalization group theory. The two parameters are constrained by the data from the shadow of M87* central black hole. The dynamics of electrically charged test particles around the black hole are integrable. However, when the black hole is immersed in an external asymptotically uniform magnetic field, the dynamics are not integrable and may allow for the occurrence of chaos. % English Editor: %Please verify that the intended meaning has been retained. Employing an explicit symplectic integrator, we survey the contributions of the two parameters to the chaotic dynamical behavior. It is found that a small change of the parameter $\gamma$ constrained by the shadow of M87* black hole has an almost negligible effect on the dynamical transition of particles from order to chaos. However, a small decrease in the parameter $\Omega$ leads to an enhancement in the strength of chaos from the global phase space structure. A theoretical interpretation is given to the different contributions. The term with the parameter $\Omega$ dominates the term with the parameter $\gamma$, even if the two parameters have same values. % English Editor: Please verify %that the intended meaning has been retained. In particular, the parameter $\Omega$ acts as a repulsive force, and its decrease means a weakening of the repulsive force or equivalently enhancing the attractive force from the black hole. On the other hand, there is a positive Lyapunov exponent that is universally given by the surface gravity of the black hole when $\Omega\geq 0$ is small and the external magnetic field vanishes.</description>

      <title>Hybrid approach predicts a lower binding energy for benzene on water ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a highly accurate value for the binding energy of benzene to proton-ordered crystalline water ice (XIh), as a model for interstellar ices. We compare our computed value to the latest experimental data available from temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and find that our binding energy value agrees well with data obtained from binding to either crystalline or amorphous ice. Importantly, our new value is lower than that used in most astrochemical networks by about nearly half its value. We explore the impact of this revised binding energy value for both an AGB outflow and a protoplanetary disk. We find that the lower value of the binding energy predicted here compared with values used in the literature (4050 K versus 7587 K) leads to less depletion of gas-phase benzene in an AGB outflow, and leads to a shift outwards in the benzene snowline in the midplane of a protoplanetary disk. Using this new value, the AGB model predicts lower abundances of benzene in the solid phase throughout the outflow. The disk model also predicts a larger reservoir of gas-phase benzene in the inner disk, which is consistent with the recent detections of benzene for the first time in protoplanetary disks with JWST.</description>

      <title>Origin of extended Main Sequence Turn Off in open cluster NGC 2355</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of extended Main Sequence Turn-Off (eMSTO) in the open clusters has been attributed to various factors, such as spread in rotation rates, binary stars, and dust-like extinction from stellar excretion discs. We present a comprehensive analysis of the eMSTO in the open cluster NGC 2355. Using spectra from the Gaia-ESO archives, we find that the stars in the red part of the eMSTO have a higher mean v sin i value of 135.3$\pm$4.6 km s$^{-1}$ compared to the stars in the blue part that have an average v sin i equal to 81.3$\pm$5.6 km s$^{-1}$. This suggests that the eMSTO in NGC 2355 is possibly caused by the spread in rotation rates of stars. We do not find any substantial evidence of the dust-like extinction from the eMSTO stars using ultraviolet data from the Swift survey. The estimated synchronization time for low mass ratio close binaries in the blue part of the eMSTO suggests that they would be mostly slow-rotating if present. However, the stars in the blue part of the eMSTO are preferentially located in the outer region of the cluster indicating that they may lack low mass ratio close binaries. The spread in rotation rates of eMSTO stars in NGC 2355 is most likely caused by the star-disc interaction mechanism. The stars in the lower main sequence beyond the eMSTO region of NGC 2355 are slow-rotating (mean v sin i = 26.5$\pm$1.3 km s$^{-1}$) possibly due to the magnetic braking of their rotations.</description>

      <title>Estimating the mass-to-distance ratio for a set of megamaser AGN black holes by employing a general relativistic method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06486v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Motivated by the recent achievements of a full general relativistic method in determining black hole (BH) parameters, we continue to estimate the mass-to-distance ratio of the supermassive BHs hosted at the core of the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) of the megamaser galaxies NGC 1320, NGC 1194, NGC 5495, and Mrk 1029. Aims. Our aim is to study the properties of super massive BHs at the centers of the selected AGNs by using a full general relativistic method that allows us to address the potential detection of relativistic effects within such astrophysical systems. Methods. In order to perform statistical estimations with publicly available observational data, we used a general relativistic model that describes BH rotation curves and further employed a Bayesian fitting method. Results. We estimated the mass-to-distance ratio of the aforementioned BHs, their position and the recessional redshifts of the host galaxies produced by both peculiar motion and cosmological expansion of the Universe. Finally, we calculated the gravitational redshift of the closest maser to the BH for each AGN. This gravitational redshift is a general relativistic effect produced by the gravitational field of the BH properly included in the modelling.</description>

      <title>Stellar/BH Population in AGN Disks: Direct Binary Formation from Capture Objects in Nuclei Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09129v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Active Galatic Nuclei(AGN) disk has been proposed as a potential channel for the merger of binary black holes. The population of massive stars and black holes in AGN disks captured from the nuclei cluster plays a crucial role in determining the efficiency of binary formation and final merger rate within the AGN disks. In this paper, we investigate the capture process using analytical and numerical approaches. We discover a new constant integral of motion for one object's capture process. Applying this result to the whole population of the nuclei cluster captured by the AGN disk, we find that the population of captured objects depends on the angular density and eccentricity distribution of the nuclei clusters and is effectively independent of the radial density profile of the nuclei cluster and disk models. An isotropic nuclei cluster with thermal eccentricity distribution predicts a captured profile $d N/d r \propto r^{-1/4}$. The captured objects are found to be dynamically crowded within the disk. Direct binary formation right after the capture would be promising, especially for stars. The conventional migration traps that help pile up single objects in AGN disks for black hole mergers might not be required.</description>

      <title>Ly$\alpha$ emission as a sensitive probe of feedback-regulated LyC escape from dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ly$\alpha$ emission is an exceptionally informative tracer of the life cycle of evolving galaxies and the escape of ionising photons. However, theoretical studies of Ly$\alpha$ emission are often limited by insufficient numerical resolution, incomplete sets of physical models, and poor line-of-sight (LOS) statistics. To overcome such limitations, we utilize here the novel PANDORA suite of high-resolution dwarf galaxy simulations that include a comprehensive set of state-of-the-art physical models for ionizing radiation, magnetic fields, supernova feedback and cosmic rays. We post-process the simulations with the radiative transfer code \textsc{RASCAS} to generate synthetic observations and compare to observed properties of Ly$\alpha$ emitters. Our simulated Ly$\alpha$ haloes are more extended than the spatial region from which the intrinsic emission emanates and our spatially resolved maps of spectral parameters of the Ly$\alpha$ emission are very sensitive to the underlying spatial distribution and kinematics of neutral hydrogen. Ly$\alpha$ and LyC emission display strongly varying signatures along different LOS depending on how each LOS intersects low-density channels generated by stellar feedback. Comparing galaxies simulated with different physics, we find the Ly$\alpha$ signatures to exhibit systematic offsets determined by the different levels of feedback strength and the clumpiness of the neutral gas. Despite this variance, and regardless of the different physics included in each model, we find universal correlations between Ly$\alpha$ observables and LyC escape fraction, demonstrating a robust connection between Ly$\alpha$ and LyC emission. Ly$\alpha$ observations from a large sample of dwarf galaxies should thus give strong constraints on their stellar feedback-regulated LyC escape and confirm their important role for the reionization of the Universe.</description>

      <title>A merger-driven scenario for clumpy galaxy formation in the epoch of reionization: Physical properties of clumps in the FirstLight simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations with superb angular resolution have revealed the existence of clumpy galaxies at high redshift through the detection of rest-frame optical emission lines. We use the FirstLight simulation to study the properties of (sub-)galactic clumps that are bright in [OIII] 5007$\mathrm{\mathring{A}}$ line with flux greater than $\sim 10^{-18} \, {\rm erg\, s^{-1}\, cm^{-2}}$, to be detected by JWST. For 62 simulated galaxies that have stellar masses of $(0.5-6) \times 10^{10} \, M_\odot$ at $z=5$, we find clumps in 1828 snapshots in the redshift range $z = 9.5-5.5$. The clumps are identified by the surface density of star formation rate. About one-tenth of the snapshots show the existence of clumpy systems with two or more components. Most of the clumps are formed by mergers and can be characterized by their ages; central clumps dominated by stellar populations older than 50 Myr, and off-centered clumps dominated by younger stellar populations with specific star formation rates of $\sim 50 \, {\rm Gyr^{-1}}$. The latter type of young clumps is formed from gas debris in the tidal tails of major mergers with baryonic mass ratios of $1 \leq q &lt; 4$. The merger-induced clumps are short-lived, and merge within a dynamical time of several tens million years. The number density of the clumpy systems is estimated to be $\sim 10^{-5}\, {\rm cMpc^{-3}}$, which is large enough to be detected in recent JWST surveys.</description>

      <title>Imaging of I Zw 18 by JWST. I. Strategy and First Results of Dusty Stellar Populations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a JWST imaging survey of I Zw 18, the archetypal extremely metal-poor, star-forming (SF), blue compact dwarf galaxy. With an oxygen abundance of only $\sim$3% $Z_{\odot}$, it is among the lowest-metallicity systems known in the local Universe, and is, therefore, an excellent accessible analog for the galactic building blocks which existed at early epochs of ionization and star formation. These JWST data provide a comprehensive infrared (IR) view of I Zw 18 with eight filters utilizing both Near Infrared Camera (F115W, F200W, F356W, and F444W) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (F770W, F1000W, F1500W, and F1800W) photometry, which we have used to identify key stellar populations that are bright in the near- and mid-IR. These data allow for a better understanding of the origins of dust and dust-production mechanisms in metal-poor environments by characterizing the population of massive, evolved stars in the red supergiant (RSG) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phases. In addition, it enables the identification of the brightest dust-enshrouded young stellar objects (YSOs), which provide insight into the formation of massive stars at extremely low metallicities typical of the very early Universe. This paper provides an overview of the observational strategy and data processing, and presents first science results, including identifications of dusty AGB, RSG, and bright YSO candidates. These first results assess the scientific quality of JWST data and provide a guide for obtaining and interpreting future observations of the dusty and evolved stars inhabiting compact dwarf SF galaxies in the local Universe.</description>

      <title>Kinematics and metallicity of the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Andromeda XVIII</title>

Abstract: Andromeda XVIII is an isolated dwarf galaxy 579 kpc away from the nearest large galaxy, M31. It is a candidate "backsplash galaxy" that might have been affected by a close passage to M31. We present new Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy of Andromeda XVIII to assess the likelihood that it is a backsplash galaxy. We estimated the velocities, metallicities ([Fe/H]), and $\alpha$-enhancements ([$\alpha$/Fe]) for 56 probable members. Based on the abundances of 38 stars with low errors ($\delta [Fe/H] &lt; 0.3$), parameters for the simplest chemical evolution models were estimated using maximum likelihood coupled with an MCMC. The metallicity distribution is inconsistent with these models due to a sharp metal-rich cut-off. We estimated Andromeda XVIII's mean heliocentric velocity, rotation velocity, position angle of the rotation axis, and velocity dispersion using maximum likelihood coupled with a Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC). There is no evidence for bulk rotation, though sub-populations might be rotating. The mean heliocentric velocity is -337.2 km s$^{-1}$, so that the line-of-sight velocity relative to M31 is lower than the escape velocity from M31. Together, the metallicity distribution and the mean velocity are consistent with a sudden interruption of star formation. For possible causes for this quenching, we considered gas loss due to ram pressure stripping during a close passage by M31, and due to a past major merger. However, we cannot rule out internal feedback (i.e., a terminal wind).</description>

Abstract: Tidal interactions between galaxies often give rise to tidal tails, which can harbor concentrations of stars and interstellar gas resembling dwarf galaxies. Some of these tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs) have the potential to detach from their parent galaxies and become independent entities, but their long-term survival is uncertain. In this study, we conducted a search for detached TDGs associated with a sample of 39 interacting galaxy pairs in the local Universe using infrared, ultraviolet, and optical images. We employed IR colors and UV/optical/IR spectral energy distributions to identify potential interlopers, such as foreground stars or background quasars. Through spectroscopic observations using the Boller and Chivens spectrograph at San Pedro M\'artir Observatory, we confirmed that six candidate TDGs are at the same redshift as their putative parent galaxy pairs. We identified and measured emission lines in the optical spectra and calculated nebular oxygen abundances, which range from log(O/H) = 8.10 $\pm$ 0.01 to 8.51 $\pm$ 0.02. We have serendipitously discovered an additional detached TDG candidate in Arp72 using available spectra from SDSS. Utilizing the photometric data and the CIGALE code for stellar population and dust emission fitting, we derived the stellar masses, stellar population ages, and stellar metallicities for these detached TDGs. Compared to standard mass-metallicity relations for dwarf galaxies, five of the seven candidates have higher than expected metallicities, confirming their tidal origins. One of the seven candidates remains unclear due to large uncertainties in metallicity, and another has stellar and nebular metallicities compatible with those of a preexisting dwarf galaxy. The latter object is relatively compact in the optical relative to its stellar mass, in contrast to the other candidate TDGs [abridged].</description>

      <title>Emergence of red, star-forming galaxies (red misfits) in a {\Lambda}CDM universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of red misfits (RM) using a cosmological, hydrodynamical simulation from the $\rm \small EAGLE$ project. Similar to observations, the RM possess less dust, higher stellar metallicities, and older stellar populations compared to blue, star-forming galaxies (BA) at the same $M_\star$. Lagrangian particle-tracking reveals that the older ages of RM have resulted from a combined effect of higher star formation efficiency (SFE), and the earlier onset and faster net depletion of their interstellar medium (ISM). For the centrals, the latter was partially due to higher efficiency of escape from ISM, driven by stronger stellar and/or AGN feedback (depending on the mass). There was an additional contribution to this escape from gas stripping for satellite RM, as suggested by the higher group masses ($\gtrsim 0.5$ dex) and ${\rm H_2}/{\rm H\,{\small I}}$ ratios ($\gtrsim 0.3$ dex). Moreover, accretion of circumgalactic gas (CGM) onto the galaxy has been less efficient for the satellites. On the metallicity front, the offsets are largely due to the disparity in SFE, causing varying degrees of enrichment through the mass-transfers associated with stellar winds and supernovae. We ascribe this SFE disparity to the lower specific angular momentum ($j$) of freshly accreted CGM for RM, which ultimately manifested in the ISM kinematics due to interactions with cooling flows. The impact on $j_{\rm ism}$ was further intensified by poorer alignment with the flow's $\vec{j}$, particularly for the satellites. Our results illuminate potential origins of RM, and motivate further exploration of this peculiar class through a synergy between observations and simulations.</description>

Abstract: Removing cold interstellar medium (ISM) from a galaxy is central to quenching star formation. However, the exact mechanism of this process remains unclear. The objective of this work is to find the mechanism responsible for dust and gas removal in simulated early-type galaxies (ETGs). A statistically significant sample of massive (M_*&gt;$10^{10}$M$_\odot$), simulated ETG in a redshift range of 0.02--0.32 is studied in the context of its ISM properties. In particular, we investigate the cold dust and gas removal timescales, the cold gas inflows, and their relation with black hole (BH) mass. We also investigate the evolution of galaxies in the dust vs. star formation rate (SFR) plane and the influence of merger events. We find agreement with previous observational works considering the timescales of dust and HI removal from ETGs. When considering the dust-to-stellar mass ratio as a function of time in simulations, we recovered a similar decline as in the observational sample as a function of stellar age, validating its use for timing the ISM decline. Moreover, we recover the observed relation between dust mass and SFR for actively star-forming galaxies as well as for passive ETGs. We also show that starburst galaxies form their own sequence on the dust vs. SFR plot in a form $\log(M_{\rm dust, SB})= 0.913\times \log({\rm SFR}) + 6.533$ with $2\sigma$ scatter of 0.32. Finally, we find that type II supernova reverse shocks dominate the dust destruction at the early stages of ETG evolution, while at later times stellar feedback becomes more important. We show that merger events lead to morphological transformations by increasing the bulge-to-total stellar mass ratio followed by an increase in BH masses. The BH feedback resulting from radio mode accretion prevents the hot halo gas from cooling, indirectly leading to a decrease in the SFR.</description>

      <title>Impact of stellar population synthesis choices on forward modelling-based redshift distribution estimates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The forward modelling of galaxy surveys has recently gathered interest as one of the primary methods to achieve the required precision on the estimate of the redshift distributions for stage IV surveys. One of the key aspects of forward modelling a galaxy survey is the connection between the physical properties drawn from a galaxy population model and the intrinsic SEDs, achieved through SPS codes (e.g. FSPS). However, SPS requires a large number of detailed assumptions on the constituents of galaxies, for which the model choice or parameter values are currently uncertain. In this work, we perform a sensitivity study of the impact that the variations of the SED modelling choices have on the mean and scatter of the tomographic galaxy redshift distributions. We assumed the Prospector beta model as the fiducial input galaxy population model and used its SPS parameters to build 9 bands magnitudes of a fiducial sample of galaxies. We then built samples of galaxy magnitudes by varying one SED modelling choice at a time. We modelled the colour redshift relation of these galaxy samples using the SOM approach. We placed galaxies in the SOM cells according to their observed frame colours and used their cell assignment to build colour selected tomographic bins. Finally, we compared each variant's binned redshift distributions against the estimates obtained for the fiducial model. We find that the SED components related to the IMF, AGNs, gas physics, and the attenuation law substantially bias the mean and the scatter of the tomographic redshift distributions with respect to those estimated with the fiducial model. Regardless of the applied stellar mass function based re-weighting strategy, the bias in the mean and the scatter of the tomographic redshift distributions are greater than the precision requirements set by next-generation Stage IV galaxy surveys, such as LSST and Euclid.</description>
