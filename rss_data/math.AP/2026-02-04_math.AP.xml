      <title>Revisiting Non-Rotating Star Models: Classical Existence and Uniqueness Theory and Scaling Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study of the properties of non-rotating stellar models governed by the Euler-Poisson system under general equations of state, including the case of polytropic gaseous stars. We revisit and extend existence results by Auchmuty and Beals \cite{AB71}, adapt the uniqueness results from the quantum mechanical framework of Lieb and Yau \cite{LY87} to the classical Newtonian mechanical setting. The results are also synthesized in McCann \cite{McC06} but without proof. The second work we do is applying a scaling method to establish relations between solutions with different total masses. As the mass tends to zero, we analyze convergence properties of the density functions and identify precise rates for the contraction or extension of their supports.</description>

      <title>Scattering and stability for ODE-type blow-up surfaces for focusing nonlinear wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the focusing power nonlinear wave equation with any power, in Minkowski space of any spacetime dimension. We present a complete understanding of the local stability and scattering theory (both in high regularity spaces) for solutions exhibiting ODE type blow-up on spacelike hypersurfaces, with the blow-up at each point modelled by the explicit solution $\phi_{\mathrm{model}} = c_p t^{-\alpha_p}$.
  Given a sufficiently regular spacelike hypersurface $\Sigma_f$, together with auxiliary scattering data $\psi$, we construct the unique corresponding solution to the nonlinear wave equation that (locally) forms an ODE type singularity on $\Sigma_f$ attaining $\psi$ as scattering data. Conversely, we show that such ODE type singularities are (locally) stable to suitably regular perturbations away from the singularity, and that the blow-up surface and scattering data remain regular, in a continuously dependent manner, following such perturbations.</description>

      <title>Existence for Stable Rotating Star-Planet Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the existence and properties of stable, uniformly rotating star-planet systems, i.e. mass ratio is sufficiently small. It is modeled by the Euler-Poisson equations. Following the framework established by McCann for binary stars \cite{McC06}, we adopt a variational approach, and prove the existence of local energy minimizers with respect to the Wasserstein $L^\infty$ metric, under the assumed equation of state $P(\rho)=K\rho^\gamma$ and under the condition that the mass ratio $m$ is sufficiently small, corresponding to a star-planet system. Such minimizers correspond to solutions of the Euler-Poisson system. We consider two cases. For $\gamma &gt; 2$, we not only prove existence but also show, via scaling arguments, that the radii (to be precise, the bounds of the supports of the minimizers) tend to zero. For $\frac{3}{2} &lt; \gamma \leq 2$, we estimate an upper bound for the (potential) expansion rates of the radii, and it turns out that the existence result remains valid in this case as well. Finally, we provide estimates for the distances between different connected components of supports of minimizers and propose a conjecture regarding the number of connected components.</description>

      <title>Lack of uniqueness for an elliptic equation with nonlinear and nonlocal drift posed on a torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a nonlinear and nonlocal elliptic equation posed on the flat torus. While constant solutions always exist, we show that uniqueness fails in general. Using spectral analysis and the Crandall--Rabinowitz bifurcation theorem, we prove the existence of branches of non-constant periodic solutions bifurcating from constant states. This result is qualitative and non-constructive. Using a conceptually different argument, we construct explicit multiple solutions for a specific one--dimensional formulation of our target problem.</description>

      <title>Symmetrization of the Maxwell--Neumann--Poincar'e operator, spectral decomposition in $\mathbf{H}(\mathrm{curl},D)$ traces, and boundary localisation of SPRs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Neumann--Poincar\'{e} (NP) operator, a fundamental operator in potential theory, has attracted renewed attention for its central role in the analysis of surface plasmon resonances (SPRs). SPRs, characterized by non-radiative electromagnetic waves at material interfaces with opposing permittivities, underpin advanced technologies such as bio-sensing and cloaking devices. While spectral properties of the scalar NP operator and SPR dynamics for scalar waves are well-established, their vectorial counterparts in Maxwell's framework remain poorly understood. This work bridges this gap by introducing a novel symmetrization principle for the matrix-valued Maxwell Neumann--Poincar\'{e} (MNP) operator, enabling a spectral decomposition of traces in the $\mathbf{H}(\mathrm{curl},D)$ space--a foundational advance for electromagnetic theory. Building on this framework, we rigorously characterize the quantum-ergodic localization of weak surface plasmon resonances at material boundaries in the full Maxwell system, thereby settling a long-standing question concerning their quantitative description.</description>

      <title>On very weak solutions of certain elliptic systems with double phase growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a higher integrability result for very weak solutions of higher-order elliptic systems involving a double phase operator as the principal part. As a model case, we consider \begin{equation} \int_{\Omega} \left( |D^m u|^{p-2}D^m u + a(x)|D^m u|^{q-2}D^m u \right) \cdot D^m \varphi = 0 \quad \text{for any } \varphi \in C_c^{\infty}(\Omega), \end{equation} where $n,m \in \mathbb{N},\ n\ge 2,\,1 &lt; p \le q &lt; \infty,\,\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is an open set and $a:\Omega \rightarrow [0,\infty)$ is a measurable function. The proof is based on a construction of an appropriate test function by the Lipschitz truncation technique, a deduction of a reverse H\"older inequality and an application of Gehring's lemma. Our contributions include estimates for weighted mean value polynomials and sharp Sobolev--Poincar\'e-type inequalities for the double phase operator. Our result can be viewed as a generalization with respect to the derivative order, the coefficient function and the growth conditions of the recent paper by Baasandorj, Byun and Kim (Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 376:8733-8768,2023).</description>

      <title>The Small Dispersion Limit of the Intermediate Long Wave Equation via Semiclassical Soliton Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03063v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the small dispersion limit of the intermediate long wave (ILW) equation, specifically on a class of well-behaved initial conditions $u_0$ where the number of solitons in the solution increases without bound. First, we conduct a formal WKB-style analysis on the ILW direct scattering problem, generating approximate eigenvalues and norming constants. We then use this to define a modified set of scattering data and rigorously analyze the associated inverse scattering problem. The main results include demonstrating $L^2$-convergence of the solution at $t = 0$ to the original initial condition $u_0$ and for $0 &lt; t &lt; t_\mathrm{c}$ to the associated solution of invicid Burgers' equation, where $t_\mathrm{c}$ is the time of gradient catastrophe.</description>

      <title>Existence and partial regularity of suitable weak solutions to the 3D Navier-Stokes-Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation, which describes a two-phase mixture of the viscous incompressible fluid with particles or bubbles through a frictional force term. In the three-dimensional whole space, we construct a new class of suitable weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes-Vlasov-Fokker-Planck system satisfying energy estimates and three local or global energy inequalities of different forms. These obtained local energy inequalities play an important role in characterizing the measure of the singularity set of weak solutions. The main difficulties in deriving these inequalities lie in establishing the convergence of the density function $f$ in bounded or unbounded domains and dealing with the convergence of the non-local frictional force term. The strong convergence of both $f$ and $f \log f$ weighted by $|v|^k$ is proved by exploring some new a priori quantities of the velocity with the help of Tao's $L^p$ decomposition and the DiPerna-Lions compactness method. Moreover, as an immediate consequence of the existence result, we are able to describe the Hausdorff dimension of set of singular points of the fluid velocity $u$ and also establish the $\alpha$-H\"{o}lder continuity of $f$ at the regular points of $u$.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions with bounded index: Parallels to De Giorgi's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-known conjecture of De Giorgi -- motivated by analogy with the Bernstein problem for minimal surfaces -- asserts the rigidity of monotone solutions to the Allen--Cahn equation in $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$, with $d\leq 7$.
  We establish close parallels to De Giorgi's conjecture for general solutions of bounded Morse index, far stronger than the minimal surface analogy would suggest: Namely, any finite index solution to the Allen--Cahn equation with bounded energy density in $\mathbb{R}^4$ is one-dimensional, and -- conditionally on the classification of stable solutions -- the same holds for all $4\leq n \leq 7$.
  As a geometric application, phase transitions with bounded energy and index in closed four-manifolds have smooth transition layers which behave like minimal hypersurfaces.
  Consequently, phase transitions exhibit a remarkably rigid behaviour in higher dimensions. This is in stark contrast with the 3D case, in which a wealth of nontrivial entire solutions with finite index (and energy density) is conversely known to exist, by work pioneered by Del Pino--Kowalczyk--Wei. The authors conjectured that any such solution must have parallel ends which are either planar or catenoidal, suggesting it as a parallel to De Giorgi's conjecture in this framework. We confirm this picture under the bounded energy density assumption.</description>

      <title>Quantitative sensitivity analysis for Fokker-Planck equation with respect to the Wasserstein distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the sensitivity of solutions to the Fokker-Planck equation with respect to some unknown parameter. Our main result is to provide quantitative upper bounds for the $p$-Wasserstein distance $\mathcal{W}_p$ between two solutions with different parameters, for every $p \geq 2$. We are able to give two proofs of this result, the first relying on synchronous coupling between two solutions of an SDE, and another one that relies on the differentiation of Kantorovitch dual formulation of optimal transport. We also provide more specific bounds in the case of the overdamped Langevin process, for which we are able to compare convergence to the invariant measure and sensitivity to the parameter.</description>

      <title>Bivariate Hardy-Sobolev Inequality and Its Sharp Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a bivariate Hardy-Sobolev inequality. Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ ($N \geq 3$) be an open domain, $s \in (0,2)$, $\alpha &gt; 1$, $\beta &gt; 1$ with $\alpha + \beta = 2^*(s)$, and $\kappa \in \mathbb{R}$. For any functions $u, v \in D_0^{1,2}(\Omega)$, we prove the inequality:
  \begin{multline*}
  \int_{\Omega} |\nabla u|^2 \, \mathrm{d}x + \int_{\Omega} |\nabla v|^2 \, \mathrm{d}x
  \ge S_{\alpha,\beta,\lambda,\mu}(\Omega) \left( \int_{\Omega} \Big( \lambda \frac{|u|^{2^*(s)}}{|x|^s} + \mu \frac{|v|^{2^*(s)}}{|x|^s} + 2^*(s) \kappa \frac{|u|^\alpha |v|^\beta}{|x|^s} \Big)\, \mathrm{d}x \right)^{\frac{2}{2^*(s)}}.
  \end{multline*}
  We derive the best constant $S_{\alpha,\beta,\lambda,\mu}(\Omega)$ and characterize the set of minimizers. Moreover, for $\Omega = \mathbb{R}^N$ and $\kappa &gt; 0$, we obtain sharp stability results for nonnegative functions.</description>

      <title>On Poincar\'e-Sobolev level involving fractional GJMS operators on hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to a qualitative analysis of the Poincar\'e--Sobolev level associated with the fractional GJMS operators \(\mathcal{P}_s\) \(\bigl(s\in(0,\tfrac n2)\setminus\mathbb N\bigr)\) on the hyperbolic space \(\mathbb H^n\). In contrast to the integer-order case, when \(s\notin\mathbb N\) the operator \(\mathcal{P}_s\) does not enjoy the conformal covariance that allows one, in the upper half-space or ball model, to relate it to the Euclidean fractional Laplacian \((-\Delta)^s\); this link is crucial for importing Euclidean theory. We therefore introduce \(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}}_s\) (\(s&gt;0\)), which is conformally related to \((-\Delta)^s\). Our purpose in the paper is to analyze the monotonicity, attainability, and strict-gap regions of the Poincar\'e--Sobolev levels associated with \(\mathcal{P}_s\) and with \(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}}_s\) with \(s\in(0,\tfrac n2)\setminus\mathbb N\). First, we reinterpret the Brezis--Nirenberg problem through the lens of Poincar\'e--Sobolev levels, connecting earlier results for the Euclidean Laplacian and for operators \(\mathcal{P}_k\) on \(\mathbb H^n\) with integer \(k\in(0,\tfrac n2)\). We then establish new, explicit lower bounds for the Hardy term in fractional Hardy--Sobolev--Maz'ya inequalities involving both \(\mathcal{P}_s\) and \(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}}_s\). By applying the concentration--compactness principle together with a detailed analysis of the strict-gap regions for the Poincar\'e--Sobolev levels, we prove the existence of solutions to the Brezis--Nirenberg problem on \(\mathbb H^n\) for both operators. Finally, combining the Hardy lower bounds with criteria for attainability, we obtain a complete characterization of the Poincar\'e--Sobolev levels \(H_{n,s}\) and \(\widetilde H_{n,s}\).</description>

      <title>Local profiles of self-similar solutions of the planar stationary Navier--Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit self-similar solutions of the two-dimensional stationary incompressible Navier-Stokes equations under scaling symmetries, also known as Jeffery-Hamel solutions. We investigate the local patterns of smooth Jeffery-Hamel solutions in a conical subdomain $\Omega$ with vertex at the origin, without imposing any boundary conditions on $\Omega$. For radial Jeffery-Hamel solutions, we obtain all the explicit local profiles in $\Omega$ with arbitrary opening angles. In the non-radial case, we show that some Jeffery-Hamel solutions can be obtained via solving a Li\'enard equation, and we derive new explicit local profiles expressible in terms of Weierstrass elliptic functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the system of cold plasma equations describing the motion of electrons in the field of stationary ions, we consider the Riemann problem posed at an impenetrable interface between two media. These media differ in the magnitude of the constant ion field. The interface between the media is assumed to be free. Its position is determined from the generalized Rankine-Hugoniot conditions and the stability condition, that is, the intersection of Lagrangian particle trajectories at the interface.</description>

      <title>On weak solutions to the 1d compressible Navier-Stokes equations: a Lipschitz continuous dependence on data in weaker norms and an error of their homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We deal with the global in time weak solutions to the 1D compressible Navier-Stokes system of equations for large discontinuous initial data and nonhomogeneous boundary conditions of three standard types. We prove the Lipschitz-type continuous dependence of the solution $(\eta,u,\theta)$, in a norm slightly stronger than $L^{2,\infty}(Q)\times L^2(Q)\times L^2(Q)$, on the initial data $(\eta^0,u^0,e^0)$ in a norm of $L^2(\Omega)\times H^{-1}(\Omega)\times H^{-1}(\Omega)$-type and also on the free terms in all the equations in some dual norms. Here $\eta$, $u$ and $\theta$ are the specific volume, velocity and absolute temperature as well as $\eta^0$, $u^0$ and $e^0$ are the initial specific volume, velocity and specific total energy, and $Q=\Omega\times (0,T)$. We also apply this result to the case of discontinuous rapidly oscillating, with the period $\varepsilon$, initial data and free terms and derive an estimate $O(\varepsilon)$ for the difference between the solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations and their Bakhvalov-Eglit two-scale homogenized version with averaged data.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior of solutions to a planar Hartree equation with isolated singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the isolated singularities of the Hartree type equation
  \begin{equation*}
  -\Delta u (x)= \left(\frac{1}{|x|^\alpha}*e^u\right)e^{u(x)}\quad \text{in } B_{1}\setminus\{0\} ,
  \end{equation*}
  where $\alpha&gt;0$, $\displaystyle \frac{1}{|x|^\alpha}*e^u\triangleq\int_{B_{1} \setminus \{0\}}\frac{e^u(y)}{|x-y|^\alpha}dy$, and the punctured ball $B_{1}\setminus\{0\}\subset \mathbb{R}^2$. Under the finite total curvature condition, by establishing a representation formula for singular solutions, we obtain the asymptotic behavior of the solutions near the origin. We also extend this asymptotic behavior results to the case with a general non-negative coefficient $K(x)$, and to the higher-order Hartree-type equations in any dimension $n \geq 3$.</description>

      <title>The compressible Euler system with damping in hybrid Besov spaces: global well-posedness and relaxation limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the global well-posedness of the compressible Euler system with damping in Rd (d\geq1) and its relaxation limit toward the porous medium equation. In [12], the first author and Danchin studied these two problems in hybrid Besov spaces, where the high-frequency components of the solution are bounded in L2-based norms, while the low-frequency components are controlled in Lp-based norms with p\in[2,\max{4,\frac{2d}{d-2}}]. Motivated by the observation that the limit system is well-posed in Lp-based spaces for p\in[2, \infty), we extend the low-frequency analysis to this full range, thereby providing a more unified framework for studying such relaxation limits.
  The core of our proof consists in establishing refined product and commutator estimates describing sharply the interactions between the high, medium, and low-frequency regimes. A key observation underlying our analysis is that the product of two functions localized at low frequencies generates only interactions between low and medium frequencies, never purely high-frequency ones. Consequently, for a suitable choice of frequency threshold, the high-frequency projection of the product of two functions localized low frequencies vanishes.</description>

      <title>On the criticality and the principal eigenvalue of almost periodic elliptic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the notion and the properties of the generalised \pe\ for elliptic operators in unbounded domains, and we relate it with the criticality theory. We focus on operators with almost periodic coefficients. We present a Liouville-type result in dimension $N\leq2$. Next, we show with a counter-example that criticality is not equivalent to the existence of an almost periodic principal eigenvalue, even for self-adjoint operators. Finally, we exhibit an almost periodic operator which is subcritical but which admits a critical limit operator. This is a manifestation of the instability character of the criticality property in the almost periodic setting.</description>

      <title>Timelike curves: homotopies and domain of determinacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies domains of determination of linear strictly hyperbolic second order operators $P$. For an open set $\mathcal O$, a set $Z$ is a domain of determination when the values of solutions of the differential equation $Pu=0$ are determined on $Z$ by their values in $\mathcal O$. Fritz John's global H\"olmgren theorem implies that points that can be reached by deformations of noncharacteristic hypersufaces with initial surface and boundaries in $\mathcal O$ belong to a domain of determination provided that local uniqueness holds at noncharacteristic surfaces. Using spacelike hypersurfaces yields sharp finite speed results whose domains of determination are described in terms of influence curves that never exceed the local speed of propagation. This paper studies deformations of noncharacteristic nonspacelike hypersurfaces. We prove that points reachable by (repeated) deformations by noncharacteristic nonspacelike hypersurfaces coincide exactly with the set of points reachable by (repeated) homotopies of timelike arcs whose initial curves and endpoints belong to $\mathcal O$. When the set $\mathcal O$ is a small neighborhood of a forward timelike arc connecting $a$ to $b$, a natural candidate for $Z$ is the intesection of the future of $a$ with the past of $b$. This candidate is exact for D'Alembert's equation. We prove that it is also exact when $a,b$ are points close together on a fixed timelike arc. The timelike homotopy criterion fuels the construction of surprising examples for which the domain of determination is strictly larger (resp. strictly smaller) than the future-intersect-past candidate.</description>

      <title>Global existence for the fully parabolic Keller--Segel system with critical mass on the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the global existence of solutions to the Cauchy problem for the two-dimensional fully parabolic Keller--Segel system at the critical mass. It is known that global-in-time existence holds for initial data with critical mass under radial symmetry or suitable moment conditions, whereas the behavior of general solutions in the critical regime remains delicate. In this paper, we establish global-in-time existence for general initial data with critical mass, without imposing any symmetry or moment assumptions. The proof relies on the construction of a reconstructed Lyapunov functional, combined with refined regularity estimates for the associated dissipative terms, which enable us to control the solution dynamics in the critical regime.</description>

Abstract: We classify entire 2-dimensional area-minimizing or stable surfaces in R^4 with quadratic area growth as algebraic, cut out by a finite union of holomorphic polynomials whose collective degrees are controlled by the density at infinity. As a consequence, we obtain bounds on the singular set size and genus in terms of the density at infinity.</description>

Abstract: We study the existence problem for complete contact forms with constant Tanaka--Webster scalar curvature on non-compact strictly pseudoconvex CR manifolds. We prove that, under mild assumptions, the universal cover of a compact strictly pseudoconvex CR manifold admits infinitely many non-homothetic such contact forms whenever its fundamental group has infinite profinite completion. As applications, we treat complements of real or complex spheres in the standard CR sphere, as well as circle bundles over compact K\"{a}hler manifolds and the boundary of a Reinhardt domain.</description>

      <title>On singular Galerkin discretizations for three models in high-frequency scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider three common mathematical models for time-harmonic high frequency scattering: the Helmholtz equation in two and three spatial dimensions, a transverse magnetic problem in two dimensions, and Maxwell's equation in three dimensions with dissipative boundary conditions such that the continuous problem is well posed. In this paper, we construct meshes for popular (low order) Galerkin finite element discretizations such that the discrete system matrix becomes singular and the discrete problem is not well posed. This implies that a condition "the finite element space has to be sufficiently rich" in the form of a resolution condition - typically imposed for discrete well-posedness - is not an artifact from the proof by a compact perturbation argument but necessary for discrete stability of the Galerkin discretization.</description>

Abstract: In 1993, the global stability of Minkowski spacetime was proved in the celebrated work of Christodoulou and Klainerman. In 2003, Klainerman and Nicol\`o revisited Minkowski stability in the exterior of an outgoing null cone. In 2023, the author extended the results of Christodoulou-Klainerman to minimal decay assumptions. In this paper, we prove that the exterior stability of Minkowski holds with decay that is borderline compared to the minimal decay considered in 2023.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the power-law vortex $\overline{\omega}(x) = \beta |x|^{-\alpha}$, which explicitly solves the stationary unforced incompressible Euler equations in $\mathbb{R}^2$ in both physical and self-similar coordinates, is exponentially linearly stable in self-similar coordinates with the natural scaling. This result, which is valid for functions in a weighted $L^2$ space and in the un-weighted $L^2$ space with a mild symmetry condition, answers a question from the monograph by Albritton et al. Moreover, we prove that in physical coordinates the linearization around the power law vortex cannot generate an unstable $C_0$-semigroup.</description>

      <title>A piezoelectric beam model with nonlinear interior dampings and supercritical sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to investigate a three-dimensional fully magnetic effected piezoelectric beam model with strong sources and nonlinear interior dampings. By employing nonlinear semigroups and the theory of monotone operators, the existence of local weak solutions is established. By the potential well method, we obtain the global existence of potential well solutions. Decay rates of the total energy are obtained in terms of the behavior of the damping terms. The main advantage in this work is that the stabilization estimate does not generate lower-order terms, and in addition we remove some strong conditions in previous results to obtain a weaker energy decay. Finally, when the initial total energy is negative, positive but small, respectively, the blow-up results for weak solutions if the source terms are stronger than damping terms are obtained according to the differential inequality technique. Moreover, if interior dampings are linear, a blow-up result with arbitrarily high initial energy is established by the concavity method and an upper bound for the blow-up time is also derived. All results are independent of any relation among the model coefficients.</description>

Abstract: For a time-independent potential $q\in L^\infty$, consider the source-to-solution operator that maps a source $f$ to the solution $u=u(t,x)$ of $(\Box+q)u=f$ in Euclidean space with an obstacle, where we impose on $u$ vanishing Cauchy data at $t=0$ and vanishing Dirichlet data at the boundary of the obstacle. We study the inverse problem of recovering the potential $q$ from this source-to-solution map restricted to some measurement domain. By giving an example where measurements take place in some subset and the support of $q$ lies in the `shadow region' of the obstacle, we show that recovery of $q$ is exponentially unstable.</description>

      <title>Global smooth solutions of 2-D quadratically quasilinear wave equations with null conditions in exterior domains, II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03348v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the paper [S. Alinhac, The null condition for quasilinear wave equations in two space dimensions I, Invent. Math. 145 (2001), no. 3, 597-618], S. Alinhac established the global existence of small data smooth solutions to the Cauchy problem of 2-D quadratically quasilinear wave equations with null conditions. However, for the corresponding 2-D initial boundary value problem in exterior domains, it is still open whether the global solutions exist. When the 2-D quadratic nonlinearity admits a special $Q_0$ type null form, the global small solution is shown in our previous article [Hou Fei, Yin Huicheng, Yuan Meng, Global smooth solutions of 2-D quadratically quasilinear wave equations with null conditions in exterior domains, arXiv:2411.06984]. In the present paper, we now solve this open problem through proving the global existence of small solutions to 2-D general quasilinear wave equations with null conditions in exterior domains. Our proof procedure is based on finding appropriate divergence structures of quasilinear wave equations under null conditions, introducing a good unknown to eliminate the resulting $Q_0$ type nonlinearity and deriving some new precise pointwise spacetime decay estimates of solutions and their derivatives.</description>

      <title>Compactness of conformal metrics with constant $Q$-curvature of higher order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k\ge1$ be a positive integer and let $P_g$ be the GJMS operator $P_{g}$ of order $2k$ on a closed Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ of dimension $n&gt;2k$. We investigate the compactness of the set of conformal metrics to $g$ with prescribed constant positive $Q$-curvature of order $2k$- or, equivalently, of the set of positive solutions for the $2k$-th order $Q$-curvature equation. Under a natural positivity-preserving condition on $P_{g}$ we establish compactness, for an arbitrary $1 \le k &lt; \frac{n}{2}$, under the following assumptions: $(M,g)$ is locally conformally flat and $P_g$ has positive mass in $M$, or $2k+1 \le n \le 2k+5$ and $P_g$ has positive mass in $M$, or $n \ge 2k+4$ and $|\text{W}_g|_g &gt;0$ in $M$.
  For an arbitrary $1 \le k &lt; \frac{n}{2}$, the expression of $P_g$ is not explicit, which is an obstacle to proving compactness. We overcome this by relying on Juhl's celebrated recursive formulae for $P_g$ to perform a refined blow-up analysis for solutions of the $Q$-curvature equation and to prove a Weyl vanishing result for $P_g$. This is the first compactness result for an arbitrary $1 \le k &lt; \frac{n}{2}$ and the first successful instance where Juhl's formulae are used to yield compactness. Our result also hints that the threshold dimension for compactness for the $2k$-th order $Q$-curvature equation diverges as $k \to + \infty$.</description>

Abstract: Assume $\alpha\in (0, 2)$ and $d\ge 2$. Let $\mathcal L^\alpha$ be the generator of a symmetric, but not necessarily isotropic, $\alpha$-stable process $X$ in $\mathbb R^d$ whose L\'evy density is comparable with that of an isotropic $\alpha$-stable process. In this paper, we show that the $C^{1, \rm Dini}$ regularity assumption on an open set $D\subset \mathbb R^d$ is optimal for the standard boundary decay property for nonnegative $\mathcal L^\alpha$-harmonic functions in $D$, and for the standard boundary decay property of the heat kernel $p^D(t,x,y)$ of the part process $X^D$ of $X$ on $D$ by proving the following: (i) If $D$ is a $C^{1, \rm Dini}$ open set and $h$ is a nonnegative function which is $\mathcal L^\alpha$-harmonic in $D$ and vanishes near a portion of $\partial D$, then the rate at which $h(x)$ decays to 0 near that portion of $\partial D$ is ${\rm dist} (x, D^c)^{\alpha/2}$. (ii) If $D$ is a $C^{1, \rm Dini}$ open set, then, as $x\to \partial D$, the rate at which $p^D(t,x,y)$ tends to 0 is ${\rm dist} (x, D^c)^{\alpha/2}$. (iii) For any non-Dini modulus of continuity $\ell$, there exist non-$C^{1, \rm Dini}$ open sets $D$, with $\partial D$ locally being the graph of a $C^{1, \ell}$ function, such that the standard boundary decay properties above do not hold for $D$.</description>

Abstract: We consider the axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations in a finite cylinder $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^3$. We assume that $v_r$, $v_\varphi$, $\omega_\varphi$ vanish on the lateral part of boundary $\partial\Omega$ of the cylinder, and that $v_z$, $\omega_\varphi$, $\partial_zv_\varphi$ vanish on the top and bottom parts of the boundary $\partial\Omega$, where we used standard cylindrical coordinates, and we denoted by $\omega= {\rm curl}\, v$ the vorticity field. Our aim is to derive the estimate $$ \left\|\frac{\omega_{r}}{r}\right\|_{V\left(\Omega\times (0,t)\right)}+\left\|\frac{\omega_{\varphi}}{r}\right\|_{V\left(\Omega\times (0,t)\right)} \leq \phi(\operatorname{data}),$$ where $\phi$ is an increasing positive function and $\|\ \|_{V\left(\Omega\times (0,t)\right)}$ is the energy norm. We are not able to derive any global type estimate for nonslip boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Quasiconvexity in the Riemannian setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02642v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of quasiconvexity for continuous functions $f$ defined on the vector bundle of linear maps between the tangent spaces of a smooth Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ and $\mathbb{R}^m$, naturally generalizing the classical Euclidean definition. We prove that this condition characterizes the sequential lower semicontinuity of the associated integral functional \[ F(u, \Omega) = \int_{\Omega} f(du) \, d\mu \] with respect to the weak$^*$ topology of $W^{1,\infty}(\Omega, \mathbb{R}^m)$, for every bounded open subset $\Omega\subseteq M$.</description>

      <title>On the monotonicity of the entropy production in the Landau-Maxwell equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the homogeneous Landau equation with Maxwell molecules and prove that the entropy production is non-increasing provided the directional temperatures are well-distributed and the solution admits a moment of order $\ell$, for some $\ell$ arbitrarily close to $2$. It implies that for an initial condition with finite moment of order $\ell$, the entropy production is guaranteed to be non-increasing after a certain time, that we explicitly compute. This is the first partial answer to a conjecture made by Henry P. McKean in 1966 on the sign of the time-derivatives of the entropy. Without moment assumptions, we obtain a possibly sharp short-time regularization rate for the entropy production, and exponential decay for large times.</description>

      <title>Local well-posedness and blow-up for the restricted fourth-order Prandtl equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove local well-posedness and finite-time blow-up for a restricted fourth-order Prandtl equation posed on the half-line with clamped boundary conditions. The equation arises from a two-dimensional fourth-order Prandtl system via an ansatz reduction, and its nonlinearity involves a nonlocal integral term. To close a Duhamel fixed-point argument, we need uniform $L^1$ bounds for the associated half-line biharmonic heat kernel. We establish uniform $L^1$ estimates for the kernel and its derivatives, and we show that the semigroup preserves spatial regularity under appropriate compatibility conditions, using an alternative representation derived by integration by parts. These kernel estimates yield local existence and uniqueness for the restricted model and allow us to construct solutions that blow-up in finite time.</description>

      <title>Local bounds for nonlinear higher-order vector fields for the p-Laplace equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study higher regularity for weak solutions of the $p$-Laplace equation $-\Delta_p u = f$ in a domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ for $p$ sufficiently close to 2. For $m \ge 3$, assuming that $f$ satisfies suitable Sobolev and H\"older regularity conditions, we prove that the nonlinear quantity $|\nabla u|^{m-2}\nabla u$ belongs to $W^{m-1,q}_{{loc}}(\Omega)$, and that $|\nabla u|^{m-2} D^2u$ belongs to $W^{m-2,q}_{{loc}}(\Omega)$, for any $q\ge 2$. Furthermore, we obtain uniform $L^\infty$ bounds for the weighted $(m-1)$-th derivatives of $|\nabla u|^{m-2}\nabla u$ and the weighted $(m-2)$-th derivatives of $|\nabla u|^{m-2} D^2u$, providing quantitative control even near critical points of $\nabla u$.</description>

      <title>Generalized Morse Functions, Excision and Higher Torsions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Comparing invariants from both topological and geometric perspectives is a key focus in index theorem. This paper compares higher analytic and topological torsions and establishes a version of the higher Cheeger-M\"uller/Bismut-Zhang theorem. In fact, Bismut-Goette achieved this comparison assuming the existence of fiberwise Morse functions satisfying the fiberwise Thom-Smale transversality condition (TS condition). To fully generalize the theorem, we should remove this assumption. Notably, unlike fiberwise Morse functions, fiberwise generalized Morse functions (GMFs) always exist, we extend Bismut-Goette's setup by considering a fibration $ M \to S $ with a unitarily flat complex bundle $ F \to M $ and a fiberwise GMF $ f $, while retaining the TS condition.
  Compared to Bismut-Goette's work, handling birth-death points for a generalized Morse function poses a key difficulty. To deal with this, first, by the work of the author M.P., joint with Zhang and Zhu, we focus on a relative version of the theorem. Here, analytic and topological torsions are normalized by subtracting their corresponding torsions for trivial bundles. Next, using new techniques from by the author J.Y., we excise a small neighborhood around the locus where $f$ has birth-death points. This reduces the problem to Bismut-Goette's settings (or its version with boundaries) via a Witten-type deformation. However, new difficulties arise from very singular critical points during this deformation. To deal with these, we extend methods from Bismut-Lebeau, using Agmon estimates for noncompact manifolds developed by Dai and J.Y.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Sobolev inequality in manifolds with nonnegative curvature via the ABP method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17748v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the ABP method developed by Brendle to establish the optimal $L^p$ logarithmic Sobolev inequality on manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature, as well as a sharp $L^2$ logarithmic Sobolev inequality for submanifolds in manifolds with nonnegative sectional curvature. The sharp constants in both inequalities depend on the asymptotic volume ratio of the ambient manifold.</description>

      <title>Variable Elliptic Structures on the Plane: Transport Dynamics, Rigidity, and Function Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study variable elliptic structures in the plane defined by a smoothly varying quadratic relation i^2 + beta(x,y) i + alpha(x,y) = 0, and the associated first order operator dbar = 1/2 (dx + i dy). Differentiating the structure relation yields explicit expressions for the derivatives of i(x,y) in terms of the coefficient functions alpha and beta, leading to a universal transport system governing their admissible variations. In the elliptic regime this system reduces to a forced complex Burgers equation for a scalar spectral parameter encoding the structure coefficients. We identify a rigidity condition under which the transport becomes conservative, and show that in this regime the generalized Cauchy Riemann operator satisfies a Leibniz rule and admits a factorization of the associated second order operator into first order components. As a consequence, classical tools of planar complex analysis, including Cauchy Pompeiu type formulas, integral representations, and elliptic second order operators, reappear in a variable coefficient setting with explicit structure. The theory is developed at the level of direct computation, emphasizing transparency of the integrability mechanism and the interplay between transport dynamics, rigidity, and function theory.</description>
