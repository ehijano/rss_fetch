      <title>iTeach: Interactive Teaching for Robot Perception using Mixed Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce iTeach, a Mixed Reality (MR) framework to improve robot perception through real-time interactive teaching. By allowing human instructors to dynamically label robot RGB data, iTeach improves both the accuracy and adaptability of robot perception to new scenarios. The framework supports on-the-fly data collection and labeling, enhancing model performance, and generalization. Applied to door and handle detection for household tasks, iTeach integrates a HoloLens app with an interactive YOLO model. Furthermore, we introduce the IRVLUTD DoorHandle dataset. DH-YOLO, our efficient detection model, significantly enhances the accuracy and efficiency of door and handle detection, highlighting the potential of MR to make robotic systems more capable and adaptive in real-world environments.

      <title>Learning to Walk from Three Minutes of Real-World Data with Semi-structured Dynamics Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) methods exploit neural networks as flexible function approximators to represent a priori unknown environment dynamics. However, training data are typically scarce in practice, and these black-box models often fail to generalize. Modeling architectures that leverage known physics can substantially reduce the complexity of system-identification, but break down in the face of complex phenomena such as contact. We introduce a novel framework for learning semi-structured dynamics models for contact-rich systems which seamlessly integrates structured first principles modeling techniques with black-box auto-regressive models. Specifically, we develop an ensemble of probabilistic models to estimate external forces, conditioned on historical observations and actions, and integrate these predictions using known Lagrangian dynamics. With this semi-structured approach, we can make accurate long-horizon predictions with substantially less data than prior methods. We leverage this capability and propose Semi-Structured Reinforcement Learning (SSRL) a simple model-based learning framework which pushes the sample complexity boundary for real-world learning. We validate our approach on a real-world Unitree Go1 quadruped robot, learning dynamic gaits -- from scratch -- on both hard and soft surfaces with just a few minutes of real-world data.

      <title>iFANnpp: Nuclear Power Plant Digital Twin for Robots and Autonomous Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotics has gained significant attention due to its autonomy and ability to automate in the nuclear industry. However, the increasing complexity of robots has led to a growing demand for advanced simulation and control methods to predict robot behavior and optimize plant performance. Most existing digital twins only address parts of systems and do not offer an overall design of nuclear power plants. Furthermore, they are often designed for specific algorithms or tasks, making them unsuitable for broader research applications or other potential projects. In response, we propose a comprehensive nuclear power plant designed to enhance real-time monitoring, operational efficiency, and predictive maintenance. We selected to model a full-scope nuclear power plant in Unreal Engine 5 to incorporate the complexities and various phenomena. The high-resolution simulation environment is integrated with a General Pressurized Water Reactor Simulator, a high-fidelity physics-driven software, to create a realistic flow of nuclear power plant and a real-time updating virtual environment. Furthermore, the virtual environment provides various features and a Python bridge for researchers to test custom algorithms and frameworks easily. The digital twin's performance is presented, and several research ideas - such as multi-robot task scheduling and robot navigation in the radiation area - using implemented features are presented.</description>

      <title>Failure Prediction from Limited Hardware Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prediction of failures in real-world robotic systems either requires accurate model information or extensive testing. Partial knowledge of the system model makes simulation-based failure prediction unreliable. Moreover, obtaining such demonstrations is expensive, and could potentially be risky for the robotic system to repeatedly fail during data collection. This work presents a novel three-step methodology for discovering failures that occur in the true system by using a combination of a limited number of demonstrations from the true system and the failure information processed through sampling-based testing of a model dynamical system. Given a limited budget $N$ of demonstrations from true system and a model dynamics (with potentially large modeling errors), the proposed methodology comprises of a) exhaustive simulations for discovering algorithmic failures using the model dynamics; b) design of initial $N_1$ demonstrations of the true system using Bayesian inference to learn a Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based failure predictor; and c) iterative $N - N_1$ demonstrations of the true system for updating the failure predictor. To illustrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology, we consider: a) the failure discovery for the task of pushing a T block to a fixed target region with UR3E collaborative robot arm using a diffusion policy; and b) the failure discovery for an F1-Tenth racing car tracking a given raceline under an LQR control policy.</description>

      <title>Language-Model-Assisted Bi-Level Programming for Reward Learning from Internet Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning from Demonstrations, particularly from biological experts like humans and animals, often encounters significant data acquisition challenges. While recent approaches leverage internet videos for learning, they require complex, task-specific pipelines to extract and retarget motion data for the agent. In this work, we introduce a language-model-assisted bi-level programming framework that enables a reinforcement learning agent to directly learn its reward from internet videos, bypassing dedicated data preparation. The framework includes two levels: an upper level where a vision-language model (VLM) provides feedback by comparing the learner's behavior with expert videos, and a lower level where a large language model (LLM) translates this feedback into reward updates. The VLM and LLM collaborate within this bi-level framework, using a "chain rule" approach to derive a valid search direction for reward learning. We validate the method for reward learning from YouTube videos, and the results have shown that the proposed method enables efficient reward design from expert videos of biological agents for complex behavior synthesis.</description>

      <title>EasyHeC++: Fully Automatic Hand-Eye Calibration with Pretrained Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hand-eye calibration plays a fundamental role in robotics by directly influencing the efficiency of critical operations such as manipulation and grasping. In this work, we present a novel framework, EasyHeC++, designed for fully automatic hand-eye calibration. In contrast to previous methods that necessitate manual calibration, specialized markers, or the training of arm-specific neural networks, our approach is the first system that enables accurate calibration of any robot arm in a marker-free, training-free, and fully automatic manner. Our approach employs a two-step process. First, we initialize the camera pose using a sampling or feature-matching-based method with the aid of pretrained image models. Subsequently, we perform pose optimization through differentiable rendering. Extensive experiments demonstrate the system's superior accuracy in both synthetic and real-world datasets across various robot arms and camera settings.

      <title>Motion Planning for Object Manipulation by Edge-Rolling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common way to manipulate heavy objects is to maintain at least one point of the object in contact with the environment during the manipulation. When the object has a cylindrical shape or, in general, a curved edge, not only sliding and pivoting motions but also rolling the object along the edge can effectively satisfy this condition. Edge-rolling offers several advantages in terms of efficiency and maneuverability. This paper aims to develop a novel approach for approximating the prehensile edge-rolling motion on any path by a sequence of constant screw displacements, leveraging the principles of screw theory. Based on this approach, we proposed an algorithmic method for task-space-based path generation of object manipulation between two given configurations using a sequence of rolling and pivoting motions. The method is based on an optimization algorithm that takes into account the joint limitations of the robot. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments to manipulate a cylinder along linear and curved paths using the Franka Emika Panda manipulator.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Compliance Policy: Learning Approximate Compliance for Diffusion Guided Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compliance plays a crucial role in manipulation, as it balances between the concurrent control of position and force under uncertainties. Yet compliance is often overlooked by today's visuomotor policies that solely focus on position control. This paper introduces Adaptive Compliance Policy (ACP), a novel framework that learns to dynamically adjust system compliance both spatially and temporally for given manipulation tasks from human demonstrations, improving upon previous approaches that rely on pre-selected compliance parameters or assume uniform constant stiffness. However, computing full compliance parameters from human demonstrations is an ill-defined problem. Instead, we estimate an approximate compliance profile with two useful properties: avoiding large contact forces and encouraging accurate tracking. Our approach enables robots to handle complex contact-rich manipulation tasks and achieves over 50\% performance improvement compared to state-of-the-art visuomotor policy methods.

      <title>A Novel Multi-Gait Strategy for Stable and Efficient Quadruped Robot Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taking inspiration from the natural gait transition mechanism of quadrupeds, devising a good gait transition strategy is important for quadruped robots to achieve energy-efficient locomotion on various terrains and velocities. While previous studies have recognized that gait patterns linked to velocities impact two key factors, the Cost of Transport (CoT) and the stability of robot locomotion, only a limited number of studies have effectively combined these factors to design a mechanism that ensures both efficiency and stability in quadruped robot locomotion. In this paper, we propose a multi-gait selection and transition strategy to achieve stable and efficient locomotion across different terrains. Our strategy starts by establishing a gait mapping considering both CoT and locomotion stability to guide the gait selection process during locomotion. Then, we achieve gait switching in time by introducing affine transformations for gait parameters and a designed finite state machine to build the switching order. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on using our strategy with changing terrains and velocities, and the results indicate that our proposed strategy outperforms baseline methods in achieving simultaneous efficiency in locomotion by considering CoT and stability.</description>

      <title>REGNet V2: End-to-End REgion-based Grasp Detection Network for Grippers of Different Sizes in Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grasping has been a crucial but challenging problem in robotics for many years. One of the most important challenges is how to make grasping generalizable and robust to novel objects as well as grippers in unstructured environments. We present \regnet, a robotic grasping system that can adapt to different parallel jaws to grasp diversified objects. To support different grippers, \regnet embeds the gripper parameters into point clouds, based on which it predicts suitable grasp configurations. It includes three components: Score Network (SN), Grasp Region Network (GRN), and Refine Network (RN). In the first stage, SN is used to filter suitable points for grasping by grasp confidence scores. In the second stage, based on the selected points, GRN generates a set of grasp proposals. Finally, RN refines the grasp proposals for more accurate and robust predictions. We devise an analytic policy to choose the optimal grasp to be executed from the predicted grasp set. To train \regnet, we construct a large-scale grasp dataset containing collision-free grasp configurations using different parallel-jaw grippers. The experimental results demonstrate that \regnet with the analytic policy achieves the highest success rate of $74.98\%$ in real-world clutter scenes with $20$ objects, significantly outperforming several state-of-the-art methods, including GPD, PointNetGPD, and S4G.

      <title>An Expeditious Spatial Mean Radiant Temperature Mapping Framework using Visual SLAM and Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring thermal comfort is essential for the well-being and productivity of individuals in built environments. Of the various thermal comfort indicators, the mean radiant temperature (MRT) is very challenging to measure. Most common measurement methodologies are time-consuming and not user-friendly. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel MRT measurement framework that uses visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and semantic segmentation techniques. The proposed approach follows the rule of thumb of the traditional MRT calculation method using surface temperature and view factors. However, it employs visual SLAM and creates a 3D thermal point cloud with enriched surface temperature information. The framework then implements Grounded SAM, a new object detection and segmentation tool to extract features with distinct temperature profiles on building surfaces. The detailed segmentation of thermal features not only reduces potential errors in the calculation of the MRT but also provides an efficient reconstruction of the spatial MRT distribution in the indoor environment. We also validate the calculation results with the reference measurement methodology. This data-driven framework offers faster and more efficient MRT measurements and spatial mapping than conventional methods. It can enable the direct engagement of researchers and practitioners in MRT measurements and contribute to research on thermal comfort and radiant cooling and heating systems.</description>

      <title>The Indirect Method for Generating Libraries of Optimal Periodic Trajectories and Its Application to Economical Bipedal Walking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory optimization is an essential tool for generating efficient and dynamically consistent gaits in legged locomotion. This paper explores the indirect method of trajectory optimization, emphasizing its application in creating optimal periodic gaits for legged systems and contrasting it with the more commonly used direct method. While the direct method provides considerable flexibility in its implementation, it is limited by its input space parameterization. In contrast, the indirect method improves accuracy by defining control inputs as functions of the system's states and costates. We tackle the convergence challenges associated with indirect shooting methods, particularly through the systematic development of gait libraries by utilizing numerical continuation methods. Our contributions include: (1) the formalization of a general periodic trajectory optimization problem that extends existing first-order necessary conditions for a broader range of cost functions and operating conditions; (2) a methodology for efficiently generating libraries of optimal trajectories (gaits) utilizing a single shooting approach combined with numerical continuation methods, including a novel approach for reconstructing Lagrange multipliers and costates from passive gaits; and (3) a comparative analysis of the indirect and direct shooting methods using a compass-gait walker as a case study, demonstrating the former's superior accuracy in generating optimal gaits. The findings underscore the potential of the indirect method for generating families of optimal gaits, thereby advancing the field of trajectory optimization in legged robotics.</description>

      <title>Geometric Optimal Control of Mechanical Systems with Gravitational and Resistive Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal control plays a crucial role in numerous mechanical and robotic applications. Broadly, optimal control methods are divided into direct methods (which optimize trajectories directly via discretization) and indirect methods (which transform optimality conditions into equations that guarantee optimal trajectories). While direct methods could mask geometric insights into system dynamics due to discretization, indirect methods offer a deeper understanding of the system's geometry. In this paper, we propose a geometric framework for understanding optimal control in mechanical systems, focusing on the combined effects of inertia, drag, and gravitational forces. By modeling mechanical systems as configuration manifolds equipped with kinetic and drag metrics, alongside a potential field, we explore how these factors influence trajectory optimization. We derive optimal control equations incorporating these effects and apply them to two-link and UR5 robotic manipulators, demonstrating how manifold curvature and resistive forces shape optimal trajectories. This work offers a comprehensive geometric approach to optimal control, with broad applications to robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Stability and Transparency in Mixed Reality Bilateral Human Teleoperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work introduced the concept of human teleoperation (HT), where the remote robot typically considered in conventional bilateral teleoperation is replaced by a novice person wearing a mixed reality head mounted display and tracking the motion of a virtual tool controlled by an expert. HT has advantages in cost, complexity, and patient acceptance for telemedicine in low-resource communities or remote locations. However, the stability, transparency, and performance of bilateral HT are unexplored. In this paper, we therefore develop a mathematical model and simulation of the HT system using test data. We then analyze various control architectures with this model and implement them with the HT system to find the achievable performance, investigate stability, and determine the most promising teleoperation scheme in the presence of time delays. We show that instability in HT, while not destructive or dangerous, makes the system impossible to use. However, stable and transparent teleoperation are possible with small time delays (&lt;200 ms) through 3-channel teleoperation, or with large time delays through model-mediated teleoperation with local pose and force feedback for the novice.</description>

      <title>LoRD: Adapting Differentiable Driving Policies to Distribution Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09681v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distribution shifts between operational domains can severely affect the performance of learned models in self-driving vehicles (SDVs). While this is a well-established problem, prior work has mostly explored naive solutions such as fine-tuning, focusing on the motion prediction task. In this work, we explore novel adaptation strategies for differentiable autonomy stacks consisting of prediction, planning, and control, perform evaluation in closed-loop, and investigate the often-overlooked issue of catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, we introduce two simple yet effective techniques: a low-rank residual decoder (LoRD) and multi-task fine-tuning. Through experiments across three models conducted on two real-world autonomous driving datasets (nuPlan, exiD), we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods and highlight a significant performance gap between open-loop and closed-loop evaluation in prior approaches. Our approach improves forgetting by up to 23.33% and the closed-loop OOD driving score by 8.83% in comparison to standard fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Technical Design Review of Duke Robotics Club's Oogway: An AUV for RoboSub 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Duke Robotics Club is proud to present our robot for the 2024 RoboSub Competition: Oogway. Now in its second year, Oogway has been dramatically upgraded in both its capabilities and reliability. Oogway was built on the principle of independent, well-integrated, and reliable subsystems. Individual components and subsystems were tested and designed separately. Oogway's most advanced capabilities are a result of the tight integration between these subsystems. Such examples include a re-envisioned controls system, an entirely new electrical stack, advanced sonar integration, additional cameras and system monitoring, a new marker dropper, and a watertight capsule mechanism. These additions enabled Oogway to prequalify for Robosub 2024.</description>

      <title>Flying Quadrotors in Tight Formations using Learning-based Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flying quadrotors in tight formations is a challenging problem. It is known that in the near-field airflow of a quadrotor, the aerodynamic effects induced by the propellers are complex and difficult to characterize. Although machine learning tools can potentially be used to derive models that capture these effects, these data-driven approaches can be sample inefficient and the resulting models often do not generalize as well as their first-principles counterparts. In this work, we propose a framework that combines the benefits of first-principles modeling and data-driven approaches to construct an accurate and sample efficient representation of the complex aerodynamic effects resulting from quadrotors flying in formation. The data-driven component within our model is lightweight, making it amenable for optimization-based control design. Through simulations and physical experiments, we show that incorporating the model into a novel learning-based nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) framework results in substantial performance improvements in terms of trajectory tracking and disturbance rejection. In particular, our framework significantly outperforms nominal MPC in physical experiments, achieving a 40.1% improvement in the average trajectory tracking errors and a 57.5% reduction in the maximum vertical separation errors. Our framework also achieves exceptional sample efficiency, using only a total of 46 seconds of flight data for training across both simulations and physical experiments. Furthermore, with our proposed framework, the quadrotors achieve an exceptionally tight formation, flying with an average separation of less than 1.5 body lengths throughout the flight. A video illustrating our framework and physical experiments is given here: https://youtu.be/Hv-0JiVoJGo</description>

      <title>Gaussian Splatting Visual MPC for Granular Media Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in learned 3D representations have enabled significant progress in solving complex robotic manipulation tasks, particularly for rigid-body objects. However, manipulating granular materials such as beans, nuts, and rice, remains challenging due to the intricate physics of particle interactions, high-dimensional and partially observable state, inability to visually track individual particles in a pile, and the computational demands of accurate dynamics prediction. Current deep latent dynamics models often struggle to generalize in granular material manipulation due to a lack of inductive biases. In this work, we propose a novel approach that learns a visual dynamics model over Gaussian splatting representations of scenes and leverages this model for manipulating granular media via Model-Predictive Control. Our method enables efficient optimization for complex manipulation tasks on piles of granular media. We evaluate our approach in both simulated and real-world settings, demonstrating its ability to solve unseen planning tasks and generalize to new environments in a zero-shot transfer. We also show significant prediction and manipulation performance improvements compared to existing granular media manipulation methods.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control for Optimal Motion Planning of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion planning is an essential process for the navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) where they need to adapt to obstacles and different structures of their operating environment to reach the goal. This paper presents an optimal motion planner for UAVs operating in unknown complex environments. The motion planner receives point cloud data from a local range sensor and then converts it into a voxel grid representing the surrounding environment. A local trajectory guiding the UAV to the goal is then generated based on the voxel grid. This trajectory is further optimized using model predictive control (MPC) to enhance the safety, speed, and smoothness of UAV operation. The optimization is carried out via the definition of several cost functions and constraints, taking into account the UAV's dynamics and requirements. A number of simulations and comparisons with a state-of-the-art method have been conducted in a complex environment with many obstacles to evaluate the performance of our method. The results show that our method provides not only shorter and smoother trajectories but also faster and more stable speed profiles. It is also energy efficient making it suitable for various UAV applications.</description>

      <title>Socially Aware Motion Planning for Service Robots Using LiDAR and RGB-D Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Service robots that work alongside humans in a shared environment need a navigation system that takes into account not only physical safety but also social norms for mutual cooperation. In this paper, we introduce a motion planning system that includes human states such as positions and velocities and their personal space for social-aware navigation. The system first extracts human positions from the LiDAR and the RGB-D camera. It then uses the Kalman filter to fuse that information for human state estimation. An asymmetric Gaussian function is then employed to model human personal space based on their states. This model is used as the input to the dynamic window approach algorithm to generate trajectories for the robot. Experiments show that the robot is able to navigate alongside humans in a dynamic environment while respecting their physical and psychological comfort.</description>

      <title>ImagineNav: Prompting Vision-Language Models as Embodied Navigator through Scene Imagination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual navigation is an essential skill for home-assistance robots, providing the object-searching ability to accomplish long-horizon daily tasks. Many recent approaches use Large Language Models (LLMs) for commonsense inference to improve exploration efficiency. However, the planning process of LLMs is limited within texts and it is difficult to represent the spatial occupancy and geometry layout only by texts. Both are important for making rational navigation decisions. In this work, we seek to unleash the spatial perception and planning ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and explore whether the VLM, with only on-board camera captured RGB/RGB-D stream inputs, can efficiently finish the visual navigation tasks in a mapless manner. We achieve this by developing the imagination-powered navigation framework ImagineNav, which imagines the future observation images at valuable robot views and translates the complex navigation planning process into a rather simple best-view image selection problem for VLM. To generate appropriate candidate robot views for imagination, we introduce the Where2Imagine module, which is distilled to align with human navigation habits. Finally, to reach the VLM preferred views, an off-the-shelf point-goal navigation policy is utilized. Empirical experiments on the challenging open-vocabulary object navigation benchmarks demonstrates the superiority of our proposed system.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Neural Mapping and Motion Planning in Unknown Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mapping and motion planning are two essential elements of robot intelligence that are interdependent in generating environment maps and navigating around obstacles. The existing mapping methods create maps that require computationally expensive motion planning tools to find a path solution. In this paper, we propose a new mapping feature called arrival time fields, which is a solution to the Eikonal equation. The arrival time fields can directly guide the robot in navigating the given environments. Therefore, this paper introduces a new approach called Active Neural Time Fields (Active NTFields), which is a physics-informed neural framework that actively explores the unknown environment and maps its arrival time field on the fly for robot motion planning. Our method does not require any expert data for learning and uses neural networks to directly solve the Eikonal equation for arrival time field mapping and motion planning. We benchmark our approach against state-of-the-art mapping and motion planning methods and demonstrate its superior performance in both simulated and real-world environments with a differential drive robot and a 6 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) robot manipulator.

      <title>Markerless Aerial-Terrestrial Co-Registration of Forest Point Clouds using a Deformable Pose Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For biodiversity and forestry applications, end-users desire maps of forests that are fully detailed, from the forest floor to the canopy. Terrestrial laser scanning and aerial laser scanning are accurate and increasingly mature methods for scanning the forest. However, individually they are not able to estimate attributes such as tree height, trunk diameter and canopy density due to the inherent differences in their field-of-view and mapping processes. In this work, we present a pipeline that can automatically generate a single joint terrestrial and aerial forest reconstruction. The novelty of the approach is a marker-free registration pipeline, which estimates a set of relative transformation constraints between the aerial cloud and terrestrial sub-clouds without requiring any co-registration reflective markers to be physically placed in the scene. Our method then uses these constraints in a pose graph formulation, which enables us to finely align the respective clouds while respecting spatial constraints introduced by the terrestrial SLAM scanning process. We demonstrate that our approach can produce a fine-grained and complete reconstruction of large-scale natural environments, enabling multi-platform data capture for forestry applications without requiring external infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Conformalized Reachable Sets for Obstacle Avoidance With Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safe motion planning algorithms are necessary for deploying autonomous robots in unstructured environments. Motion plans must be safe to ensure that the robot does not harm humans or damage any nearby objects. Generating these motion plans in real-time is also important to ensure that the robot can adapt to sudden changes in its environment. Many trajectory optimization methods introduce heuristics that balance safety and real-time performance, potentially increasing the risk of the robot colliding with its environment. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing Conformalized Reachable Sets for Obstacle Avoidance With Spheres (CROWS). CROWS is a novel real-time, receding-horizon trajectory planner that generates probalistically-safe motion plans. Offline, CROWS learns a novel neural network-based representation of a spherebased reachable set that overapproximates the swept volume of the robot's motion. CROWS then uses conformal prediction to compute a confidence bound that provides a probabilistic safety guarantee on the learned reachable set. At runtime, CROWS performs trajectory optimization to select a trajectory that is probabilstically-guaranteed to be collision-free. We demonstrate that CROWS outperforms a variety of state-of-the-art methods in solving challenging motion planning tasks in cluttered environments while remaining collision-free.

      <title>REPeat: A Real2Sim2Real Approach for Pre-acquisition of Soft Food Items in Robot-assisted Feeding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents REPeat, a Real2Sim2Real framework designed to enhance bite acquisition in robot-assisted feeding for soft foods. It uses `pre-acquisition actions' such as pushing, cutting, and flipping to improve the success rate of bite acquisition actions such as skewering, scooping, and twirling. If the data-driven model predicts low success for direct bite acquisition, the system initiates a Real2Sim phase, reconstructing the food's geometry in a simulation. The robot explores various pre-acquisition actions in the simulation, then a Sim2Real step renders a photorealistic image to reassess success rates. If the success improves, the robot applies the action in reality. We evaluate the system on 15 diverse plates with 10 types of food items for a soft food diet, showing improvement in bite acquisition success rates by 27\% on average across all plates.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel neural network model capable of discovering high-level skill representations from unlabeled demonstration data. We also propose a bi-level planning pipeline that utilizes our model using a gradient-based planning approach. While extracting high-level representations, our model also preserves the low-level information, which can be used for low-level action planning. In the experiments, we tested the skill discovery performance of our model under different conditions, tested whether Multi-Modal LLMs can be utilized to label the learned high-level skill representations, and finally tested the high-level and low-level planning performance of our pipeline.</description>

      <title>Dreaming to Assist: Learning to Align with Human Objectives for Shared Control in High-Speed Racing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tight coordination is required for effective human-robot teams in domains involving fast dynamics and tactical decisions, such as multi-car racing. In such settings, robot teammates must react to cues of a human teammate's tactical objective to assist in a way that is consistent with the objective (e.g., navigating left or right around an obstacle). To address this challenge, we present Dream2Assist, a framework that combines a rich world model able to infer human objectives and value functions, and an assistive agent that provides appropriate expert assistance to a given human teammate. Our approach builds on a recurrent state space model to explicitly infer human intents, enabling the assistive agent to select actions that align with the human and enabling a fluid teaming interaction. We demonstrate our approach in a high-speed racing domain with a population of synthetic human drivers pursuing mutually exclusive objectives, such as "stay-behind" and "overtake". We show that the combined human-robot team, when blending its actions with those of the human, outperforms the synthetic humans alone as well as several baseline assistance strategies, and that intent-conditioning enables adherence to human preferences during task execution, leading to improved performance while satisfying the human's objective.</description>

      <title>NeRF-enabled Analysis-Through-Synthesis for ISAR Imaging of Small Everyday Objects with Sparse and Noisy UWB Radar Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) imaging presents a formidable challenge when it comes to small everyday objects due to their limited Radar Cross-Section (RCS) and the inherent resolution constraints of radar systems. Existing ISAR reconstruction methods including backprojection (BP) often require complex setups and controlled environments, rendering them impractical for many real-world noisy scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel Analysis-through-Synthesis (ATS) framework enabled by Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for high-resolution coherent ISAR imaging of small objects using sparse and noisy Ultra-Wideband (UWB) radar data with an inexpensive and portable setup. Our end-to-end framework integrates ultra-wideband radar wave propagation, reflection characteristics, and scene priors, enabling efficient 2D scene reconstruction without the need for costly anechoic chambers or complex measurement test beds. With qualitative and quantitative comparisons, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional techniques and generates ISAR images of complex scenes with multiple targets and complex structures in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) and noisy scenarios, particularly with limited number of views and sparse UWB radar scans. This work represents a significant step towards practical, cost-effective ISAR imaging of small everyday objects, with broad implications for robotics and mobile sensing applications.</description>

      <title>The Ingredients for Robotic Diffusion Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years roboticists have achieved remarkable progress in solving increasingly general tasks on dexterous robotic hardware by leveraging high capacity Transformer network architectures and generative diffusion models. Unfortunately, combining these two orthogonal improvements has proven surprisingly difficult, since there is no clear and well-understood process for making important design choices. In this paper, we identify, study and improve key architectural design decisions for high-capacity diffusion transformer policies. The resulting models can efficiently solve diverse tasks on multiple robot embodiments, without the excruciating pain of per-setup hyper-parameter tuning. By combining the results of our investigation with our improved model components, we are able to present a novel architecture, named \method, that significantly outperforms the state of the art in solving long-horizon ($1500+$ time-steps) dexterous tasks on a bi-manual ALOHA robot. In addition, we find that our policies show improved scaling performance when trained on 10 hours of highly multi-modal, language annotated ALOHA demonstration data. We hope this work will open the door for future robot learning techniques that leverage the efficiency of generative diffusion modeling with the scalability of large scale transformer architectures.

      <title>Signage-Aware Exploration in Open World using Venue Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current exploration methods struggle to search for shops in unknown open-world environments due to a lack of prior knowledge and text recognition capabilities. Venue maps offer valuable information that can aid exploration planning by correlating scene signage with map data. However, the arbitrary shapes and styles of the text on signage, along with multi-view inconsistencies, pose significant challenges for accurate recognition by robots. Additionally, the discrepancies between real-world environments and venue maps hinder the incorporation of text information into planners. This paper introduces a novel signage-aware exploration system to address these challenges, enabling the robot to utilize venue maps effectively. We propose a signage understanding method that accurately detects and recognizes the text on signage using a diffusion-based text instance retrieval method combined with a 2D-to-3D semantic fusion strategy. Furthermore, we design a venue map-guided exploration-exploitation planner that balances exploration in unknown regions using a directional heuristic derived from venue maps with exploitation to get close and adjust orientation for better recognition. Experiments in large-scale shopping malls demonstrate our method's superior signage recognition accuracy and coverage efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art scene text spotting methods and traditional exploration methods.</description>

      <title>A Surface Adaptive First-Look Inspection Planner for Autonomous Remote Sensing of Open-Pit Mines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present an autonomous inspection framework for remote sensing tasks in active open-pit mines. Specifically, the contributions are focused towards developing a methodology where an initial approximate operator-defined inspection plan is exploited by an online view-planner to predict an inspection path that can adapt to changes in the current mine-face morphology caused by route mining activities. The proposed inspection framework leverages instantaneous 3D LiDAR and localization measurements coupled with modelled sensor footprint for view-planning satisfying desired viewing and photogrammetric conditions. The efficacy of the proposed framework has been demonstrated through simulation in Feiring-Bruk open-pit mine environment and hardware-based outdoor experimental trials. The video showcasing the performance of the proposed work can be found here: https://youtu.be/uWWbDfoBvFc</description>

      <title>Kinematic-ICP: Enhancing LiDAR Odometry with Kinematic Constraints for Wheeled Mobile Robots Moving on Planar Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiDAR odometry is essential for many robotics applications, including 3D mapping, navigation, and simultaneous localization and mapping. LiDAR odometry systems are usually based on some form of point cloud registration to compute the ego-motion of a mobile robot. Yet, few of today's LiDAR odometry systems consider the domain-specific knowledge and the kinematic model of the mobile platform during the point cloud alignment. In this paper, we present Kinematic-ICP, a LiDAR odometry system that focuses on wheeled mobile robots equipped with a 3D LiDAR and moving on a planar surface, which is a common assumption for warehouses, offices, hospitals, etc. Our approach introduces kinematic constraints within the optimization of a traditional point-to-point iterative closest point scheme. In this way, the resulting motion follows the kinematic constraints of the platform, effectively exploiting the robot's wheel odometry and the 3D LiDAR observations. We dynamically adjust the influence of LiDAR measurements and wheel odometry in our optimization scheme, allowing the system to handle degenerate scenarios such as feature-poor corridors. We evaluate our approach on robots operating in large-scale warehouse environments, but also outdoors. The experiments show that our approach achieves top performances and is more accurate than wheel odometry and common LiDAR odometry systems. Kinematic-ICP has been recently deployed in the Dexory fleet of robots operating in warehouses worldwide at their customers' sites, showing that our method can run in the real world alongside a complete navigation stack.</description>

      <title>Preliminary Evaluation of an Ultrasound-Guided Robotic System for Autonomous Percutaneous Intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cancer cases have been rising globally, resulting in nearly 10 million deaths in 2023. Biopsy, crucial for diagnosis, is often performed under ultrasound (US) guidance, demanding precise hand coordination and cognitive decision-making. Robot-assisted interventions have shown improved accuracy in lesion targeting by addressing challenges such as noisy 2D images and maintaining consistent probe-to-surface contact. Recent research has focused on fully autonomous robotic US systems to enable standardized diagnostic procedures and reproducible US-guided therapy. This study presents a fully autonomous system for US-guided needle placement capable of performing end-to-end clinical workflow. The system autonomously: 1) identifies the liver region on the patient's abdomen surface, 2) plans and executes the US scanning path using impedance control, 3) localizes lesions from the US images in real-time, and 4) targets the identified lesions, all without human intervention. This study evaluates both position and impedance-controlled systems. Validation on agar phantoms demonstrated a targeting error of 5.74 +- 2.70 mm, highlighting its potential for accurately targeting tumors larger than 5 mm. Achieved results show its potential for a fully autonomous system for US-guided biopsies.</description>

      <title>HumanFT: A Human-like Fingertip Multimodal Visuo-Tactile Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tactile sensors play a crucial role in enabling robots to interact effectively and safely with objects in everyday tasks. In particular, visuotactile sensors have seen increasing usage in two and three-fingered grippers due to their high-quality feedback. However, a significant gap remains in the development of sensors suitable for humanoid robots, especially five-fingered dexterous hands. One reason is because of the challenges in designing and manufacturing sensors that are compact in size. In this paper, we propose HumanFT, a multimodal visuotactile sensor that replicates the shape and functionality of a human fingertip. To bridge the gap between human and robotic tactile sensing, our sensor features real-time force measurements, high-frequency vibration detection, and overtemperature alerts. To achieve this, we developed a suite of fabrication techniques for a new type of elastomer optimized for force propagation and temperature sensing. Besides, our sensor integrates circuits capable of sensing pressure and vibration. These capabilities have been validated through experiments. The proposed design is simple and cost-effective to fabricate. We believe HumanFT can enhance humanoid robots' perception by capturing and interpreting multimodal tactile information.</description>

      <title>Efficiently Obtaining Reachset Conformance for the Formal Analysis of Robotic Contact Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formal verification of robotic tasks requires a simple yet conformant model of the used robot. We present the first work on generating reachset conformant models for robotic contact tasks considering hybrid (mixed continuous and discrete) dynamics. Reachset conformance requires that the set of reachable outputs of the abstract model encloses all previous measurements to transfer safety properties. Aiming for industrial applications, we describe the system using a simple hybrid automaton with linear dynamics. We inject non-determinism into the continuous dynamics and the discrete transitions, and we optimally identify all model parameters together with the non-determinism required to capture the recorded behaviors. Using two 3-DOF robots, we show that our approach can effectively generate models to capture uncertainties in system behavior and substantially reduce the required testing effort in industrial applications.</description>

      <title>PIVOT-R: Primitive-Driven Waypoint-Aware World Model for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language-guided robotic manipulation is a challenging task that requires an embodied agent to follow abstract user instructions to accomplish various complex manipulation tasks. Previous work trivially fitting the data without revealing the relation between instruction and low-level executable actions, these models are prone to memorizing the surficial pattern of the data instead of acquiring the transferable knowledge, and thus are fragile to dynamic environment changes. To address this issue, we propose a PrIrmitive-driVen waypOinT-aware world model for Robotic manipulation (PIVOT-R) that focuses solely on the prediction of task-relevant waypoints. Specifically, PIVOT-R consists of a Waypoint-aware World Model (WAWM) and a lightweight action prediction module. The former performs primitive action parsing and primitive-driven waypoint prediction, while the latter focuses on decoding low-level actions. Additionally, we also design an asynchronous hierarchical executor (AHE), which can use different execution frequencies for different modules of the model, thereby helping the model reduce computational redundancy and improve model execution efficiency. Our PIVOT-R outperforms state-of-the-art (SoTA) open-source models on the SeaWave benchmark, achieving an average relative improvement of 19.45% across four levels of instruction tasks. Moreover, compared to the synchronously executed PIVOT-R, the execution efficiency of PIVOT-R with AHE is increased by 28-fold, with only a 2.9% drop in performance. These results provide compelling evidence that our PIVOT-R can significantly improve both the performance and efficiency of robotic manipulation.</description>

      <title>SMART-TRACK: A Novel Kalman Filter-Guided Sensor Fusion For Robust UAV Object Tracking in Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of sensor fusion and state estimation for object detection and localization, ensuring accurate tracking in dynamic environments poses significant challenges. Traditional methods like the Kalman Filter (KF) often fail when measurements are intermittent, leading to rapid divergence in state estimations. To address this, we introduce SMART (Sensor Measurement Augmentation and Reacquisition Tracker), a novel approach that leverages high-frequency state estimates from the KF to guide the search for new measurements, maintaining tracking continuity even when direct measurements falter. This is crucial for dynamic environments where traditional methods struggle. Our contributions include: 1) Versatile Measurement Augmentation Using KF Feedback: We implement a versatile measurement augmentation system that serves as a backup when primary object detectors fail intermittently. This system is adaptable to various sensors, demonstrated using depth cameras where KF's 3D predictions are projected into 2D depth image coordinates, integrating nonlinear covariance propagation techniques simplified to first-order approximations. 2) Open-source ROS2 Implementation: We provide an open-source ROS2 implementation of the SMART-TRACK framework, validated in a realistic simulation environment using Gazebo and ROS2, fostering broader adaptation and further research. Our results showcase significant enhancements in tracking stability, with estimation RMSE as low as 0.04 m during measurement disruptions, advancing the robustness of UAV tracking and expanding the potential for reliable autonomous UAV operations in complex scenarios. The implementation is available at https://github.com/mzahana/SMART-TRACK.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) based quadrupedal locomotion control has emerged as an extensively researched field, driven by the potential advantages of autonomous learning and adaptation compared to traditional control methods. This paper provides a comprehensive study of the latest research in applying RL techniques to develop locomotion controllers for quadrupedal robots. We present a detailed overview of the core concepts, methodologies, and key advancements in RL-based locomotion controllers, including learning algorithms, training curricula, reward formulations, and simulation-to-real transfer techniques. The study covers both gait-bound and gait-free approaches, highlighting their respective strengths and limitations. Additionally, we discuss the integration of these controllers with robotic hardware and the role of sensor feedback in enabling adaptive behavior. The paper also outlines future research directions, such as incorporating exteroceptive sensing, combining model-based and model-free techniques, and developing online learning capabilities. Our study aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive understanding of the state-of-the-art in RL-based locomotion controllers, enabling them to build upon existing work and explore novel solutions for enhancing the mobility and adaptability of quadrupedal robots in real-world environments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the concept of reflexive actuation, examining how robots may leverage both internal and external stimuli to trigger changes in the motion, performance, or physical characteristics of the robot, such as its size, shape, or configuration, and so on. These changes themselves may in turn be sequentially re-used as input to drive further adaptations. Drawing inspiration from biological systems, where reflexes are an essential component of the response to environmental changes, reflexive actuation is critical to enable robots to adapt to diverse situations and perform complex tasks. The underlying principles of reflexive actuation are analyzed, with examples provided from existing implementations such as contact-sensitive reflexive arms, physical counters, and their applications. The paper also outlines future directions and challenges for advancing this research area, emphasizing its significance in the development of adaptive, responsive robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Words to Wheels: Vision-Based Autonomous Driving Understanding Human Language Instructions Using Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative application of foundation models, enabling Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) equipped with an RGB-D camera to navigate to designated destinations based on human language instructions. Unlike learning-based methods, this approach does not require prior training but instead leverages existing foundation models, thus facilitating generalization to novel environments. Upon receiving human language instructions, these are transformed into a 'cognitive route description' using a large language model (LLM)-a detailed navigation route expressed in human language. The vehicle then decomposes this description into landmarks and navigation maneuvers. The vehicle also determines elevation costs and identifies navigability levels of different regions through a terrain segmentation model, GANav, trained on open datasets. Semantic elevation costs, which take both elevation and navigability levels into account, are estimated and provided to the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) planner, responsible for local path planning. Concurrently, the vehicle searches for target landmarks using foundation models, including YOLO-World and EfficientViT-SAM. Ultimately, the vehicle executes the navigation commands to reach the designated destination, the final landmark. Our experiments demonstrate that this application successfully guides UGVs to their destinations following human language instructions in novel environments, such as unfamiliar terrain or urban settings.</description>

      <title>Ergodic Trajectory Optimization on Generalized Domains Using Maximum Mean Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel formulation of ergodic trajectory optimization that can be specified over general domains using kernel maximum mean discrepancy. Ergodic trajectory optimization is an effective approach that generates coverage paths for problems related to robotic inspection, information gathering problems, and search and rescue. These optimization schemes compel the robot to spend time in a region proportional to the expected utility of visiting that region. Current methods for ergodic trajectory optimization rely on domain-specific knowledge, e.g., a defined utility map, and well-defined spatial basis functions to produce ergodic trajectories. Here, we present a generalization of ergodic trajectory optimization based on maximum mean discrepancy that requires only samples from the search domain. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to produce coverage trajectories on a variety of problem domains including robotic inspection of objects with differential kinematics constraints and on Lie groups without having access to domain specific knowledge. Furthermore, we show favorable computational scaling compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for ergodic trajectory optimization with a trade-off between domain specific knowledge and computational scaling, thus extending the versatility of ergodic coverage on a wider application domain.</description>

      <title>Fully Asynchronous Neuromorphic Perception for Mobile Robot Dodging with Loihi Chips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse and asynchronous sensing and processing in natural organisms lead to ultra low-latency and energy-efficient perception. Event cameras, known as neuromorphic vision sensors, are designed to mimic these characteristics. However, fully utilizing the sparse and asynchronous event stream remains challenging. Influenced by the mature algorithms of standard cameras, most existing event-based algorithms still rely on the "group of events" processing paradigm (e.g., event frames, 3D voxels) when handling event streams. This paradigm encounters issues such as feature loss, event stacking, and high computational burden, which deviates from the intended purpose of event cameras. To address these issues, we propose a fully asynchronous neuromorphic paradigm that integrates event cameras, spiking networks, and neuromorphic processors (Intel Loihi). This paradigm can faithfully process each event asynchronously as it arrives, mimicking the spike-driven signal processing in biological brains. We compare the proposed paradigm with the existing "group of events" processing paradigm in detail on the real mobile robot dodging task. Experimental results show that our scheme exhibits better robustness than frame-based methods with different time windows and light conditions. Additionally, the energy consumption per inference of our scheme on the embedded Loihi processor is only 4.30% of that of the event spike tensor method on NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX with energy-saving mode, and 1.64% of that of the event frame method on the same neuromorphic processor. As far as we know, this is the first time that a fully asynchronous neuromorphic paradigm has been implemented for solving sequential tasks on real mobile robot.</description>

      <title>Traversability-Aware Legged Navigation by Learning from Real-World Visual Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enhanced mobility brought by legged locomotion empowers quadrupedal robots to navigate through complex and unstructured environments. However, optimizing agile locomotion while accounting for the varying energy costs of traversing different terrains remains an open challenge. Most previous work focuses on planning trajectories with traversability cost estimation based on human-labeled environmental features. However, this human-centric approach is insufficient because it does not account for the varying capabilities of the robot locomotion controllers over challenging terrains. To address this, we develop a novel traversability estimator in a robot-centric manner, based on the value function of the robot's locomotion controller. This estimator is integrated into a new learning-based RGBD navigation framework. The framework develops a planner that guides the robot in avoiding obstacles and hard-to-traverse terrains while reaching its goals. The training of the navigation planner is directly performed in the real world using a sample efficient reinforcement learning method. Through extensive benchmarking, we demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves the best performance in accurate traversability cost estimation and efficient learning from multi-modal data (the robot's color and depth vision, and proprioceptive feedback) for real-world training. Using the proposed method, a quadrupedal robot learns to perform traversability-aware navigation through trial and error in various real-world environments with challenging terrains that are difficult to classify using depth vision alone.</description>

      <title>DR-MPC: Deep Residual Model Predictive Control for Real-world Social Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can a robot safely navigate around people exhibiting complex motion patterns? Reinforcement Learning (RL) or Deep RL (DRL) in simulation holds some promise, although much prior work relies on simulators that fail to precisely capture the nuances of real human motion. To address this gap, we propose Deep Residual Model Predictive Control (DR-MPC), a method to enable robots to quickly and safely perform DRL from real-world crowd navigation data. By blending MPC with model-free DRL, DR-MPC overcomes the traditional DRL challenges of large data requirements and unsafe initial behavior. DR-MPC is initialized with MPC-based path tracking, and gradually learns to interact more effectively with humans. To further accelerate learning, a safety component estimates when the robot encounters out-of-distribution states and guides it away from likely collisions. In simulation, we show that DR-MPC substantially outperforms prior work, including traditional DRL and residual DRL models. Real-world experiments show our approach successfully enables a robot to navigate a variety of crowded situations with few errors using less than 4 hours of training data.</description>

      <title>Navigation under uncertainty: Trajectory prediction and occlusion reasoning with switching dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting future trajectories of nearby objects, especially under occlusion, is a crucial task in autonomous driving and safe robot navigation. Prior works typically neglect to maintain uncertainty about occluded objects and only predict trajectories of observed objects using high-capacity models such as Transformers trained on large datasets. While these approaches are effective in standard scenarios, they can struggle to generalize to the long-tail, safety-critical scenarios. In this work, we explore a conceptual framework unifying trajectory prediction and occlusion reasoning under the same class of structured probabilistic generative model, namely, switching dynamical systems. We then present some initial experiments illustrating its capabilities using the Waymo open dataset.</description>

      <title>MLP-SLAM: Multilayer Perceptron-Based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping With a Dynamic and Static Object Discriminator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (V-SLAM) system has seen significant development in recent years, demonstrating high precision in environments with limited dynamic objects. However, their performance significantly deteriorates when deployed in settings with a higher presence of movable objects, such as environments with pedestrians, cars, and buses, which are common in outdoor scenes. To address this issue, we propose a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)-based real-time stereo SLAM system that leverages complete geometry information to avoid information loss. Moreover, there is currently no publicly available dataset for directly evaluating the effectiveness of dynamic and static feature classification methods, and to bridge this gap, we have created a publicly available dataset containing over 50,000 feature points. Experimental results demonstrate that our MLP-based dynamic and static feature point discriminator has achieved superior performance compared to other methods on this dataset. Furthermore, the MLP-based real-time stereo SLAM system has shown the highest average precision and fastest speed on the outdoor KITTI tracking datasets compared to other dynamic SLAM systems.The open-source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/TaozheLi/MLP-SLAM.</description>

      <title>Active Learning of Robot Vision Using Adaptive Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robots need robust and flexible vision systems to perceive and reason about their environments beyond geometry. Most of such systems build upon deep learning approaches. As autonomous robots are commonly deployed in initially unknown environments, pre-training on static datasets cannot always capture the variety of domains and limits the robot's vision performance during missions. Recently, self-supervised as well as fully supervised active learning methods emerged to improve robotic vision. These approaches rely on large in-domain pre-training datasets or require substantial human labelling effort. To address these issues, we present a recent adaptive planning framework for efficient training data collection to substantially reduce human labelling requirements in semantic terrain monitoring missions. To this end, we combine high-quality human labels with automatically generated pseudo labels. Experimental results show that the framework reaches segmentation performance close to fully supervised approaches with drastically reduced human labelling effort while outperforming purely self-supervised approaches. We discuss the advantages and limitations of current methods and outline valuable future research avenues towards more robust and flexible robotic vision systems in unknown environments.</description>

      <title>Harnessing with Twisting: Single-Arm Deformable Linear Object Manipulation for Industrial Harnessing Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wire-harnessing tasks pose great challenges to be automated by the robot due to the complex dynamics and unpredictable behavior of the deformable wire. Traditional methods, often reliant on dual-robot arms or tactile sensing, face limitations in adaptability, cost, and scalability. This paper introduces a novel single-robot wire-harnessing pipeline that leverages a robot's twisting motion to generate necessary wire tension for precise insertion into clamps, using only one robot arm with an integrated force/torque (F/T) sensor. Benefiting from this design, the single robot arm can efficiently apply tension for wire routing and insertion into clamps in a narrow space. Our approach is structured around four principal components: a Model Predictive Control (MPC) based on the Koopman operator for tension tracking and wire following, a motion planner for sequencing harnessing waypoints, a suite of insertion primitives for clamp engagement, and a fix-point switching mechanism for wire constraint updating. Evaluated on an industrial-level wire harnessing task, our method demonstrated superior performance and reliability over conventional approaches, efficiently handling both single and multiple wire configurations with high success rates.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Diffusion Terrain Generator for Autonomous Uneven Terrain Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful method for developing robust robot control policies capable of navigating through complex and unstructured terrains. The effectiveness of these methods hinges on two essential elements: (1) the use of massively parallel physics simulations to expedite policy training, and (2) an environment generator tasked with crafting sufficiently challenging yet attainable terrains to facilitate continuous policy improvement. Existing methods of environment generation often rely on heuristics constrained by a set of parameters, limiting the diversity and realism. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Diffusion Terrain Generator (ADTG), a novel method that leverages Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models to dynamically expand existing training environments by adding more diverse and complex terrains adaptive to the current policy. ADTG guides the diffusion model's generation process through initial noise optimization, blending noise-corrupted terrains from existing training environments weighted by the policy's performance in each corresponding environment. By manipulating the noise corruption level, ADTG seamlessly transitions between generating similar terrains for policy fine-tuning and novel ones to expand training diversity. Our experiments show that the policy trained by ADTG outperforms both procedural generated and natural environments, along with popular navigation methods.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Degeneracy Detection for Point-to-Plane Error Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Degeneracies arising from uninformative geometry are known to deteriorate LiDAR-based localization and mapping. This work introduces a new probabilistic method to detect and mitigate the effect of degeneracies in point-to-plane error minimization. The noise on the Hessian of the point-to-plane optimization problem is characterized by the noise on points and surface normals used in its construction. We exploit this characterization to quantify the probability of a direction being degenerate. The degeneracy-detection procedure is used in a new real-time degeneracy-aware iterative closest point algorithm for LiDAR registration, in which we smoothly attenuate updates in degenerate directions. The method's parameters are selected based on the noise characteristics provided in the LiDAR's datasheet. We validate the approach in four real-world experiments, demonstrating that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods at detecting and mitigating the adverse effects of degeneracies. For the benefit of the community, we release the code for the method at: github.com/ntnu-arl/drpm.</description>

      <title>Generalizable Humanoid Manipulation with Improved 3D Diffusion Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humanoid robots capable of autonomous operation in diverse environments have long been a goal for roboticists. However, autonomous manipulation by humanoid robots has largely been restricted to one specific scene, primarily due to the difficulty of acquiring generalizable skills. Recent advances in 3D visuomotor policies, such as the 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3), have shown promise in extending these capabilities to wilder environments. However, 3D visuomotor policies often rely on camera calibration and point-cloud segmentation, which present challenges for deployment on mobile robots like humanoids. In this work, we introduce the Improved 3D Diffusion Policy (iDP3), a novel 3D visuomotor policy that eliminates these constraints by leveraging egocentric 3D visual representations. We demonstrate that iDP3 enables a full-sized humanoid robot to autonomously perform skills in diverse real-world scenarios, using only data collected in the lab.

      <title>Semantic Environment Atlas for Object-Goal Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Semantic Environment Atlas (SEA), a novel mapping approach designed to enhance visual navigation capabilities of embodied agents. The SEA utilizes semantic graph maps that intricately delineate the relationships between places and objects, thereby enriching the navigational context. These maps are constructed from image observations and capture visual landmarks as sparsely encoded nodes within the environment. The SEA integrates multiple semantic maps from various environments, retaining a memory of place-object relationships, which proves invaluable for tasks such as visual localization and navigation. We developed navigation frameworks that effectively leverage the SEA, and we evaluated these frameworks through visual localization and object-goal navigation tasks. Our SEA-based localization framework significantly outperforms existing methods, accurately identifying locations from single query images. Experimental results in Habitat scenarios show that our method not only achieves a success rate of 39.0%, an improvement of 12.4% over the current state-of-the-art, but also maintains robustness under noisy odometry and actuation conditions, all while keeping computational costs low.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Robotics Systems Issues with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quickly resolving issues reported in industrial applications is crucial to minimize economic impact. However, the required data analysis makes diagnosing the underlying root causes a challenging and time-consuming task, even for experts. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) excel at analyzing large amounts of data. Indeed, prior work in AI-Ops demonstrates their effectiveness in analyzing IT systems. Here, we extend this work to the challenging and largely unexplored domain of robotics systems. To this end, we create SYSDIAGBENCH, a proprietary system diagnostics benchmark for robotics, containing over 2500 reported issues. We leverage SYSDIAGBENCH to investigate the performance of LLMs for root cause analysis, considering a range of model sizes and adaptation techniques. Our results show that QLoRA finetuning can be sufficient to let a 7B-parameter model outperform GPT-4 in terms of diagnostic accuracy while being significantly more cost-effective. We validate our LLM-as-a-judge results with a human expert study and find that our best model achieves similar approval ratings as our reference labels.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents the Articulated Animal AI Environment for Animal Cognition, an enhanced version of the previous AnimalAI Environment. Key improvements include the addition of agent limbs, enabling more complex behaviors and interactions with the environment that closely resemble real animal movements. The testbench features an integrated curriculum training sequence and evaluation tools, eliminating the need for users to develop their own training programs. Additionally, the tests and training procedures are randomized, which will improve the agent's generalization capabilities. These advancements significantly expand upon the original AnimalAI framework and will be used to evaluate agents on various aspects of animal cognition.</description>

      <title>ESVO2: Direct Visual-Inertial Odometry with Stereo Event Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event-based visual odometry is a specific branch of visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques, which aims at solving tracking and mapping sub-problems in parallel by exploiting the special working principles of neuromorphic (ie, event-based) cameras. Due to the motion-dependent nature of event data, explicit data association ie, feature matching under large-baseline view-point changes is hardly established, making direct methods a more rational choice. However, state-of-the-art direct methods are limited by the high computational complexity of the mapping sub-problem and the degeneracy of camera pose tracking in certain degrees of freedom (DoF) in rotation. In this paper, we resolve these issues by building an event-based stereo visual-inertial odometry system on top of our previous direct pipeline Event-based Stereo Visual Odometry. Specifically, to speed up the mapping operation, we propose an efficient strategy for sampling contour points according to the local dynamics of events. The mapping performance is also improved in terms of structure completeness and local smoothness by merging the temporal stereo and static stereo results. To circumvent the degeneracy of camera pose tracking in recovering the pitch and yaw components of general six-DoF motion, we introduce IMU measurements as motion priors via pre-integration. To this end, a compact back-end is proposed for continuously updating the IMU bias and predicting the linear velocity, enabling an accurate motion prediction for camera pose tracking. The resulting system scales well with modern high-resolution event cameras and leads to better global positioning accuracy in large-scale outdoor environments. Extensive evaluations on five publicly available datasets featuring different resolutions and scenarios justify the superior performance of the proposed system against five state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>ActSafe: Active Exploration with Safety Constraints for Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is ubiquitous in the development of modern AI systems. However, state-of-the-art RL agents require extensive, and potentially unsafe, interactions with their environments to learn effectively. These limitations confine RL agents to simulated environments, hindering their ability to learn directly in real-world settings. In this work, we present ActSafe, a novel model-based RL algorithm for safe and efficient exploration. ActSafe learns a well-calibrated probabilistic model of the system and plans optimistically w.r.t. the epistemic uncertainty about the unknown dynamics, while enforcing pessimism w.r.t. the safety constraints. Under regularity assumptions on the constraints and dynamics, we show that ActSafe guarantees safety during learning while also obtaining a near-optimal policy in finite time. In addition, we propose a practical variant of ActSafe that builds on latest model-based RL advancements and enables safe exploration even in high-dimensional settings such as visual control. We empirically show that ActSafe obtains state-of-the-art performance in difficult exploration tasks on standard safe deep RL benchmarks while ensuring safety during learning.</description>

Abstract: This work introduces Transformer-based Off-Policy Episodic Reinforcement Learning (TOP-ERL), a novel algorithm that enables off-policy updates in the ERL framework. In ERL, policies predict entire action trajectories over multiple time steps instead of single actions at every time step. These trajectories are typically parameterized by trajectory generators such as Movement Primitives (MP), allowing for smooth and efficient exploration over long horizons while capturing high-level temporal correlations. However, ERL methods are often constrained to on-policy frameworks due to the difficulty of evaluating state-action values for entire action sequences, limiting their sample efficiency and preventing the use of more efficient off-policy architectures. TOP-ERL addresses this shortcoming by segmenting long action sequences and estimating the state-action values for each segment using a transformer-based critic architecture alongside an n-step return estimation. These contributions result in efficient and stable training that is reflected in the empirical results conducted on sophisticated robot learning environments. TOP-ERL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RL methods. Thorough ablation studies additionally show the impact of key design choices on the model performance.</description>

      <title>Generating Driving Simulations via Conversation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyber-physical systems like autonomous vehicles are tested in simulation before deployment, using domain-specific programs for scenario specification. To aid the testing of autonomous vehicles in simulation, we design a natural language interface, using an instruction-following large language model, to assist a non-coding domain expert in synthesising the desired scenarios and vehicle behaviours. We show that using it to convert utterances to the symbolic program is feasible, despite the very small training dataset. Human experiments show that dialogue is critical to successful simulation generation, leading to a 4.5 times higher success rate than a generation without engaging in extended conversation.</description>

      <title>Make the Pertinent Salient: Task-Relevant Reconstruction for Visual Control with Distractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) have made it a powerful tool for visual control tasks. Despite improved data efficiency, it remains challenging to train MBRL agents with generalizable perception. Training in the presence of visual distractions is particularly difficult due to the high variation they introduce to representation learning. Building on DREAMER, a popular MBRL method, we propose a simple yet effective auxiliary task to facilitate representation learning in distracting environments. Under the assumption that task-relevant components of image observations are straightforward to identify with prior knowledge in a given task, we use a segmentation mask on image observations to only reconstruct task-relevant components. In doing so, we greatly reduce the complexity of representation learning by removing the need to encode task-irrelevant objects in the latent representation. Our method, Segmentation Dreamer (SD), can be used either with ground-truth masks easily accessible in simulation or by leveraging potentially imperfect segmentation foundation models. The latter is further improved by selectively applying the reconstruction loss to avoid providing misleading learning signals due to mask prediction errors. In modified DeepMind Control suite (DMC) and Meta-World tasks with added visual distractions, SD achieves significantly better sample efficiency and greater final performance than prior work. We find that SD is especially helpful in sparse reward tasks otherwise unsolvable by prior work, enabling the training of visually robust agents without the need for extensive reward engineering.</description>

      <title>Trust or Bust: Ensuring Trustworthiness in Autonomous Weapon Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Autonomous Weapon Systems (AWS) into military operations presents both significant opportunities and challenges. This paper explores the multifaceted nature of trust in AWS, emphasising the necessity of establishing reliable and transparent systems to mitigate risks associated with bias, operational failures, and accountability. Despite advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), the trustworthiness of these systems, especially in high-stakes military applications, remains a critical issue. Through a systematic review of existing literature, this research identifies gaps in the understanding of trust dynamics during the development and deployment phases of AWS. It advocates for a collaborative approach that includes technologists, ethicists, and military strategists to address these ongoing challenges. The findings underscore the importance of Human-Machine teaming and enhancing system intelligibility to ensure accountability and adherence to International Humanitarian Law. Ultimately, this paper aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse on the ethical implications of AWS and the imperative for trustworthy AI in defense contexts.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Local Features and Range Images for Small Data Real-Time Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation of point clouds is an essential task for understanding the environment in autonomous driving and robotics. Recent range-based works achieve real-time efficiency, while point- and voxel-based methods produce better results but are affected by high computational complexity. Moreover, highly complex deep learning models are often not suited to efficiently learn from small datasets. Their generalization capabilities can easily be driven by the abundance of data rather than the architecture design. In this paper, we harness the information from the three-dimensional representation to proficiently capture local features, while introducing the range image representation to incorporate additional information and facilitate fast computation. A GPU-based KDTree allows for rapid building, querying, and enhancing projection with straightforward operations. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate the benefits of our modification in a ``small data'' setup, in which only one sequence of the dataset is used to train the models, but also in the conventional setup, where all sequences except one are used for training. We show that a reduced version of our model not only demonstrates strong competitiveness against full-scale state-of-the-art models but also operates in real-time, making it a viable choice for real-world case applications. The code of our method is available at https://github.com/Bender97/WaffleAndRange.</description>

      <title>ROSAR: An Adversarial Re-Training Framework for Robust Side-Scan Sonar Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces ROSAR, a novel framework enhancing the robustness of deep learning object detection models tailored for side-scan sonar (SSS) images, generated by autonomous underwater vehicles using sonar sensors. By extending our prior work on knowledge distillation (KD), this framework integrates KD with adversarial retraining to address the dual challenges of model efficiency and robustness against SSS noises. We introduce three novel, publicly available SSS datasets, capturing different sonar setups and noise conditions. We propose and formalize two SSS safety properties and utilize them to generate adversarial datasets for retraining. Through a comparative analysis of projected gradient descent (PGD) and patch-based adversarial attacks, ROSAR demonstrates significant improvements in model robustness and detection accuracy under SSS-specific conditions, enhancing the model's robustness by up to 1.85%. ROSAR is available at https://github.com/remaro-network/ROSAR-framework.</description>

      <title>ShieldNN: A Provably Safe NN Filter for Unsafe NN Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.09564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel closed-form Control Barrier Function (CBF) and associated controller shield for the Kinematic Bicycle Model (KBM) with respect to obstacle avoidance. The proposed CBF and shield -- designed by an algorithm we call ShieldNN -- provide two crucial advantages over existing methodologies. First, ShieldNN considers steering and velocity constraints directly with the non-affine KBM dynamics; this is in contrast to more general methods, which typically consider only affine dynamics and do not guarantee invariance properties under control constraints. Second, ShieldNN provides a closed-form set of safe controls for each state unlike more general methods, which typically rely on optimization algorithms to generate a single instantaneous for each state. Together, these advantages make ShieldNN uniquely suited as an efficient Multi-Obstacle Safe Actions (i.e. multiple-barrier-function shielding) during training time of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) enabled NN controller. We show via experiments that ShieldNN dramatically increases the completion rate of RL training episodes in the presence of multiple obstacles, thus establishing the value of ShieldNN in training RL-based controllers.</description>

      <title>The Brain-Inspired Cooperative Shared Control Framework for Brain-Machine Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09531v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In brain-machine interface (BMI) applications, a key challenge is the low information content and high noise level in neural signals, severely affecting stable robotic control. To address this challenge, we proposes a cooperative shared control framework based on brain-inspired intelligence, where control signals are decoded from neural activity, and the robot handles the fine control. This allows for a combination of flexible and adaptive interaction control between the robot and the brain, making intricate human-robot collaboration feasible. The proposed framework utilizes spiking neural networks (SNNs) for controlling robotic arm and wheel, including speed and steering. While full integration of the system remains a future goal, individual modules for robotic arm control, object tracking, and map generation have been successfully implemented. The framework is expected to significantly enhance the performance of BMI. In practical settings, the BMI with cooperative shared control, utilizing a brain-inspired algorithm, will greatly enhance the potential for clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Distributed Optimization Methods for Multi-Robot Systems: Part I -- A Tutorial</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed optimization provides a framework for deriving distributed algorithms for a variety of multi-robot problems. This tutorial constitutes the first part of a two-part series on distributed optimization applied to multi-robot problems, which seeks to advance the application of distributed optimization in robotics. In this tutorial, we demonstrate that many canonical multi-robot problems can be cast within the distributed optimization framework, such as multi-robot simultaneous localization and planning (SLAM), multi-robot target tracking, and multi-robot task assignment problems. We identify three broad categories of distributed optimization algorithms: distributed first-order methods, distributed sequential convex programming, and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We describe the basic structure of each category and provide representative algorithms within each category. We then work through a simulation case study of multiple drones collaboratively tracking a ground vehicle. We compare solutions to this problem using a number of different distributed optimization algorithms. In addition, we implement a distributed optimization algorithm in hardware on a network of Rasberry Pis communicating with XBee modules to illustrate robustness to the challenges of real-world communication networks.</description>

Abstract: Although the field of distributed optimization is well-developed, relevant literature focused on the application of distributed optimization to multi-robot problems is limited. This survey constitutes the second part of a two-part series on distributed optimization applied to multi-robot problems. In this paper, we survey three main classes of distributed optimization algorithms -- distributed first-order methods, distributed sequential convex programming methods, and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) methods -- focusing on fully-distributed methods that do not require coordination or computation by a central computer. We describe the fundamental structure of each category and note important variations around this structure, designed to address its associated drawbacks. Further, we provide practical implications of noteworthy assumptions made by distributed optimization algorithms, noting the classes of robotics problems suitable for these algorithms. Moreover, we identify important open research challenges in distributed optimization, specifically for robotics problems.</description>

      <title>DiMSam: Diffusion Models as Samplers for Task and Motion Planning under Partial Observability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13196v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative models such as diffusion models, excel at capturing high-dimensional distributions with diverse input modalities, e.g. robot trajectories, but are less effective at multi-step constraint reasoning. Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) approaches are suited for planning multi-step autonomous robot manipulation. However, it can be difficult to apply them to domains where the environment and its dynamics are not fully known. We propose to overcome these limitations by composing diffusion models using a TAMP system. We use the learned components for constraints and samplers that are difficult to engineer in the planning model, and use a TAMP solver to search for the task plan with constraint-satisfying action parameter values. To tractably make predictions for unseen objects in the environment, we define the learned samplers and TAMP operators on learned latent embedding of changing object states. We evaluate our approach in a simulated articulated object manipulation domain and show how the combination of classical TAMP, generative modeling, and latent embedding enables multi-step constraint-based reasoning. We also apply the learned sampler in the real world. Website: https://sites.google.com/view/dimsam-tamp</description>

      <title>Learning-on-the-Drive: Self-supervised Adaptation of Visual Offroad Traversability Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous offroad driving is essential for applications like emergency rescue, military operations, and agriculture. Despite progress, systems struggle with high-speed vehicles exceeding 10m/s due to the need for accurate long-range (&gt; 50m) perception for safe navigation. Current approaches are limited by sensor constraints; LiDAR-based methods offer precise short-range data but are noisy beyond 30m, while visual models provide dense long-range measurements but falter with unseen scenarios. To overcome these issues, we introduce ALTER, a learning-on-the-drive perception framework that leverages both sensor types. ALTER uses a self-supervised visual model to learn and adapt from near-range LiDAR measurements, improving long-range prediction in new environments without manual labeling. It also includes a model selection module for better sensor failure response and adaptability to known environments. Testing in two real-world settings showed on average 43.4% better traversability prediction than LiDAR-only and 164% over non-adaptive state-of-the-art (SOTA) visual semantic methods after 45 seconds of online learning.</description>

      <title>A fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for combinatorial filter reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06664v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What is the minimal information that a robot must retain to achieve its task? To design economical robots, the literature dealing with reduction of combinatorial filters approaches this problem algorithmically. As lossless state compression is NP-hard, prior work has examined, along with minimization algorithms, a variety of special cases in which specific properties enable efficient solution. Complementing those findings, this paper refines the present understanding from the perspective of parameterized complexity. We give a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for the general reduction problem by exploiting a transformation into clique covering. The transformation introduces new constraints that arise from sequential dependencies encoded within the input filter -- some of these constraints can be repaired, others are treated through enumeration. Through this approach, we identify parameters affecting filter reduction that are based upon inter-constraint couplings (expressed as a notion of their height and width), which add to the structural parameters present in the unconstrained problem of minimal clique covering. Compared with existing work, we precisely identify and quantitatively characterize those features that contribute to the problem's hardness: given a problem instance, the combinatorial core may be a fraction of the instance's full size, with a small subset of constraints needing to be considered, and even those may have directly identifiable couplings that collapse degrees of freedom in the enumeration.</description>

Abstract: Fruit distribution is pivotal in shaping the future of both agriculture and agricultural robotics, paving the way for a streamlined supply chain. This study introduces an innovative methodology that harnesses the synergy of RGB imagery, LiDAR, and IMU data, to achieve intricate tree reconstructions and the pinpoint localization of fruits. Such integration not only offers insights into the fruit distribution, which enhances the precision of guidance for agricultural robotics and automation systems, but also sets the stage for simulating synthetic fruit patterns across varied tree architectures. To validate this approach, experiments have been carried out in both a controlled environment and an actual peach orchard. The results underscore the robustness and efficacy of this fusion-driven methodology, highlighting its potential as a transformative tool for future agricultural robotics and precision farming.</description>

When juxtaposed with conventional soft and compliant robotic systems, HCMs exhibit pronounced rigidity, augmented mobility, reproducible repeatability, and an effective design and fabrication paradigm. In this research, we investigate the feasibility of utilizing carbon fiber reinforced plastic CFRP as the foundational material for an HCM based fish robot, herein referred to as CarbonFish. Our objective centers on realizing high frequency undulatory motion, thereby laying the groundwork for accelerated aquatic locomotion in subsequent models. We proffer an exhaustive design and fabrication schema underpinned by mathematical principles. Preliminary evaluations of our single actuated CarbonFish have evidenced an undulation frequency approaching 10 Hz, suggesting its potential to outperform other biologically inspired aquatic entities as well as real fish.</description>

      <title>SwarmPRM: Probabilistic Roadmap Motion Planning for Large-Scale Swarm Robotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16699v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale swarm robotic systems consisting of numerous cooperative agents show considerable promise for performing autonomous tasks across various sectors. Nonetheless, traditional motion planning approaches often face a trade-off between scalability and solution quality due to the exponential growth of the joint state space of robots. In response, this work proposes SwarmPRM, a hierarchical, scalable, computationally efficient, and risk-aware sampling-based motion planning approach for large-scale swarm robots. SwarmPRM utilizes a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to represent the swarm's macroscopic state and constructs a Probabilistic Roadmap in Gaussian space, referred to as the Gaussian roadmap, to generate a transport trajectory of GMM. This trajectory is then followed by each robot at the microscopic stage. To enhance trajectory safety, SwarmPRM incorporates the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) in the collision checking process to impart the property of risk awareness to the constructed Gaussian roadmap. SwarmPRM then crafts a linear programming formulation to compute the optimal GMM transport trajectory within this roadmap. Extensive simulations demonstrate that SwarmPRM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in computational efficiency, scalability, and trajectory quality while offering the capability to adjust the risk tolerance of generated trajectories.</description>

Abstract: Manipulating objects with two multi-fingered hands has been a long-standing challenge in robotics, due to the contact-rich nature of many manipulation tasks and the complexity inherent in coordinating a high-dimensional bimanual system. In this work, we share novel insights into physical modeling, real-time perception, and reward design that enable policies trained in simulation using deep reinforcement learning (RL) to be effectively and efficiently transferred to the real world. Specifically, we consider the problem of twisting lids of various bottle-like objects with two hands, demonstrating policies with generalization capabilities across a diverse set of unseen objects as well as dynamic and dexterous behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first sim-to-real RL system that enables such capabilities on bimanual multi-fingered hands.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-based learning of contact plans for agile locomotion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03639v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Legged robots have become capable of performing highly dynamic maneuvers in the past few years. However, agile locomotion in highly constrained environments such as stepping stones is still a challenge. In this paper, we propose a combination of model-based control, search, and learning to design efficient control policies for agile locomotion on stepping stones. In our framework, we use nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to generate whole-body motions for a given contact plan. To efficiently search for an optimal contact plan, we propose to use Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). While the combination of MCTS and NMPC can quickly find a feasible plan for a given environment (a few seconds), it is not yet suitable to be used as a reactive policy. Hence, we generate a dataset for optimal goal-conditioned policy for a given scene and learn it through supervised learning. In particular, we leverage the power of diffusion models in handling multi-modality in the dataset. We test our proposed framework on a scenario where our quadruped robot Solo12 successfully jumps to different goals in a highly constrained environment.</description>

      <title>A Scalable and Parallelizable Digital Twin Framework for Sustainable Sim2Real Transition of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10996v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) systems usually require significantly long training times due to their inherent complexity. Furthermore, deploying them in the real world demands a feature-rich environment along with multiple embodied agents, which may not be feasible due to budget or space limitations, not to mention energy consumption and safety issues. This work tries to address these pain points by presenting a sustainable digital twin framework capable of accelerating MARL training by selectively scaling parallelized workloads on-demand, and transferring the trained policies from simulation to reality using minimal hardware resources. The applicability of the proposed digital twin framework is highlighted through two representative use cases, which cover cooperative as well as competitive classes of MARL problems. We study the effect of agent and environment parallelization on training time and that of systematic domain randomization on zero-shot sim2real transfer across both the case studies. Results indicate up to 76.3% reduction in training time with the proposed parallelization scheme and as low as 2.9% sim2real gap using the suggested deployment method.</description>

Abstract: We propose a hybrid feedback control scheme for the autonomous robot navigation problem in three-dimensional environments with arbitrarily-shaped convex obstacles. The proposed hybrid control strategy, which consists in switching between the move-to-target mode and the obstacle-avoidance mode, guarantees global asymptotic stability of the target location in the obstacle-free workspace. We also provide a procedure for the implementation of the proposed hybrid controller in a priori unknown environments and validate its effectiveness through simulation results.</description>

      <title>Learning Quadruped Locomotion Using Differentiable Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14864v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores the potential of using differentiable simulation for learning quadruped locomotion. Differentiable simulation promises fast convergence and stable training by computing low-variance first-order gradients using robot dynamics. However, its usage for legged robots is still limited to simulation. The main challenge lies in the complex optimization landscape of robotic tasks due to discontinuous dynamics. This work proposes a new differentiable simulation framework to overcome these challenges. Our approach combines a high-fidelity, non-differentiable simulator for forward dynamics with a simplified surrogate model for gradient backpropagation. This approach maintains simulation accuracy by aligning the robot states from the surrogate model with those of the precise, non-differentiable simulator. Our framework enables learning quadruped walking in simulation in minutes without parallelization. When augmented with GPU parallelization, our approach allows the quadruped robot to master diverse locomotion skills on challenging terrains in minutes. We demonstrate that differentiable simulation outperforms a reinforcement learning algorithm (PPO) by achieving significantly better sample efficiency while maintaining its effectiveness in handling large-scale environments. Our method represents one of the first successful applications of differentiable simulation to real-world quadruped locomotion, offering a compelling alternative to traditional RL methods.</description>

      <title>Towards Generalist Robot Learning from Internet Video: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19664v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaling deep learning to huge internet-scraped datasets has yielded remarkably general capabilities in natural language processing and visual understanding and generation. In contrast, data is scarce and expensive to collect in robotics. This has seen robot learning struggle to match the generality of capabilities observed in other domains. Learning from Videos (LfV) methods seek to address this data bottleneck by augmenting traditional robot data with large internet-scraped video datasets. Such video data may provide the model with foundational information regarding physical behaviours and the physics of the world. This holds great promise for improving the generality of our robots.
  In this survey, we present an overview of the emerging field of LfV. We outline fundamental concepts, including the benefits and challenges of LfV. We provide a comprehensive review of current methods for: extracting knowledge from large-scale internet video; tackling key LfV challenges; and boosting downstream reinforcement and robot learning via the use of video data. LfV datasets and benchmarks are also reviewed. The survey closes with a critical discussion of challenges and opportunities. Here, we advocate for scalable foundation model approaches that can leverage the full range of available internet video to aid the learning of robot policies and dynamics models. We hope this survey can inform and catalyse further LfV research, facilitating progress towards the development of general-purpose robots.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Human Trajectory Prediction using 3D Dynamic Scene Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for long-term human trajectory prediction in indoor human-centric environments, which is essential for long-horizon robot planning in these environments. State-of-the-art human trajectory prediction methods are limited by their focus on collision avoidance and short-term planning, and their inability to model complex interactions of humans with the environment. In contrast, our approach overcomes these limitations by predicting sequences of human interactions with the environment and using this information to guide trajectory predictions over a horizon of up to 60s. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict interactions with the environment by conditioning the LLM prediction on rich contextual information about the scene. This information is given as a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph that encodes the geometry, semantics, and traversability of the environment into a hierarchical representation. We then ground these interaction sequences into multi-modal spatio-temporal distributions over human positions using a probabilistic approach based on continuous-time Markov Chains. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new semi-synthetic dataset of long-term human trajectories in complex indoor environments, which also includes annotations of human-object interactions. We show in thorough experimental evaluations that our approach achieves a 54% lower average negative log-likelihood and a 26.5% lower Best-of-20 displacement error compared to the best non-privileged (i.e., evaluated in a zero-shot fashion on the dataset) baselines for a time horizon of 60s.</description>

      <title>TRANSIC: Sim-to-Real Policy Transfer by Learning from Online Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10315v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning in simulation and transferring the learned policy to the real world has the potential to enable generalist robots. The key challenge of this approach is to address simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) gaps. Previous methods often require domain-specific knowledge a priori. We argue that a straightforward way to obtain such knowledge is by asking humans to observe and assist robot policy execution in the real world. The robots can then learn from humans to close various sim-to-real gaps. We propose TRANSIC, a data-driven approach to enable successful sim-to-real transfer based on a human-in-the-loop framework. TRANSIC allows humans to augment simulation policies to overcome various unmodeled sim-to-real gaps holistically through intervention and online correction. Residual policies can be learned from human corrections and integrated with simulation policies for autonomous execution. We show that our approach can achieve successful sim-to-real transfer in complex and contact-rich manipulation tasks such as furniture assembly. Through synergistic integration of policies learned in simulation and from humans, TRANSIC is effective as a holistic approach to addressing various, often coexisting sim-to-real gaps. It displays attractive properties such as scaling with human effort. Videos and code are available at https://transic-robot.github.io/</description>

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) serves as a benchmark task to evaluate the capability of robots to navigate within novel environments and identify objects in response to human queries. However, existing EQA methods often rely on simulated environments and operate with limited vocabularies. This paper presents a map-based modular approach to EQA, enabling real-world robots to explore and map unknown environments. By leveraging foundation models, our method facilitates answering a diverse range of questions using natural language. We conducted extensive experiments in both virtual and real-world settings, demonstrating the robustness of our approach in navigating and comprehending queries within unknown environments.</description>

      <title>Fast Decentralized State Estimation for Legged Robot Locomotion via EKF and MHE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a fast and decentralized state estimation framework for the control of legged locomotion. The nonlinear estimation of the floating base states is decentralized to an orientation estimation via Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and a linear velocity estimation via Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE). The EKF fuses the inertia sensor with vision to estimate the floating base orientation. The MHE uses the estimated orientation with all the sensors within a time window in the past to estimate the linear velocities based on a time-varying linear dynamics formulation of the interested states with state constraints. More importantly, a marginalization method based on the optimization structure of the full information filter (FIF) is proposed to convert the equality-constrained FIF to an equivalent MHE. This decoupling of state estimation promotes the desired balance of computation efficiency, accuracy of estimation, and the inclusion of state constraints. The proposed method is shown to be capable of providing accurate state estimation to several legged robots, including the highly dynamic hopping robot PogoX, the bipedal robot Cassie, and the quadrupedal robot Unitree Go1, with a frequency at 200 Hz and a window interval of 0.1s.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07837v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning general-purpose models from diverse datasets has achieved great success in machine learning. In robotics, however, existing methods in multi-task learning are typically constrained to a single robot and workspace, while recent work such as RT-X requires a non-trivial action normalization procedure to manually bridge the gap between different action spaces in diverse environments. In this paper, we propose the visual kinematics chain as a precise and universal representation of quasi-static actions for robot learning over diverse environments, which requires no manual adjustment since the visual kinematic chains can be automatically obtained from the robot's model and camera parameters. We propose the Visual Kinematics Transformer (VKT), a convolution-free architecture that supports an arbitrary number of camera viewpoints, and that is trained with a single objective of forecasting kinematic structures through optimal point-set matching. We demonstrate the superior performance of VKT over BC transformers as a general agent on Calvin, RLBench, Open-X, and real robot manipulation tasks. Video demonstrations can be found at https://mlzxy.github.io/visual-kinetic-chain.</description>

      <title>Sim-to-Real Transfer via 3D Feature Fields for Vision-and-Language Navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09798v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) enables the agent to navigate to a remote location in 3D environments following the natural language instruction. In this field, the agent is usually trained and evaluated in the navigation simulators, lacking effective approaches for sim-to-real transfer. The VLN agents with only a monocular camera exhibit extremely limited performance, while the mainstream VLN models trained with panoramic observation, perform better but are difficult to deploy on most monocular robots. For this case, we propose a sim-to-real transfer approach to endow the monocular robots with panoramic traversability perception and panoramic semantic understanding, thus smoothly transferring the high-performance panoramic VLN models to the common monocular robots. In this work, the semantic traversable map is proposed to predict agent-centric navigable waypoints, and the novel view representations of these navigable waypoints are predicted through the 3D feature fields. These methods broaden the limited field of view of the monocular robots and significantly improve navigation performance in the real world. Our VLN system outperforms previous SOTA monocular VLN methods in R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks within the simulation environments and is also validated in real-world environments, providing a practical and high-performance solution for real-world VLN.</description>

      <title>Towards Open-World Grasping with Large Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18722v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to grasp objects in-the-wild from open-ended language instructions constitutes a fundamental challenge in robotics. An open-world grasping system should be able to combine high-level contextual with low-level physical-geometric reasoning in order to be applicable in arbitrary scenarios. Recent works exploit the web-scale knowledge inherent in large language models (LLMs) to plan and reason in robotic context, but rely on external vision and action models to ground such knowledge into the environment and parameterize actuation. This setup suffers from two major bottlenecks: a) the LLM's reasoning capacity is constrained by the quality of visual grounding, and b) LLMs do not contain low-level spatial understanding of the world, which is essential for grasping in contact-rich scenarios. In this work we demonstrate that modern vision-language models (VLMs) are capable of tackling such limitations, as they are implicitly grounded and can jointly reason about semantics and geometry. We propose OWG, an open-world grasping pipeline that combines VLMs with segmentation and grasp synthesis models to unlock grounded world understanding in three stages: open-ended referring segmentation, grounded grasp planning and grasp ranking via contact reasoning, all of which can be applied zero-shot via suitable visual prompting mechanisms. We conduct extensive evaluation in cluttered indoor scene datasets to showcase OWG's robustness in grounding from open-ended language, as well as open-world robotic grasping experiments in both simulation and hardware that demonstrate superior performance compared to previous supervised and zero-shot LLM-based methods.

Abstract: Recent work has shown diffusion models are an effective approach to learning the multimodal distributions arising from demonstration data in behavior cloning. However, a drawback of this approach is the need to learn a denoising function, which is significantly more complex than learning an explicit policy. In this work, we propose Equivariant Diffusion Policy, a novel diffusion policy learning method that leverages domain symmetries to obtain better sample efficiency and generalization in the denoising function. We theoretically analyze the $\mathrm{SO}(2)$ symmetry of full 6-DoF control and characterize when a diffusion model is $\mathrm{SO}(2)$-equivariant. We furthermore evaluate the method empirically on a set of 12 simulation tasks in MimicGen, and show that it obtains a success rate that is, on average, 21.9% higher than the baseline Diffusion Policy. We also evaluate the method on a real-world system to show that effective policies can be learned with relatively few training samples, whereas the baseline Diffusion Policy cannot.</description>

      <title>Learning Granular Media Avalanche Behavior for Indirectly Manipulating Obstacles on a Granular Slope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Legged robot locomotion on sand slopes is challenging due to the complex dynamics of granular media and how the lack of solid surfaces can hinder locomotion. A promising strategy, inspired by ghost crabs and other organisms in nature, is to strategically interact with rocks, debris, and other obstacles to facilitate movement. To provide legged robots with this ability, we present a novel approach that leverages avalanche dynamics to indirectly manipulate objects on a granular slope. We use a Vision Transformer (ViT) to process image representations of granular dynamics and robot excavation actions. The ViT predicts object movement, which we use to determine which leg excavation action to execute. We collect training data from 100 real physical trials and, at test time, deploy our trained model in novel settings. Experimental results suggest that our model can accurately predict object movements and achieve a success rate $\geq 80\%$ in a variety of manipulation tasks with up to four obstacles, and can also generalize to objects with different physics properties. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to leverage granular media avalanche dynamics to indirectly manipulate objects on granular slopes.

Abstract: The ICRA conference is celebrating its $40^{th}$ anniversary in Rotterdam in September 2024, with as highlight the Happy Birthday ICRA Party at the iconic Holland America Line Cruise Terminal. One month later the IROS conference will take place, which will include the Earth Rover Challenge. In this challenge open-world autonomous navigation models are studied truly open-world settings.
  As part of the Earth Rover Challenge several real-world navigation sets in several cities world-wide, like Auckland, Australia and Wuhan, China. The only dataset recorded in the Netherlands is the small village Oudewater. The proposal is to record a dataset with the robot used in the Earth Rover Challenge in Rotterdam, in front of the Holland America Line Cruise Terminal, before the festivities of the Happy Birthday ICRA Party start.

      <title>MoVEInt: Mixture of Variational Experts for Learning Human-Robot Interactions from Demonstrations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shared dynamics models are important for capturing the complexity and variability inherent in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Therefore, learning such shared dynamics models can enhance coordination and adaptability to enable successful reactive interactions with a human partner. In this work, we propose a novel approach for learning a shared latent space representation for HRIs from demonstrations in a Mixture of Experts fashion for reactively generating robot actions from human observations. We train a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn robot motions regularized using an informative latent space prior that captures the multimodality of the human observations via a Mixture Density Network (MDN). We show how our formulation derives from a Gaussian Mixture Regression formulation that is typically used approaches for learning HRI from demonstrations such as using an HMM/GMM for learning a joint distribution over the actions of the human and the robot. We further incorporate an additional regularization to prevent "mode collapse", a common phenomenon when using latent space mixture models with VAEs. We find that our approach of using an informative MDN prior from human observations for a VAE generates more accurate robot motions compared to previous HMM-based or recurrent approaches of learning shared latent representations, which we validate on various HRI datasets involving interactions such as handshakes, fistbumps, waving, and handovers. Further experiments in a real-world human-to-robot handover scenario show the efficacy of our approach for generating successful interactions with four different human interaction partners.</description>

      <title>Motion Manifold Flow Primitives for Language-Guided Trajectory Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing text-based robot trajectory generation models is made particularly difficult by the small dataset size, high dimensionality of the trajectory space, and the inherent complexity of the text-conditional motion distribution. Recent manifold learning-based methods have partially addressed the dimensionality and dataset size issues, but struggle with the complex text-conditional distribution. In this paper we propose a text-based trajectory generation model that attempts to address all three challenges while relying on only a handful of demonstration trajectory data. Our key idea is to leverage recent flow-based models capable of capturing complex conditional distributions, not directly in the high-dimensional trajectory space, but rather in the low-dimensional latent coordinate space of the motion manifold, with deliberately designed regularization terms to ensure smoothness of motions and robustness to text variations. We show that our Motion Manifold Flow Primitive (MMFP) framework can accurately generate qualitatively distinct motions for a wide range of text inputs, significantly outperforming existing methods.</description>

      <title>Coverage Path Planning For Minimizing Expected Time to Search For an Object With Continuous Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present several results of both theoretical as well as practical interests. First, we propose the quota lawn mowing problem, an extension of the classic lawn mowing problem in computational geometry, as follows: given a quota of coverage, compute the shortest lawn mowing route to achieve said quota. We give constant-factor approximations for the quota lawn mowing problem.
  Second, we investigate the expected detection time minimization problem in geometric coverage path planning with local, continuous sensory information. We provide the first approximation algorithm with provable error bounds with pseudopolynomial running time. Our ideas also extend to another search mechanism, namely visibility-based search, which is related to the watchman route problem. We complement our theoretical analysis with some simple but effective heuristics for finding an object in minimum expected time, on which we provide simulation results.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Imitation under Mismatched Execution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human demonstrations as prompts are a powerful way to program robots to do long-horizon manipulation tasks. However, translating these demonstrations into robot-executable actions presents significant challenges due to execution mismatches in movement styles and physical capabilities. Existing methods either depend on robot-demonstrator paired data, which is infeasible to scale, or rely too heavily on frame-level visual similarities that often break down in practice. To address these challenges, we propose RHyME, a novel framework that automatically aligns robot and demonstrator task executions using optimal transport costs. Given long-horizon robot demonstrations, RHyME synthesizes semantically equivalent demonstrator videos by retrieving and composing short-horizon demonstrator clips. This approach facilitates effective policy training without the need for paired data. We demonstrate that RHyME outperforms a range of baselines across cross-embodiment datasets, showing a 52% increase in task recall over prior cross-embodiment learning methods. We release our code and datasets at https://portal-cornell.github.io/rhyme/.</description>

Abstract: Effective human-robot collaboration (HRC) requires the robots to possess human-like intelligence. Inspired by the human's cognitive ability to selectively process and filter elements in complex environments, this paper introduces a novel concept and scene-understanding approach termed `relevance.' It identifies relevant components in a scene. To accurately and efficiently quantify relevance, we developed an event-based framework that selectively triggers relevance determination, along with a probabilistic methodology built on a structured scene representation. Simulation results demonstrate that the relevance framework and methodology accurately predict the relevance of a general HRC setup, achieving a precision of 0.99 and a recall of 0.94. Relevance can be broadly applied to several areas in HRC to improve task planning time by 79.56% compared with pure planning for a cereal task, reduce perception latency by up to 26.53% for an object detector, improve HRC safety by up to 13.50% and reduce the number of inquiries for HRC by 80.84%. A real-world demonstration showcases the relevance framework's ability to intelligently assist humans in everyday tasks.</description>

      <title>Input-to-State Stable Coupled Oscillator Networks for Closed-form Model-based Control in Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Even though a variety of methods have been proposed in the literature, efficient and effective latent-space control (i.e., control in a learned low-dimensional space) of physical systems remains an open challenge. We argue that a promising avenue is to leverage powerful and well-understood closed-form strategies from control theory literature in combination with learned dynamics, such as potential-energy shaping. We identify three fundamental shortcomings in existing latent-space models that have so far prevented this powerful combination: (i) they lack the mathematical structure of a physical system, (ii) they do not inherently conserve the stability properties of the real systems, (iii) these methods do not have an invertible mapping between input and latent-space forcing. This work proposes a novel Coupled Oscillator Network (CON) model that simultaneously tackles all these issues. More specifically, (i) we show analytically that CON is a Lagrangian system - i.e., it possesses well-defined potential and kinetic energy terms. Then, (ii) we provide formal proof of global Input-to-State stability using Lyapunov arguments. Moving to the experimental side, we demonstrate that CON reaches SoA performance when learning complex nonlinear dynamics of mechanical systems directly from images. An additional methodological innovation contributing to achieving this third goal is an approximated closed-form solution for efficient integration of network dynamics, which eases efficient training. We tackle (iii) by approximating the forcing-to-input mapping with a decoder that is trained to reconstruct the input based on the encoded latent space force. Finally, we show how these properties enable latent-space control. We use an integral-saturated PID with potential force compensation and demonstrate high-quality performance on a soft robot using raw pixels as the only feedback information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new method that extracts knowledge from a large language model (LLM) to produce object-level plans, which describe high-level changes to object state, and uses them to bootstrap task and motion planning (TAMP) in a hierarchical manner. Existing works use LLMs to either directly output task plans or to generate goals in representations like PDDL. However, these methods fall short because they either rely on the LLM to do the actual planning or output a hard-to-satisfy goal. Our approach instead extracts knowledge from a LLM in the form of plan schemas as an object level representation called functional object-oriented networks (FOON), from which we automatically generate PDDL subgoals. Our experiments demonstrate how our method's performance markedly exceeds alternative planning strategies across several tasks in simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14562v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving human-like dexterity is a longstanding challenge in robotics, in part due to the complexity of planning and control for contact-rich systems. In reinforcement learning (RL), one popular approach has been to use massively-parallelized, domain-randomized simulations to learn a policy offline over a vast array of contact conditions, allowing robust sim-to-real transfer. Inspired by recent advances in real-time parallel simulation, this work considers instead the viability of online planning methods for contact-rich manipulation by studying the well-known in-hand cube reorientation task. We propose a simple architecture that employs a sampling-based predictive controller and vision-based pose estimator to search for contact-rich control actions online. We conduct thorough experiments to assess the real-world performance of our method, architectural design choices, and key factors for robustness, demonstrating that our simple sampling-based approach achieves performance comparable to prior RL-based works.

      <description>arXiv:2409.14567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the modeling and attitude control of jumping quadrupeds in low-gravity environments. First, a convex decomposition procedure is presented to generate high-accuracy and low-cost collision geometries for quadrupeds performing agile maneuvers. A hierarchical control architecture is then investigated, separating torso orientation tracking from the generation of suitable, collision-free, corresponding leg motions. Nonlinear Model Predictive Controllers (NMPCs) are utilized in both layers of the controller. To compute the necessary leg motions, a torque allocation strategy is employed that leverages the symmetries of the system to avoid self-collisions and simplify the respective NMPC. To plan periodic trajectories online, a Finite State Machine (FSM)-based weight switching strategy is also used. The proposed controller is first evaluated in simulation, where 90 degree rotations in roll, pitch, and yaw are stabilized in 6.3, 2.4, and 5.5 seconds, respectively. The performance of the controller is further experimentally demonstrated by stabilizing constant and changing orientation references. Overall, this work provides a framework for the development of advanced model-based attitude controllers for jumping legged systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02141v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in humanoid robotics, including the integration of hierarchical reinforcement learning-based control and the utilization of LLM planning, have significantly enhanced the ability of robots to perform complex tasks. In contrast to the highly developed humanoid robots, the human factors involved remain relatively unexplored. Directly controlling humanoid robots with the brain has already appeared in many science fiction novels, such as Pacific Rim and Gundam. In this work, we present E2H (EEG-to-Humanoid), an innovative framework that pioneers the control of humanoid robots using high-frequency non-invasive neural signals. As the none-invasive signal quality remains low in decoding precise spatial trajectory, we decompose the E2H framework in an innovative two-stage formation: 1) decoding neural signals (EEG) into semantic motion keywords, 2) utilizing LLM facilitated motion generation with a precise motion imitation control policy to realize humanoid robotics control. The method of directly driving robots with brainwave commands offers a novel approach to human-machine collaboration, especially in situations where verbal commands are impractical, such as in cases of speech impairments, space exploration, or underwater exploration, unlocking significant potential. E2H offers an exciting glimpse into the future, holding immense potential for human-computer interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autoregressive models have demonstrated remarkable success in natural language processing. In this work, we design a simple yet effective autoregressive architecture for robotic manipulation tasks. We propose the Chunking Causal Transformer (CCT), which extends the next-single-token prediction of causal transformers to support multi-token prediction in a single pass. Further, we design a novel attention interleaving strategy that allows CCT to be trained efficiently with teacher-forcing. Based on CCT, we propose the Autoregressive Policy (ARP) model, which learns to generate action sequences autoregressively. We find that action sequence learning enables better leverage of the underlying causal relationships in robotic tasks. We evaluate ARP across diverse robotic manipulation environments, including Push-T, ALOHA, and RLBench, and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in all tested environments, while being more efficient in computation and parameter sizes. Video demonstrations, our source code, and the models of ARP can be found at http://github.com/mlzxy/arp.</description>

      <title>ACDC: Automated Creation of Digital Cousins for Robust Policy Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training robot policies in the real world can be unsafe, costly, and difficult to scale. Simulation serves as an inexpensive and potentially limitless source of training data, but suffers from the semantics and physics disparity beween simulated and real-world environments. These discrepancies can be minimized by training in digital twins,which serve as virtual replicas of a real scene but are expensive to generate and cannot produce cross-domain generalization. To address these limitations, we propose the concept of digital cousins, a virtual asset or scene that, unlike a digital twin,does not explicitly model a real-world counterpart but still exhibits similar geometric and semantic affordances. As a result, digital cousins simultaneously reduce the cost of generating an analogous virtual environment while also facilitating better robustness during sim-to-real domain transfer by providing a distribution of similar training scenes. Leveraging digital cousins, we introduce a novel method for the Automatic Creation of Digital Cousins (ACDC), and propose a fully automated real-to-sim-to-real pipeline for generating fully interactive scenes and training robot policies that can be deployed zero-shot in the original scene. We find that ACDC can produce digital cousin scenes that preserve geometric and semantic affordances, and can be used to train policies that outperform policies trained on digital twins, achieving 90% vs. 25% under zero-shot sim-to-real transfer. Additional details are available at https://digital-cousins.github.io/.</description>

Abstract: Research on autonomous driving in unstructured outdoor environments is less advanced than in structured urban settings due to challenges like environmental diversities and scene complexity. These environments-such as rural areas and rugged terrains-pose unique obstacles that are not common in structured urban areas. Despite these difficulties, autonomous driving in unstructured outdoor environments is crucial for applications in agriculture, mining, and military operations. Our survey reviews over 250 papers for autonomous driving in unstructured outdoor environments, covering offline mapping, pose estimation, environmental perception, path planning, end-to-end autonomous driving, datasets, and relevant challenges. We also discuss emerging trends and future research directions. This review aims to consolidate knowledge and encourage further research for autonomous driving in unstructured environments. To support ongoing work, we maintain an active repository with up-to-date literature and open-source projects at: https://github.com/chaytonmin/Survey-Autonomous-Driving-in-Unstructured-Environments.</description>

      <title>DCNet: A Data-Driven Framework for DVL Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are underwater robotic platforms used in a variety of applications. An AUV's navigation solution relies heavily on the fusion of inertial sensors and Doppler velocity logs (DVL), where the latter delivers accurate velocity updates. To ensure accurate navigation, a DVL calibration is undertaken before the mission begins to estimate its error terms. During calibration, the AUV follows a complex trajectory and employs nonlinear estimation filters to estimate error terms. In this paper, we introduce DCNet, a data-driven framework that utilizes a two-dimensional convolution kernel in an innovative way. Using DCNet and our proposed DVL error model, we offer a rapid calibration procedure. This can be applied to a trajectory with a nearly constant velocity. To train and test our proposed approach a dataset of 276 minutes long with real DVL recorded measurements was used. We demonstrated an average improvement of 70% in accuracy and 80% improvement in calibration time, compared to the baseline approach, with a low-performance DVL. As a result of those improvements, an AUV employing a low-cost DVL, can achieve higher accuracy, shorter calibration time, and apply a simple nearly constant velocity calibration trajectory. Our results also open up new applications for marine robotics utilizing low-cost, high-accurate DVLs.</description>

      <title>SegGrasp: Zero-Shot Task-Oriented Grasping via Semantic and Geometric Guided Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Task-oriented grasping, which involves grasping specific parts of objects based on their functions, is crucial for developing advanced robotic systems capable of performing complex tasks in dynamic environments. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework that incorporates both semantic and geometric priors for zero-shot task-oriented grasp generation. The proposed framework, SegGrasp, first leverages the vision-language models like GLIP for coarse segmentation. It then uses detailed geometric information from convex decomposition to improve segmentation quality through a fusion policy named GeoFusion. An effective grasp pose can be generated by a grasping network with improved segmentation. We conducted the experiments on both segmentation benchmark and real-world robot grasping. The experimental results show that SegGrasp surpasses the baseline by more than 15\% in grasp and segmentation performance.</description>

      <title>Constrained Trajectory Optimization on Matrix Lie Groups via Lie-Algebraic Differential Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02018v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix Lie groups are an important class of manifolds commonly used in control and robotics, and optimizing control policies on these manifolds is a fundamental problem. In this work, we propose a novel computationally efficient approach for trajectory optimization on matrix Lie groups using an augmented Lagrangian-based constrained discrete Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP). The method involves lifting the optimization problem to the Lie algebra during the backward pass and retracting back to the manifold during the forward pass. Unlike previous approaches that addressed constraint handling only for specific classes of matrix Lie groups, the proposed method provides a general solution for nonlinear constraint handling across generic matrix Lie groups. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed DDP method in handling constraints within a mechanical system characterized by rigid body dynamics in SE(3), assessing its computational efficiency compared to existing direct optimization solvers. Additionally, the method demonstrates robustness under external disturbances when applied as a Lie-algebraic feedback control policy on SE(3), and in optimizing a quadrotor's trajectory in a challenging realistic scenario. Experiments show that the proposed approach effectively manages general constraints defined on configuration, velocity, and inputs during optimization, while also maintaining stability under external disturbances when executing the resultant control policy in closed-loop.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Sim-to-Real Gap from the Information Bottleneck Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently achieved remarkable success in robotic control. However, most works in RL operate in simulated environments where privileged knowledge (e.g., dynamics, surroundings, terrains) is readily available. Conversely, in real-world scenarios, robot agents usually rely solely on local states (e.g., proprioceptive feedback of robot joints) to select actions, leading to a significant sim-to-real gap. Existing methods address this gap by either gradually reducing the reliance on privileged knowledge or performing a two-stage policy imitation. However, we argue that these methods are limited in their ability to fully leverage the available privileged knowledge, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we formulate the sim-to-real gap as an information bottleneck problem and therefore propose a novel privileged knowledge distillation method called the Historical Information Bottleneck (HIB). In particular, HIB learns a privileged knowledge representation from historical trajectories by capturing the underlying changeable dynamic information. Theoretical analysis shows that the learned privileged knowledge representation helps reduce the value discrepancy between the oracle and learned policies. Empirical experiments on both simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that HIB yields improved generalizability compared to previous methods.

      <title>S.T.A.R.-Track: Latent Motion Models for End-to-End 3D Object Tracking with Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Appearance Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17602v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the tracking-by-attention paradigm, this paper introduces an object-centric, transformer-based framework for tracking in 3D. Traditional model-based tracking approaches incorporate the geometric effect of object- and ego motion between frames with a geometric motion model. Inspired by this, we propose S.T.A.R.-Track, which uses a novel latent motion model (LMM) to additionally adjust object queries to account for changes in viewing direction and lighting conditions directly in the latent space, while still modeling the geometric motion explicitly. Combined with a novel learnable track embedding that aids in modeling the existence probability of tracks, this results in a generic tracking framework that can be integrated with any query-based detector. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate the benefits of our approach, showing state-of-the-art performance for DETR3D-based trackers while drastically reducing the number of identity switches of tracks at the same time.</description>

      <title>A Parameter Privacy-Preserving Strategy for Mixed-Autonomy Platoon Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been demonstrated that leading cruise control (LCC) can improve the operation of mixed-autonomy platoons by allowing connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) to make longitudinal control decisions based on the information provided by surrounding vehicles. However, LCC generally requires surrounding human-driven vehicles (HDVs) to share their real-time states, which can be used by adversaries to infer drivers' car-following behavior, potentially leading to financial losses or safety concerns. This paper aims to address such privacy concerns and protect the behavioral characteristics of HDVs by devising a parameter privacy-preserving approach for mixed-autonomy platoon control. First, we integrate a parameter privacy filter into LCC to protect sensitive car-following parameters. The privacy filter allows each vehicle to generate seemingly realistic pseudo states by distorting the true parameters to pseudo parameters, which can protect drivers' privacy in behavioral parameters without significantly influencing the control performance. Second, to enhance the reliability and practicality of the privacy filter within LCC, we first introduce an individual-level parameter privacy preservation constraint to the privacy filter, focusing on the privacy level of each individual parameter pair. Subsequently, we extend the current approach to accommodate continuous parameter spaces through a neural network estimator. Third, analysis of head-to-tail string stability reveals the potential impact of privacy filters in degrading mixed traffic flow performance. Simulation shows that this approach can effectively trade off privacy and control performance in LCC. We further demonstrate the benefit of such an approach in networked systems, i.e., by applying the privacy filter to a preceding vehicle, one can also achieve a certain level of privacy for the following vehicle.</description>

      <title>Learning Shared RGB-D Fields: Unified Self-supervised Pre-training for Label-efficient LiDAR-Camera 3D Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constructing large-scale labeled datasets for multi-modal perception model training in autonomous driving presents significant challenges. This has motivated the development of self-supervised pretraining strategies. However, existing pretraining methods mainly employ distinct approaches for each modality. In contrast, we focus on LiDAR-Camera 3D perception models and introduce a unified pretraining strategy, NeRF-Supervised Masked Auto Encoder (NS-MAE), which optimizes all modalities through a shared formulation. NS-MAE leverages NeRF's ability to encode both appearance and geometry, enabling efficient masked reconstruction of multi-modal data. Specifically, embeddings are extracted from corrupted LiDAR point clouds and images, conditioned on view directions and locations. Then, these embeddings are rendered into multi-modal feature maps from two crucial viewpoints for 3D driving perception: perspective and bird's-eye views. The original uncorrupted data serve as reconstruction targets for self-supervised learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior transferability of NS-MAE across various 3D perception tasks under different fine-tuning settings. Notably, NS-MAE outperforms prior SOTA pre-training methods that employ separate strategies for each modality in BEV map segmentation under the label-efficient fine-tuning setting.

      <title>On The Planning Abilities of OpenAI's o1 Models: Feasibility, Optimality, and Generalizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19924v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased their ability to perform complex reasoning tasks, but their effectiveness in planning remains underexplored. In this study, we evaluate the planning capabilities of OpenAI's o1 models across a variety of benchmark tasks, focusing on three key aspects: feasibility, optimality, and generalizability. Through empirical evaluations on constraint-heavy tasks (e.g., $\textit{Barman}$, $\textit{Tyreworld}$) and spatially complex environments (e.g., $\textit{Termes}$, $\textit{Floortile}$), we highlight o1-preview's strengths in self-evaluation and constraint-following, while also identifying bottlenecks in decision-making and memory management, particularly in tasks requiring robust spatial reasoning. Our results reveal that o1-preview outperforms GPT-4 in adhering to task constraints and managing state transitions in structured environments. However, the model often generates suboptimal solutions with redundant actions and struggles to generalize effectively in spatially complex tasks. This pilot study provides foundational insights into the planning limitations of LLMs, offering key directions for future research on improving memory management, decision-making, and generalization in LLM-based planning.

      <title>DivScene: Benchmarking LVLMs for Object Navigation with Diverse Scenes and Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Object navigation in unknown environments is crucial for deploying embodied agents in real-world applications. While we have witnessed huge progress due to large-scale scene datasets, faster simulators, and stronger models, previous studies mainly focus on limited scene types and target objects. In this paper, we study a new task of navigating to diverse target objects in a large number of scene types. To benchmark the problem, we present a large-scale scene dataset, DivScene, which contains 4,614 scenes across 81 different types. With the dataset, we build an end-to-end embodied agent, NatVLM, by fine-tuning a Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) through imitation learning. The LVLM is trained to take previous observations from the environment and generate the next actions. We also introduce CoT explanation traces of the action prediction for better performance when tuning LVLMs. Our extensive experiments find that we can build a performant LVLM-based agent through imitation learning on the shortest paths constructed by a BFS planner without any human supervision. Our agent achieves a success rate that surpasses GPT-4o by over 20%. Meanwhile, we carry out various analyses showing the generalization ability of our agent. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/zhaowei-wang-nlp/DivScene.</description>
